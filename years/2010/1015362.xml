The SP3 group is developing a new type of electrostatic ion thruster, called the Helicon Double Layer Thruster (HDLT). Electrostatic ion thrusters are a highly fuel efficient means to propel a spacecraft, with the limitation that the maximum thrust they can provide is significantly less than that of a chemical based rocket. This type of thruster is ideally suited for long-term missions and satellite station keeping.  Hundreds of electrostatic ion thrusters operate continuously in space today.

Extending thruster life allows for the possibility of longer-term missions, as well as keeping satellites in orbit longer, which could potentially save a lot of money. The HDLT seeks to overcome the limitation of electron sources through a thruster design that can simultaneously emit an equal number of electrons and ions.     The ion acceleration mechanism in an HDLT is a current-free double layer, which is a type of electric field that arises when a source plasma expands into a larger vacuous region. In space, the thruster would act as the source plasma, and outer space itself as the larger vacuous region.  Proof of principle experiments of the current-free double layer mechanism have been conducted in the SP3 group since 2003.
