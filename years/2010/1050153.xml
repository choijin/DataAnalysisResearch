<AbstractNarration>What is the effect of a mutation that "knocks out" a single gene in an organism's genome? Unsatisfyingly, today's plant geneticists can only say: "It depends." Only a small minority of mutations are lethal or have a significant impact. For the vast majority, at most only subtle effects have been detected. Plant genetics is poised to progress rapidly in remedying this situation, using a collection of "knockout" mutant strains of the model species Arabidopsis thaliana. Knockouts, carrying a tiny tagged segment of disruptive DNA in one targeted gene, are already available for ~67% of the 27,000+ unique genes in this plant's genome. Inspired by progress in yeast genetics, the project will grow large subsets of these knockouts in benign and challenging environments, quantifying ecological performance attributes (e.g., population growth rate, fruit yield). We predict that, as in yeast, such an approach will reveal important phenotypic differences between mutant and control lines and possibly reveal undiscovered genome-wide patterns. The project is a collaboration of primarily undergraduate institutions and will train young scientists in how major genomic questions are addressed by networks of researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will involve screening 7000 available T-DNA lines to identify those that have mutations at only one gene, providing these results to the biological community.  Traits relevant to plant performance will be measured in over 3000 single-mutant lines, across multiple environments. Cyberinfrastructure will be developed to disseminate common protocols and to archive and index data.    Over 50 undergraduate researchers will be involved in collecting and analyzing data and communicating results. The project also includes a study of how participating in a distributed research network influences undergraduates' access to social capital within the scientific community. Results from this aspect of the work will lay the foundation for a larger scale, empirical study of the outcomes undergraduates realize by participating in research networks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     The Undergraduates Phenotyping Arabidopsis Knockouts (unPAK) network was founded as a network between rsearchers at the College of Charleston, Barnard College, Hampden-Sydney College, and the University of Georgia.  Its goal was to contribute new knowledge about the role of several uncharacterized A. thaliana genes with respect to plant in a manner that maximized research access to undergraduates.  The unPAK network has scanned thousands of A. thaliana loci over the past 6 years through the use of dozens of undergraduates in both independent research and classroom settings.  The data from these projects can be accessed at http://arabidopsisunpak.org and multiple manuscripts are currently in preparation that analyze the scientific and pedagogical aspects of unPAK.   At Hampden-Sydney College, our primary objective was to genotype SALK line A. thaliana mutants for the presence of a single T-DNA insertion or multiple T-DNA insertions.  Since the fitness phenotyping analyses generated by unPAK relied on the assurance that the effects seen in each experiment were the result of the disrupted gene under consideration and not secondary side effects caused by promiscuous T-DNA insertions, it was essential for each SALK line to be characterized for T-DNA insertion number via a dual target PCR strategy. Performing a conventional PCR simultaneously against the T-DNA insertion cassette and a housekeeping gene and running the results on an agarose gel, students were able to compare the band intensities and derive the presence of multiple T-DNA insertions in a given line in an efficient and high throughput manner.  Initially, results were verified by qPCR; however, as data accumulated and was tested, we realized that band intensity comparision was sufficient to obtain the information needed for the project.  Over time, we found that ~50% of all SALK lines had more than one T-DNA insertion and could thus not be used for phenotyping analysis.  This finding suggested the need to consider emerging technlogies like CRISPR/Cas9 to generate more specific gene disruptiuons in an efficient manner and, thus, expand the pool of deletion lines available to unPAK for phenotyping analysis.   Another important aspect of unPAK at Hampden-Sydney was to study the best ways that unPAK materials could be utilized in classes to maximize the number of students that could benefit from performing authentic research as part of their scientific training.  In this spirit, we worked closely with colleagues from the College of Charleston and Virginia Tech to devise a course-based undergraduate reserach experience (CURE) based on our Virginia Tech colleague's interest in chemical defenses to insect herbivory.  We selected SALK lines likely to encode genes participating in insect herbivory defenses and asked students to perform experiments that considered their ability to withstand comsumption by larvae of the diamond head moth (Plutella xylostella).  The students generated intriguing data that requires extensive retesting; nonetheless, assessment data revealed that they had shown genuine engagement with the project as well as felt a sense of ownership over their work.  These attitudes are critical for retention of students in the research sciences in particuar and the STEM fields in general, suggesting that unPAK materials can serve well as an effective CURE in the undergraduate biology classroom.   Overall at Hampden-Sydney, unPAK provided indepdnent study research assistantships for 15 undergraduates over summers and during academic years. Several students used their unPAK experiences in support of their senior Honors theses and presented their research at regional and national scientific conferences.  As a reult of our CURE work, an additional 60 undergraduates got the opportunity to perform authentic research as a part of their undergraduate education.
