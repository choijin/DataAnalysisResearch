<AbstractNarration>Organic agriculture is booming. Despite the recent global food and financial crisis, the production and consumption of organic goods has defied common trends. Heralded as the beginning of an Organic Revolution in sub-Saharan Africa, this development strategy holds vast promise for two interrelated reasons: First, the previous agricultural revolutions - the Green and Biotechnology Revolution - have largely sidestepped the continent, particularly small-scale farmers. Second, even in the context of a long history of failure and exploitation, agriculture-led development remains a main avenue for alleviating poverty. While organic agriculture's ecological benefits are better known, scholarship has been lacking on the socio-economic impacts of organic export production on African farmers. Socio-economic inequality especially has received little to no attention, even though the previous agricultural revolutions continue to highlight the highly uneven and unintended impacts of the diffusion of new agricultural technology across the globe. This doctoral dissertation research project addresses this critical omission by studying the growth in organic farming across six villages in Shinyanga, the leading region of organic cotton production in sub-Saharan Africa. In the first phase, 120 surveys were undertaken of both organic and conventional farmers, with a special focus on the importance of space and economies of scale. After the quantitative analysis using participatory and spatial econometrics, the research findings will be shared and collaboratively examined in a second phase via follow-up interviews and focus groups. In the third phase, inter-annual changes in inequality and poverty are assessed and supported via additional archival research to situate the findings within the complex history of colonial cotton production in Tanzania. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organic agriculture, especially in chemically-intensive cotton production, has evident ecological benefits. The results of this study will provide unique empirical evidence of the economic impact of organic agriculture on African cotton farmers from Tanzania. Given the government's goal to reduce rural poverty and inequality and the international demand to boost organic production in sub-Saharan Africa, the findings from this research will inform policymakers on the potentials and limits of this latest agricultural revolution. By locating the spread and adoption of organic agriculture as an innovation, the research will furthermore break down the economic impact of this agricultural growth on individual farmers and the villages throughout the cotton growing region. Focusing on contracted organic production in a de facto organic environment, the research project may further the evaluation of such development efforts vis-Ã -vis similar ones underway in other parts of the developing world, such as Fair Trade cotton production in West Africa. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award will also provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.</AbstractNarration>
