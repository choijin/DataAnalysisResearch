<AbstractNarration>OISE 10-16120&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project brings together faculty at Montana State University (MSU) and Gorno Altaisk State University (GASU) in Russia to plan informal science education research and education activities in two distinct but similar mountain systems (Yellowstone USA and Altai Russia).   A team of  MSU faculty and students will travel to GASU for workshops  addressing similar interests in science learning in informal settings. The team will also meet with community members of two villages (Ongudai &amp; Kosh-Agach) in critical ecological and ethno-cultural areas of the Altai. &lt;br/&gt;The MSU principal investigators are Michael Brody (Education), Cliff Montagne (Ecology) and John Fisher (Archaeology). The GASU coordinator of the workshop is Natalia Yurkova (Education &amp; International Programs). In addition, Eleanor Abrams (Education) from the University of New Hampshire (UNH), representing school-based science learning with indigenous Altai people will participate in the workshops.&lt;br/&gt;The workshops will address informal science learning in an ecological context and focus on issues of culture and diversity as they relate to indigenous populations in contrasting ecological and social systems.  Two separate one and a half day workshops in Ongudaisky Region and Kosh-Agachsky Region, Altai Republic will focus on native people?s understanding, values, interests and concerns related to informal learning settings and how these will influence our future research and education activities. &lt;br/&gt;These workshops contribute significantly to our emerging understanding of science learning in informal settings. They address a unique conception of ecological learning in three dimensions; personal, community and cultural perspectives. The inclusion of a school-based perspective merges our understanding of formal and informal science learning in these unique settings. This collaboration provides a holistic view of science learning and will unite diverse intellectual resources and research efforts in unique ecological and social systems.&lt;br/&gt;This work is expected to extend our understanding of science learning related to critical natural and cultural resources and their management. An understanding of how, why and where learning takes place will help extend the US and international research and education agendas related to informal and formal science learning, natural and cultural resource management and social and ecological sustainability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research planning project was a collaboration of Montana State University (MSU), Gorno-Altaisk State University (GASU) in the Altai Republic, Russian Federation and the University of New Hampshire (UNH).  The Altai Republic, Russian Federation and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, Montana, USA have very much in common (UNEP 2009, Noss 2002). Ecologically they are mountain-valley-river systems. They are the headwaters of continental river drainages. They are both biologically diverse with similar alpine, steppe, forest and grassland systems. Both the Altai and Yellowstone systems are recreation and tourist destinations. Both have national, regional and state parks. Each system is faced with problems related to economic development, and ecological-cultural degradation related to tourism, recreation and other development activities. The Yellowstone and Altai systems have become increasingly more valuable for our understanding of global climate change as relatively pristine areas evolve in relation to the effects of climate change. Both systems have a major urban center (Bozeman, MT, USA &amp; Gorno-Altaisk Altai Republic, Russian Federation) with an associated state university situated within the ecological system. Both systems have very distinct and important cultural resources associated with well-recognized populations of indigenous people (Native American &amp; Native Altaian).  Five university faculty and three Native American students from the USA traveled to the Altai Republic and conducted a series of research planning workshops with university faculty, K-12 teachers, members of local and regional environmental non-government organizations and community members. The team will met with community members of two villages (Ongudai &amp; Kosh-Agach) in critical ecological and ethno-cultural areas of the Altai.  The workshops addressed informal science learning in an ecological context and focus on issues of culture and diversity as they relate to indigenous populations in contrasting ecological and social systems. Workshop participants reported on their current research and education activities, interact with leading Altai regional experts in ecology, archeology and education and plan a collaborative research and education agenda focusing on science learning in informal settings. Two separate one and a half day workshops in Ongudaisky Region and Kosh-Agachsky Region, Altai Republic focused on native peoples' understanding, values, interests and concerns related to informal learning settings and how these influence our research and education activities. Workshop proceedings and outcomes are published on line at https://sites.google.com/a/yellowstone-altai.org/yellowstone-altai/.  The results of the research planning workshops contribute significantly to our emerging understanding of science learning in informal settings especially as it relates to "ethno-cultural pedagogical content knowledge."  The research team proposes a new understanding of informal learning with native people.  Our emerging theory of "ethno-cultual pedagogical content knowledge" is synthesis of our prior understanding in the USA of pedagogical content (Shulman 1986) and the native Altaian educators understanding of ethno-cultural pedagogy (Ushinsky 1988).  Our result include a unique conception of ecological learning in three dimensions; personal, community and cultural perspectives. The MSU-GASU-UNH collaboration provides a holistic view of science learning and unites diverse intellectual resources and research efforts in unique ecological and social systems.  Both the Yellowstone and Altai mountain systems are of global concern as part of worldwide natural and cultural resources impacted by pervasive development, recreation and tourism activities and climate change. The underlying theoretical foundation of "ethno-cultural pedagogical content knowledge" for informal environmental science learning is the basis for effective approaches to enable isol...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
