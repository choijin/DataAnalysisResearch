<AbstractNarration>This proposal applies for NSF support to broaden participation in the Fifteenth International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems (ASPLOS?10), to be held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on March 13?17, 2010. ASPLOS is the premiere forum for research involving the interaction of computer architecture, compilers, and operating systems.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal aims to increase the impact of this conference by enabling participation by additional students and faculty for whom travel support would otherwise preclude their attendance. The PIs are requesting funds to cover expenses of up to 40 US-based students, post-docs and junior faculty with no NSF travel support.</AbstractNarration>
