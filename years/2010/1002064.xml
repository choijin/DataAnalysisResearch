<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to investigate innovative frequency channelized architectures for broadband analog-to-digital conversion. The approach employs a broadband analog iterative filter bank based on a spatially unfolded cascade of image-reject down-conversion stages. For an N-stage cascade, the input is concurrently decomposed into 2 to the power of N-1 contiguous channels; each digitized using converters clocked at 1/(2 to the power of N-1) of the input Nyquist rate. All down converter local oscillators are derived from a single reference with a cascade of compact, low power, divide-by-2 stages. The architecture potentially allows for frequency scalable resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The approach in this research does not suffer from limitations of traditional high-speed time-domain samplers, such as requirements for extremely fine time resolution. It also avoids a major implementation bottleneck in current frequency-domain approaches arising from the requirement for multiple non-harmonically related local oscillators. Performance limitations due to finite image-rejection, local oscillator spurs, and  phase noise are addressed with circuit-level innovations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The innovations in signal digitization capability address a critical need for technology advances in multiple areas with broad societal and scientific impact including computing, communications, sensors, medicine, and fundamental science.  The unique architecture is expected to enable new signal-processing intensive implementations utilizing multi-resolution and frequency scalable designs with diverse applications in these areas. Graduate and undergraduate students involved in this research will gain expertise in theoretical and experimental aspects of the design of high-performance digitizers and signal processors. The results of this research will be disseminated through publications and seminars and will be incorporated into graduate courses taught by the PIs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The design of broadband electronic systems is crucial for several important application areas.  Modern electronic systems exploit ever more powerful digital signal processing and computation but at the same time require ever more capable analog-to-digital conversion interfaces to the real world to capture the physical information-carrying signals.  As processing demands increase, the signal bandwidth demands keep increasing.  Current analog-to-digital conversion either rely on single high speed converter solutions or time-interleaved converter solutions.     In this program we explored the use of frequency interleaving as a preprocessor for broadband signal processing.  Iterative downconversion architectures were studied that allow to chop a broadband signal into a collection of narrower band signals that can be processed in parallel at a lower speed.  By using an iterative multi-stage architecture the signal frequency information is gradually split across an increasing number of bands but each with a progressively reducing bandwidth.  The iterative approach further eliminates the need for complex clock generators and instead can operate from a single clock frequency reference.     Key outcomes of this research include the development of a 3-way iterative downconversion architecture that further simplifies the iterative architecture and offers better performance.  Experimental iterative downconverter prototypes with custom designed integrated circuits were developed to demonstrate our key findings.  This also included novel implementations of critical building blocks like harmonic reject mixers. We further developed techniques for low-noise clock frequency reference generation combining advantages of classical phase-frequency phase-locked loops with sampling phase-locked loops. The integrated circuit prototype implementing our combined phase detector approach demonstrated the robustness of the classical approach while maintaining the low noise benefits of a sampling loop.       The research program offered research opportunities for several Ph.D. graduate students to be trained in the area of advanced analog integrated circuit design, a skill set that is high demand by the US semiconductor industry. The program further included research experience opportunities for undergraduate students. The key findings of the research have been disseminated through presentations at conferences and in journal papers.
