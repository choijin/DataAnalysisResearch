<AbstractNarration>The very large models used in cloud-climate studies must be supported by a suitably designed infrastructure for data management, analysis, and visualization. These needs are community wide and should be addressed in a coordinated fashion that serves the community as a whole.This is a proposal to plan for a Community Infrastructure Development, Deployment and/or Operations (CI-ADDO) proposal to be submitted in summer 2011. The community to be served by the planned infrastructure consists of researchers associated with a broadly based NSF Science and Technology Center that focuses on the role of clouds in climate change. The infrastructure will have hardware, software, education, and outreach components.</AbstractNarration>
