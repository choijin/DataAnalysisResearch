<AbstractNarration>SES#: 1002629&lt;br/&gt;PI: David C. Stark&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: Dennis Bogusz&lt;br/&gt;Columbia University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why do regulators mandate practices that firms already employ voluntarily? In the research, a dataset will be created of regulations, stock market listing rules and corporate governance standards from the United States and nine other countries. Voluntary practices will be ascertained from annual reports and other corporate disclosures from roughly 1500 listed companies headquartered in the focal countries. Data for both regulations and voluntary practices span the period from 1989 to 2008. Qualitative comparative analysis will explain the various paths to regulation, both within and between the countries, through combinations of causal conditions. Foremost is the prevalence of originally voluntary practices. Additional conditions that explain the transition to regulation include a history of corporate governance scandals, capital market development, and the political and legal framework of each country. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: The resulting dataset will become a valuable research tool for other scholars keen on understanding regulatory change partially rooted in firm behavior. Further, this research stands to benefit industry leaders, regulators and policymakers by elucidating relationships in the capital markets that, although often overlooked, are key to regulatory reform.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Findings from this project indicate prominent corporate influence of  regulation whereby governments appear more "corporate" in that they merely  duplicate regulation of extant business practice.  Precise  configurations of conditions that lead to this outcome vary across  corporate governance practices, but different countries can follow  similar paths to this type of regulation.  Governments are perhaps not  the harbingers of regulation that legal systems have historically  served.  Rather corporate governance no longer refers simply to  governance of firms, but also governance by firms.   I  show that voluntary firm practice is on the one hand a response to  uncertainty: adopting certain governance practices either deliberately  pre-empts regulation or anticipates regulation of the same practice.  On  the other hand, and failing regulatory pre-emption, firms can provide  regulators the template for future regulation.  I also show that  regulators likewise utilize uncertainty strategically when regulating  before or after other regulators.  Lastly, I have given particular  attention to an evolving form of legal regulation theory that accounts  for extra-juridical sources of law.   Regulation is ultimately a social process.  The choices of public  and private actors in the economy to control others&mdash;to govern&mdash;have  political, legal and of course, economic characteristics.  Yet we cannot  owe an account of their behavior to institutions or structures alone.   We must instead unpack the process of regulation at different levels and  by different actors.  This study attempted to explain such regulatory  process and opens the door to future research on comparative regulation  of previously voluntary behavior.
