<AbstractNarration>The fundamental research goal of this project is to understand the relative roles of evolutionary history, geography, and ecology in producing the morphological and behavioral diversity of the antbirds (Thamnophilidae), a species-rich group of birds that inhabit lowland tropical forests of South and Central America. The integration of genetic data with morphological, behavioral, ecological, geographic, and environmental data for every species in the group will allow increased understanding of differences in vocalizations, shapes, sizes, and species numbers within the antbirds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding why some groups of organisms are more diverse than others, and why some groups exhibit more behavioral and morphological variation, is a central goal of evolutionary biology. It is well known that diversity does not evolve uniformly over time, and that differences in morphological and behavioral diversity are often correlated with the number of species in the group. It remains unclear, however, to what extent the evolution of behavioral and morphological diversity promotes the creation of new species. The integration of genetic, geographic, ecological, behavioral and morphological information, along with cutting-edge analytical approaches, in this project will allow insights into the mechanisms that generate and maintain biological diversity in the Neotropics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PROJECT OUTCOMES REPORT     PHENOTYPIC AND NICHE EVOLUTION IN THE ANTBIRDS (AVES, THAMNOPHILIDAE)     INTELLECTUAL MERIT     A pervasive goal in evolutionary biology has been to address why some clades are richer in species or phenotypic diversity than others. This study used an integrative approach that combined phylogenetic, phenotypic, distributional, and ecological data to investigate large-scale patterns of evolution in a species-rich family of Neotropical birds. The Thamnophilidae is a large family of insectivorous passerine birds that provides great opportunities to study variation in species and phenotypic diversity.

Finally, the genus and species-level taxonomic classifications of the Thamnophilidae have been subject to various changes due to the novel information revealed by the integrative approach followed here. It can be argued then, that this research has made various contributions in the fields of evolutionary biology, systematics, and taxonomy of Neotropical birds, and will allow a better understanding of how species richness and phenotypic diversity is created and maintained in the Neotropics.
