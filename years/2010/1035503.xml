<AbstractNarration>The Math for America San Diego Noyce Master Teaching Fellows Program (MfA SD Noyce MTF) encompasses a comprehensive leadership program designed to develop key qualities of teacher-leaders: teaching, learning, leading, and influencing. The program is offered through a collaboration between the University of California San Diego (UCSD) and Math for America (MfA) San Diego, with the goal of developing 12 teacher leaders in mathematics to help transform mathematics teaching and learning in high needs schools in the San Diego area. These collaborating institutions are part of an on-going partnership, the MfA SD, in which they are joined by two other universities (California State University San Marcos and San Diego State University); three school districts (the Escondido Union High School, Oceanside Unified, and San Diego Unified); and the San Diego County Office of Education. The MfA SD partnership also operates a Noyce Teaching Fellows (TF) program, allowing for synergistic interactions between new teachers (TFs) and the emerging teacher leaders (MTFs), and for leveraging of existing support systems. The national network of MfA is another essential partner whose contributions include a common, electronic fellowship application process, collaboration in the development of evaluative mechanisms, and enhanced fund-raising, as evidenced by the matching funds being provided to this project by MfA national. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. The MfA SD Noyce MTF Program aims to transform mathematics education in high-need districts by helping teacher leaders to become powerful change agents in their respective spheres of influence. While 12 teachers and their students and colleagues are the direct recipients of this program, the influence of these MTFs extends well beyond the participant group and will do so for much longer than the grant period. The development of the infrastructure which supports this program and the enthusiastic involvement of the three partner districts and the San Diego County Office of Education is ensuring that the Program impacts thousands of students in the region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. The MfA SD is a cohesive collection of interrelated and integrated academic, professional, and social support systems that unites a collection of faculty, well-regarded teacher education programs, strong but under-funded public school districts, and local philanthropists. There is a commonality in purpose and an intellectual glue that bonds their components and adheres the participating professors, fellows, teachers, and administrators. Their shared philosophy is guided by two fundamental questions: 1) what is the mathematics that should be taught in school; and 2) how should it be taught? The intellectual merit of the MfA Noyce MTF SD program lies in the continual restatement of those questions and the reevaluation of the answers by the mathematics and education communities. The program's goals of developing teacher leaders in and for mathematics and developing the infrastructure to sustain these efforts are practical, but they are informed at every stage by these fundamental questions of mathematics teaching and learning.</AbstractNarration>

We have presented a model program for systemic reform, designed to significantly improve student learning of mathematics in high-need high schools.  The MfA SD Noyce Master Teaching Fellowship Program encompasses a comprehensive leadership development program carefully designed to develop four key qualities of teacher leaders: teaching, learning, leading, and influencing. Intellectual Merit  In order to teach mathematics well, teachers need to know mathematics deeply, understand the kinds of difficulties student will encounter when learning mathematics and the impact of their previous and existing knowledge on the acquisition of new knowledge. They must know how to translate their knowledge of mathematics and how students learn into meaningful lessons for students. To know mathematics deeply means not only knowing subject matter elements, such as particular definitions, theorems, proofs, solutions to problems, for example, but also be able to think conceptually, know basic problem-solving approaches and master multiple methods of proving. It is the quality of this knowledge that is the cornerstone of teaching for it affects what the teachers teach and how they teach it. Knowing how to teach mathematics well includes an understanding of how to assess students? knowledge, how to utilize assessment to pose problems that stimulate students? intellectual curiosity, and how to help students solidify and retain knowledge they have acquired. The goal of mathematical instruction is not only for students to learn definitions, theorems, formulas, but also to acquire valuable ways of thinking that are at the heart of the subject. Some of the ways of thinking targeted in this project for its participants and, ultimately, for their students were:   Attend to relationships among physical, geometric, and algebraic realities. In mathematics it is valuable to translate from one to the other and back again.   An equation can be rewritten in various forms which make certain properties more noticeable. The link between the forms is provided by something which stays the same, for example the solution set.   Reason deductively. Proving relies on logic. Be clear about what is given, what is proved, what can be assumed or chosen freely.   MfA SD is a cohesively designed program of inter-related and integrated academic, professional, and social support systems that unites a collection of distinguished faculty, well-regarded teacher education programs, strong but under-funded public school districts, and generous local philanthropists. There is a commonality in their purpose and an intellectual bond among their components that connects their professors, fellows, teachers, and administrators to a structure supported by the scholarship and teaching practice of the investigator, Guershon Harel, and his colleagues.

The project?s goals of developing teacher leaders in and for mathematics and developing the infrastructure to sustain these efforts are practical but they are informed at every stage by these fundamental questions of mathematics teaching and learning.  Broader Impacts The two goals of this program were to develop 12 teacher leaders (MTFs) in mathematics who have demonstrated excellent skills and knowledge and the capacity for continued growth in four related areas: teaching, learning, leading and influencing and to develop the infrastructure necessary to sustain the changes begun by this program in order to continue to reform high school mathematics classrooms. Beyond the clear educational benefits of developing 12 teacher leaders in mathematics for high-need school districts in one of the nation?s most valuable, high-technology regions, the influx of Noyce support leveraged the local resources that flowed into the MfA SD program.
