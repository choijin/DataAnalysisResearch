<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the fundamental nature of artificial nano-structured magnetic systems, where individual nano-sized magnetic elements play the role of "atoms" of an artificial "crystal".  The interaction between these "atoms" can be designed-to-order by choosing the geometrical and magnetic parameters of the "atoms", and the magnetic ground state of the system can be controlled in real time by the pulses of bias magnetic field.  The research will lead to the development of novel man-made dynamically controllable magnetic materials for applications in microwave signal processing. Theoretical analytical and numerical efforts are directed towards the creation of a clear fundamental picture of the static and dynamic collective behavior of such materials. The fabrication and experimental efforts are directed towards the development of materials with optimized magnetic parameters that can be used in reciprocal and non-reciprocal on-chip microwave signal processing devices. The US teams from Oakland University (OU) and Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) concentrate on theory (analytical and numerical) (OU) and fabrication and characterization of magnetic nano-structures (ANL). The Spanish team from Universidad del Pais Vasco (UPV) works on the theory of magnetic dots in a vortex state and on the measurements of static characteristics of fabricated nano-structures. The Ukrainian team from Kiev National University (KNU) concentrates on microwave experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research of the properties of novel dynamically controlled artificial magnonic materials, combining theory, numerical simulations and cutting-edge experimental techniques, is expected to have a broad impact that extends beyond magnetism to other fields of materials science and electrical engineering. The work will have a transformative effect on the field of microwave magnetic materials, and will lead to the development of a novel class of on-chip signal processing devices compatible with the existing planar semiconductor technology. Significant emphasis is placed on the training of young researchers in the USA and Europe by engaging them in state-of-the-art research in a highly collaborative and international environment. Students and postdoctoral fellows learn modern theoretical and experimental techniques that provide them with the tools for successful careers in science and technology, and will make them highly employable in either academia or industry. Activities include extended inter-group visits of students and senior participants, and the interaction between academia (OU, UPV, and KNU) and a national laboratory (ANL). The project synergistically combines theorists, experimentalists, and fabrication specialists, as necessary for the rapid development of a fundamental understanding and practical applications of the proposed artificial magnetic materials based on arrays of interacting magnetic dots.</AbstractNarration>

The research Program supported by the grant NSF DMR #1015175  was  devoted to the development of the theory  of dynamically reconfigurable nano-structured artificial magnetic materials &ndash; two-dimensional magnonic crystals based on arrays of interacting nano-sized magnetic dots.  The main advantages of the proposed artificial materials compared to the existing natural materials is the possibility to obtain "tailored-to-order" magnetic properties that can be dynamically controlled in real time by the pulses of the bias magnetic field.      The nano-scale magnetic dots can have several quasi-stable orientations of static magnetization held by the shape anisotropy of a magnetic nano-element. These magnetization orientations can be reversed by the application of a short paulse of an external bias magnetic field (see Fig.1).       Therefore, the arrays of many such elements coupled by a magneto-dipolar interaction can exist in several quasi-stable collective magnetization states with different microwave properties and the switching between these different collective magnetization states can be performed dynamically by pulses of external magnetic field (see Fig.2).  In particular, the frequency of microwave absorption in the "ferromagnetic" and "chessboard antiferromagnetic" states could differ by several GHz and the switching between these states could be performed in less than 100 ns  (see  Fig.2).   Intellectual Merit    Here are the main scientific results obtained in the research Program supported by the grant NSF DMR #1015175 :   We developed a general theory      of collective spin-wave excitations in a two-dimensional array of magnetic      nanodots coupled by magnetodipolar interaction. The theory allows one to      analytically calculate spectra, damping rates, excitation efficiencies,      and other characteristics of spin waves in both periodic and aperiodic      ground states of an array.         We developed a general analytic theory of      the ground state switching process in dipolarly coupled magnetic dot      arrays. An array can be switched into a quasi-regular      chessboard-antiferromagnetic state by the application of a short pulse of      external in-plane magnetic field having a sufficiently long trailing      front.       We demonstrated that collective      spin waves (SWs) propagating in complex periodic arrays of dipolarly      coupled magnetic nanopillars existing in a saturated (single-domain)      ground state in a zero bias magnetic field could be nonreciprocal. To guarantee the SW nonreciprocity, two      conditions should be fulfilled: (i) existence of a nonzero out-of-plane      component of the pillarsÆ static magnetization and (ii) a complex      periodicity of arrayÆs ground state with at least two elements per a      primitive cell, if the elements are different, and at least three elements      per a primitive cell, if the elements are identical.      We derived approximate      electrodynamic boundary conditions for an array of dipolarly coupled magnetic      elements in the case when the elementsÆ th...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
