<AbstractNarration>This award is for the operations and maintenance of a multi-scale, multidisciplinary ocean observing system that will provide a permanent presence in the ocean, with unprecedented power and interactive capability for advanced sensors and platforms, and real-time access to data and advanced visualization tools.  The Ocean Observing Initiative (OOI) will transform ocean research and education by establishing an open, integrated, networked observing system that will enable next-generation research, discovery, education, and public engagement on a range of topics as broad as climate&lt;br/&gt;variability and ocean ecosystems, turbulent mixing, plate tectonics, and sub-seafloor biogeochemistry. The OOI will enable multiple scales of marine observations to be integrated into one observing system via common design elements and an overarching, interactive cyberinfrastructure. The Consortium for Ocean Leadership will coordinate and manage the initial operation of the OOI, with subawards to the Implementing Organizations for the Coastal/Global Scale Nodes, the Regional Scale Nodes, Cyberinfrastructure, and Education and Public Engagement. The coastal-scale assets of the OOI will expand existing observations off both U.S. coasts, creating focused, configurable observing regions. Regional cabled observing platforms will ?wire? a single region in the Northeast Pacific Ocean with a high speed optical and power grid. The global component addresses planetary-scale changes via moored open-ocean buoys linked to shore via satellite. A unifying cyberinfrastructure will link all the components of the system, and permit researchers to control sampling strategies of experiments deployed on one part of the system in response to remote detection of events by other parts of the system. The whole of OOI allows scientists and citizens to view phenomena irrespective of the observations' sources (e.g.,coastal, global, regional, ships, satellites, IOOS).</AbstractNarration>

OOI data contribute to research on the impacts of climate change, ecosystem variability, the ocean&rsquo;s role in the global carbon cycle, and linkages among seafloor volcanism and life.</p> <p class="Noindent">As originally commissioned, the OOI was a network of seven arrays located across the North and South Atlantic and Pacific Ocean basins, including one Cabled Array, two Coastal Arrays, and four Global Arrays. The OOI marine instrumented infrastructure included 41 moorings, 20 seafloor packages, up to 32 buoyancy-driven gliders, and 2 propeller-driven Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV). Over 800 instruments representing 75 models of specialized instrumentation provided unique data and information, including more than 40,000 unique streams of data and seafloor high-definition video and still images. Since commissioning, two of the seven arrays (the only two in the southern hemisphere) were deactivated to meet specific budgetary reductions directed by Congress.</p> <p class="Noindent">The OOI provides free access to its data for a vast user community of oceanographers, scientists, educators, students, and the public.
