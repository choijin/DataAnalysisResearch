<AbstractNarration>MentorNet is an educational organization devoted to the advancement of underrepresented minority groups in the STEM disciplines, particularly women.  To this end, the organization has goals that are directly in line with the mission of the NSF ADVANCE Program.  Specifically, MentorNet, through the proposed ADVANCE PAID project will provide online and virtual tools that will enable women of color to expand exiting professional networks and engage in electronic mentoring.  The proposed project will also provide an electronic resource of current news, career opportunities and discussion forums for this cadre of women in the academic STEM disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit.  The MentorNet ADVANCE PAID project will serve to raise awareness of and sensitivity to the unique issues and circumstances that are experienced by women of color.  Specifically, because of the nature of the electronic platform that will be developed by this project, significant progress will be made in understanding what factors in social networking influence the growth and engagement of women of color as well as what factors produce positive outcomes for mentoring relationships.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact.  This organization is able to leverage its vast capacity to provide access to social networking and electronic mentoring to women of color across the nation.  Additionally, in its capacity to sustain itself, this project will also indirectly affect future generations of women of color in the STEM disciplines.  To that end, the MentorNet ADVANCE PAID project has the potential to contribute significantly to addressing the underrepresentation of STEM women of color in the US and abroad.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this NSF Grant #1043737, "Creating a Mentoring-focused Web Community for Women of Color in STEM," was to "create a safe, secure, private and ultimately self-sustaining online social network to support the NSF-sponsored STEM Women of Color Conclave.  The goal will be to provide online and virtual tools &ndash; adapted from the existing MentorNet web program &ndash; to enable members of the Conclave to enrich their existing relationships, form new ones, recruit and bring new members into the community, extend their face-to-face meetings and conferences, grow their personal network, and mentor each other one-on-one to succeed in their careers."  MentorNet for Faculty Women of Color (See http://faculty.mentornet.org) is a customized, private, on-line mentoring service that facilitates one-to-one, on-line mentoring experiences of faculty women of color participating in ADVANCE programs.   MentorNet for Faculty Women of Color is a configurable instance of MentorNet?s completely new, scalable mentoring service that has familiar features from social networks like LinkedIn and Facebook and that is offered as Platform as a Service (PaaS) hosted on cloud-based virtual servers. During the performance of this grant, we focused on designing, implementing and piloting the new platform; researching, implementing and deploying mentoring programs to support mentor-mentee pairs who are faculty women of color; and on deploying closely related instances of other mentoring communities with an emphasis on supporting faculty women of color who join other MentorNet communities. The program content for the Faculty Women of Color program is public and dynamically generated and therefore always current at: http://bit.ly/mentornet_faculty_topics_for_mentees and http://bit.ly/mentornet_faculty_topics_for_mentors. In addition to MentorNet for Faculty Women of Color, the new MentorNet virtual mentoring service hosts two other closely-related mentoring communities:  MentorNet for STEM students, (http://program.mentornet.org) an open social network for mentoring available to any student pursuing a STEM degree at an accredited institution of higher education in the U.S. and to any STEM professional interested in becoming a mentor (more than 9,000 mentors and mentees); and the ADVANCE Regional Network (http://arn.mentornet.org) an on-line mentoring program to facilitate mentorships between tenured faculty and junior faculty within a five-institution consortium of University of Houston, in conjunction with Rice University, Texas A&amp;M University, Prairie View A&amp;M University,  and University of Texas Pan Am.  The MentorNet platform and program for faculty have influenced and are being utilized in other disciplines.  The NIGMS National Research Mentoring Network (http://nrmnet.net) uses the MentorNet guided virtual mentorship model and has adapted our program content for STEM faculty to support the more than 4,000 biomedical researchers in the NRMN network.  The majority of those who engage in virtual mentorship are female post-docs and faculty (60%) and more than 40% of whom are from historically under-represented groups in STEM (Latina, African American, Native American, Pacific Islander and multi-racial).
