<AbstractNarration>The project is a collaborative effort involving the Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering and the California Polytechnic State University that is working to improve the STEM educational community's understanding of how students develop the skills and attitudes necessary for self-directed and lifelong learning.  Specifically, the investigators are examining first- and second-year students' conceptions of learning; measuring students' sense of control and responsibility in their learning processes; and evaluating students' skill in using self-regulated learning strategies to respond to diverse learning opportunities and challenges. The project aims to determine (1) how entering STEM students are characterized with respect to self-directed learning skills and attitudes, (2) how STEM students' conceptions of learning, motivations toward learning, and self-directed skills change in the first two years of their undergraduate programs, (3) what are the within- and across-institution differences in students' initial attributes and self-directed learning growth, (4) what are the gender differences in students' initial attributes and self-directed learning growth, and (5) how students evaluate learning experiences with respect to their own self-directed learning development. The project draws upon existing social-cognitive theories of motivation and self-regulation, as well as the investigators' successful practice in autonomy-supportive pedagogies and current studies of self-directed learning in STEM environments. The broader impacts include the enhanced understanding of how students become self-directing, which will inform curriculum development that facilitates the emergence of lifelong learners.</AbstractNarration>

Using both quantitative surveys and open-ended discussion questions and focus groups, we measured what drives students to learn (motivations and goals), what students believe about learning, and when and how students demonstrate the behavioral and thinking patterns of self-directed learners.  Intellectual Merit  The quantitative results showed that students at both schools reported positive attributes of self-directed learners, such as autonomous motivations, an emphasis on learning over grades, and generally positive beliefs about learning. Engineering undergraduates at the two schools did show some differences, however. For example, students at the small private college more strongly endorsed social (versus individual) learning, and reported more positive goal orientations (focus on learning versus grades), compared to large public university students. In addition, the large public university students expressed stronger extrinsic motivations, which are associated with attaining rewards or avoiding punishments. At both schools, entering first-year students only moderately endorsed self-regulated learning over teacher-directed learning, indicating room for self-directed learner growth at both institutions.  Measuring self-directed learner growth over time was not straightforward. Overall, the quantitative analyses failed to reveal many significant temporal changes in studentsÃ† SDL abilities, as measured by the mean responses for groups of students over the two-year period. Most of the survey subscale means remained relatively stable over time; and many of the significant shifts that occurred in year one of the study disappeared during year two.
