<AbstractNarration>1066898&lt;br/&gt;Gracias&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biochemical sensing coupled with mechanical actuation is widely observed in nature and enables autonomous function with high selectivity and specificity and without the need for any electrical wires or batteries. However, this concept has yet to be realized in human engineering which relies heavily on electromechanical actuation schemes. This proposal is focused on the development of micro-nanostructured tools and materials that sense biochemicals and autonomously reconfigure in response to them. A fundamental element of the strategy is the creation of biosensing hinges which are based on the biologically inspired concept of chemo-mechanical actuation wherein chemical sensing events elicit mechanical responses without the need for any wires, tethers, batteries or electrical power. &lt;br/&gt;This concept will be utilized in combination with micro and nanoscale patterning to enable the creation of functional, smart miniaturized devices and materials that are inexpensive, can be mass produced and do not consume electrical power. Hence, these functional structures can be deployed in a number of environments including hard-to-reach places and over long periods of time (without the need for electrical charging) to enhance the capabilities of devices and materials for biomedical, lab-on-a-chip and security applications. Along with the research, significant efforts will be directed at enhancing broader education by the inclusion of undergraduate students in research experiences and exposing K-12 students, teachers and the public to the frontiers of science and engineering, specifically in the area of biologically inspired sensing modalities via research experiences, workshops, public lectures and the world wide web. In addition, activities will be created to enhance participation of K-12 students from groups that are underrepresented in science and engineering by fostering connections with the Baltimore public school system.</AbstractNarration>
