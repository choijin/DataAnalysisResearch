<AbstractNarration>Stress during particular developmental stages has long-term effects on brain and behavior.  It was discovered that particular stressors, even very short-duration challenges during the pubertal period in mice cause deleterious changes in the brain's response to the hormones, estradiol and progesterone, in adulthood.  Because these hormones influence such a wide range of behaviors in all vertebrate animals, it is essential to understand how a transient event lasting only a day or two can have an enduring negative influence on hormonal response.   It will be determined how long into adulthood the effects of pubertal stressors on behavioral response to hormones endure, it will be determined if it generalizes to another rodent species, and it will be determined if this robust effect generalizes to a different immune challenge that works through an independent cellular signaling pathway.  Using molecular and epigenetic tools, a novel hypothesis for the cellular underpinnings of this reprogramming of response to hormones will be tested.  It is predicted that pubertal stressors cause long-term alteration in regulation of brain receptors for estradiol, and that this is mediated by changes in methylation patterns of the gene for the receptor, ultimately reprogramming behavioral response to estradiol.  This research is valuable, because it addresses an important problem for all animals; how does a short-term perturbation cause long-term disruption in behavior?  This work will provide unique training experiences for students at all levels aiming for careers in science and medicine.  Students are involved at all stages of research from hypothesis development and testing to oral and written communication of results.  When trainees learn principles of critical thinking and hypothesis testing through first-hand research experience, it is anticipated that they will share it formally as future educators and physicians and informally in social situations, thereby dramatically increasing the reach of the science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During pubertal development, an animal?s response to stress changes, and the sexual differentiation of the brain and behavior continues. We discovered that exposure to particular stressors during the peripubertal period of female mice results in long-term changes in behavioral responsiveness of the brain to estrogens in adulthood.  Particular stressors during pubertal development in mice alter all behaviors influenced by estrogens that we have studied, such as reproductive behavior, performance on particular cognitive tasks, depression-like, and anxiety-like behaviors. Depending on the behavior, particular stressors during pubertal development decrease, eliminate, or even reverse the effects of estrogens in female mice.  In trying to determine the reason for this change in hormone response after particular stressors during pubertal development, we focused on the immune cells of the brain, because these are major factors influencing neuronal development.  We found that a particular type of immune cell in the brain, microglia, changes in function during pubertal development.  It is interesting that changes are not uniform over the entire brain; rather, they are specific to particular brain regions.  We discovered that removal of estrogens circulating in the brain of the animals by removal of the ovaries causes dramatic changes in the normal function of these cells of the immune system.  We then found that manipulating levels of estrogens by administering estrogens or blocking their production has dramatic effects on the function of these immune cells. These changes in response to estrogens during pubertal development in turn may be responsible for the changes of the brain?s response to estrogens later on in development.  These findings add to a growing body of research showing the importance of the peripubertal period for later effects of hormones on the brain and behavior in animals.  Likewise, they add to the growing body of research showing the importance of these particular immune cells to brain development.  They suggest that the changes that we have discovered in the function of the brain?s immune cells brought about by estrogens during pubertal development are responsible for remodeling of the response of particular brain areas to hormones.   Although these studies were performed in a model, laboratory species, mice, they suggest that we should consider the possibility that atypical responses to ovarian hormones, including estrogens, in adulthood in women could be due to particular stressors during the sensitive, peripubertal period of development.  During the course of this research, numerous undergraduates and graduate students were given the opportunity to be directly involved in research.  Trainees at all levels were involved in all phases of planning, execution, and dissemination of the results of the research.  Many of these trainees have gone on to graduate, medical, or veterinary school, or have taken positions in education, science, or the health professions. Their introduction to this hypothesis-driven research helped to prepare them to be critical thinking educators, scientists, physicians, or support staff.
