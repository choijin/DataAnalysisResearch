<AbstractNarration>With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Wake and a team of undergraduate research trainees will conduct two years of detailed analysis of vertebrate faunal remains recovered from four Formative Period archaeological sites in the Soconusco Region of Southwest Pacific Mesoamerica.  This project will examine the role vertebrate resources had in the development of SW Mesoamerican societies across the roughly 2000 year Formative Period on the Soconusco coastal plain of Pacific Chiapas, Mexico and adjacent Pacific Guatemala.  The Formative Period in this region includes the transition from mobile hunter-gatherer adaptations to early sedentary agricultural societies, into simple and complex chiefdoms, culminating in early states.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide much needed new information and synthesis of vertebrate faunal collections that have been languishing since their initial excavation at both theoretical and substantive levels.   Little is known about Formative Period diets, dietary change through time and human effects on available vertebrate resources through time in the region.  The project will examine several research questions including whether human exploitation impacted locally available resources and, if so, how human populations responded to resource stress.  Increasing reliance on dogs as food and net fishing for high yield low-trophic level fishes is one possible response to resource stress and increasing populations in the region during the Formative Period.  This project will test this and other hypotheses with new data from at least four recently excavated archaeological sites: Paso de la Amada, La Blanca, Canton Corralito and Cuauhtemoc.  The results of these analyses will be compared to collections from 8 other regional sites previously examined at UCLA to investigate local variability and broad regional trends.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this study include the illustration that the close examination of animal bones from a region absent of intensive animal domestication and husbandry can provide important information concerning economic and political changes related to the development of socio-political complexity.  This project will analyze and synthesize languishing, information-rich vertebrate archaeofaunas in order to provide a more complete synthesis of vertebrate exploitation, human impacts, and dietary roles during the development of social complexity in the region.  An important part of this project is the support and training of undergraduate research assistants in the methodology of zooarchaeology and faunal analysis.  The project will augment the vertebrate comparative collections held at UCLA.  Ultimately this project hopes to encourage greater investment in zooarchaeological study in the neotropics by supplying high-quality data and interpretations, well-trained future zooarchaeology graduate students, and the collections and facilities to expedite research-driven analysis of vertebrate archaeofaunas.</AbstractNarration>

Deer, rabbits and giant pocket gophers increase through time, suggesting an increase in garden hunting.  A variety of bird species representing more habitats appears at both Early Formative Period sites.     The Middle Formative Period Cochas Phase (950-650 BC), represented by early urban center of La Blanca built around a large, early earthen pyramid, continues the Early Formative pattern of high species diversity and higher-than-Archaic Period fishery MTL.  Estuarine, riverine and fresh water swamp habitats were equally important.  At La Blanca dogs and reptiles are more common than at Paso or Aquiles Serdan. A greater relative frequency of deer, dog and preferred (high trophic level) fish is seen in "elite" house mounds.  Tapir appears in low numbers, only in elite contexts.     At the Late Formative Period urban center of El Ujuxte species diversity remains high but decreases through time.  Reversing a trend seen in the early and middle formative periods, the MTL of the El Ujuxte fishery increases through the Late Formative Period.  Fish diversity remains low and focused on riverine and fresh water swamp habitats and urtles are common.  Dogs are more common at El Ujuxte than any other site, with deer and peccary well-represented.  Tapir and large cats are more common at La Blanca and El Ujuxte than any other site.     The Late Archaic vertebrate consumption pattern focused on extraction of fish to the point of resource depression, adverse impacts on high trophic level species, and increasing emphasis of lower trophic level resources.       The Early Formative Period pattern of vertebrate exploitation is radically different in several ways.  While still extracting species from estuarine and fresh water habitats, the occupants of Paso de la Amada and Aquiles Serdan exploit a much wider range of species, resulting in greater diversity and MTL values that decline slightly over time.  These people also introduced and consumed domestic dogs on a scale never before seen in Soconusco.       The Middle Formative pattern of vertebrate consumption continues trends observed in the Early Formative; a diverse array of species from various habitats, stable MTL values and dog consumption intensifies.  "Rarer" mammals such as tapir and spotted cats appear more commonly in the Middle Formative assemblages as social stratification intensifies.     By the Late Formative urbanization has reduced overall species diversity, intensified dog use and focused on locally available fish species. The MTL values for the Ujuxte fishery increase over time, suggesting the intensification of an overall sustainable fishery.
