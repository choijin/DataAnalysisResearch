<AbstractNarration>The Models of Professional Development for Mathematics Teachers project is conducting a comprehensive study of professional development models designed for mathematics teachers in grades K-12.  The research team will identify key constructs and frameworks within professional development programs and identify types of professional development models.  The goals of the project are to encourage researchers and professional developers to reconceptualize mathematics professional development, develop a shared language, and renew discussions on effective professional development for teachers of mathematics. The project team includes faculty and students at North Carolina State University and a research scientist at American Institutes for Research.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The project team is coding and analyzing descriptive data on mathematics professional development (MPD) gathered from studying mathematics teacher education research literature.  They are also conducting interviews with authors of the studies they have identified. The project is investigating the general question: What are the various models used by mathematics teacher educators when designing and implementing mathematics professional development?  Specifically, they are asking:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. What are similarities and differences across goals, theoretical frameworks, contexts and structures that exist in the design of MPD offered to K-12 teachers?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. How does the field name and define various characteristics of MPD?&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;3. How can the characteristics of the various MPD designs be grouped into meaningful models? What are the main elements that define these models?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers hope that their efforts to describe models of professional development will help educators to move away from professional development designed around a few salient features and move toward professional development models that contain a theoretical framework and coherent features that work together.  They want professional developers and researchers to use a common language to study and assess professional development. Their analysis of existing professional development projects in mathematics teaching will offer the following outcomes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. An empirically established definition of characteristics and models of MPD, with explanations of the various elements that comprise these models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. A coding protocol for use in the classification of MPD models and the    organization of current information about existing MPD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. A theoretical framework for organizing knowledge about MPD that can foster new ways to think about these models in the design of innovative MPD for teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. A set of research-related innovations such as new hypotheses for studying MPD, new approaches to testing the explanatory and predictive validity of various features of professional development, and new formats for describing the state of the art in MPD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. Concepts that can support a revision of what is meant by best practices or effective features of MPD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;6. An open-source, web-based, searchable database with descriptions of various MPD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This exploratory project will provide an opportunity for the mathematics education field to learn more about professional development and approaches to conducting research on professional development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal of the Models of Professional Development for Mathematics Teachers project was to examine professional development programs offered to K-12 teachers. The project aimed to synthesize the field of mathematics professional development research through analysis of the design of the interventions being studied. Whereas analyses of research studies typically focus on summarizing research findings, this exploratory project proposed to analyze the interventions themselves, that is, the design of professional development programs discussed in the research literature.  This focus on design made the project unique in its examination of the field.  To accomplish the projectÆs goal, investigators conducted a search of the research literature on mathematics professional development between 1992 and 2010, which resulted in 2,776 entries.  A prescreening of the abstract for all these entries revealed that 903 were of interest: 308 dissertations and 595 manuscripts. The research team collected all 578 manuscripts that could be retrieved, screening all of them for relevance. A total of 272 papers passed the screening processes and were subsequently coded.  Intellectual Merit  This project resulted in important findings concerning the professional development programs offered to K-12 mathematics teachers that are represented in the research literature. Most of the PD programs are developed based on constructivist, social constructivist, or situated learning theories, and the most often reported goal is to improve teachersÆ pedagogical content knowledge (followed by improving their subject matter knowledge and their knowledge of student learning). These professional development programs are usually facilitated by researchers or other members of the research team, although most of them take place in schools. They are often face-to-face and many last between 25 and 50 hours. These programs are often complex and multifaceted, including a variety of formats (e.g., summer institute with school year follow up that might include coaching opportunities) as well as a collection of different activities (e.g., discussion, reflections, collective planning, etc.) designed around various tools (e.g., videos, student work, lesson planning, etc.).  Thus, most professional development programs offer a wide array of opportunities for teachers over prolonged periods of time, making their separation into specific models complex.  One of the most important findings from the study, however, was the variety of ways in which researchers describe their programs and the lack of agreement among studies on what features of the design of professional development need to be reported.  This lack of consistent reporting makes it difficult to compare findings across research studies as it is not clear how the interventions under consideration are similar or different.  Broader Impact  The codebook created for this project offers an important tool for both professional development designers and researchers. This tool suggests features of professional development that one should take into account when designing a professional development program for mathematics teachers, as well as a set of variables about the professional development design that need to be included in the reporting of professional development research.  Further, the project also suggests the importance of the development of standards for reporting professional development, which allows for comparison among programs and for deeper understanding of professional development models. To date, no other study has attempted to examine the ways in which professional development interventions are described in research reports. This project reveals the importance of attending to this feature of the research to inform those who are interested in better understanding professional development offered to mathematics teachers.
