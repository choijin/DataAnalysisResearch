<AbstractNarration>Plasma is by far the most common form of matter in the universe, but is usually quite hot, especially when created in the laboratory.  The researchers of this project developed a technique that starts with laser-cooled atoms to produce ultracold plasmas, with temperatures that they have measured to less than 1 K.  This work will continue to study the properties of ultracold plasmas, as they expand into vacuum, and when they are confined in two and three dimensions with magnetic fields. The researchers will investigate how magnetic fields modify the collective properties of the plasma and how dynamics are changed. The researchers will develop techniques to measure the distribution of highly excited atoms created by the plasma to test the theory at low temperatures, which bears on efforts to trap and study antihydrogen atoms.  They will study the evaporation of electrons from the plasma, which will provide insight into the basic physics of non-equilibrium systems, which occur quite often in nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is exploratory, investigating regimes of physical system that have not previously been explored, or theoretically treated.  It resides at the boundary between atomic physics and plasma physics.  Greater understanding of these systems may have relevance for astrophysical processes occurring in the interior of planets and stars, as well as for inertial confinement fusion.  They also provide a testing ground for state-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulations, which have applications in many areas of physics and technology, including national security.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in state-of-the-art optical techniques, along with gaining experience with high vacuum, analog, RF, and digital electronics, and computer-based data acquisition.   They will be in an environment that exposes them to a wide variety of physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Plasma is the most common state of matter,  estimated to comprise 99% of the universe. It can exist over tens of orders of magnitude of density and temperature, from the ultralow density of the interstellar medium to the interior of stars, from a few hundred Kelvin in the ionosphere to tem million kelvin in the Sun.  This project explored properties of ultracold plasmas, neutral plasma created with the atomic physics technique of ionizing a laser-cooled cloud of xenon atoms.  With temperatures below one Kelvin, this is a new extreme regime of plasma physics.  But nonetheless it shares some similarities with other plasma, and understanding those as well as differences furthers our overall understanding of this complex state of matter.  This project concentrated on studying how these ultracold plasmas could be excited with radiofrequency fields, and developed a new non-invasive technique to detect the collective motion of the particles in the plasma.  Such collective behavior is important throughout plasma physics, from research towards fusion energy to astrophysical plasmas.  One characteristic feature of these ultracold plasmas is their inhomogeneous density distributions, which modifies the collective response of the plasma, requiring an extension of traditional theories of collective modes of plasma.  This can be relevant in other plasma systems as well in very different parameter regimes.  These plasmas also border on the regime of strong coupling, where the electrostatic energy between particles is comparable to the thermal energy, as regime relevant to fusion, and also a regime where traditional plasma physics theory breaks down.
