<AbstractNarration>This 1-year award will support initial maintenance and upgrade of the Greenland GPS Network (GNET) that was originally installed during International Polar Year 2007-2009. Maintenance and upgrade activities in summer 2011 will focus on installations along the southeast coast of Greenland and along the west coast facing Baffin Bay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The primary purpose of GNET is to study changes in ice sheet mass balance produced by climate cycles and climate change, and to provide observational constraints on models of glacial isostatic adjustment, often referred to as postglacial rebound (PGR), which provide the crucial 'PGR correction' for the GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) satellite mission and any follow-on missions. The goal is to achieve a consistent set of gravity, displacement and ice mass histories with the highest possible spatial resolution. GNET will also contribute meteorological estimates of surface mass balance (SMB) by generating precipitable water (PW, i.e., integrated water vapor) solutions at all GPS (Global Positioning System) stations that can be assimilated and exploited using numerical weather models (NWM). Surface atmospheric pressure fields from high resolution NWMs will be used to correct the GPS time series for atmospheric loading effects, thereby isolating the displacement cycles associated with seasonal changes in ice mass. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: GNET is an international collaboration between a US team, led by Ohio State University, and international partners in Denmark and Luxembourg. It is expected that GNET will contribute to understanding of the globally significant issues of climate and sea level change, and will be able to detect the onset of runaway or catastrophic ice loss within weeks of a sudden onset. A collaboration between GNET and the NWM community could have a significant impact on general meteorological products. It is also expected that GNET will contribute to studies of the polar ionosphere, and can synergize with existing space physics networks and facilities in Greenland and northern Canada. GNET will be used as a general positioning infrastructure, for kinematic positioning of survey aircraft, GPS rovers embedded in ice flows, etc. GNET is becoming a multiple use instrument or facility, as well as a specific research project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Greenland GPS Network (GNET) was constructed during the 2007, 2008 and 2009 field seasons in order to develop a new means to measure the impact of climate cycles and climate change on ice mass balance in the worldÆs second largest ice sheet. The primary objective of GNET is to æweighÆ the Greenland ice sheet by measuring the earthÆs instantaneous elastic response to contemporary changes in ice mass, much as a traditional bathroom scale measures body mass by gauging the degree to which it can compress a spring.  As a result of this project, there are now more than 50 continuous GPS stations set into the bedrock surrounding the Greenland Ice Sheet. All of these stations are rising at rates between 2 and 30 mm/year, with a median rate of 8 mm/yr (Figure 1). These rates are so high that there can be no doubt that the dominant cause of this uplift is elastic rebound driven by contemporary changes in ice mass.  The largest rates of bedrock uplift are seen in southeast and northwest Greenland, where the greatest rates of ice loss have been concentrated since GNET began.  The typical displacement history of the GNET GPS stations is an annual vertical oscillation (representing the annual climate cylce) superimposed on a long term trend in uplift. But in 2010, GNET recorded an extra 'spike' or 'pulse' of uplift. We call this the 2010 uplift anomaly. The median amplitude of this anomaly was about 8 mm or 0.3 inches. This 'pulse' of uplift was almost certainly caused by the record breaking summer of 2010. We compare the 2010 melting day anomay with the 2010 uplift anomaly in Figure 2. The melting day anomaly is defined  as the number of extra days of melting that occur in a given year, relative to a long-term average number of days per year that melting occurs in that location. The record-breaking summer of 2010 was unusually long as well as unusually hot, and it produced one of the largest melting day anomalies ever observed in Greenland. The spatial correlation between these anomalies is obvious once we take into account the tendency for earthÆs elastic response to ice loss to decrease with increasing distance from the loss center (i.e. the ice margin).  In short, we have be able to show that GNET is able to 'weigh' the changes in ice mass associated with climate cycles and climate change.  And that ice mass changes are the dominant cause of vertical crustal motion in Greenland.   The results of this research have been discussed at much greater length in the paper by Bevis and others (2012) published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
