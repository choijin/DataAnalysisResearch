<AbstractNarration>This award supports the study of computer simulations of black holes in orbit with each other or with neutron stars.  More specifically, computer codes will be developed to construct numerical solutions to Einstein's equations of General Relativity.  The emphasis of this project will be to explore methods and algorithms for the initial data for isolated black holes or black holes in orbit that will lead to models of orbiting black holes that are more realistic than those that are currently available.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding black holes in binary systems is important for our understanding of gravity, one of the four fundamental forces of nature.  In more practical terms, accurate models of orbiting black holes are crucial for data analysis in the NSF-funded Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), designed to detect gravitational radiation emitted by such systems.  This award also supports undergraduate students who are actively involved in this research, and who receive valuable training preparing them for future careers in the sciences and beyond.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Einstein's theory of General Relativity describes gravitation.  It describes all gravitational interactions, ranging from the gravitational forces we feel on the Earth, to the evolution and fate of the Universe itself.  Learning about these gravitational interactions requires solving Einstein's equations, a complicated set of differential equations that form the core of General Relativity.   For some simple cases these differential equations can be solved analytically, with pencil and paper, but for more general cases this is not possible.   In the field of "numerical relativity" we instead solve the equations numerically, by writing computer programs that can find solutions on the computer.    In my research I develop approaches and methods that aid in the numerical solution of Einstein's equations, and then I use these methods to model astrophysical objects with strong gravitational fields, for which Einstein's general relativity is import - in particular black holes and neutron stars.  During the funding period of this grant I have worked on several aspects of such simulations. For example, I developed a new way of casting a subset of Einstein's equations that provides a new approach to modeling black holes. Together with colleagues we also found new analytical descriptions of black holes, which provide us with insight into how numerical simulations of these objects work. But probably most importantly we found a new way of solving Einstein's equations on the computer, which I would like to explain in some more detail.  Numerical relativity experienced a remarkable breakthrough ten years ago, when it became possible to simulate two black holes that orbit each other. Those simulations were carried out with Cartesian coordinates, ie. coordinates x, y and z that label the three spatial dimensions. For simulations of single objects, however, so-called spherical polar coordinates r, &Theta; and &phi; are often much better suited. Many codes used in the astrophysics community, for example some designed for simulations of supernova explosions, use these coordinates. However,  spherical polar coordinates also have disadvantages; in particular, they introduce so-called singularities into the equations, meaning that some terms become formally infinite. Therefore it had not been possible to carry out numerical relativity simulations in these coordinates, at least not without symmetry assumptions.  As a consequence, most simulations of supernova explosions, for example, adopt only approximate treatments of relativistic gravitation.  However, we have recently found a way to avoid these difficulties, and to implement a numerical relativity code in spherical polar coordinates without any symmetry assumptions.  I believe that this is an important development, because it opens the door for two somewhat separate lines of research.  On the one hand, this new code is a tool that is well suited for the study of a number of unexplored problems within the field of general relativity itself - for example in the context of the so-called "critical collapse" to black holes.  On the other hand, it provides an avenue for transfering the expertise and knowledge gained in the field of numerical relativity to the broader field of theoretical astrophysics - for example these new techniques can now be used in simulations of supernova explosions, so that relativistic gravity can now be described exactly, rather than approximately.  This grant has supported my work on these research projects, and it also had a very positive effect on my educational and training efforts, both directly and indirectly.  In particular it has supported my work with students on research projects, whether these students were directly funded through this grant, or obtained funds from other sources (e.g. Claire-Booth-Luce Fellowships, or Bowdoin research fellowships.) These students obtain training in computer programming and problem solving in general - valuable skills in the STEM fi...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
