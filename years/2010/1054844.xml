<AbstractNarration>Hardware components can contain malicious, illegal modifications that can siphon sensitive information to transmit to adversaries or shutdown critical operations.  Such modifications to the hardware - the root of trust in computing - can compromise trustworthiness of systems.  A malicious modification (backdoor) can find its way into a design through a core component implemented by a malicious insider on the team, or through a third-party intellectual property (IP). This research investigates techniques to build trustworthy hardware systems even with such untrustworthy, malicious hardware components.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key insight used in this study is that while a large number of digital backdoor implementations are feasible they can be all classified into four simple categories with unique behavioral characteristics that can be leveraged to thwart backdoors. Digital backdoors can only be triggered in two ways: they must turn-on after certain amount of time or by specially crafted inputs.  This classification is complete because time and data are the only two ways a digital system can change. After a backdoor is woken up it can impact the infested hardware component in only two ways: it can cause the hardware component to produce extraneous outputs or corrupt existing outputs. Backdoor detection techniques monitor the outputs of hardware units for anomalous behavior while protection techniques scramble inputs making it infeasible for the backdoor to be triggered at runtime. Hardening both the inputs and outputs of a hardware module against backdoors provides comprehensive protection and provides a strong basis, for the first time, to certify digital hardware to be free of backdoors.  Such certification can significantly enhance the state of trustworthy computing</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The purpose of this NSF CAREER award was to investigate techniques for building trustworthy hardware from untrustworthy components. Most solutions in this area are focused on detecting backdoors/trojans inserted during outsourced fabrication, but this research program focused on the more fundamental problem of backdoors inserted at the early design stage. Current techniques for catching fabrication-level backdoors rely on a clean design, a characteristic which may be difficult to guarantee given that design and validation are also outsourced. Thus, the design stage is the root of trust in computer systems, and our focus on protection at this stage is vital for trustworthy computing.   To solve the hardware backdoor problem, a taxonomy of design level hardware attacks was developed, and  five lines of attack comprising eleven individual techniques that potentially cover all digital hardware attacks that can be inserted at the design stage were investgiated.  The first line of attack enforces communication invariants between on-chip units. The second line of attack modifies inputs supplied to a unit to prevent backdoors from turning on. A third line of attack uses static analysis to detect suspicious portions of the design before hardware is manufactured. The fourth line of attack uses new techniques to reduce the cost of traditional N-version execution. A fifth line of attack investigates techniques for preserving front-end design protections during fabrication in a malicious untrustworthy foundry. A final aspect of the research develops a theory that provides advice to designers on which techniques to choose when multiple techniques are applicable.       The solutions developed here, taken together, make it possible for the first time to build trustworthy hardware from untrustworthy digital components, an advance that allows development of systems that are secure from the foundational level of the computing stack.  Under this award both performance and security validation was performed. For performance validation, RTL prototypes -- a microcontroller, cryptographic units at 90nm -- we built to implement methods for silencing triggers. The prototypes show that defenses can be created with only 8% area overhead compared to a completely insecure design with negligible performance loss.  An international "red team" competition was organized to test the hardware security ideas developed under his work. Eight teams tried to evade a static analysis technique developed under this award to sneak backdoors into a design of their choosing. The techniques successfully detected all the backdoors in a short amount of time with no prior knowledge of the design or its implementation, a scenario that closely mimics how third-party IP is procured in the real world. These successes against red-team efforts coupled with a best paper award at the Computer and Communication Security Conference (three of 530 submissions) are strong endorsements for the efficacy of the proposed techniques.  Finally the PI has been involved commercialization of the technology through a SBIR funded startup Chip Scan Inc.
