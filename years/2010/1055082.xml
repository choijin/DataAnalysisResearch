<AbstractNarration>The 45th Annual Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference will be held at the University of Texas at Tyler from Thursday March 17 through Saturday March 19, 2011.  The conference will offer special sessions in Continuum Theory, Dynamical Systems, Geometric Group Theory, Geometric Topology, and Set-theoretic Topology, as well as six plenary talks and 12 semi-plenary talks covering the breadth of the special sessions.  The conference is organized by the special session organizing committees, the conference steering committee, and the principal investigator on the grant.  The grant provides funds to support travel for graduate students and young researchers, in addition to the invited speakers.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The series of conferences is one of the longest running in mathematics.  In the spring of 1967, the first conference was held at Arizona State University, and it was primarily a conference on general topology and continuum theory.  In the past 45 years, the conference has grown in size and scope.  It has continued to be the most important conference of the year in set-theoretic topology and continuum theory, while expanding to include the areas of dynamical systems, geometric group theory, and geometric topology.  Over the years, the conference has made special efforts to broaden participation by women, underrepresented groups, graduate students, and young researchers, while expanding to cover a broader section of topology.  Many of the most famous results of the last 45 years have been first announced at this conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference website: http://www.math.uttyler.edu/sgraves/STDC2011/Welcome.html</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 45th Annual Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference was held March 17, 18, 19, 2011 in the Ratliff Engineering and Science Complex on the campus of the University of Texas at Tyler.  The conference was supported by NSF grant DMS 1055082.  There were 212 registered participants representing eighteen countries around the world.  This conference series has been among the longest running and most  successful conferences in mathematics.   Once again this year, the  leading topologists from around the world gathered to share the latest  results in the field and to encourage and train the next generation of  researchers by supporting the large number of graduate students who  attended the conference.  Structural Overview:  The conference was organized by Conference Chair Sheldon Davis, Conference Secretary Lori Wages, both from University of Texas at Tyler, and by five special session organizing committees.  They were arranged by discipline as follows:  Continuum Theory   Gerardo Acosta (Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico), chair  Van Nall (University of Richmond)   Thelma West (University of Louisiana, Lafayette)  Dynamical Systems   John Mayer (University of Alabama at Birmingham), chair   Daniel Look (St. Lawrence University)   Brian Raines (Baylor University)  Geometric Group Theory   Noel Brady (University of Oklahoma), chair   Ross Geoghegan (Binghamton University, SUNY)  Kim Ruane (Tufts University)   Geometric Topology   Steve Ferry (Rutgers University), chair   NIkolay Brodskiy (University of Tennessee)   Gerard Venema (Calvin College)   Set-theoretic Topology   Alan Dow (University of North Carolina, Charlotte), chair   Michael Hrusak (Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico)   Todd Eisworth (Ohio University)   Six speakers were invited to give 50 minute plenary talks, twelve speakers were invited to give 35 minute semi-plenary talks, and each special session was allotted twenty-four spots in parallel sessions for contributed talks of twenty minutes duration.  The invited speakers were divided roughly equally among the special session areas with special interest in speakers who would appeal to more than one discipline.  There was a bit of overflow in the contributed talk sessions, and that was accommodated by running a sixth session at times.  The conference schedule and abstracts booklet is attached.  The invited speakers were as follows:  Plenary Speakers (50 minute talks)  Robert Devaney, Boston University,      dynamical systems David Gabai, Princeton University,      geometric topology Charles Hagopian, California State      University Sacramento, continuum theory Wayne Lewis, Texas Tech University,      continuum theory Stevo Todorcevic, University of Toronto,      set-theoretic topology Robert Young, Courant Institute at New      York University, geometric group theory   Semi-plenary Speakers (35 minute talks)  James Fowler, Ohio State University,      geometric topology K. P. Hart, Technical University Delft,      set-theoretic topology Shelly Harvey, Rice University,      geometric topology Sergio Macias, Universidad Nacional      Aut&oacute;noma de M&eacute;xico, continuum theory David Milovich, Texas A&amp;M      International, set-theoretic topology Michael Misiurewicz, Indiana University      Purdue University - Indianapolis, dynamical systems Justin Moore, Cornell University,      geometric group theory Denis Osin, Vanderbilt University,      geometric group theory Martin Scharlemann, University of      California Santa Barbara geometric topology Paul Szeptycki, York University,      set-theoretic topology Murat Tuncali, Nipissing University,      continuum theory Mariusz Urbanski, University of North      Texas, dynamical systems      The continuum theory session was dedicated to Wayne Lewis on the occasion of his sixtieth birthday and in recognition of his contributions and long service to the field of continuum theory.
