<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program, Prof. Kim Williams and her group at the Colorado School of Mines seek increased understanding of the relationship between thermal diffusion and analyte-solvent parameters in the context of thermal field-flow fractionation (ThFFF), with aims of developing methods that address new measurement challenges posed by nanoscale materials.  Extensive systematic studies with different polymer chemistries and architectures (linear chains, combs, dendrimers, stars, and bottle brushes) and nanoparticles functionalized with these polymers are included, as are new ThFFF channel designs that can significantly reduce analysis times and energy consumption while providing a potential route to semipreparative scale separations. The ability to collect larger amounts of well defined narrow dispersity polymers and nanoparticles will be a boon to unraveling property-function relationships.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activities will advance knowledge and understanding within analytical chemistry and across different fields. Through the development of novel analytical methods for nanoscale materials, this project can impact diverse areas such as separations, synthesis of new materials, and renewable energy.  The ability to monitor reactions will provide insight into synthesis pathways and facilitate reaction optimization for targeted products. Understanding the relative role of specific nanomaterials properties in controlling end properties (e.g., the influence of nanoparticle size and surface chemistry on photoconversion efficiencies) will facilitate the design of novel nanostructures for solar cells. The program includes an outreach component geared towards K-12 science education in two Denver school districts with high numbers of minority and disadvantaged students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Polymers and nanoparticles are prevalent in a multitude of consumer products including food, clothing, solar cells, and drug delivery systems.  Novel chemistries, architectures, and hybrids are continuously introduced to yield new products with an array of different desired properties.  These nanoscale materials represent a new frontier in analytical chemistry, particularly, in the area of separations.   Polymer synthesis can lead to a distribution of molecular weights, chemical composition distribution, and multiple chain architectures.  The average values and distributions of these parameters can significantly impact the mechanical and physical properties of the resultant polymers. Similarly, synthesized nanoparticles have size (and shape) distributions.  Their surfaces are often modified with different chemistries, but the modifications add further heterogeneity in the form of distributions in surface coverage and functionality.  These distributions in molecular weight, size, shape, composition, architecture, etc. can yield remarkably different properties and end product performances. Analytical techniques that measure only the average values do not provide sufficient information to understand why batch-to-batch variations occur.  Often, the culprit is the presence of low amounts of an undesired component which does not significantly affect the average value. Separation techniques are crucial to the analysis of polymers and nanoparticles as each æindividualÆ component is measured and a true distribution is reported.     Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) is the workhorse technique for separating polymers.  As the name implies, SEC separates according to size.  Innovative separation techniques are needed to meet the analytical demands described above. This NSF grant is focused on the development of thermal field-flow fractionation (ThFFF) for separating and analyzing polymers and nanoparticles distributions.  The major outcomes of this funded project are:  1)      We have demonstrated that ThFFF can separate polymers according to their composition and composition distributions can be obtained.  Light scattering and UV detectors monitored the elution of separated components as each eluted from the ThFFF channel and provided an independent measurement of molecular weights and sizes. An example commercial polymer consisting of three different chemistries was shown to have a different composition than stated by the manufacturers and low amounts of a polymer contaminant were found.    2)      Our group has shown that ThFFF can be used to identify different polymer architectures &ndash; linear, star, and bottlebrush.  Most importantly, information about the number of chain ends can be obtained without the need for standards (a requirement for existing analytical methods such as SEC, light scattering, and viscometry).  3)      Through experimental determination of thermal diffusion coefficients, our group has advanced understanding of polymer motion in a temperature gradient.  Most of the research in this field of thermophoresis is of a theoretical nature. The ability to make measurements has allowed us to examine, validate, and modify proposed theories.  4)      Our work with gold nanorods provides experimental evidence (confirming existing theories) that the effective radius of gold nanorods does indeed affect the maximum wavelength of the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance, albeit to a lesser magnitude than aspect ratio.  This work was possible because of the FFF separation and easy collection of nanoparticles with different dimensions.  Gold nanorods have many important uses that include bioimaging and biosensing and the wavelengths that they absorb and emit light are important.  5)      In collaboration with the NSF Renewable Energy MRSEC at Colorado School of Mines, we developed a size-based FFF separation for silicon quantum dots that also removed excess reactants.  The photoluminescent properties of the different size...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
