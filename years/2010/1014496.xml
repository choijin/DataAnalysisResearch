<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The suite of cubozoan jellyfish species known to cause æIrukandjiÆ syndrome, have historically been confined to tropical regions and are particularly prolific in northern Australia.  Ocean warming, however, may enable these jellyfish to expand their range southwards within the next few decades, potentially impacting the lucrative tourism markets of southeast Queensland.   Cubozoan jellyfish have balance organs called statocysts which contain calcified structures called statoliths.  Increased acidity may affect the development of statoliths and subsequent functioning of the statocysts, which may impair the animalsÆ ability to orientate (Richardson and Gibbons 2008). Ocean pH has decreased by 0.1 compared to pre-industrial values and is predicted to decrease by 0.3-0.4 by 2100 and up to 1 over the next 200-300 years (Orr et al. 2005).  A decrease of 0.3-0.4 pH units equates to an increase in H+ of 150% and could potentially affect abundance and also have very deleterious effects on statolith formation and functioning.   Very little is known about the factors promoting cubozoan jellyfish abundance and distribution in tropical waters and information on the early life stages and their response to varying environmental conditions is lacking.  The major objective of this project was to assess how irukandji jellyfish may respond to changing ocean conditions.  Specifically, to test the effects of temperature, acidity and the interaction of temperature and acidity on the population dynamics of polyps of the cubozoan Alatina nr mordens, a species of jellyfish that occurs in Australia and Hawaii.  In order to test the effects of increased ocean temperatures and acidification on polyps of the cubozoan Alatina nr mordens, I conducted a 27-day aquarium-based manipulative laboratory experiment during the winter of 2010.  For the duration of the experiment, pH and temperatures of the treatments remained fairly constant and within target levels.  Target pH treatment levels of 7.9, 7.8 and 7.6 were chosen to correspond to approximate current and predicted near-future levels of 0.3 - 0.5 below the current ocean pH conditions of approximately 8.0.  Temperature treatments were chosen to mimic winter conditions in the tropical waters off northern Queensland of approximately 25.0 oC, as well as warmed conditions of 27.0 oC and 29.0 oC that are assumed to not to be typically experienced by the polyps but could be under warming scenarios.  Mortality rates were high in the majority of treatments with a total of 60.7 % mortality of original polyps across all treatment replicates.  This mortality was not able to be attributed to either factor (pH, temperature) or the combination of factors.  Reproduction was also variable  among the treatments and again showed no pattern due to pH, temperature or the combination of these factors on either the percent of originals that reproduced or the total number of reproduction events by the original polyps and offspring on a single plate.  While the data from the experiment did not provide insight into the effects of ocean warming and acidification on the polyp stage of Alatina nr mordens, the experiment did prove to be useful information on the best practices for care and handling of these sensitive organisms in the laboratory.  Irukandji jellyfish are an understudied organisms and to date there have been very few laboratory experiments with these organisms.  This information is not only relevant to ecologists working to answer basic ecological questions about the species but may also be relevant to researchers in the biomedical field who may be keeping irukandji specimens while working on remedies for their potentially lethal sting.  Repetition of the study with new handling protocols may serve to answer the initial question of the effect of ocean warming and acidification on the polyp stage of irukandji jellyfish.  Information from conclusive results will be useful to develop management strategies to protect swimm...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
