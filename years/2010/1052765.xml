<AbstractNarration>Learning to hear novel speech sounds is one of the major challenges of mastering a second language (L2). Previous work using intensive auditory training has helped learners perceive challenging and unfamiliar speech sounds but no method to date has consistently brought learners to native levels. This research project by Yukari Hirata and Spencer Kelly at Colgate University attempts to improve upon previous methods by coupling auditory instruction with visual and motor information conveyed though hand gestures. Specifically, Hirata and Kelly will explore how observing and producing different types of gestures helps native English speakers learn novel speech sounds in Japanese. Hirata and Kelly will investigate this question using behavioral and brain measures and will explore whether mastering these novel speech sounds also leads to better L2 vocabulary learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the increasing contact among people all over the world, developing effective and efficient strategies for L2 teaching is more important than ever. The project also allows for integration of research into the educational experience of undergraduate students at a primarily undergraduate institution, exposing them to the excitement of scientific inquiry. Finally, strengthening on-campus laboratory facilities (that can be used by several disciplines) for the behavioral and neural investigation of foreign language learning will enrich and diversify undergraduate science education.</AbstractNarration>

Specifically, our research examined whether observing and producing different types of hand gesture affect L2 auditory perception, and whether strengthening auditory and phonological representations of an L2 strengthen semantic representations. Length of vowels is phonemic in Japanese, and native English speakers are known to have difficulty auditorily distinguishing these phonemic contrasts. In our study, eighty-eight native English speakers took part in one of four types of video instruction on Japanese vocabulary items with vowel length contrasts. In the videos, the verbal presentation was accompanied by two types of hand movements conveying different phonological rhythm information (i.e., familiar versus novel). In addition, participants either passively observed the gestures in the videos or actively imitated them while learning the L2 word meanings.
