<AbstractNarration>This project studies time-frequency analysis as it first appeared in the nineteen sixties with Carleson's seminal work on almost everywhere convergence of Fourier series. About fifteen years ago, Carleson's techniques were used to establish estimates for the bilinear Hilbert transform which initiated a rapid development of time-frequency analysis. The research of this project elaborates on important aspects of this theory in small dimensions greater than one with relevance to other areas of analysis. The bilinear Hilbert transform in two dimensions relates to a long standing open problem in ergodic theory about almost everywhere convergence of ergodic averages for two commuting transformations. Time-frequency analysis in two dimensions is also relevant to twin conjectures by Stein and Zygmund on Hilbert transform and differentiation along vector fields in two dimensions. Finally, a non-linear variant of Fourier analysis on low dimensional Lie groups, which relates to many branches of mathematics such as scattering theory, gives rise to interesting fundmental questions. Some of them are nonlinear variants of time frequency analysis in small dimensions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research of this project has several connections to mathematical physics, which may lead to applications. It studies the mathematical foundations of scattering of particles along long range potentials. It also studies the foundations of analysis along vector fields, which present the mathematical framework of fluid dynamics. Some of the analysis of this project in two dimensions may be interpreted as a particular interplay of two random processes, such as can be found in financial mathematics. This project will help continue an active research and training group in harmonic analysis at UCLA, that has attracted a number of excellent young mathematicians and has helped maintain the workforce in mathematics. A further educational component of this project is to continue a series of very successful summer schools for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in analysis from different universities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PI has conducted research in the areas proposed in the project resulting in nine publications with various coauthors. These publications  were posted publically on the preprint server arxiv.org and additionally submitted to mathematical journals for dissemination. The results were also disseminated at various international conferences.  Through these publications, significant advances of our understanding of time frequency analysis in  small dimensions has been achieved.  A new framework for the theory called "outer Lp theory"  was developed with a former PhD student of the PI. This theory aided in the resolution of several open questions. This theory has the potential to have further impact in a broader array of mathematical fields. Another significant research advance during the funding period was the further development of the theory of "entangled operators" which had been introduced by a PhD student of the PI just prior to the beginning of the funding period.  During each year of the project, the PI has coorganized a summer school in various areas related to the core area of the project. Each summer school  was partially funded by the project and attended by  approximately eighteen PhD students or postdoctoral fellows.  The PI has contributed to the pipeline of the mathematical workforce by advising 6 PhD students during the funding period, of which one has graduated during the funding period and one has graduated shortly after the funding period.
