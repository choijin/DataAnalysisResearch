<AbstractNarration>The goal of the project supported by this award is to create new computer programs to calculate the interactions and properties of systems of three nucleons (atomic number A=3) using the most general form of interactions allowed by the physical laws of nature.  These new computer programs will be made publicly available, thereby allowing other researchers to explore different parameters of the interaction or different interactions without the need to write the intricate computer programs needed to explore a three-nucleon system.  A main motivation for this study is to understand the complex interactions between protons and neutrons in the nucleus; however the computational techniques used can also be applied to other areas of physics where three-body interactions are present, such as atomic physics (research with cold atoms) and particle physics (quark interactions inside the proton).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The method of predicting the behavior of three or more interacting bodies is a long-standing problem in theoretical physics. While the interactions of two particles are fairly easy to calculate, the so-called three-body problem is much more difficult to solve.  A method attributed to Faddeev is now widely used, but the implementation of the Faddeev equations requires long and involved calculations that are best suited for powerful computers. The traditional approach to calculating the Faddeev equations uses a mathematical technique called partial-wave expansion.  However, as the energy increases in the three-body system, this mathematical technique becomes inefficient.  The current project utilizes a novel mathematical approach of taking spin traces, which allows the three-body problem to be solved at much higher energies, and generally increases the flexibility of implementing a wider class of inter-particle forces.  Hence, this project will provide a better theoretical framework for the investigation of the three-body problem than is presently feasible.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Though Einstein's theory of special relativity was formulated over 100 years ago, there are still unsolved issues when considering systems that contain more than two particles, since in such a system pairs can be influenced by the presence and motion of other particles. The simplest system for which the role of the force between a pair of nucleons (neutron or protons) in the presence of another nucleon can be quantitatively investigated is the three nucleon system. Since the three-nucleon problem can be numerically solved with controlled errors, it provides an ideal theoretical laboratory for investigating the effects of special relativity in a few-nucleon environment.  Over the years, computational advances have extended the range of energies for which the three-nucleon problem can be (numerically) solved exactly.  However, including the effects of special relativity in a quantum mechanical description of the three-body problem is remains a challenge.  Integrating new theoretical and computational capabilities to understand relativistic effects in the three-nucleon system was one of the goals of this project.  Our calculations of the bound state of three nucleons (e.g. Helium-3) resulted in a detailed understanding of the of the role of relativistic effects and the first explicit comparison between non-relativistic and relativistic wave functions, which describe the velocity distribution between a nucleon pair and the spectator nucleon.  We identified four different types of relativistic corrections and show that those must all be treated consistently in order to get an accurate determination of the effects of relativity.  Accurate relativistic wave functions for Helium-3 and Tritium nuclei will be needed as input to compute the distribution of charge and currents in these nuclei, which will be measured in the MARATHON experiment, which is an approved experiment for the 12-GeV upgrade Jefferson National Laboratory.  The work carried out within this project also paves the way for extending the the three-nucleon bound-state calculations to treat high-energy collisions of two and three nucleon systems. Collisions of a proton with a Deuterium target at moderately high energies (around 250 MeV) indicates that our current understanding of the nuclear forces between two and three-nucleons is insufficient and some new short-distance physics may come into play.  For such considerations it is crucial to be able to carry out calculations that treat relativistic effects consistently.  While three-body models are an important tool to investigate questions relevant what governs the to the underlying physics of the system, the numerical codes to carry out realistic and precise three-body calculations require a significant development and testing effort. Thus the group of researchers using such important tools is relatively small. In order to make our codes useful to a wider community, we use a standard representation of the force between the constituent particles in terms of operators, so that the different forces can be substituted, once the new force has been cast into the standard form. Having the backbone of suite of codes available may allow educating and training of young scientists in applying advanced computational techniques in their research.
