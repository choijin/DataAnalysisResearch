<AbstractNarration>The project addresses the qualitative properties of solutions to the Navier-Stokes, Euler, primitive, and other important equations in fluid dynamics. The spatial and temporal behavior of solutions, such as the size of solutions, spatial and temporal complexity, quantitative unique continuation, analytic and Gevrey regularity, and long time asymptotics, will be studied. The complex systems of equations involving coupling of the Navier-Stokes equations with elasticity and other equations will also be considered with emphasis on existence, uniqueness, regularity, and long time behavior of solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Navier-Stokes and Euler equations are principal models for a fluid motion. The understanding of behavior of the solutions is of fundamental importance in engineering, meteorology, medicine, and oceanography. The project will address qualitative properties of solutions with special emphasis on the properties of fine structures in the flow including vortices and oscillations. The project will also address the relationship between large and small scale motion of fluids. The research will develop tools for better understanding of a turbulent fluid flow and will aim at finding relations between theory and numerical simulations.</AbstractNarration>

The results address the spatial and temporal complexity of solutions, unique continuation, and analyticity.  In connection with the spatial and temporal behavior of solutions, the PI and Reis provided a complete asymptotic expansion of solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, extending accuracy of previous asymptotics due to Fujigaki and Miyakawa.  In regard to the analyticity and Gevrey regularity of solutions of the Euler equations, the results of the PI and V. Vicol give thebehavior of the analyticity domain of solutions for positive time. In particular, the inverse of the analyticity radius increases at most at a double exponential rate.  The PI, Tuffaha, and Ziane established low regularity existence results for the fluid-structure system of equation modelling an interaction of an elastic structure and a fluid. PI and Tuffaha provided existence results for the model when the interface is evolves with time.  Other results include existence of solutuions to hydrostatic Euler equation in analytic spaces, with fixed or in evolving domain, sharp trace regularity, existence for the compressible fluid-structure model, and the local existence for the free boundary Euler system.   The results of the project were published in the Mathematics journals publishing works in the area of PDEs. They were deseminated on the national and international conferences and during visits at various universities.  Four Ph.D. students Mihaela Ignatova, Ednei Reis, Yuan Pei, and Vlad Vicol, have obtained Ph.D.'s by results obtained while supported by the project.
