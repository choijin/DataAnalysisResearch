<AbstractNarration>The goal of this Targeted Infusion project is to implement an integrative B.S. degree program in Biochemistry within the Department of Chemistry. The curriculum for this program was approved by the University Faculty in the spring of 2009. The decision to offer a B.S. in Biochemistry was made following several years of feedback from our chemistry graduates that pointed to the need for an undergraduate curriculum that allows more exposure and experience in biology. As is the case with many Chemistry programs, the Chemistry program at Hampton is designed along the traditional single discipline mentality, allowing for very limited opportunity for interdisciplinary cross-fertilization. Only two entry level biology courses (introduction to Biology I&amp;II) are required for our chemistry majors. Program integration is becoming increasingly necessary in the preparation of future scientists. With the implementation of this program, the Department of Chemistry will offer two baccalaureate degrees: the traditional B.S. degree in Chemistry, and a B.S. degree in Biochemistry. Both degree programs meet the American Chemical Society certification requirements.</AbstractNarration>

Urasa  Awardee: Hampton University  Award Number: 1036306  Program Officer Name: Claudia Rankins    Background  The Department of Chemistry at Hampton University is committed to providing an environment and educational experiences that allow students to acquire knowledge, skills, and abilities for future careers in research, education, industry, and health-related professions. Over 80% of our chemistry graduates pursue postgraduate training at renowned research institutions, including Johns Hopkins, Duke, U.N.C.

The laboratory component encompasses state-of-the-art equipment and materials to support a modern biochemistry curriculum.  Outcome   The establishment of the Biochemistry program did not only respond to the curriculum improvement suggestions mentioned  above, but it was also meant to provide an expanded field of career options for chemistry and other science students.

Both degrees are certified by the American Chemical Society. The name of the department was changed to "The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry" to highlight the identities of the two degree offerings.  Impact  This program places Hampton University in a rather unique position in three respects: (1) we are among very few institutions that offer an undergraduate degree in Biochemistry; only three other HBCUs offer...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
