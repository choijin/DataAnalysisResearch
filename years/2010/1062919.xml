<AbstractNarration>The I-MIRTHE REU Site program, affiliated with the NSF Engineering Research Center MIRTHE, trains students in interdisciplinary, cross-institutional, original research in a broadly cast network of research fields under the unifying umbrella of mid-infrared sensor systems research, development, and applications. The program provides students with a cutting-edge educational and research experience that: (1) leads students to independent, original research that is interdisciplinary in nature and has high potential for benefits for society, (2) allows students to experience first-hand the value of collaborative research and teaches the means of effective research communication, (3) encourages and enables the participants to form lasting and broadly cast professional networks with senior students, post-docs, and faculty mentors, (4) fosters diversity in the student population, and (5) provides students who have otherwise limited access to genuine research opportunities with new and potentially career-changing experiences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program provides scientific training for a diverse and globally competitive work force and it educates and mentors early career students to become leaders in research and development in fields of importance to society. The program actively recruits underrepresented minorities into the STEM fields, and provides students who have limited access to research resources with opportunities to conduct original research with the leaders in the field and at state-of-the-art facilities. The I-MIRTHE REU inspires a new generation of engineering professionals to enter and remain in the STEM fields and conduct groundbreaking research and development to the benefit of society.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes Report:  REU Site Interdisciplinary Research Experience for Undergraduates in Mid-InfraRed Technologies for Health and the Environment (I-MIRTHE REU)  The I-MIRTHE REU program, a REU Site award for the NSF Engineering Research Center for Mid-InfraRed Technologies for Health and the Environment (MIRTHE), carried out during the summers 2011 &ndash; 2014, is an intensely cross-disciplinary and cross-institutional summer research program that trained students in material science, device and systems engineering, laser spectroscopy, optical trace gas sensing, and mid-infrared applications in medical diagnostics and the environment. In addition to carrying out cutting-edge research projects, the students experienced the value of collaborative research, i.e. "that the whole can be more than the sum of its parts", and practiced effective communication methods by interacting and meeting with their peers at all six MIRTHE research universities, virtually through the web and in person at the week-long MIRTHE Summer Workshop, held at the end of each summerÆs program.  Activities and Findings  The 2011-2014 I-MIRTHE REU Site program was conducted as a 9-week intensive summer research experience, from early June to early August each year.  The I-MIRTHE REU students conducted original research and were directly embedded into the respective facultyÆs research group.  The students interacted with each other, on a daily basis within each location, and on a weekly basis across locations &ndash; through in person meetings and web-conferences, respectively.  These web-conferences included lectures by faculty on MIRTHE related topics as well as short presentations by the students to update each other on their individual summer research projects.  During the 9th week, the annual week-long MIRTHE Summer Workshop was held and the I-MIRTHE REU students gave presentations about their work &ndash; short oral "flash-presentations", followed by extensive poster presentations with fellow students, faculty, and industry collaborators in attendance.   Over this award period, 46 individual undergraduate students participated in the programs at the six MIRTHE locations (Princeton University, Rice University, Johns Hopkins University, Texas A&amp;M University, the City College of New York and the University of Maryland Baltimore County), under the guidance of 20 MIRTHE faculty; 6 students participated in two summers, bringing the total number of internships for this project to 52.   The students were recruited through fliers, which were sent to several hundred academic institutions across the U.S; the official MIRTHE website; through targeted advertising at professional and society conferences (McNair, NSBE, SACNAS, and SWE), as well as partnering LSAMP programs; by direct faculty-to-student recruiting; and by word-of-mouth. The program recruited underrepresented minorities into the STEM fields, and provided students with otherwise limited access to research resources with opportunities to conduct original research with the leaders in the field and at state-of-the-art facilities.  The I-MIRTHE REU inspired a new generation of engineering professionals to enter and remain in the STEM fields and conduct groundbreaking research and development to the benefit of society.
