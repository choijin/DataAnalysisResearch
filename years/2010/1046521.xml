<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project focused on real-time automated data mining of medical videos.  These videos are of increasing importance, particularly in applications such as real-time decision making based on video recordings of networks of blood vessels. The proposed research addresses the real-time knowledge discovery from large volumes of complex video signals, for the generation of predictive models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successfully deployed, the technology enabled by this effort will extend an area of emerging clinical significance. The effort proposes to specialize a tool towards assessment of tissue oxygenation using real-time automated processing of microcirculation videos. The real-time and fully automated nature of image processing and machine learning methods proposed by this project, places this technology in a strong position in the market, both as a standalone system and as a software package included with imaging hardware.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merits  The main novelties achieved in this project include the followings:  1)    Computational methods were designed to analyze microcirculation videosthrough a fully automated process. Unlike all existing systemsthat require experts to continuously edit and correct the output of the algorithm/software at each step, the resulting performs all steps in a fully automated way without the need for any human supervision. Moreover, since the computational methods (e.g. machine learning algorithms) were trained using the expertise of multiple (more than 5) highly trained experts, as opposed of only one individual assessing a video, the assessment made by our system is far less subjective.  A specificoutcome of the project was the design of computational methods to apply the capabilities of machine learning to adaptively adjust the settings and parameters of the segmentation methods based on the local statistics on the grey levels.

The adaptive machine learning adjustment of parameters is a capability that can potentially improve the quality of segmentation in many medical and non-medical image and video processing applications.  2)      Another outcome was that all computational methods are done in near-real-time as they were implemented using parallel-processing which resulted in near-real-time performance.

Considering this trend, the timing advantage of our method, achieved in Phase I, is even more significant as it can generate its results for 3-spot tests within 30 seconds as opposed to 3 hours of "man+machine" in the current software tools.     Broader Impact  The algorithms developed in this study for vessel segmentation can be directly applied to a wide range of applications in biomedical image processing such as retinal image processing and Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA). The resulting algorithm, such as the segmentation methods can be applied in many non-medical applications as we...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
