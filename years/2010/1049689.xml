<AbstractNarration>With this collaborative RUI award, the Chemistry of Life Processes program is funding the research team of Professors Emily Fogle, Lori Robins and Kristen Meisenheimer, under the leadership of Professor John Marlier, all of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, to study the mechanism of thioester hydrolysis.   Thioesters are important intermediates in biological catalysis from fatty acid synthesis, to polyketide synthase condensations to intein self-slicing and its counterpart in modern chemical native chemical ligation.  This proposal seeks to better understand the mechanism by which biologically relevant thioesters undergo hydrolysis, both in solution and in an enzyme active site.  The principal tool to be employed is that of kinetic isotope effects (KIEs). Indeed, this proposal will help to bolster a standing departmental effort at Cal Poly SLO to build a thematic undergraduate research program that specializes in the techniques of KIEs to study mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The faculty team is expected to provide one-on-one training to undergraduates in modern physical organic chemistry with a focus on a biologically relevant problem.   The Cal Poly team will strive to broaden participation in chemistry through the integration of women and members of traditionally underrepresented groups into the research enterprise.  In the longer term, it is hoped that fundamental insights on the mechanism of thioester cleavage and condensation reactions will be obtained through these studies.</AbstractNarration>

Study of reaction mechanisms allows chemists to gain a basic understanding of short-lived, reactive intermediate chemical species that form during a reaction. In addition to increasing our basic understanding of chemical reactions, the study of reaction mechanisms often allows chemists to optimize reaction conditions. The study of enzyme-catalyzed reaction mechanisms is particularly important in biology because some studies of enzyme mechanisms have resulted in drug development. An example of a mechanism with reactive intermediates is shown in Image 2.     The first type of experiment in our project followed how fast a water molecule containing a heavy isotope of oxygen (18O) exchanged into the reactant (FTC) compared to how fast the product formed. These PIX experiments can offer evidence for the existence of certain symmetric reactive intermediates in the mechanism and can also indicate how fast these intermediates form the product versus how fast they return to the reactant. An example of such a symmetrical intermediate (shown in brackets) is given in Image 3.     In all reaction conditions studied PIX experiments determined that the symmetrical intermediates formed product much faster than they returned to a reactant containing an 18O label. Therefore, breaking the C&mdash;S bond is very rapid relative to the other steps in the mechanism. Unfortunately the PIX results for the enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis are more difficult to interpret due to an inherent property of enzymes.     The second type of experiment was KIEs.

Under alkaline conditions the highest energy point is also formation of the first intermediate but the results argue for more fully formed/broken bonds making this a late transition state.     BChE-catalyzed hydrolysis has two distinct steps: acylation and de-acylation. This mechanism is shown in Image 5. Most of our KIE results are limited to studying only the acylation step. These results indicate that formation of the fi...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
