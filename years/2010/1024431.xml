<AbstractNarration>SES-1024539&lt;br/&gt;PI: Jennifer L. Glass&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Iowa&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-1024431&lt;br/&gt;PI: Robin W. Simon&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Wake Forest University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this research are twofold: (1) to document cross-national variation in the effect of parenthood on well-being in post-industrial developed economies, and (2) to determine whether cross-national variation in the effect of parenthood on well-being can be explained by variation in the quality and quantity of welfare state support for parenthood. This research will use the 2005 World Values Surveys from a sample of 21 OCED countries to determine the impact of parenthood on several key indicators of adult well-being, including life satisfaction, general happiness, mastery, fatalism, and self-rated health. The investigators hypothesize that those countries with greater public support for parenting will show less negative effects of parenthood on adult well-being than other countries with less support. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;By investigating the role of public policies and institutional supports for parenting on parents? psychological well-being, this research can help identify those practices that minimize the child penalty on adult well-being, and most strongly affect the lived experience of parents.</AbstractNarration>
