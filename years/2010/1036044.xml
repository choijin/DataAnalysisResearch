<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to facilitate a conference (5/17-19/2010) between a representative delegation of science center personnel led by the Association of Science-Technology Centers (ASTC) and  three Chinese organizations (CTSM, BSTCC, BSTEC) on the merits of informal science education for STEM education of the public and youth. [The three Chinese organizations are: China Science and Technology Museum (CSTM); Beijing Science and Technology Consulting Center (BSTCC), and Beijing Science and Technology Exchange Center with Foreign Countries (BSTEC).] The three-day conference in Beijing, China will include 16 US participants. Presentations from both sides will be made followed by discussions providing a basis for comparisons and contrasts. The total number of participants at the conference is estimated to be 200.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;China has recently decided to put considerable effort into informal science education, suggesting that science learning begins with "hands on" activities. The basis for this conclusion is derived from significant findings of research on cognitive aspects of childhood education. Since the US has considerable interest in this subject as well, this conference is timely. China is providing housing, meals and in-country transportation ($130,000) while NSF is providing US participants with airfare to China and logistical expenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A detailed final report from the US participants will provide a mechanism for dissemination of the conference results.</AbstractNarration>

Science center directors heard presentations on these topics from colleagues based in both the U.S. and China, with one day dedicated to each question.On the third and final day of the forum, participants had the opportunity to put the ideas developed during days one and two into practice during focused workshops.

Plans for future cooperation were also generated on an individual level, with a number of the US and Chinese participants expressing interest in forming partnerships on projects discussed during the forum.
