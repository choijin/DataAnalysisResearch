<AbstractNarration>The proposal "Mathematics for microscopy and cell biology," will allow the investigator to perform hands-on microscopy experiments on bacterial aggregation and growth and on epithelial cell migration. Analysis of images of these processes will help guide future mathematical modeling efforts into how bacteria accumulate near surfaces and how epithelial cells close wounds. Imaging and image analysis are critical steps needed for gaining mechanistic insight into how biofilm-mediated bacterial infections and wound healing occur. These are important problems in biomedicine and bioengineering which can be better addressed with the proposed quantitative and systematic experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will also develop an applied mathematics course based on the different types of microscopy typically used in modern cell biology. The course will be intended for physicists and mathematicians and review the fundamental optics and chemical excitation occurring in modern microscopy.&lt;br/&gt;The investigator also plans to write a peer-reviewed journal review article on modern microscopy, emphasizing its theoretical aspects.</AbstractNarration>
