<AbstractNarration>OBJECTIVE.  This  effort includes synergistic work crucial to the development of future terahertz (THz, 1012 Hz) nano-size circuits, employing Metallic Single-Wall Carbon Nanotubes (SWCNTs) ¡V unique 1D  nanoscale materials:  I) We will enhance the perfomance we have demonstrated for SWCNTs  as direct detectors at THz frequencies and demonstrate these as novel heterodyne detectors that can constitute sensitive elements for THz focal plane arrays (FPAs) that require only moderate cooling (?î 100 K);  II) Development of compact THz sources in which heated CNTs produce broadband THz radiation; III) Integration of the detectors and sources into THz integrated circuits. We will further deepen our understanding of CNT devices at THz through comprehensive time-dependent quantum simulations that characterize plasmonic resonances, AC transport  and contact coupling in a variety of CNT configurations &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT. Unique measurements will test theories of how electromagnetic waves interact with and couple to electrons in CNTs at THz frequencies, including slowly propagating plasmons and resonances due to such plasmons, while also obtaining values for small bandgaps. The time-dependent quantum simulations will utilize several unique approaches and a novel eigenvalue solver (¡§FEAST¡¨) developed by the Co-PI. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACT.  The results will provide the community a broad range of new understanding of the basic properties of 1-D conductors and their contacts at very high frequencies, while involving students at all levels. The work can potentially benefit society at large, especially in terms of enabling very compact THz cancer imagers, imagers for security applications, and a new paradigm for designing THz integrated circuits. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
