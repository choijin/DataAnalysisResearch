<AbstractNarration>Engineered networks usually operate at their capacity limits. The ability for a complex engineered network to maintain its robustness and functionality in the presence of attacks and/or failures is an outstanding issue in science and engineering with tremendous implications to society and homeland defense. The aims of the exploratory research are to develop a mathematical theory to understand the critical dynamics of complex engineered networks and to articulate effective control strategies for building more efficient, secure, robust, and optimally functional networked systems. In particular, the interplay among the functionality, network evolution, robustness and security will be investigated. Network capacity will be defined based on laws of physical flows and the impact of network's evolution toward the capacity limit on its structure and function will be explored, leading to effective control strategies. Results from the exploratory research will form the base for a more comprehensive program of interdisciplinary study on complex networks at ASU with significant applications in natural sciences, engineering, social science, economy, and defense.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on fundamental issues concerning the functionality, structure, security and dynamics of complex networks, enabling identification of the vulnerabilities of real-world engineered networks, which can be used either for the protection of infrastructural networks or for the destruction of pathological and adversarial networks. The research will also provide guidance for designing more robust engineered networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research requires tools from statistical and nonlinear physics, mathematics, control and industrial engineering, and scientific computing. Besides providing a solid mathematical foundation for the problem of network robustness and security, the work will be a demonstration of how interdisciplinary approach can lead to solutions to realistic problems of significant societal concern, due to the ubiquity and importance of complex engineered networks to the modern infrastructure of the US. The research will also help create an exciting interdisciplinary environment for graduate and undergraduate students from various disciplines of science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

Complex networks, composed of individual nodes and links among them, are mathematical and physical framework structures that distill and describe the essence and salient features of many complex interacting systems in nature and society. Neuronal networks in the human brain, protein networks in biological cells, and collaboration networks of scientists are some of the significant and interesting examples of complex networks. Compressive sensing is a technique recently developed in applied mathematics and engineering signal processing to reconstruct a full picture and dynamics of the underlying system based only on a sparse amount of data.

Inferring hidden nodes in complex network based on time series. In many disciplines of science and engineering, detecting hidden objects, objects that cannot be observed from the external world, is an extremely challenging but important problem. The NSF support enabled us to develop a completely data-driven, compressive-sensing based method to detect hidden nodes in complex networks in the presence of local noise sources.  By using the idea of differential signal, we demonstrated for a large number of model and real networks that, even when some nodes in the network are driven by strong noise, insofar as at least two of the neighboring nodes of the hidden node are subject to weak background noise only, unequivocal identification of the hidden node can be achieved.  3. Understanding cascading breakdown in social and economical systems. A hallmark of a modern economical recession is the collapse and bankruptcy of a large number of financial institutions and corporations on a large scale. The manner by which the failures occur may be described as a cascading process, where the initial collapse of one or a few institutions, for example, triggered the failures of many others. While sophisticated economical and social models can conceivably be constructed to describe the process of cascading collapses, an issue of significant interest is whether there is a ``minimal'' model that can capture the major generic ingredients of the process, which are independent of the system details.
