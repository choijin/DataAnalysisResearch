<AbstractNarration>Engineering - Other (59)&lt;br/&gt;This project is expanding an early CCLI project that developed a prototype desktop learning module (DLM) that could be used for experimentation and demonstration of basic concepts in fluid mechanics and heat transfer. The DLM is a desktop apparatus with multiple, easily removable cartridges that can be reconfigured to perform a variety of experiments.  Studies have found that usage of the DLM has led to positive and statistically significant impacts on students' critical thinking skills and has also improved student scores on the Miller concept inventory.  In this expansion effort, the DLM is being re-engineered to improve its functionality and serviceability. Additional cartridges are being built to support experiments in chemical, civil, electrical, and biomedical engineering.  The project is also developing accompanying course and laboratory materials that incorporate modern pedagogical techniques.  The new DLM and cartridges are being used in classes at five different institutions, ranging from a two-year college to a research intensive university.  The impact of the DLM on student learning is being rigorously studied across all five institutions.  The project is working with industry partners to move the DLM from the prototype stage to the commercial product stage.  The results of the project are being disseminated through conference and journal publications and dedicated faculty development workshops at the ASEE Chemical Engineering Summer School.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Professors and students at Washington State University (WSU) spearheaded this project where the intellectual merit outcomes are centered on how to develop miniature industrial equipment we call Desktop Learning Modules or DLMs and on the impact when using them in the classroom. We use DLMs in a hands-on fashion within the traditional classroom by involving small groups of chemical, mechanical and civil engineering students to learn concepts in fluid mechanics and heat transfer. Chemical engineering findings show about 70% of students engaged in DLM activities achieve minimal conceptual competency on four questions related to the higher levels of learning in Bloom&rsquo;s Taxonomy in the areas of evaluating, creating, and analyzing processes. This is in contrast to only 48% achieving minimal competency when exposed to lecture only. In civil engineering on six conceptual questions, 70% of those receiving the DLM instruction achieved minimal competency whereas only 39% did so with lecture. Survey questions about foundational knowledge, application and integration of knowledge for a shell and tube heat exchanger, and an evaporator show very large effect sizes of 0.8 to 2.0 all favoring the DLM hands-on learning. The effect size is a statistical measure that indicates how far above the hands-on group compares to the lecture group in satisfaction in learning; an effect size of 1.0 means one group differs by another by a whole standard deviation. In one implementation, project teams used the DLMs in a cooperative learning manner to inform project design, and growth in critical thinking. Student teams that used the DLMs reach our target score around 3.5 in a junior level course moving toward a graduating professional competency rating of 4.0. Those who did not use the DLMs showed little to no gain in competency from the beginning to the end of the semester hovering around a score of 2.5.</p> <p>Broader impact outcomes include the fact that Armfield Ltd. is now selling the technology, calling it the DLMX, at a low enough cost so that many universities are buying several of them along with companion workbooks. Well over 200 sets of DLM cartridges have been sold to universities across the U.S. and a high school workbook is available. A USAID/National Science Foundation PEER (Partnerships for Enhanced Engagement in Research) grant was obtained by the team as a result of the base NSF grant. The PEER allowed the U.S. professors and students to interact with the National Research Institute for Chemical Technology (NARICT) and Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria, Nigeria to create DLMs for converting waste agriculture to synthesis gas that can be used for creating heating and transportation fuels. Three international workshops were conducted culminating in the principal investigator, a postdoc and three students traveling to Ghana, West Africa to put on a workshop attended by the NARICT and ABU team and many Ghanaian professors. The teaching technique was transferred to Central Florida University where two Masters students worked on the project along with a few professors and undergraduates.</p> <p>At WSU and Central Florida University 10 faculty, one postdoctoral associate, four Ph.D. students, three M.S. students, and about 12 undergraduates received training in translating course concepts into practical hands-on exercises, professional development in creating accompanying course worksheets, assessment pre- and posttests, and a university and high-school level workbook. In Nigeria at NARICT and ABU six faculty, one M.S. and four undergraduates received such training. Two high school teachers were involved in using the Armfield DLMX and one of them is a co-author who contributed significantly to the high school workbook in terms of content and classroom testing. In addition, numerous scholarly peer-refereed publications and conference proceedings, and poster and platform presentations were generated. A WSU Ph.D. student grew in professional development by organizing the international workshops and in particular the one at the University of Ghana. Many faculty across the U.S. purchased the Armfield Ltd. DLMX and accompanying workbooks, and use them with their students.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/29/2018<br>      Modified by: Bernard&nbsp;J&nbsp;Van Wie</p> </div> <div
