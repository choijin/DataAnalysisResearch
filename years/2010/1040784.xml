<AbstractNarration>Cloud computing provides economic advantages from shared resources, but security is a major risk for remote operations and a major barrier to the approach, with challenges for both hosts and the network. NEBULA is a potential future Internet architecture providing trustworthy networking for the emerging cloud computing model of always-available network services. NEBULA addresses many network security issues, including data availability with a new core architecture (NCore) based on redundant connections to and between NEBULA core routers, accountability and trust with a new policy-driven data plane (NDP), and extensibility with a new control plane (NVENT) that supports network virtualization, enabling results from other future Internet architectures to be incorporated in NEBULA. NEBULA?s data plane uses cryptographic tokens as demonstrable proofs that a path was both authorized and followed. The NEBULA control plane provides one or more authorized paths to NEBULA edge nodes; multiple paths provide reliability and load-balancing. The NEBULA core uses redundant high-speed paths between data centers and core routers, as well as fault-tolerant router software, for always-on core networking. The NEBULA architecture removes network (in) security as a prohibitive factor that would otherwise prevent the realization of many cloud computing applications, such as electronic health records and data from medical sensors. NEBULA will produce a working system that is deployable on core routers and is viable from both an economic and a regulatory perspective.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ * Overview      The emerging cloud and mobile environment is the latest  incarnation of the 1960's vision of "utility computing," whereby a  trustworthy network would enable end-users to connect from  anywhere to services that are always available.  The NEBULA-FIA  project was a multi-institutional collaboration to design and  prototype a network architecture capable of supporting cloud-based  critical applications via secure, highly available, and robust  communication services.  * Intellectual Merits   Enabling trustworthy cloud computing is a demanding goal.  It  entails, for instance, strong guarantees of availability of cloud  services and of integrity and/or secrecy of traffic to, within,  and from the cloud.  To tackle this challenge, the NEBULA-FIA  project envisioned an architecture consisting of three tiers: (1)  the network core (NCore) that connects cloud data centers to each  other; (2) the Nebula data plane (NDP) that connects data centers  to the access networks (and hence to end-users); and (3) the  Nebula Virtual and Extensible Networking Techniques (NVENT) that  offers users a dynamic and flexible spectrum of connectivity  choices (e.g., HIPAA-compliant or high-reliability paths).   The NEBULA-FIA subteam at Stevens focused on defining and  prototyping a design for NDP (joint with collaborators at Stanford  University and at the University of Texas at Austin), as well as  on integrating this prototype with select components of the NVENT  layer (joint with collaborators at the University of  Pennsylvania).  The proposed data-plane design [1] incorporates a  novel path verification mechanism to prevent unwanted traffic from  consuming network resources (e.g., bandwidth available on  transmission links, or state maintained in routing equipment).  Technically, this is accomplished by ensuring that before data  packets are sent over any network path, each domain along the path  has (explicitly or through delegation) consented to the use of the  path.  A domain's consent is embodied in a cryptographic token  called a proof of consent, which the sender embeds in each packet  that she launches along the path.  As the packet traverses the  path, it is incrementally marked with proofs of provenance, which  essentially certify that the packet has indeed traveled through  each domain on the path, in the correct order.  The requirement  for explicit consent is a major difference from the current  Internet architecture, and has substantial potential for improving  security: for instance, since all traffic must be explicitly  authorized and strong cryptographic mechanisms thwart spoofing,  denial-of-service (DoS) attacks are much harder to carry out.  (In  a DoS attack, malicious network actors, whether evil end-users or  rogue network operators, overwhelm the victim with spurious  service requests, causing a degradation in the quality of service  experienced by honest end-users, or even interruption of service  altogether.)   The Stevens-UPenn integration effort resulted in a prototype  combining the proposed NDP design with a control plane based on  the RapidNet [2] declarative networking engine and on the  service-access capabilities of the Serval [3] architecture.  While  bare-bone, this prototype exhibits the increased resilience to  network failures that was one of the goals of the NEBULA-FIA  project.  A demo clip available at the project web site  (http://nebula-fia.org) shows a video being streamed over a  redundant connection, unaffected by multiple faults that were  injected in the underlying network paths.  * Broader Impact   Besides contributing to the design space on network architectures  with strong security guarantees, the work supported by this grant  demonstrated the plausibility of carrying out rich per-packet  cryptography at network line rates.  Specifically, the packet  format and authentication component of the proposed data-plane  design were shown to be amenable to hardware optimization  resulting...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
