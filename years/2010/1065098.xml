<AbstractNarration>Mangrove forests that dominate tropical coastal wetlands globally are expanding their latitudinal ranges and invading areas historically dominated by temperate zone salt marshes.  Both mangroves and salt marshes provide critical ecosystem services that include filtering water, retaining nutrients, buffering shorelines from storms, supporting unique biodiversity, and serving as nurseries for commercially and recreationally important fisheries. However, the two habitats differ dramatically in structure and are likely to differ substantially in the rates and magnitudes of these ecosystem services. Funds provided by this award will support a multidisciplinary approach to understand the consequences of climate variation, nutrient enrichment, and land development on the rapid and ongoing conversion of salt marshes into mangrove forests at regional to continental scales. Aerial and satellite remote sensing will be used to document the rate and extent of mangrove spread within tropical/temperate boundary zones over the last half century.  Large scale field experiments replicated across biogeographic regions will test alternative mechanisms for these shifts in coastal wetland composition and determine the effects on nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, and food web dynamics.  Statistical and simulation modeling will be used to predict future changes in coastal wetland communities. By identifying the relative importance of environmental and biotic factors across local to global scales of organization, data and models developed in this study will help wetlands management by resource managers, fisheries agencies, and conservationists. Findings from this study will be made available through highly visible exhibits and online sites for educators through the Ocean Portal, a collaborative effort among the Smithsonian, NOAA, and the Ocean Conservancy.  Postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students will be trained in a variety of interdisciplinary techniques, resulting in a collaborative effort that brings together researchers from universities, government, and federal agencies.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Many species will undergo range shifts in response to climate change. This study sought to clarify the causes and effects of range shifts by Florida's mangroves - a group of culturally, ecologically, and economically important species in the coastal zone. Specifically, this study: 1) documented and modeled the extent of mangrove vegetation in coastal Florida; 2) examined factors - both physical and biological - that influence mangrove encroachment in coastal wetlands; and 3) explored the ecological consequences of increased mangrove cover for organisms and physical processes in coastal wetlands. To that end, the research team used a combination of archival, remote sensing, survey, experimental, and genetic data collected from numerous sites along the east and Gulf coasts of Florida.</p> <p>Taken together, historical records, aerial imagery, genetic analysis, and distribution models revealed a dynamic history of alternating dominance by salt marsh and mangroves in the region, driven by occasional extreme freezes (which promote salt marsh dominance) and hurricanes (which promote mangrove expansion). Climate modeling, combined with experimental results showing differential susceptibility to freezing temperatures, indicated that Florida's three mangrove species will shift northward at different rates as winter temperatures warm. Nutrient availability, microclimates, local hydrology, herbivory by salt marsh insects, and enhanced reproduction at the range edge were also found to influence the rate of mangrove encroachment. In turn, results showed that marsh elevation, shoreline protection from storms, and carbon storage are likely to increase with climate-driven mangrove expansion. Marine and terrestrial invertebrate communities will respond to growing mangrove dominance, as well, with greater abundances of some taxa (e.g., mangrove tree crabs and spiders), and decreases in others (e.g., blue crabs). This study was unique for both its spatiotemporal breadth and for its many lines of evidence used to explore the process of range expansion in a single species (or set of species). As such, findings from this study are relevant for a wide variety of stakeholders, from resource and fisheries managers to conservationists and civil engineers.</p> <p>This study's results are applicable for parties hoping to mitigate or slow the effects of climate change, as well as for those simply in need of predictions of the future trajectory of coastal wetlands. Toward that end, findings have been shared in peer-reviewed journals, in the mainstream media, in blogs, at international and regional conferences, at local community meetings, and directly with park and reserve managers. As a result of this research, postdoctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate students, and highschoolers received training in ecology, environmental science, genetics, statistics, and experimental design. This research fostered collaboration between the Smithsonian Institution and over 10 American universities and a handful of foreign ones, and participants counted managers in the National Estuarine Research Reserve network, Florida's state parks and its environmentally-endangered lands program, and the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge among their partners. Along with these partners, this research team also organized and hosted a large international conference for an exchange of knowledge with the global community of mangrove scientists and resource managers.</p> <p>This study was intended to increase understanding of range dynamics by integrating across drivers and consequences of range shifts. It allows us to conclude that many multi-scale processes will shape the rate and extent of future species distributions, and that the outcomes of range shifts are already pervasive.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/02/2017<br>      Modified by: Leslie&nbsp;Pick</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1065098/1065098_10100802_1504369237395_IMGP7010--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1065098/1065098_10100802_1504369237395_IMGP7010--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Red mangroves in saltmarsh"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1065098/1065098_10100802_1504369237395_IMGP7010--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Red mangroves in saltmarsh"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Red mangroves invading coastal Spartina saltmarsh habitat in the Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve, Northeastern Florida</div> <div class="imageCredit">Cora Johnston</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Leslie&nbsp;Pick</div> <div class="imageTitle">Red mangroves in saltmarsh</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1065098/1065098_10100802_1504369417825_Willet--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1065098/1065098_10100802_1504369417825_Willet--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Willet"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1065098/1065098_10100802_1504369417825_Willet--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Willet"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Coastal mangroves and saltmarshes provide excellent habitat for shorebirds, such as this willet in the Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve</div> <div class="imageCredit">Daniel Gruner</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Leslie&nbsp;Pick</div> <div class="imageTitle">Willet</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1065098/1065098_10100802_1504369887361_PondAtSMS--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1065098/1065098_10100802_1504369887361_PondAtSMS--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Mangrove rearing garden at Smithsonian Marine Station"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1065098/1065098_10100802_1504369887361_PondAtSMS--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Mangrove rearing garden at Smithsonian Marine Station"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Common garden of white, red and black mangrove seedlings to be used in a variety of experiments.
