<AbstractNarration>This longitudinal, empirical, collaborative research study seeks to identify the influence of expanded "opportunity structures" in high school for preparation in mathematics and science on choice of college destinations by non-privileged high school students and their selection of STEM majors. Students studied in this longitudinal study will initially be sophomores in two geographically different urban settings - Buffalo, NY and Denver, CO.  The students in the sample have math grades that place in them in the top 20% of their class but have limited social, economic, and cultural capital (for example, parents whose education ended with little or no-college attendance). Because prior work has found that matriculation in good colleges and selection of STEM majors has varied widely in comparing students who seem to come from comparable high schools in terms of socioeconomic status, this study will add to our understanding of underlying factors.  Also, the extensive investment across US Public high schools in AP, IB, magnet schools, after-school programs, science competitions, and other enrichment activities indicates that improved understanding of the impact of these investments would be likely to be valuable to many school districts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prior research has shown that expanded opportunity structures in science and math facilitate greater college attendance, including at elite colleges.  But there is not sufficient research on which types of students are helped by this and on how such structures influence student choice of academic major.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study builds upon extensive prior research including those that employed anthropological and sociological investigations of indicators that influence personal perceptions and subsequent decisions regarding students' roles in society. This study is grounded by theoretical support from Bourdieu's Theory of Social Practice (1977) and Arum, Gamoran, and Shavit's Theory of Educational Expansion and Differentiation (2007). Answers to the research questions guiding this study are expected to advance understanding of the impact of school structures to expand educational opportunities in science and math to non-socially and non-culturally capitalized students. The PIs hypothesize that when such opportunities for educational expansion are implemented they should contribute to the reduction of inequalities associated with STEM pursuits and outcomes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project investigated the implications of (1) high school opportunity structures for STEM (math and science course availability, sequences and requirements; teacher qualifications; counseling services; technology use) and (2) "figured worlds of STEM" (cultural models of the kinds of people who pursue science, technology, engineering, or math) for choice of college major (STEM vs. non-STEM) and college destination.  Longitudinal ethnographic case studies were conducted in 4 urban public high schools in Denver, Colorado, USA.  The research included observations and interviews with approximately 12 focal students, their parents, and school staff at each school; historical and demographic data pertaining to the schools, districts, and regional context were also collected. The 48 focal students--all high-achievers in math and science at the end of 9th grade--were followed for three years (2010-2013) from 10th grade through high school graduation.  In 2014-15, follow-up surveys were conducted to track focal students' trajectories post high school.     All four schools served non-privileged students but varied in how they approached math and science education.  Two of the schools were designated "STEM-focused"; two were regular "comprehensive" high schools.     This research was in collaboration with a team led by Professor Lois Weis, University of Buffalo.  Weis? team conducted a comparable set of studies in Buffalo.     Findings pertain primarily to Denver; however, some from Buffalo are included because the comparisons are informative.     1)   Public high schools with similar student populations (~70-80% free and/or reduced lunch; ~ 75% minority) differed substantially in the way they were improving STEM opportunities.  Some offer additional Honors and AP courses; others offer STEM "academies"; others increase requirements for graduation.  Within one school, several different arrangements may be available.  In Denver:  (1) For ten years, there was consistent public support for improving STEM in schools; (2) schools have expanded STEM offerings, adding STEM-focused strands and more advanced courses; (3) changes to STEM opportunity structures were most evident at the two STEM-focused schools where an academy structure replaced a comprehensive high school model; (4) however, these reforms were not all sustained; and standardized tests revealed continuing academic weaknesses in math and science; and (5) where changes to STEM opportunities were the most dramatic, they contributed to instability and confusion.     2)   Across the U.S., designating schools as "STEM-focused" has proliferated.  In both Denver and Buffalo, some high schools not meeting state and national standards have been converted to "STEM-focused schools" in hopes of attracting stronger students, strengthening curricula, and raising test scores and college attendance rates.  Our STEM-focused schools were of this type. Not surprisingly, the schools were simultaneously undertaking other reforms, e.g., leadership changes, standards-based learning, and new testing requirements.  Administrators and teachers were overwhelmed with competing demands, coupled with fear of sanctions for failure to achieve mandated outcomes.  Despite their name, these schools were far from the model STEM schools currently being promoted in the US.      3)   Focal students in Denver and Buffalo shared familiar figured worlds of schooling and STEM, but they differed substantially in their outlook on high school and college-going opportunities. Students in Denver were more positive about schooling and future prospects than those in Buffalo.       4)   From 10th to 12th grade, the focal students developed an increasingly narrow view of the kind of person who is good in a STEM field and likely to succeed at STEM in college or a career.  As 10th graders, most focal students included themselves in this category, but by 12th grade, only a few still did.  Pressures to always understand material quickly and make the highest grades-- characteristics repeatedly mentioned as crucial for success in STEM-- discouraged them.     5)   The schools in both cities promoted a discourse valuing 4-year college education "for all."  STEM-related vocational and technical trajectories were available and of interest to some focal students, but the prevailing discourse accorded these trajectories very low status.       6)   For the most part, the figured worlds of college and career aspirations were vaguely configured or absent specific content pertaining to college life, college expectations, or the necessary preparations for college admission and career development. Guidance counselors were too busy with struggling students to address college-going issues of high-achieving students in any depth.     7)   There was interest in STEM careers among students and parents.  But they exhibited scant knowledge of job availability. In Denver, there are numerous high tech, aerospace, and health-related employers&mdash;many expanding with projected future job availability&mdash;but these employers were not familiar to the focal students or their parents and had no presence in the schools.     8)   Few focal students continued in STEM fields after high school.  Fear of failing to succeed in STEM, limited college options, and high college costs conspired to make pursuit of STEM unattractive and unreasonable.
