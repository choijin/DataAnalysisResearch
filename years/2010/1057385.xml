<AbstractNarration>The magnificent diversity and abundance of seaweeds along the Pacific Coast of California, Oregon, and Washington reflect this region's rich coastal environments.  In this project, the University Herbarium, University of California, Berkeley (UC) will image, database, geo-reference, and curate 102,000 specimens of Pacific Coast algae.  Targeted species will be all marine macroalgae (seaweeds) that are known to grow in California, Oregon, or Washington, wherever in the world they occur.  Once completed, the specimen records will complement our existing on-line resources, forming a seaweed information interchange of authoritative, up-to-date data.  Combined, this resource will contain the latest information on identification, taxonomy, distribution, ecology, relationships, and diversity of Pacific Coast marine flora.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seaweeds are the engineers of near shore environments, providing primary production and habitat for intertidal and sub-tidal communities, creating substrate and structure for myriad marine organisms and their developing larvae (including many commercially important species). The dataset to be completed will help to meet the urgent national need to predict, interpret, and act upon the effects of climate change on the marine environment.  The information will be useful for marine scientists, as well as for those concerned with marine fisheries, conservation, teaching, and learning about the Pacific Coast.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project imaged and databased all specimens of marine algae (seaweeds) that occur between the Mexican and Canadian borders, from the University Herbarium, University of California, Berkeley.  A PhD level specialist checked identifications and supervised a team of undergraduate students who worked in the imaging/databaseing lab.  Intellectual merit.  The benefits to scientists who study seaweeds is clear -- phycologists can check to see UC's holdings, can look through specimens to choose what they wish to request on loan, or request an electronic loan instead of the actual specimen.  For many species, images are very helpful for identification or for determining the reproductive state of a plant at a particular time and place. Models of geographic and ecological distribution can be developed.  In addition to core phycologists, the data provide benefits to other disciplines -- history, ecology, coastal management -- because they are usually not available in other forms.  For example, one can deduce where a collector is at a given date.  The search options also allow the generation of species lists for sites at different times, something that is impossible without a database.  The selection of specimens to be digitized was specifically designed to enable climate change studies on the West Coast, and we anticipate use of the data in this way soon.  Broader Impacts.  The public is fascinated by the ocean and is curious about its creatures, though usually poorly informed.  The power of images is huge.
