Treiman&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of California, Los Angeles&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project will collect and analyze the first national-level data on migrant children and children left behind by one or both parents, as well as, for comparison, rural and urban children living with their parents. The investigators will use a 2008 national probability sample of the adult population of China, which collected complete rosters of the children of each respondent and all children residing in respondent?s households. They will survey these children, focusing on key aspects of child well-being such as educational and cognitive development, physical health, emotional health, and risky behaviors. They also will interview the primary caregiver of each child and parents living apart from their children. Coupled with existing household and parental information gathered in the previous survey, this new survey will permit a comprehensive account of the consequences of migration for children and the underlying socioeconomic and psychosocial mechanisms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The information gathered can inform the design of intervention programs by local governments and global development organizations such as UNICEF, to reinforce the benefits while mitigating the costs of migration for children.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In many parts of the world today people leave their homes and move to new places, or even different countries, to find work. The large scale migration from Mexico and other Central American nations to the U.S. is one important example. Another is China, where more than one quarter billion people, about 20% of their population, leave their home towns to seek work. Many of these people are married with children. Internal migration in China on an unprecedented scale has affected a large fraction of Chinese children. Because of the institutional and social barriers facing migrants, many migrant parents leave their children behind in their home areas to circumvent the difficulty of arranging adequate child care and schooling. This creates the possibility of substantial psychosocial costs for the children as a result of separation from parents, in spite of often sizeable remittances from migrant parents. Some parents bring their children to cities or start families and raise children in their work locales. While migrant children enjoy preserved family unity and parental support, these children often confront various forms of both institutional and social discrimination that prevent them from fully integrating into their host communities. These two groups of children altogether account for over 25%of the population under age 18 and the fraction is steadily increasing.
