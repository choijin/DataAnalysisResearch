<AbstractNarration>The focus of this three year REU Site program at Texas A&amp;M University is electrical and computer engineering approaches to research problems involving energy generation, transmission, distribution, storage and management. Cyber-physical interactions within "smart" energy systems enable greater intelligence, autonomy and security for safety-critical applications. Specifically, a combination of analytic, computational and experimental projects will be conducted in: active grid management, smart grid cyber security, system stabilization, smart grid sensor systems, coordination of renewable energy sources, superconductors for efficient power distribution, and next generation communications for smart grid connectivity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed research is to bring the rigorous analytical approach characteristic of electrical and computer engineering to novel problems of importance to emerging cyber-physical energy systems. Recently, there is significant government focus on the development of next generation power systems that provide greater efficiency, power quality and enhanced resiliency and response to attack, natural disaster and system disturbances. The smart grid vision integrates alterative forms of energy and complex cyber infrastructure within legacy technology. This has led to a set of rich and vital research challenges that are addressed in this REU Site. The REU students will participate in developing the next generation of algorithms, protocols and prototype technologies leveraging advances in intelligent signal processing, computation, microelectronics and nano-scale device synthesis. They will participate in developing solutions that will enhance national capabilities in the presence of environmental concerns, security threats, increased energy and autonomy demands, and aging critical infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site will offer research experiences to those who may not normally have such an opportunity, particularly women, underrepresented minorities, and first-generation college students. It makes a significant contribution toward enhancing the diversity of the research and education infrastructure at TAMU and toward increasing the production of advanced-degreed African American and Hispanic engineers. It creates a model program for diverse populations that addresses undergraduates' exposure to research as well as increases awareness of the pathway to graduate school. Having a more diverse engineering and science professoriate significantly benefits society, not only in Texas but nationally, in promoting a more equitable participation of minorities in the engineering and scientific disciplines. Partner universities include Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology and HBCUs Prairie View A&amp;M University and Norfolk State Universities.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The final year of this award, 2015, was the 12<sup>th</sup> year that the Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering (ECE) hosted a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program. The goal of this award, entitled &ldquo;NSF REU SITE: Smart Energy and Smart Systems&rdquo; was to annually engage a diverse cadre of undergraduate students from electrical and computer engineering programs across the country in smart energy and smart systems related research. Electrification was recognized by the National Academy of Engineers as the greatest engineering achievement of the twentieth century and ushered in the second industrial revolution &ndash; powered by electricity. Today, electricity is even more important than ever. We challenge our REU participants to imagining daily modern life without it, or even a few hours without &ldquo;plugging in&rdquo; to recharge a smartphone. Motors still spin to drive manufacturing, but powering the infrastructure to move vast quantities of data is a challenge for the new digital economy as billions of dollars a day are processed in the e-commerce economy. Whether or not our participants pursue a research career in energy, the REU equips them to be energy-aware members of society.</p> <p>The REU site achieves our goal to provide maximum impact by broadly recruiting candidate from academic institutions across the country to cultural, ethnic and gender diversity. Striving to achieve the highest educational impact, the program targeted students in the sophomore through senior years of their undergraduate education and asked each to identify technical areas of interest. All participants met the NSF US Citizenship requirements. The site provided a high-impact experience by limiting the student-to-mentor ratio to no more than two REU students per faculty mentor with subject-domain expertise in technology areas pertinent to the REU theme of <em>Smart Energy and Smart Systems</em>. In addition to technical mentorships many of the faculty mentors also provided life and career coaching. In total, over the five years of this award the REU site engaged a total of thirty-eight (38) students.</p> <p>In addition to the in-depth and customized research program tailored to each student, the ECE REU immersed the students in a wide range of complementary activities to build research confidence, graduate school perspective, and a sense of community. The ECE REU coordinated many of its extramural activities with the TAMU College of Engineering Undergraduate Summer Research Grants (USRG) program as well as with the Honors and Undergraduate Research office that provides coordination for REU programs across all disciplines of the entire TAMU campus for the purpose of expanding participant perspective on research and building a community of undergraduate research scholars. Students from multiple REU programs were housed together for a full-immersion experience. The enhancement activities included tours of REU faculty research labs, brown bag luncheons, seminars on graduate studies, monthly luncheons coordinated by the USRG program, and an assortment of informal gatherings and socializing opportunities. Some of the topics included writing a CV, applying to graduate school, choosing a faculty adviser, amongst other topics presented by faculty. In addition, our participants participated in weekly case-studies of engineering ethics and a GRE preparatory class. Communication skills were honed through the preparation of written and oral reports and presentation of a technical poster at culmination of the annual ten-week program.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/30/2016<br>      Modified by: Robert&nbsp;S&nbsp;Balog</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1062603/1062603_10083364_1468936063389_2014_REU_group--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1062603/1062603_10083364_1468936063389_2014_REU_group--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Group photo of 2014 Cadre"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1062603/1062603_10083364_1468936063389_2014_REU_group--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Group photo of 2014 Cadre"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">In 2014 the REU cadre was comprise of 9 participants, a graduate student administrative assistant, an ethics instructor, the PO and the co-PI.
