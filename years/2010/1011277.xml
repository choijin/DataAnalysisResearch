<AbstractNarration>Ecological interactions between species are often inferred by looking for correlations in abundance between species pairs while disregarding influences of other members of the community. Through the use of computer simulations and available abundance data from a complex insect community (fig wasps), this project will determine the accuracy of a multi-species graphical modeling approach to reveal networks of beneficial and antagonistic ecological interactions among species. After determining the most accurate method of modeling ecological interactions, additional fig-wasp abundance data will be collected from six locations along the Baja Peninsula to test whether or not these interactions, both at the level of species pairs and communities as a whole, are static or dynamic over a large geographic range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Food webs often rely on predator-prey interactions, and more complete models of ecological networks involving all types of interspecific interactions (including competition, mutualism, and parasitism) are still rare. This project will develop a more inclusive model of ecological communities. The resulting model will also show how the structure of ecological networks is affected by changing environmental conditions, including human-caused habitat fragmentation and global climate change. A graduate student and an undergraduate student will participate in the research.</AbstractNarration>

Instead, their locations and movement patterns are influenced by both physical features of the environment (e.g., light levels and precipitation) and interactions with other organisms (e.g., prey and predators). These factors can, in turn, affect the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of individual species and entire communities. We used mathematical and computer simulation models to develop theory aimed at predicting how variation in the distributions of organisms in space and time affects the ecology and evolution of species diversity.

We found that when host plants were spatially aggregated (clumped), pollination efficiency and production increased while seed production decreased due to the consumption of developing seeds by larval pollinators. A scattered distribution of host tress, in contrast led to less efficient pollination and lower pollinator production, but a higher production of seeds. We also developed models evaluating how the fig-fig pollinator mutualism was affected by a second non-pollinating wasp species that competes with the pollinating wasp for access to fig seeds. In our model, the non-pollinating competitor was usually able to coexist with the pollinating mutualist when host trees were scattered, only occasionally driving both mutualists (fig and pollinating wasp species) to extinction.
