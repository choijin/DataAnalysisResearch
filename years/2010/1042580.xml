<AbstractNarration>This project explores the implications of embodied cognition for learning and teaching at the college level. College classes and college classrooms are generally designed for the purely "abstract" thinker: a thinker who does not benefit from tangible, multi-sensory approaches to learning that are part of early childhood education but considered unnecessary and inefficient for adult learners. The term "educational technology" generally refers to desktop or laptop computers with standard GUI interfaces, and to data projectors, networks, and other familiar "smart classroom" technology. But a variety of developments in computing, computing education, and education research point the way to making "smart students" more effectively by reframing educational technology. Tangible User Interfaces offer the opportunity to combine computational power with the cognitive power of manipulatives; CS1 education with manipulatives has been promoted by some faculty; and research on learning in higher education shows that multi-sensory learning is far more effective than lecture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project stems from its grounding in theory and evidence, and from the importance of its challenge to prevailing wisdom. In addition to drawing on the academic literature, the project analyzes field data from students and professionals, and conducts a laboratory study of a key proposition. The broader impacts of this work can appear in a rethinking of higher education, educational technology, and adult learning environments, making them more engaging and effective.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this Early Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project was to explore, through primary research and use of secondary sources, the implications of embodied cognition (the fact that humans learn with their bodies and environments, not just the contents of their cranium) for learning and teaching at the college level. The working hypothesis was that recognizing that college students, like other adults, are embodied learners has the potential to profoundly disrupt current assumptions and practices in higher education.  Extensive review of interdisciplinary research on embodied cognition&mdash;from neuroscience, psychology, philosophy, the arts, education, and other disciplines&mdash;combined with primary research in laboratory and classroom settings, were used to develop findings and further questions on how higher education can best serve the embodied learner.  Specific Findings:  1. The conventional college classroom can be seen as a "sensory deprivation chamber" which poorly supports sensory and embodied learning. Lectures and slides, the predominant tools of college teaching, fail to take advantage of the multisensory, kinesthetic, and embodied ways in which human beings learn. Careful design of manipulatives, interactive diagramming and concept mapping, and so forth, can significantly aid student understanding and learning.  2. While learning with manipulatives is valuable, our laboratory study of students in an introductory psychology course showed that the value is contingent. Materials must be well suited both to learning goals and to learning assessment methods, so that the use of manipulatives and other things to think with is cost-effective in terms of time spent, and helps direct students toward course learning goals. In addition to studying the cognitive benefits of physical materials, the affective benefits of manipulatives should be attended to.  3. Activities that engage the hands can increase attention and decrease anxiety. Although this phenomenon is widely reported by knitters and others who work with their hands, there has been no systematic research in this area. Because of the feasibility of interventions such as encouraging students to knit or knead modeling clay during lectures, and because of the extraordinary and widespread potential benefits, this is an important and urgent area for investigation.  4. In a pilot laboratory study of students who viewed a brief video lecture on non-Euclidean mathematics, women students who held a crocheted mathematical model (of a hyperbolic plane) showed less math anxiety and had a more positive attitude toward mathematics than women students who did not.  Questions for further research:  1. Do educational manipulatives, or manual activities such as knitting or squeezing clay, increase attention and decrease anxiety in college settings, both inside and outside the classroom?  2. Under what circumstances, and for whom, are classroom manipulatives beneficial to learning at the college level? What are the implications for the Universal Design for Learning movement and for face-to-face versus online learning?  3. Who benefits most from the use of manipulatives and other classroom "things to think with?" Are there differences in gender, social class, culture, cognitive style and identified learning disability, and other factors? Are there opportunities to, for example, increase attraction and retention of underrepresented groups in STEM?  4. How can we change practices in higher education to capitalize on the strengths of the embodied learner? What changes in pedagogy, space design, budgeting, and faculty professional development would be most effective?  5. Can gendered practices, such as knitting, crochet and weaving, be leveraged to attract and retain women in STEM fields? Can, for example, a crocheted hyperbolic plane be used to counteract stereotype threat for female students?
