<AbstractNarration>A principal goal of biological theory is to understand complex living systems in terms of their parts and the interactions between their parts.  In this project, an ecologist, a protein physiologist and a mathematician will collaborate to develop new ways of understanding how highly interconnected biological systems change through time.  Specifically, these investigators aim to develop a general theory of linear dynamics on complex biological networks.  Surprisingly, a great variety of critically important biological phenomena at a wide range of scales is captured by linear or approximately linear dynamics on complex networks.  By applying novel methods for coarse graining biological networks, this project will answer questions such as: how many functionally distinct moving parts does a given system have?  How do quantities of interest, such as nutrients or information, move through a highly interconnected network?  Which nodes or edges in such a network are the most important for transmission?  Can we identify nodes whose removal has the greatest or smallest effect on the performance of the network?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing a framework for general linear dynamics on complex biological networks will have a broad and deep impact on our ability to understand, predict and control critically important biological processes at a wide range of scales.  In addition, this project will contribute to training students at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral level to work across disciplines such as ecology, physiology and mathematics to deepen our understanding of complex biological systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Networks are ubiquitous in biological systems.  In ecology, networks arise as descriptions of food webs, and also as descriptions of geographical dispersal of organisms. In the latter case, the vertices of  the network represent different locations (e.g. different habitat patches along a coast) and the edges of the network represent possible routes that  organisms may follow while migrating.  In protein folding, networks arise as a description of the different amino acids making up the protein, with the edges representing which amino acid is connected to which other. In each of these examples, the transitions between states in the network may by more or less stochastic (meaning "random" or "unpredictable"). In ecology, the migration of individuals might be highly predictable, like the north/south migrations of birds with the changing seasons.  In other cases they can be unpredictable. Similarly, the propagation of information through a protein, or the transitions of an ion channel amongst its various states, can follow a combination of random and deterministic rules.  Although ecological, protein, and ion channel networks describe biological systems on vastly different scales, the underlying mathematical description of random movement on a network are strikingly similar.  The interdisciplinary team working together on this grant -- an ecologist, a expert in protein dynamics, and a computational neuroscientst -- found ways to advance our understanding of how to describe and quantify systems involving random transitions on networks. Ecological component: Many marine organisms have a juvenile stage in which they float or swim in highly variable ocean currents. This means the transport of immature marine organisms from one place to another is unpredictable from year to year, including where they end up -- or whether they get back to land at all.  This uncertainty has effects on the long term growth of the population and on the evolution of traits such as the size and number of offspring.  Prof. Snyder studied how the long-term population growth of bicolor damselfish is affected by the interaction of juvenile behavior and large ocean eddies off the Florida Keys.  She also studied how ocean eddies affect the evolution of offspring size/number and the duration of the spawning period (in any coastal organism).  This research sheds light on how some organisms cope with risky, uncertain, or changing environments.  Neuroscience component: Understanding the human brain remains one of the greatest unsolved problems of modern science.  Efforts underway, such as the Human Brain Project, involve building sophisticated computer models that challenge even today's formidable computing resources.  Finding efficient, but accurate, ways of simplifying the description of randomly fluctuating ion channel currents is an important step towards facilitating more detailed brain models.  Prof. Thomas, co-PI of the project, and Dr. Schmidt, postdoctoral trainee, analyzed a novel approach to simplifying the description of random fluctuations in ion channel networks, called the ``stochastic shielding approximation." This approximation is remarkably accurate, while speeding computational time up to 10-fold.  Their work using mathematical ideas to analyze stochastic shielding sheds light on why it works so well, and should contribute to faster, more accurate computer models of brain function in the future.    Protein  component: The structural organization of proteins provides valuable  information on their biological function, and numerous methods have  appeared which  analyze proteins as  networks of amino acids connected by non-covalent contacts. Many of  these methods are based on the local density of connections and aim to  find groups of  highly connected amino  acids. Compact globular proteins pose a challenge for these methods,  because these proteins are often not clearly divided into regions of  differing density  of connections.
