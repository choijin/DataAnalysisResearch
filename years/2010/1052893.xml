<AbstractNarration>The proposed ADVANCE PAID project, Indigenous Women in Science Network (IWSN), addresses the underrepresentation of American Indian women in the academic STEM discipline. Through the convening of small talking circles that originated as an outgrowth of a previous ADVANCE IT award, the Network has now expanded to an independent annual meeting.  Specifically, this meeting provides opportunities for American Indian women to seek mentors and create new professional relationships and offers an opportunity for this cadre of women scientists to provide much needed psychosocial support.  The network is characterized by discussions that focus on enhancing communication, identifying funding strategies, strategic planning and informing the body of literature that focuses on the intersection of gender and race.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit.  The current project provides specific and targeted opportunities for intellectual and scientific progress, including opportunities for interdisciplinary scientific collaborations.  Additionally, this project contributes to the overall understanding of the unique circumstances that are experienced by American Indian women who pursue careers as scientists and an understanding of the cultural perspectives that either contribute to or serve as barriers to career progression for American Indian women.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact.  This organization is able to leverage its commitment and established trust with a community of American Indian women to meaningfully address their underrepresentation in the academic STEM disciplines.  Additionally, this project has the potential to inform the ADVANCE community of efforts that can be made on individual campuses to increase the recruitment and retention of American Indian women.  To that end, the proposed project will significantly impact a cadre of women faculty who have been relatively underserved by the ADVANCE Program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The low numbers of American Indian &amp; Alaska Native (AIAN) women scientists and their isolation within academia can result in diminished career success.  The most effective source of information, support, mentoring and strategies leading to success for these AIAN women scientists exists within the women themselves. They hold the knowledge, strength, motivation and expertise to help other indigenous women to remain engaged in science and to move forward.  The Indigenous Women in Science Network (IWSN) offers the opportunity for members to help each other and to reach out to other women scientists. This unique organization offers AIAN women scientists the opportunity to meet, exchange knowledge, share experiences and discuss strategies that will allow them to flourish in the space between the science they love and the cultural identities that define them. Common interests will promote new interdisciplinary collaboration.     This funding supported the Third Annual Meeting of the Indigenous Women in Science Network (IWSN) held in Minneapolis MN, Nov. 9-10, 2011.  The meeting included notable speakers providing information concerning their scientific achievements.    In addition, information relevant to career development was provided and networking among American Indian women scientists took place.   A web page (http://iwsnetwork.org/)  and a face book page  were established to create an internet presence.    In addition, funding was used to hold a board meeting on Feb. 10, 2012 to discuss strategic planning for IWSN.   These meetings allowed vital and otherwise unavailable networking and information exchange among American Indian women scientists.
