<AbstractNarration>Pennsylvania State University (PSU) seeks to join the existing I/UCRC "Healthcare Organization Transformation (CHOT)" consisting of Texas A&amp;M (TAMU), Georgia Tech AND Northeastern University. TAMU is the lead institution of the existing Center. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pennsylvania State University (PSU) seeks to join the existing Center for Health Organization and Transformation (CHOT) as a fourth site. CHOT was established in 2008 to "conduct mixed methodology, applied research on the antecedents, execution, and effects of transformational interventions and strategies that combine evidence-based management, clinical and information technology innovations, and on-going organizational learning and cultural change" in healthcare systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PSU will develop and use systems principles to guide research to effectively transform healthcare delivery. A significant focus will be on transformative impact and quantitative measurements and analysis or the providers, payors, and patients. This may take form through transformation-focused interventions such as lean, six-sigma, or disease management. However, in order to accelerate change, research will be broadly directed toward organizational performance, transformation, and transformation technology development, in synch with CHOT. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed site will develop transformative approaches, demonstrate them in its partner healthcare organizations, and disseminate evidence-based approaches to regional and national healthcare CEOs, CFOs and CIOs. The proposed site will conduct interdisciplinary research with the theme of healthcare process excellence. The site's core faculty have already developed a strong history of working collaboratively across multiple units, engaging healthcare providers as partners in applied research, and working closely with students to address research needs of the relevant industry partners. The wide scope of participation (expected from the potential members of the site) will enhance dissemination of results. Dissemination is also expected to occur via professional and academic associations and conferences, and special symposia. The proposed site plans to engage students and partners from diverse and/or under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The mission of the Center for Health Organization Transformation (CHOT) is to advance knowledge and practice of transformational strategies in evidence-based management, information technology, clinical practice, and organizational learning through cooperative research among universities, health systems, and other health-related industries.  Our goals are to work with the other CHOT sites and industry partners to develop the science, methods, and evidence-based decision making tools in the following research focus areas:   1.          Macro-systems innovation  2.          Health quality, safety, access, and efficiency  3.          Patient-centered care and population health interventions  4.          Electronic health records and information exchange  The outcomes of this project impact healthcare organizations, patient-centered care, academic student training, and industry-academic collaborations.  Healthcare organizations: Through CHOT, healthcare organizations have the opportunity to work closely with industry and academic partners to translate basic research, into healthcare practice. By using process improvement methods developed by CHOT researchers, healthcare organizations are able to realize cost savings and operational efficiencies.  Patient-centered care: In many healthcare settings, there are competing objectives between patients? needs and healthcare decision makers? goals. A fundamental understanding of the mismatch between the different stakeholders will help healthcare organizations identify potential areas of dissatisfaction, both from a patient?s perspective, and a healthcare decision maker?s perspective. CHOT research pertaining to patient-centered care impacts medical readmissions through a better understanding of what patients undergo once they leave the hospital, towards better coordination of care across different stakeholders.  Academic student training: The typical learning process in higher education is primarily focused on in-class lectures and textbook assignments. CHOT has had an impact on both undergraduate and graduate students by enabling them to work on real-world problems in collaboration with industry members. This has enabled students to apply the theoretical concepts learned in academia, to practical, real-world problems that have an impact in society. Such hands-on exposure has the potential to introduce students to the business environment that they will have to navigate, once they are done with their academic degree programs.  Industry-Academic Collaboration: CHOT has had a positive impact on industry-academic collaborations by enabling stakeholders to work on a common set of problems, towards tangible outcomes. This holds both the industry members and academic partners accountable for translating basic research ideas, into tangible solutions that help make the healthcare system more efficient and effective. The CHOT partnership has the potential to lead to commercializable ventures through the active translation of basic research into practice.
