<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests funding to increase participation by U.S. graduate students at the 2010 Annual Meeting of the North American Membrane Society (NAMS/ICIM2010). The meeting will be a first ever combined meeting of the North American Membrane Society (NAMS) and the International Conference on Inorganic Membranes (ICIM). The meeting theme will be: Membranes: Enabling a Sustainable Future. The funding will be used to provide partial registration and travel support for graduate students participating in the conference. The goal is to encourage student participation at the largest meeting in North America of membrane scientists and engineers from academia, industry and government; students supported by NSF will present their research at the conference. The international nature of the meeting will enable students to interact not only with scientists and engineers from North America but also with those from Europe and Asia. The meeting will provide students with expanded opportunities to attend presentations and poster sessions to learn about the latest developments in membrane science and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NAMS/ICIM2010 meeting will consist of 40 technical sessions covering all aspects of membrane science, engineering and technology that support applications in the chemical, petrochemical, biofuels, food processing and packaging, and medical and biotechnology industries. The meeting will feature two world class plenary lectures that will address the role of membranes in water and energy sustainability as well as a special session, Membranes for a Sustainable World. In addition, the Journal of Membrane Science plans to publish a special edition tentatively entitled, Membrane Science for a Sustainable Future, in conjunction with NAMS/ICIM 2010. This special edition will offer students a unique opportunity to publish their meeting-presented research in the foremost peer reviewed membrane journal. NSF support would enable students to learn about the latest discoveries in membrane science and engineering, and meet researchers and colleagues from academia, industry and government. This unique networking opportunity would greatly benefit their research as well as facilitate their career development in the membrane area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed meeting sponsorship would increase the number of U.S. graduate students who are able to attend NAMS/ICIM2010. In addition to the 40 technical and two poster sessions, an extensive student program will be organized to advance the professional development of the next generation of membrane researchers. Four workshops will provide students with intensive training in fundamental and developing areas of membrane science and engineering. NSF funding will provide partial travel support for 20 U.S. graduate students to attend this meeting, and will be available to students of all genders, ethnicities, and geographic regions. Applications received from students with disabilities will be encouraged. Student participation at the meeting will enhance the infrastructure for research providing students the opportunity to meet leading scientists and engineers in membrane science and technology, network with students and faculty from other national and international research groups with similar interests, and interact with potential employers. In addition to the extensive technical content, activities related to the meeting theme, Membranes: Enabling a Sustainable Future, address issues of significant societal benefit. Moreover, the meeting will support the continuing education of young membrane scientists and engineers and thus will encourage the development of a new generation of leadership. Such leadership will help to maintain and increase the position of the U.S. in the development of membranes for sustainable technologies, an area of growing global emphasis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Student Travel Support for the 2010 North American Membrane Society Annual Meeting  The NAMS-ICIM 2010 meeting was held in Washington, D.C., from July 17-22, 2010, and was attended by over 500 scientists and engineers from 27 countries including 150 students.  The attendees learned about the latest advances in membrane science and engineering.  Overall, NAMS-ICIM 2010 featured 40 technical sessions with 190 oral presentations as well as two evening poster sessions for the almost 300 poster presentations.   The conference theme, "Membranes: Enabling a Sustainable Future," was highlighted with two excellent plenary lectures, one of which focused on water and the other on energy.  The conference theme attracted a large number of presentations and posters in diverse areas.  Two sessions on the state-of-the-art and future directions in water treatment and gas separation membranes provided a strong start for the research presentations.  The sessions directed to sustainability included three on water treatment, two on membrane fouling, and three on gas separation with carbon dioxide abatement as a major focus.  Sessions on fuel cells and batteries and on hydrogen recovery added to the emphasis on sustainability.  The research presented in these sessions, as well as other work described during NAMS/ICIM 2010 places membrane science in the midst of current sustainability efforts.    This conference represented a new direction as the North American Membrane Society partnered with the International Conferences on Inorganic Membranes for the first-ever joint conference.  As a result, the meeting featured sessions on inorganic membranes (three) as well as input for many other sessions, particularly those on multifunctional, mixed-matrix and high temperature membranes and membrane reactors.  The comprehensive technical program attracted a large number of students who not only took advantage of the unique learning opportunities but also capitalized on the chance for one-on-one interactions with national and international leaders in membrane science and engineering.  In addition, the meeting featured extensive participation by students, in both the oral and poster presentation sessions.  Student achievements were well-recognized via the 14 awards and certificates received by student poster competition winners.   The $10,000 award from the National Science Foundation was used to provide 40 stipends of $250 to U.S. graduate students who participated in the meeting via an oral or poster presentation.  Awards were made to all eligible students who applied without regard to gender, ethnicity, geographic region or disability status.  Additional support for student attendance and activities was provided by the Office of Naval Research.  Their meeting experience enabled students to return to their U.S. universities with increased technical insights that could be incorporated into their graduate research as well as renewed enthusiasm for a career in membrane science and engineering.
