<AbstractNarration>In the cities of the southwestern United States, regional warming combined with increasing urban populations and the resulting urban heat effect are straining limited supplies of electricity and water. Cities can be designed that are more resilient, minimizing human impacts and energy and water stresses, under scenarios of decadal warming trends. However, improved micro-scale climate models that resolve urban landscape hydrology, vegetation dynamics and patch-scale water and energy balances are needed to support the design of these resilient urban systems; funds are provided to create and validate a modeling system capable of resolving these dynamics. The tRIBS land surface hydrology model will be modified for urban environments and coupled with the vertically nested WRF 3.2 mesoscale and microclimate model. The combined model will be used to test the efficacy of different urban green-space and neighborhood designs under climate change scenarios with respect to the water and energy balance, demand for and optimal application of irrigation water, patch-scale air temperatures and humidities, and urban flooding responses. This newly coupled model will transform the design of urban neighborhoods to be quantifiably more adaptive and resilient to all types of decadal climate change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will demonstrate the technical feasibility, empirical validity, and computational tractability of this approach using neighborhoods in Phoenix, AZ as case studies. The microclimate predictions of the model will be useful to predict neighborhood-level human health and social impacts, water and energy use, urban heat island effects, and urban flooding, in neighborhoods in cities around the world. The potential social benefits of this research include a research tool that can empirically validate, quantitative design of urban neighborhoods that are more resilient to climate change and other future challenges (i.e. water or energy shortages), allows the optimization of neighborhoods that minimize water and energy use, mitigate heat island impacts, and improve social and health outcomes. This modeling tool can change cities by making them adaptive by design.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Through investigations of Phoenix, AZ microclimate dynamics we have shown these urban microclimates are influenced by land cover and management decisions, these changes influence both temperature and water usage, and that these changes are related to heart related health incidents. By coupling environmental sensors from multiple platforms we could develop and validate satellite-based evaporation estimates at a 30m and daily resolution.  These new products provide information on where in the landscape urban residents are using water and also provide important data for evaluation of process based weather models.  We also obtained new high resolution land surface temperature data for the entire Phoenix, AZ metropolitan region.  We conducted geographical overlays of these data with a high resolution land cover map, government parcel boundaries, and household surveys.  Through this linkage we showed the importance of vegetation for cooling land surface temperatures during the day.  These land cover and local microclimate patterns were also correlated with self-reported heat related health incidents &ndash; residents in hotter parcels suffered more negative consequences of heat.  The products of our work show the wide variation of urban microclimate patterns, the local causes of urban microclimate variation, and the consequences of this variation to society.  Our work contributed to an improved understanding of the patterns of urban energy balance and its associated influence on urban water use and temperatures.  These two aspects represent a trade-off in identifying sustainable patterns of urbanization &ndash; cooling local microclimates through increasing vegetation requires associated increases in water.  The broader impacts of this work are directly related to decision making for improved urban sustainability in the face of increasing temperatures and less predictable water supplies.  Training associated with this project improved skills of research scientists are were further incorporated into the undergraduate curriculum at UCR.
