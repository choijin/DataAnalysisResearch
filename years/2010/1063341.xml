<AbstractNarration>Project Description: This proposal requests support for a workshop to review and suggest improvements in the instrumentation used in the Surveys of Public Attitudes Toward and Understanding of Science and Technology. The proposed workshop will bring together survey methodologists, polling and public opinion experts, and scientific subject matter experts at NSF headquarters in Arlington. The participants will discuss and evaluate the conceptual framework underlying the Public Knowledge of Science (PKS) questions that are routinely part of the Science and Engineering Indicators (SEI) bi-annual report.  The goal of the workshop will be to assess the content of the PKS question set with an eye toward making sure that the question set more adequately reflects public knowledge of science and to correct any errors and reduce any biases in the existing PKS questions. In addition to brief presentations by NSF personnel and invited scientific experts, the workshop will include discussion groups that focus on specific challenges. The two-day workshop will ultimately lead to the production of a focused report that will be delivered to NSF and to the National Science Board (NSB).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The results from the Surveys of Public Attitudes Toward and Understanding of Science and Technology have long been included in the NSB's biannual Science and Engineering Indicators, a report which goes directly to the White House and informs public debate about science education and public support of science in the United States. It is vital that the reported survey results be based on sound, tested survey questions that ask about the right issues and measure the key concepts that reveal public understanding of science--or the lack thereof. The proposed workshop will review and improve key items on the survey and align these instruments more closely with the relevant concepts. These improvements will allow for a more revealing and more robust assessment of public understanding in future editions of the Science Indicators report and serve as a more reliable guide for future science policy in the United States.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF Workshop on Public Knowledge of Science:  Project Outcomes Report, 17 May 2012     The National Science Foundation measures public knowledge of science, and then reports that information in the biennial Science &amp; Engineering Indicators, published by the National Science Board.  In 2010, the National Science Board requested that NSF conduct two workshops to take a "fresh look at the objective, purpose and underlying assumptions" of the measures of public knowledge of science.  The first workshop was charged to reexamine the conceptual framework of public knowledge of science as reported in the Indicators.  This was organized and chaired by Dr. Chris Toumey of the University of South Carolina.  The expertise of the participants included science communication, science education, informal science education, survey research methods, science policy, learning-and-cognition, and science-and-culture.  It met in October 2010, and a report titled "Science in the Service of Citizens &amp; Consumers" was submitted to NSF in November 2010 ( http://nano.sc.edu/resources/publications.aspx ).      This workshop noted that for twenty-five years, a conceptual framework called "civic scientific literacy" measured public knowledge of science as a reflection of a proportion of the knowledge that working scientists possess.  Each time, the knowledge possessed by the public (that is, nonscientists) was a small fraction of that possessed by scientists, as if a person in the public was a micro-scientist in terms of scientific knowledge.  This lead to  stories with titles like "AmericaÆs Scientific illiterates" or "The Dismal State of Scientific Literacy".      The workshop then explored ways to improve the conceptual framework by incorporating recent thought about relations between science and the public.  One insight that was especially salient was that persons in the public have different reasons for acquiring scientific knowledge and using it.      From this, the workshop concluded that the process of measuring and reporting public knowledge of science should start with the question of what knowledge a person in the public needs, whether for civic engagement with science and science policy, or for making individual decisions about oneÆs life or health, or for feeding oneÆs curiosity about science.  This new framework was named "science in the service of citizens &amp; consumers".  Note that its starting point is different from that of the framework of "civic scientific literacy" (although there is considerable overlap in the kinds of data to be collected for either framework).      Several consequences follow from the framework of "science in the service of citizens &amp; consumers".  First, its basis is not what the public ought to know about science in general (and how little science persons in the public know), but rather what knowledge persons in the public need in various roles and circumstances.     A related point is that the public is not a homogeneous entity.  There are various levels of formal education and multiple levels of encountering science through informal science education.  Topics of interest will differ.      Thus public knowledge of science is largely topical.  It does not arise from the same needs as the content of a science textbook.  On the contrary, it arises when a citizen or a consumer is curious, concerned, or excited about a particular scientific topic.  Related to the topical character of public knowledge of science is the point that nonscientists can often acquire, comprehend and employ the relevant scientific knowledge when they have to.      After the workshop report was delivered to NSF, it was made available on the internet as a pdf document: Science in the Service of Citizens &amp; Consumers ( http://nano.sc.edu/resources/publications.aspx ).  NSF staff presented an oral summary of the report to the National Science Board in December 2010 and a written summary in February 2011.  In an article in Science  ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
