<AbstractNarration>Landsberg and Robles will continue their joint work in applying and advancing exterior differential systems (EDS). In particular they will complete their determination of the projective rigidity of rational homogeneous varieties, study questions regarding invariant differential operators (e.g., what is the image of the Killing operator on a Riemannian manifold?), and further the connections between Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand (BGG) resolutions and EDS. Robles will will identify necessary and sufficient conditions on curvature for the metric on a Riemannian 4-manifold to admit orthogonal coordinates, and determine geometric representatives of homology classes in Riemannian manifolds. Landsberg will work on problems originating in complexity theory and signal processing, in particular determining equations for secant varieties of homogeneous varieties, and establishing properties of the Mulmuley-Sohoni varieties associated to the determinant and permanant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Differential geometry may be thought of as the study of geometric objects "under a microscope" (i.e., infinitesimally). Landsberg and Robles are especially interested in geometric objects with symmetry. Over the last 40 years significant advances have been made in representation theory, which systematically studies symmetry (e.g., the BGG machinery), and these advances will be applied by the PIs to establish properties of systems of partial differential equations arising in differential geometry.  Individually, the PIs will use also use differential geometry and representation theory to work on problems in topology (Robles), in theoretical computer science (Landsberg and Robles) and signal processing (Landsberg).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Landsberg applied methods from theoretical mathematics (representation theory,differential and algebraic geometry) to problems in computer science. Nearly all computation in science and technology involves linear algebra, and the basic operation of linear algebra is matrix multiplication. The standard algorithm for multiplying n-by-n matrices (row/column multiplication) uses on the order of n^3 arithmetic operations. In 1969 Strassen discovered that this algorithm is not optimal, a discovery that has spawned a significant amount ofresearch to determine just what is optimal. It is a fundamental question to determine just how fast matrices can be multiplied. Implementable fast algorithms would have a significant effect on the ability to carry out calculations across scientific disciplines.  This fundamental question can be broken into two questions: determining lower bounds and upper bounds. Landsberg made fundamental contributions to determining lower bounds, proving the first new lower bound in 30 years under DMS 1006353 with co-author Ottaviani.  A central theoretical question in computer science is the P v NP problem ofdetermining if a problem whose solution can be easily verified also admitsa fast algorithm for solution. It is widely believed that this is not thecase, were it true it would have dramatic and far reaching consequences,in particular, all currently used cryptography would become obsolete.  Algebraic and geometric variants of the P v NP problem have been posed by Valiant and Mulmuley-Sohoni. These conjectures are out of reach at the moment and current work is centered around building mathematical foundations with which to attack them. Landsberg, with his collaborators, have made central contributions towards building this foundation.  A subject in geometry for hundreds of years has been to recognize geometric objects from infinitesimal information. During the grant period, overa series of papers, Landsberg and Robles obtained a solution to thisproblem when the geometric objects are projective homogeneous varieties.  The basic geometric objects of study in Algebraic Geometry are solutions to polynomial equations.  In additional to being a central and important field within mathematics, Algebraic Geometry has applications to many areas of science and technology.  Robles work applies techniques of two other areas of mathematics (differential geometry, which has its foundations in calculus, and representation theory, which has its foundations in linear algebra) to better understand subtle properties of these solutions.
