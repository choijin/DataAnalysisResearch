<AbstractNarration>Dr. David Bennett will continue the microlensing planet search program at the University of Notre Dame in collaboration with several research teams around the world.  Mirolensing is a gravitational phenomenon which produces a significant amplification of the brightness of a distant star when another star passes almost directly in front of it.  The latter star is called the "lens," and the manner in which the distant star's brightness rises and falls during a microlensing event can be used to detect planets around the (generally unseen) lens star.  In this project, Dr. Bennett will work to improve the analysis techniques used to detect planets, in particular to increase the number of planets detected in future microlensing events and to model the amplification from binary or multiple-planet lenses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will emphasize international collaboration, since microlensing observations are performed by many different groups worldwide. The PI will transfer his technical expertise and software to the international scientific community to ensure that those who provide the hardware for this project will also share in the scientific discovery, and to enable new investigators to learn the technical details of microlensing analysis.  The impact of the project also extends to amateur scientists and the general public.</AbstractNarration>
