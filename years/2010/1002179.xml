<AbstractNarration>Objective: The objective of this GOALI project is to initiate integrated research in the related fields of optical design and testing to support a transformational technology - Optical surface finishing based on slurry with magnetic properties. This GOALI will specifically transform the field by moving well beyond the near term goals to research and then apply key new technologies to the U.S.-based manufacture of optics that are not rotationally symmetric, including fully freeform surfaces.  These types of surfaces have yet to be economically manufactured with precision for use with emerging Gigapixel detectors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: There are a number of fronts available to advance science.  First, there are the new surface definitions proposed by QED to provide a valid mathematical basis for developing manufacturing tolerances on the complex surface parameters.  Second, there is the ongoing work at the University of Rochester to develop and disseminate the technology surrounding Nodal Aberration Theory that provides revolutionary insight into the fundamental theory of optical systems without symmetry. In addition, there is ongoing active research in finding novel, in-situ testing methods for these new surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: The footprint of this program is substantial.  It covers advancing simultaneously the industries that enable higher performance optical systems in support of other advancing technologies, for example high-definition video, remote sensing with Gigapixel sensors, and optical lithography for making computers faster and smaller. Expanding beyond the opportunity to influence the lives of graduate students, the program will also incorporate research experiences for undergraduates, aimed specifically at underrepresented minorities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Freeform Optics is an emerging technology in the optics and photonics industry where surfaces that make the optical elements of a system - think of your camera lens or your telescope - are no longer rotationally symmetric.  In a camera lens, the old way makes it such that everything seems to be mounted in barrels.  In a telescope, reflective optics is used because large lenses are hard to make and using reflective optics makes the telescope less thermally sensitive. Yet, telescopes are limited by their small field of view and obscuration that is required when reflective optics is used in a barrel like mount.  By allowing the surfaces to depart from symmetry, we can now transform the 1D barrel into a 3D package that may resemble a ball, remove obscuration, and as such make the instrument more efficient and sensitive.   There are a number of fronts available to advance science.  First, there are the new surface definitions and mathematics, where some of them will also enable the testing of these more complex surfaces as proposed by QED, and perhaps more importantly, they may provide a valid mathematical basis for developing manufacturing tolerances on the complex surface parameters.  Second, there is the ongoing work at the University of Rochester in collaboration with Synopsys to develop and disseminate the technology surrounding Nodal Aberration Theory (NAT) that provides revolutionary insight into the fundamental theory of optical systems without symmetry, first discovered in the 1980s, and only now emerging as a prevalent research area in the field of freeform optics  In addition, there is ongoing active research in both the theory of optical finishing and in finding novel, preferably in-situ testing methods for these new surfaces.   In this research we innovated in the design, fabrication and metrology of a first freeform optical telescope, 30 mm in aperture, F/1.9, composed of three mirrors approximately located on a triangle.  This telescope has, unlike conventional telescopes, no obscuration. The fact that the telescope is all reflective allowed to work in various bands of the spectrum.  The prototype aimed to possibly span from the visible to mid-infrared with high resolution using an uncooled detector across the full band, a major advantage of the approach taken.  We completed the entire manufacturing chain of this telescope from design, fabrication of the surfaces, metrology and full assembly and each step of the process was disseminated to the public in a set of three publications readily accessible on internet.  In addition to develop the methods and processes to accomplish the full assembly of this telescope, we developed and disseminated our understanding of freeform surface shapes as well as the image plane theory of freeform aberrations that led to an additional publication. Moving forward, these theories may guide the design of any freeform system to be investigated. Another partner industry Optimax contributed their understanding of tolerances for manufacture.
