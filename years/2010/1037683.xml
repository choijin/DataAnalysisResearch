<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project seeks to extend the use of concept inventories as formative assessment in electrical engineering classes.  The project brings together experts in this formative evaluation technique to create a "content-driven assessment guide" that will, in the second phase of the project, help other faculty adopt formative assessment into their classrooms.  The assessment guide is a deliverable of the project and may serve to further spread this method of assessment in engineering programs. The project also will evaluate factors related to the adoption of formative assessment in engineering courses to provide insight into the factors related to adoption or non-adoption of proven assessment methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project will be to create a network of faculty who have expertise in formative assessment using concept inventories across at least five universities.  The content-driven assessment guide will be broadly disseminated using several electronic libraries to further stimulate use of concept inventories.  The guide may serve to help adoption of concept inventories in other engineering disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of the project was the creation, implementation, and study of small faculty teaching development groups. The focus of the project was to study how instructional development for faculty and documentation of faculty expertise can be structured to promote sustained incorporation of interactive pedagogy in engineering classrooms. The project was designed around monthly meetings of a team of faculty experts in year one and monthly meetings of satellite faculty development groups (led by members of the expert team) in year two. Outcomes of the project include a model for developing and documenting teaching expertise and a compilation of case study vignettes designed to explain and illustrate teaching strategies and methods grounded in educational research and practice that encourage interactive engineering classrooms.  The study was designed to address the following research questions:  1. What is the nature of the progress of a small group of invested faculty focused on interactive pedagogy?  2. How do faculty experienced in interactive pedagogy analyze student learning?  The first question became the core of what we investigated over the life of the project. The second question evolved into understanding how faculty implemented teaching strategies that provided more formative assessment data and information about studentsÃ† learning in an ongoing fashion.  This project has broadened the use of evidence-based teaching practices through the ongoing participation of 21 engineering faculty in teaching development groups. The project has also provided opportunities for a larger number of instructors to learn about and implement evidence-based teaching strategies through panels and interactive workshops at participating institutions.  The project as a whole provided professional development for teaching to undergraduate and graduate engineering and physics instructors at four institutions. Throughout the project, members of the faculty expert team have shared techniques, discussed challenges, and broadened and enhanced their understanding of how formative assessment tasks can be incorporated in the classroom. In year two, a new set of instructors (including one graduate student) were introduced to innovative classroom techniques via the local faculty development groups. The instructors who participated in these groups learned about student learning and engineering education research, had an opportunity to try new techniques in the classroom and refine them based on their experiences and the feedback of other group members, and produced documentation of their experience in adopting evidence-based strategies.  To facilitate sharing of knowledge generated through the project, we have developed the SIMPLE design framework for building and leading successful teaching development groups. The SIMPLE framework collects a set of principles, synthesized during feedback meetings with faculty expert team, for success of teaching development groups. The SIMPLE principles are described below:  Sustainable - constructed logistically to meet the needs of the instructors  Incremental change - successful change can happen slowly, over a long period of time  Mentoring - small learning community with facilitator and feedback  People-driven - organized around the needs and interests of STEM faculty  Learning Environments - create interaction between students and instructors  Design focused &ndash; faculty document their interactive teaching process  The findings of this work address the need to transfer results from engineering education research about interactive and formative teaching methods to the classrooms of engineering educators. The creation of the SIMPLE model for teaching development groups provides a framework and guiding principles to other institutions attempting similar teaching communities of practice or professional learning communities. It is a structure that draws on models such as diffusion of innovations (Rogers, 2003) ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
