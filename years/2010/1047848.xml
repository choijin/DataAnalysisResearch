<AbstractNarration>This symposium will honor Dr. Steve Plimpton, Sandia National Lab, who is the primary developer of the LAMMPS molecular dynamics (MD) simulator (http://lammps.sandia.gov/).  LAMMPS is an open-source, massively parallel MD code that is extremely computationally efficient, contains numerous potentials that enable it to model many different materials, and is freely distributed to the technical community.  Consequently, it is widely used and is regarded as the standard by which other MD codes are compared.  Dr. Plimpton has done a great service to the technical science and engineering community by developing, freely disseminating, and maintaining the LAMMPS software.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed special symposium would highlight the large amount of work performed using LAMMPS and honor Dr. Plimpton's contributions to the community.  Contributions will be stressed  that utilize  the benefits of large scale atomic level simulations for understanding  basic materials phenomena, stressing the fact that using  parallel techniques,  atomistic simulations can now reach  experimental length scales.  The symposium will take place in San Diego, as part of the TMS Spring Meeting, Feb 27 to March 3, 2011.  The symposium has already been endorsed by the TMS/ASM Computer Simulation Committee.  The abstracts will be submitted through the normal TMS procedures.  We expect to have six sessions for this symposium, including both invited and contributed speakers.</AbstractNarration>
