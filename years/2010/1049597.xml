<AbstractNarration>Midwest Verification Day (MVD) is an informal regional workshop, started by the PIs in 2009, with the goal of cultivating a regional research network in verification and formal methods.  A chief concern is to provide a forum for students to present their formal-methods research in a supportive setting, and network with colleagues at other regional institutions.  The program for MVD, spanning one and a half days, will consist mostly of student talks, but also include two invited talks by senior researchers.  A social program is also planned, to encourage interaction among students and faculty.  MVD is colocating with a local-chapter IEEE meeting on industrial formal methods, presented by industrial researchers from nearby Rockwell Collins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MVD will foster collaboration, student development, recruiting, and exchange of ideas in formal methods and verification, in the Midwest region of the country.  Experience with similar events in other fields strongly suggests they play a crucial role in creating a vibrant regional research community, and offer invaluable opportunities for students.  MVD will help develop talent within the region, and attract it from outside, in the industrially important area of verification.  By connecting students with faculty from other regional institutions, MVD will strengthen opportunities for undergraduates to go on to graduate study, and help prepare regional graduate students for success in the international research community.  The industrial connection with the local-IEEE meeting and Rockwell Collins will contribute to the long-term development of economically important interactions between industry and academia.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Midwest Verification Day (MVD) is a regional workshop addressing the topic of verification, a field of Computer Science concerned with advanced methods for ensuring the quality of systems including software, hardware, communication protocols, and other formal computational artifacts.  Methods include automatically finding software errors, proving that software will always exhibit some desired (and formally specified) behavior, and many variations on those themes.  The goal of MVD is to bring together researchers working on different approaches to verification, from the Midwest region of the country.  The emphasis of the workshop is on giving students, primarily at the graduate level but also undergraduates, a chance to present their research in front of a supportive audience, and make new connections with colleagues in the field.  MVD was first organized by Prof. Aaron Stump and Prof. Cesare Tinelli at The University of Iowa in 2009.  This report concerns the second edition of the workshop, held in 2010 at The University of Iowa.  Since then, a third edition has been held September, 2011, at The University of Minnesota, organized by Prof.  Michael Whalen and Dr. Andrew Gacek.  A fourth edition for 2012 is being planned (at the time of this writing).  Around 50 people attended MVD '10 as registered participants: 10 University professors, 6 industrial researchers, 4 postdoctoral researchers, and 30 students, almost all at the doctoral level.  These attendees came from many different institutions in the Midwest and nearby states: Iowa State, Purdue, Rice, Rockwell Collins, The University of Iowa, The University of Kansas, The University of Colorado at Boulder, The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, The University of Minnesota, The University of Missouri, The University of Nebraska at Lincoln, and The University of Northern Iowa.  Support was also provided by Rockwell Collins and NEC Labs, with Dr. Nishant Sinha of NEC Labs giving one of the two invited talks; the other was given by Prof. Jan Vitek of Purdue.  The funds provided by the NSF were used to give travel grants to these attendees, with almost all awards going to students and postdoctoral researchers.  MVD 2010 succeeded in its goal of creating a vibrant intellectual meeting, in a supportive and welcoming Midwest environment.  Many attendees commented on the high quality of the student presentations, and there were many lively interactions between researchers and students meeting for the first time, or renewing previous acquaintances.  MVD 2010 made a valuable contribution to the goal of creating a strong regional research network in verification, with industrial connections.  Such a network will help strengthen regional collaborations among faculty, and networking and employment opportunities for students. For the significant number of students who originate in the Midwest, MVD helps build the connections to advance further in academia or make a strong contribution in industry. This in turn helps strengthen the domestic talent pool for verification and advanced software engineering, with the long-term goal of strengthening the position of the United States in this industrially important area of Computer Science.
