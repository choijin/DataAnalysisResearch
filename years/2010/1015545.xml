<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the EAPSI/KSI 2010 summer I was able to meet numerous cultural and research goals.  The changes in endothelial cell basement membrane alignment in a high glucose modified system has not been investigated&mdash;making out work novel and with high impact. Additionally, ascertaining how the mechanistic controls are changing along the Rho pathway will provide new insight into the control of alignment in response to strain and also how diabetic high glucose induces endothelial cell dysfunction.  Culturally, I immersed myself in the culture off-campus and also the research culture on campus. I am confident that I was able to absorb enough of the culture to have a good ongoing familiarity in discussions and interacting with Koreans abroad and in the research world. I made professional contacts and learned about the Korean academic system and postdoctoral process for future professional consideration. Finally, and most important I was able to learn portions of the Korean language which I am sure will continue to prove beneficial. I was also able to assist the Korean lab members in practicing their English and conference (international conferences) speaking abilities.  Overall the project was a success, as most of the goals were met and a future partnership has been formed.       Last Modified: 02/05/2014       Submitted by: Dannielle S Figueroa]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
