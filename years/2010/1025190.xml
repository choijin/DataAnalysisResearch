<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project will investigate synergistic learning, the processes by which students integrate disparate aspects of learning into a coherent whole.  The work will be conducted through curriculum innovation over four years of an environmental engineering program at the University of Georgia.   The main mechanism is establishing ?Synthesis and Design Studios? to integrate disparate knowledge from STEM, humanities, and social science courses.  The project also seeks to understand the mechanisms of synergistic learning and integrating this understanding into a meta-theory that connects learning theory with engineering education.  In particular the project seeks to understand the ?Ah Ha!? moments when various fragments of knowledge fall into place.  The project builds on a strong link between engineering education research in the area of synergistic learning and pedagogical methods and the Synthesis and Design Studios students take for all four years of the program?s curriculum.</AbstractNarration>

Have you taught a course and been frustrated when students did not apply concepts that they learned in previous courses? To begin to understand the answers to these questions around what we call synergistic learning, we conducted an educational research project within the context of an innovative, transdisciplinary Synthesis and Design Studio that enrolled environmental engineering, art education, and landscape architecture undergraduate and graduate students. This context afforded a unique opportunity to observe and research studentsÆ synergistic learning experiences&mdash;the ways that disparate learning "comes together in studentsÆ heads."  This research topic is critical as the fragmentation of the curriculum is understood to be a significant barrier to high quality education but little research has been conducted, especially within the context of engineering, to better understand how students make connections in their own learning.     From the qualitative data analysis, three key features of synergistic learning processes emerged and have been disseminated in a range of research publications:  1. Synergistic learning      processes are, oftentimes, undergirded by deeply personal processes of      student development: A number of synergistic processes were related to students making      connection between, for example, aspects of their engineering learning,      and ways of thinking promoted in artistic exploration.

In addition to the achievements in terms of curriculum innovation, the project also produced significant methodological contributions. More specifically, the development and dissemination of a visual-verbal narrative analysis method to capture a richer view on students' experiences contributed to the methodological...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
