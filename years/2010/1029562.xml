<AbstractNarration>Current network-centric Internet service model is prone to&lt;br/&gt;resource exhausting attacks such as Distributed Denial of&lt;br/&gt;Services attacks. Due to the resource sharing nature and&lt;br/&gt;non-coordinated monitoring capability of the current Internet,&lt;br/&gt;it is difficult to quickly identify attack sources. Second, a&lt;br/&gt;new trend is to develop a user-centric Internet service model,&lt;br/&gt;in which traditional local network services are outsourced to&lt;br/&gt;remote service providers such as for cloud services. This new&lt;br/&gt;trend allows end users to fully control remote service nodes,&lt;br/&gt;their interconnections and routing, which imposes great threats&lt;br/&gt;on network resource allocations. Thus, it is highly desired&lt;br/&gt;that the future Internet is designed to provide a secure&lt;br/&gt;service domain that is both network-centric and user-centric.&lt;br/&gt;As a fundamental core to this goal, a secure and resilient&lt;br/&gt;virtualized routing architecture in a global inter-networking&lt;br/&gt;environment is explored to provide network resource reservation&lt;br/&gt;protection both at the network-centric and the user-centric&lt;br/&gt;level. A novel attribute-based, cryptography-based approach to&lt;br/&gt;construct secure virtualization is to be developed.&lt;br/&gt;Furthermore, an architectural solution to address the policy&lt;br/&gt;enforcement and inter-domain trust management is also&lt;br/&gt;considered. The end goal is to greatly improve the efficiency&lt;br/&gt;of attack monitoring and intrusion detection and to increase&lt;br/&gt;the resiliency of the future Internet. This is a collaborative&lt;br/&gt;exploratory project bringing together researchers from the&lt;br/&gt;University of Missouri-Kansas City, Arizona State University,&lt;br/&gt;and Osaka City University, Japan. All research results will be&lt;br/&gt;made available to the scientific community.</AbstractNarration>
