<AbstractNarration>This award supports a series of teacher workshops associated with six future International Linear Collider (ILC) meetings over the next three years.   Two of the workshops are anticipated to take place in the US and four overseas.  The anticipated workshops will be associated with the October 2010 Linear Collider Workshop (LCW) in Geneva, Switzerland, at the March 2011 American Linear Collider Physics Group (ALCPG) Workshop at the University of Oregon, and at similar, additional professional meetings associated with ILC R&amp;D.   The workshops will allow participants to become familiar with the QuarkNet cosmic ray detector and the I2U2 e-Lab data portal that provides data analysis tools and a facility for sharing data from these classroom detectors. The teachers will become part of the e-Lab community, allow their students to use the system and foreshadow an ILC E&amp;O program that will include e-Labs. Data for this program can come from R&amp;D tests or from runs of the ILC.   This award is cofounded by the Education and Interdisciplinary Research program and the Elementary Particle Physics program within the Physics Division.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Teacher workshops have been organized in conjunction with International Linear Collider meetings over the last four years, based on support from the National Science Foundation. Teachers attending these workshops have assembled cosmic ray muon detectors for use in their classrooms. The efforts of these teacher workshops resonate with the large community of ILC researchers. The teachers explore the tools needed to probe for deeper understanding of the nature of the universe. The scientists attending the ILC meetings are after the same goal and offer the teachers a glimpse of the building excitement in the field.  The workshops allow teachers to construct simple classroom cosmic ray detectors (CRMD) and use them to make simple measurements. This allows the teachers to reacquaint themselves with the habits of mind needed to "do" science. This in turn helps them to look for ways to allow the same for their students.  As the workshop program developed, the QuarkNet staff working with it made two decisions. The first was to focus the latter set of workshops on Japan in order to foster long-term relationships with teachers that had been building since the first workshop in Nagoya in 2006. Building on these relationships has allowed for the sort of long-term engagement that impacts teaching practice and, in particular, the use of the cosmic ray detectors and e-Lab. The second was to introduce more material directly related to ILC to the workshops to be in phase with the growing excitement in Japan after the announcement of the recommended siting of the accelerator north of Sendai in the Iwate Prefecture. The skills built by the QuarkNet staff in working on international masterclasses were harnessed to pilot similar student investigations to introduce ILC physics.  Additional workshops were organized for students.  Specifically, the workshops were the following  2012 &ndash; Kyungpook National University, Daegu, Korea 2013 &ndash; Universidad San Francisco de Quito, Ecuador 2013 &ndash; University of Tokyo, Japan 2014 &ndash; University of Tokyo, Japan (also Shizuoka and Sendai) 2015 &ndash; University of Tokyo, Japan (also Shizuoka and Sendai)   This project also supported participation in the education and outreach activities at  ICHEP, Valencia, Spain, 2014 ICNFP, Chania, Greece, 2014 Athens, Greece working group meeting, 2014           Last Modified: 12/30/2015       Submitted by: James E Brau]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
