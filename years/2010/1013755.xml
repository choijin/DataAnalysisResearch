<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will develop a Liquid Tin Anode Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (LTA-SOFC) to generate energy from biomass.  The LTA-SOFC is an advanced fuel cell that has improved efficiency of directly generating electrical power from fuels such as biomass, diesel, natural gas, and coal.  This project will study the efficiency of an LTA-SOFC to produce electricity from biomass for long periods of time, and to increase the power from Kilo Watts to Mega Watts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the development of an efficient and cost effective electric power generating system based on the direct use of biomass.  In addition, the LTA-SOFC will reduce carbon emissions.</AbstractNarration>
