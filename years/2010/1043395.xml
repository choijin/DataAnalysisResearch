<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers will explore the use of a distributed temperature sensing monitoring system (DTS), using fiber-optical (FO) technology, as the basis of a sustainable, sub-ice cavity sensing array. FO cable systems, such as may be deployed through a hot-water drilled hole through an ice shelf, passing through the underlying cavity to the sea floor, are capable of measuring temperatures down fiber at 1 meter intervals, and at time frequencies as high as 15 seconds. DTS FO systems operate via optical time domain reflectometry along the fiber waveguide using inelastic  backscatter of coherent laser light as a probe beam in the FO environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The introduction of new technologies to the harsh environmental conditions of the Antarctic are often associated with high risk. However, the potential rewards of this approach (e.g. multiyear capability, minimal submerged mechanical or electrical components that may fail, relative simplicity of deployment and measurement principle, yet yielding distributed real time and spatial observation) are attractive enough to conduct a pilot project at a field-ready location (McMurdo). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current indications are that the instability of some of the world's largest ice sheets located around the Antarctic and Greenland may be caused by the presence of warming, deep ocean waters, shoaling over continental shelves, and melting the underside of floating ice shelves. Additional knowledge of the temporal and spatial variability of the temperature fields underneath terminal ice shelves, such as those draining the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, are needed to accurately project future global climate effects on ice-shelf ocean interactions, and in order to inform societal and technological aspects of adaption to changing sea-level.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The largest uncertainty in future global sea level resides with the fate of the massive ice sheets, Greenland and Antarctica, which hold large potential for raising sea level in the coming centuries.  Such change could happen relatively rapidly if warm ocean waters flow beneath the periphery of these ice sheets, where they meet the ocean at features known as ice shelves that extend and float out over the ocean at such locations.    In order to understand how warm waters can and do arrive beneath such ice shelves, and thereby force rapid basal melting, this project sought to deploy an extensive temperature sensing device beneath an ice shelf as a pilot project to see if such technology is scalable and workable to be deployed on a large scale in future monitoring studies of ice shelf melting.  The technology chosen for this project is the so-called DTS (distributed temperature sensing) fibre-optic cable which is capable of measuring temperature at every one-meter at a reasonably good accuracy of better than 0.1 degree Centigrade.  Access through the ice shelf was achieved via mechanical drill through a 200 m thickness.  Subsequently, an almost 1000 meter fiber optical cable was deployed.  A surface-side computer recorded the temperature all along the length of the vertical cable every 6 hours, during a more than one-year period.  The resulting depth-time series of sub ice shelf temperature shows that this technology is indeed capable of carrying out year-round sub ice shelf ocean temperature measurements, and could in principle be deployed on a much wider and larger scale.
