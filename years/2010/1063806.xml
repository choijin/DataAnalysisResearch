<AbstractNarration>This work examines the role of university research in chemical sciences in the post Bayh-Dole era by combining unique data about funding sources, scientific publishing, invention disclosing, patenting and licensing, and utilization and commercialization of university inventions. The work sheds light on: &lt;br/&gt;(1) The relationship between the nature of research funding sources and university research, knowledge utilization and technology transfer; &lt;br/&gt;(2) The interplay between government funding and industry funding in university research; and&lt;br/&gt;(3) The relationship between IP protection and technology transfer and utilization of university research and inventions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The project advances understanding of the multiple dimensions of University technology transfer. It addresses not only publishing and patenting, but also licensing, further patenting and indicators of commercialization, and relates all these to funding sources of university research.  The research offers a clearer picture of the links between research support, research, and invention, and the ways in which inventions and publications are used in further research by licensees and nonlicensees. The research  investigates not only whether patenting and exclusive licensing are encouraging commercialization by licensees, but also whether they are leading to further research, in the public or private sector. It provides new information about the effect of exclusive licensing on nonlicensee research to obtain a fuller comprehension of the overall effect of exclusivity. The project also provides a methodological platform for future research on university research and technology transfer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts  Few public policy issues are more important than technology transfer of research by the nation's universities to users who convert it into further advances, and development and commercialization of products. The Bayh-Dole Act has been an important factor in the rapid increase in university patenting and licensing in the United States, and has contributed to the current leadership position of the United States in high technology industries including biomedicine and pharmaceuticals, advanced materials and chemistry. It informs further deliberations on university patenting policy by providing better information on the ways in which effective technology transfer is actually occurring. Finally, the project supports the move to "evidence-based" decisions by government on funding and on the merits of increased private sector research support.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There is a general consensus that university research has been one of the most important driving forces for the U.S. innovation system and U.S. competitiveness. Prior to 1980, university scientists in most cases allowed free access to and utilization of research results published in scientific journals. The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 aimed at increasing commercialization of university inventions by facilitating and encouraging university patenting of federally funded inventions and exclusive licensing of their patents.  Our research aims to achieve a better understanding of the role of university patenting and licensing in the post Bayh-Dole era, using Chemical Sciences as a test bed. The research evaluates the impacts of university research from many perspectives, taking into account the nature of funding sources, scientific publishing, invention disclosing, patenting and licensing, and utilization and commercialization of university inventions.  We have acquired a unique dataset of all 21,733 inventions, disclosed to University of California, Office of Technology Transfer from 1975 through 2009. A large portion of the inventions in the database are related to chemical, biochemical or biomedical inventions.  For the disclosures in the database, we have access to information on patenting, licensing and (incomplete) sponsorship.    Using the data, we have conducted studies on: (1) the relationship between research sponsorship and generation and transfer of university inventions; (2) the effect of exclusive licensing on nonlicenseesÆ follow-on research; (3) the effect of publication of university patent applications on licensing of university inventions; and (4) several novel approaches in evaluating patents based on patent data mining and machine learning techniques.  Our research on public versus corporate research sponsorship challenge economists to reconsider presumptions that private sponsorship will reduce the externalities generated by the projects they support. Our work calls into question the assumption that private sponsored research will tend to be licensed more exclusively, and generate less citations by follow-on researchers. The results contribute some empirical content to the debate on the merits and dangers of encouraging corporations to sponsor academic research. The research has significant implications for policies on university research funding, patenting and licensing.  Our research on the informational role of licensing and of publication of applications, suggests the importance of information for subsequent innovation, and the effects of institutional structures on information flows. In particular the research leads to a more positive view of exclusive licensing as a generator of information for non-licensees, and of early publication of patents as a net boost for further research. Our research on patent data mining incorporates data mining and machine-learning techniques into patent evaluation. The concepts, methods and algorithms developed in our research are not only useful for patent data mining and patent evaluation, but also contribute to the general field of data sciences and big data. Our research highlights the importance of access to large data sets regarding academic technology transfer. Hopefully this will encourage diverse institutions to collaborate in making such data available for research in a standardized format that facilitates empirical analysis, while ensuring necessary protection of private information.  The results from our research have been published by or submitted to top general journals such as Nature, top field journals in economics and policy, and top data science conferences. These results could have significant implications for policies and on society beyond science and Technology.
