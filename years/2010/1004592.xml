<AbstractNarration>Direct observation of dark matter will have profound implications in astrophysics and particle physics. By directly observing dark matter particles in our detectors, we will be able to determine the nature of the particles that make up to 83% of the mass of the universe. These studies will offer a unique window on physics beyond the Standard Model, and are complementary to searches for New Physics at the Large Hadron Collider. Direction-sensitive Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) detectors will provide the most convincing evidence for direct observation of dark matter due to their excellent background rejection capabilities. The correlation between the energy and length of the recoil track allows for a powerful rejection of backgrounds due to photons, electrons, and alpha particles. In addition, the correlation between the measured direction of the nuclear recoil and the expected direction of the dark matter wind allows for an efficient rejection of more insidious backgrounds, such as neutrons and solar neutrinos. Finally, directionality can discriminate between various dark matter halo models in our Galaxy, making directional detectors unique observatories for underground WIMP astronomy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide funding to construct a detector that measures the direction of the WIMP particles as well as their recoil energy, to provide an unambiguous observation of dark matter, even in the presence of backgrounds. The detector proposed is DMTPCino, a 1 cubic meter, low-pressure time projection chamber (TPC) with optical readout. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technology can be used for several applications outside particle physics, such as neutron detection for homeland security and defense applications, to scan for potentially hazardous materials through the emission of fission-spectrum neutrons. Applications of the DMTPC principle as an imaging device for medical and biological applications are also under study.  The DMTPCino experiment is ideal for educating and training the next generation of particle physicists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our project aims to detect dark matter by measuring the directon of the dark matter particles.  The direciton of dark matter particles is predicted form galactic rotation curves measured in other galaxies applied to the Milky Way.  In contrst to other dark matter epxeriments, knowing the direction will provide ``smoking gun'' proof of dark matter detection as will as providing important additional information about the dark matter velocity distribution in our galaxy.     The detector concept is described in detail in Battat, et al., 2013.  Since our last report, we have shown how well our idea works by using neutrons to induce nuclear recoils in our detector like those that would be found in dark matter collisions.  We have used our results to estimate the size of a realistic experiment using direciton nuclear recoil.     We have shown that our direcitonal sensitivity does not become significant until nuclear recoil energies reach 150 keV, meaning a competativle experiment will only be ble to use about 3% of nuclear recoils to establish a direction for the incident dark matter.  The loss of directional information at lower energies occurs because the recoiling nucleus suffers hard collisions with other nuclei in the surounding environment, causing the recoiling nucleus to change direction early in its path.
