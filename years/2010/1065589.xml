<AbstractNarration>This award is based on Program Solicitation 04-036, International Research Experiences for Students (IRES),  will support participation of students from Central Washington University in conservation-biology research projects at the Mt. Huangshan field station in China.  The research involves the study of Tibetan macaques in a conservation park. Students will investigate primate genetics as they relate to the behavior of the monkeys, and the work will be integrated to provide guidance on preservation of the species, especially in an environment that brings them into contact with human observers. The overall objective of the ongoing collaborative research program, which applies behavioral and genetic studies to develop guidelines for conservation of endangered species, is to develop guidelines for management of ecotourism areas. Two graduate students and three undergraduates will spend four weeks at the field station in each of the three years of the program. Students will be prepared on their home campus and required to develop a research plan prior to traveling, and they will receive professional mentoring throughout and after the international experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project takes advantage of the on-going collaborative research program with  Anhui University in China, and the students will be able to interact directly and immediately with researchers at the field site. The research approach is comprehensive and multidisciplinary and aims to understand the effects of interactions within primate communities and with human observers, such as transmission of disease.  The scientific work will be integrated to provide guidance on preservation of the species and to develop scientifically informed recommendations for management of nature parks.</AbstractNarration>

Conservation programs must be situated in local ecologies and cultures, but case studies such as this one can prove helpful in the design of nature tourism programs at other sites where such programs represent the last and perhaps best hope for speciesÆ survival.  Extent to which the project involved creative, original, or potentially transformative concepts: This project entailed development of creative, culturally-informed and -sensitive approaches to wildlife monitoring and management at a macaque tourist site. Tibetan macaques have great significance to Chinese people. They figure prominently in tales of the Monkey King, and revered president Deng Xiaoping was reportedly spiritually and politically affected by his Mt.

Adequacy of resources to carry out the project, team leadersÆ qualifications, and measurement of project success: The long term relationship between the two universities involved in this grant ensured a nearly seamless process with respect to the logistics of getting to the field, collecting data, and writing up the results of the research. All researchers used non-invasive, observational methods consistent with China and US wildlife laws protecting threatened and endangered species. Central WA U faculty and students submitted research protocols to CentralÆs Institutional Care and Use Committee (and Human Subjects, where appropriate) prior to data collection. Central WA U and Anhui U staff developed Memoranda of Understanding that provided the foundation for inter-institutional collaboration.  Dr. Li Jinhua was the leader of the Anhui U research team, and Dr. Lori Sheeran was the leader of the Central WA U research team. The two universities have been "sister" campuses for more than 30 years, and the field project based at the Valley of the Wild Monkeys began in 2004.
