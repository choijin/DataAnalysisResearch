<AbstractNarration>Understanding populations that undergo fluctuations in abundance from one year to the next continues to challenge ecologists. This study will investigate midges in Lake Mývatn, Iceland, to determine why their abundance fluctuates over 5 orders of magnitude in irregular cycles lasting 4-7 years.  Juvenile midges feed on algae at the bottom of the lake, and experiments  that encompass a full peak-to-peak midge cycle will be initiated to test the hypothesis that the extreme midge fluctuations are caused when the larvae consume all the algae.  The research will also investigate the consequences of the midge cycles.  During high midge years, over 300 metric tons of midges are deposited in the surrounding heathland, providing food for predators and nutrients for plants.  This provides a natural experiment to test hypotheses about how the lake and shoreline ecosystems interact by observing how the pulses of midges ramify through the ecosystem networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will strengthen international collaborations with scientists in Iceland. It will train US graduate and undergraduate students doing work at Mývatn, providing them exposure to challenging scientific questions whose answers require expertise from several disciplines. Students will work in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats under the tutelage of an interdisciplinary and international research group.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most important lessons from ecology is that even simple ecosystems can have complex and dramatic dynamics. An extreme example is our study system: Lake Myvatn, Iceland. This subarctic lake has a simple food web, but it is also highly productive because it is fed by nutrient-rich spring water from surrounding lava fields. The lake is dominated by midges, small non-biting flies that as larvae feed in the sediment on the lake floor. Not only are midges the main herbivores in the lake, they are also prey for fish, birds, and other predators. The remarkable thing about Myvatn is that midge abundances fluctuate over four orders of magnitude, with peak abundances occurring irregularly every 4-8 years. During high-midge years, the weight of the dominant midge species that emerges from the lake is equivalent to 100 humpback whales, while in low-midge years the weight is equivalent to 100 Cocker Spaniels. Not only are the fluctuations extreme, but also our analyses show that they cannot be predicted. This is because the fluctuations are driven by ecological processes in the lake that make the ecosystem inherently unstable. The extreme, unstable midge fluctuations make Myvatn an unparalleled study system to understand the ecological processes that make ecosystems difficult to predict and manage.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are in the middle of a 10-year project to understand (i) the processes that underlie the inherent instability of Myvatn, and (ii) the consequences of this instability for the entire ecosystem. Objective (i) involves studying why the midge populations crash. In peak years, the midges make up 85% of the herbivores and carpet the lake floor with silk tubes in which the larvae live. Algae, the dominant primary producers in the lake, grow on these tubes, so the midges are farmers that provide algae with a place to grow. All our evidence points to the failure of midge farming as the cause of the population collapse, although we don't yet know why it fails. The midge populations have not crashed since the start of the study, so we have not had the chance to study a crash in progress. Nonetheless, we have generated a wealth of data and understanding of the ecological processes that maintain high midge populations, so we have a good baseline for comparison when the downturn inevitably occurs.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Objective (ii) uses the instability of the Myvatn ecosystem as a natural experiment to test hypotheses about mechanisms coupling the different parts of the lake ecosystem, and linkages between the lake and shoreline ecosystems. Most of the species in the lake fluctuate either synchronously or asynchronously with midges. For example, we have shown that historical changes in midge abundance have driven changes in the community of crustaceans that are the lake&rsquo;s second most important herbivores. Midges affect crustaceans through their silk tubes: when midges are present the crustaceans that graze algae from hard surfaces are favored, while in the absence of midges the crustaceans that filter algae from the oozy sediment are favored. We have also shown that the midge carcasses deposited around the shore are responsible for converting the plant communities from arctic heathland to highly productive grassland. The nutrients from decomposing midges give grasses a competitive advantage, and the net result is an increase in the productivity of the shoreline ecosystem.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Myvatn is not only a great study system, it is also a great location to train students in the interdisciplinary sciences that are needed to understand how ecosystems function. We have trained 15 current or recently matriculated undergraduate students, and 4 graduate students at Myvatn. These students have done research spanning aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, and combining field monitoring, experiments, and mathematical/statistical theory. Myvatn is the perfect training ground, where ecological interactions are strong, and ecological questions are many. Most of our students are already on their way to professional careers in ecology. Thus, Myvatn provides both a natural laboratory to study what makes ecosystems unstable, and also a training laboratory for the next generation of ecologists.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/05/2017<br>      Modified by: Anthony&nbsp;R&nbsp;Ives</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1052160/1052160_10074730_1494005668550_midges--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1052160/1052160_10074730_1494005668550_midges--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Mating midge swarms"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1052160/1052160_10074730_1494005668550_midges--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Mating midge swarms"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Midges of the species Tanytarsus gracilentus grow in the sediment of the Myvatn lake floor until they emerge as adults to mate on the shore.
