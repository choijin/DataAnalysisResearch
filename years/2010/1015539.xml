<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Under a microscope, the living world teems with a dizzying array of swimming creatures.  From bacteria living in the intestines of a human host, hostile or otherwise, to algae that traverse the ocean using a microscopic breast-stroke, the way that micro-organisms swim is dramatically different from the average human being.  From a purely biological standpoint, understanding how organisms swim sheds light on how such creatures develop, survive, and reproduce.  However, the behavior of micro-organisms is drastically effected by their environment, and as a direct result, studying the mechanics or physics of how the environment steers collective behavior can yield fruitful observations of the natural world.  Our collaboration (between the Physiological Flow Studies Laboratory at Tohoku University and the Lauga Applied Mathematics group at UC San Diego) was designed to mathematically model the collective interactions of a microswimmers.  Although the obvious application of such modeling is to understand how micro-organisms behave, recent developments in nanotechnology have allowed engineers and scientists to construct artificial swimmers of various shapes and sizes. Fabrication of controllable nano- and micro-swimmers allow increased technological possibilities for self-assembly, drug delivery and chemical engineering.  By mathematically and computationally modeling the fluid flow interactions amongst a collection of spherical microswimmers, we can describe group behavior and predict global properties of a ``living fluid" composed of bacteria, algae, or synthetic nanoparticles. Our results show that, despite the spherically symmetric shape of the swimmers, a particular direction of swimming is chosen collectively, and the entire group spontaneously develops directional order.  This behavior is akin to flocking birds or swarming in bacteria, and previous theoretical analyses indicated that spherical partices could not display such pattern-forming behavior.  It is our hope that with a combination of ongoing theoretical and experimental work, our results will lead to a more complete understanding of the complicated and tumultuous life led by microswimmers, and spur further experiments towards fabricating nano-machines that exploit our knowledge of fluid mechanics with the goal of enhancing control of the microscopic world.
