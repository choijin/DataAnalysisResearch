<AbstractNarration>The proposed work will explore the performance of unique configurations of harvesting wind energy devices for the first time with the use of piezoelectric materials optimally located inside a flow field. The available power in a flowing fluid is proportional to the cube of its velocity, which in the case of turbulent flows is proportional to the cube of a characteristic length scale and to the cube of a characteristic strain rate/frequency scale. This feature creates a unique opportunity to generate a substantial amount of energy by using piezoelectric generators, which are AC-coupled devices, to convert fluid kinetic energy to electrical energy. This energy can be used for continuously powering very small electronic devices or can be rectified and stored for intermittent use. This requires fundamental understanding of the three-way coupled interaction between the air motions, the dynamics of the vibrating structure and the electrical field of the piezoelectric material. Detail mapping of the flow fields will provide information on the flow field where energy harvesting is at maximum or optimal. The work that emerges from this proposal will provide the basis for designing generators that can be used to power small scale electronic devices. Although the anticipated energy harvesting is small, continuous harvesting at multi points may be more productive. Implementing such a strategy would be possible at the end of the proposed research when issues related to scaling up the available results to real-life scale, will be better understood. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present research program and the novel experimental setup have already attracted the interests of a number of undergraduate and graduate students and the general public. The experimental setup will also be used as part of a summer enrichment program for high school students interested in science and engineering. Furthermore, the students working on this research project will obtain valuable training and skills in coupled aerodynamics, structures and electronics, which is critical for the advancement of energy technologies such as windmills and water turbines. &lt;br/&gt;The educational component is primarily focused on minority students. The research will benefit from the presence of many on-campus programs already in operation to enhance the participation of members of groups underrepresented in science and engineering, including the CUNY Pipeline Program for undergraduates interested in pursuing a Ph.D. degree. It is proposed to increase the participation of minority students at the undergraduate and high school levels through inquiry-based learning projects related to the proposed research. Dissemination of the results will be attempted using a web-based approach.</AbstractNarration>
