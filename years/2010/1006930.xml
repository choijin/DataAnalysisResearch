<AbstractNarration>Technical: This project aims for greater fundamental understanding of the nature of electronic and structural defects in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices. At present, the origin and nature of such defects are poorly understood, as is their impact on device performance. This project will analyze defects in existing and new materials for OPV devices through a variety of experimental techniques, including impedance spectroscopy, carrier transport measurements, and OPV device fabrication and testing. The experimental results will be closely coupled with Monte Carlo computational simulations of charge transport and recombination processes and finite element calculations of OPV device performance. Attempts at mitigating or removing defects from the devices will be carried out through techniques such as pulsed electrical biasing to induce either subtle changes in the local-scale morphology or removal of macroscopic short-circuit defects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical:  The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with technological relevance in electronics and photonics. Successful outcome of the project will result in more efficient and robust organic photovoltaic devices that provide an avenue to low cost solar energy utilizing a technology that is easily scaled to large area and high throughput manufacturing. Fundamental progress in the science and engineering of organic photovoltaics can be readily transitioned to application via existing start-up OPV companies that are striving to bring the technology to the point of cost-efficient, large area solar power conversion. Integration of research and education will be emphasized providing students with opportunities and challenges across the fields of physics, chemistry, and engineering, and through the collaborative nature of the project. A female undergraduate student will be working on the project, and it is expected that this experience will accelerate her learning process and help launch her graduate career in applied physics or engineering. Outside the University, the project will reach out to the local Denver community via interaction with the Wings over the Rockies Air &amp; Space Museum. Through an existing close relationship with the museum, the PI and students will build new exhibits at the museum that expose the general population to the science and engineering of solar energy and organic and other photovoltaic technologies. He will also provide curriculum for  summer camps and programs at the museum that reach out to Boy and Girl Scout troops, minorities, and children in at-risk populations.</AbstractNarration>
