<AbstractNarration>Fully nonlinear second order partial differential equations (PDEs) are referred to &lt;br/&gt;    a class of nonlinear second order PDEs which are nonlinear in (at least one) second &lt;br/&gt;    order partial derivatives of unknown functions. Such a class of PDEs arise from many &lt;br/&gt;    scientific and engineering fields including astrophysics, differential geometry, geostrophic  &lt;br/&gt;    fluid dynamics, image processing, kinetic theory, materials science, mass transportation,  &lt;br/&gt;    meteorology, and optimal control. They constitute the most difficult class of PDEs to &lt;br/&gt;    analyze analytically and to approximate numerically. Building on the PI's recent success on  &lt;br/&gt;    developing convergent and efficient numerical methods and algorithms for fully nonlinear  &lt;br/&gt;    second order (time-independent) elliptic PDEs, the proposed research project intends to  &lt;br/&gt;    carry out a comprehensive and systematic study of numerical methods and algorithms &lt;br/&gt;    for fully nonlinear second order (time-dependent) evolution PDEs. The objectives of the  &lt;br/&gt;    proposed research include (i) to develop the vanishing moment method and the moment solution  &lt;br/&gt;    theory for fully nonlinear second order evolution PDEs, (ii) to develop fully discrete  &lt;br/&gt;    Galerkin type numerical methods (e.g. finite element methods, mixed finite element methods,  &lt;br/&gt;    spectral and discontinuous Galerkin methods) for fully nonlinear second order evolution PDEs  &lt;br/&gt;    based on the vanishing moment methodology, (iii) to apply and/or to adapt the developed numerical &lt;br/&gt;    methods to a number of emerging application problems which are governed by fully nonlinear second &lt;br/&gt;    order PDEs, (iv) to develop computer codes for implementing the proposed numerical methods. &lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;    As numerical approximations of fully nonlinear second order evolution PDEs is an untouched  &lt;br/&gt;    sub-area within the numerical PDEs and those PDEs arise from many important applications in &lt;br/&gt;    astrophysics, differential geometry, geostrophic fluid dynamics, image processing, kinetic theory, &lt;br/&gt;    materials science, mass transportation, meteorology, and optimal control, the completion of the  &lt;br/&gt;    proposed research project is expected to have a profound impact on solving this class of PDEs and &lt;br/&gt;    on providing the much needed capability and enabling tools for solving a range of important &lt;br/&gt;application  &lt;br/&gt;    problems which are governed by fully nonlinear second order PDEs. As a by-product, the moment &lt;br/&gt;    solution theory is expected to give some insights to our understanding of the viscosity solution  &lt;br/&gt;    theory, and might be very likely to provide a logical and natural generalization and extension &lt;br/&gt;    for the viscosity solution theory which is not natural and neither practical from the computational  &lt;br/&gt;    point of view. The educational component of this project is to engage and train graduate students in  &lt;br/&gt;    developing necessary applied and computational mathematics knowledge and skills so that they can &lt;br/&gt;   pursue a successful career in science and engineering in the future.</AbstractNarration>
