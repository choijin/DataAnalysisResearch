<AbstractNarration>This proposal was submitted to the Fostering Interdisciplinary Research in Education (FIRE) activity of the Research and Evaluation in Science and Engineering Education (REESE) Program, which is designed to bring together investigators from diverse disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, Designing Transformative Assessments for Interdisciplinary Learning in Science (DeTAILS), aims to design and implement technology-enhanced formative assessments to help college students integrate scientific knowledge and solve complex problems across disciplines. Specifically, researchers will target fundamental biological processes in physiological contexts that are closely related to physics. The assessments will be administered to college students enrolled in introductory physics, biology, physiology, and science education courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project PI, trained in both physics and physics education, will conduct the research under the supervision of the mentor (co-PI; physiologist) to expand his knowledge in physiology. This experience will help the investigator better conduct further research in science assessment to promote interdisciplinary thinking, particularly in physics, physiology, and related fields.</AbstractNarration>
