<AbstractNarration>The goal of this joint project between the University of Washington and the Grenoble Institute of Technology (Grenoble-INP) in France is to develop an integrated experimental and meso-scale simulation approach to design porous electrochemical ceramics with multifunctional design requirements.  The research focus is on the development of a framework for the analysis and optimization of the microstructure of this important class of materials. The competing requirements on the microstructure, for optimum electrochemical performance on one hand and mechanical performance and thermo-mechanical stability on the other, are being studied.  Using this understanding to design optimal microstructures, to process them and characterize their performance is the central element of this integrated experimental and state-of-the art simulations investigation. High performance electrochemical systems (e.g. electrodes for solid oxide fuel cells, gas separation membranes and batteries) have microstructural requirements that include high surface area and porosity.  These requirements are seemingly contradictory to requirements for reliable and stable long term performance.  This apparent contradiction can be addressed by using graded, hierarchical and/or anisotropic porous microstructures.  However, a systematic and scientifically based approach to design these complex microstructures has not been developed, and this is the overarching goal of this research.     &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The integrated experimental and meso-scale simulations research project builds on and further enhances the established international collaboration between two groups with complementary expertise to address all the needed elements to achieve the overall goal of the project.  The effort uses experimental techniques to process materials with complex microstructures, and experimentally and numerically investigates the effect of the microstructure on the mechanical and electrochemical performance and the thermo-mechanical stability of the microstructure.  The lessons from these investigations are used to numerically design optimal microstructures, to experimentally process them, and to characterize their performance.  The group at the University of Washington focuses on the experimental investigation.  However, the US graduate student spends significant time with the collaborators in France to learn and use the discrete element code dp3D developed at the SIMAP laboratory of Grenoble-INP.  She/he is also able to conduct simulations remotely from the US.  Similarly, the graduate student from Grenoble spends significant time in the US learning the experimental techniques and approaches. This international, integrated, collaborative research effort provides a unique high quality learning opportunity for the participating students. The investigators   integrate this research with educational programs for K-16 through undergraduate research and summer pre-engineering programs like Materials Camps and Math Academy. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF DMR-1008600 "Materials World Network: Designed Porous Ceramics for Electrochemical Applications", PI: R. K. Bordia  This was an international project, in collaboration with a team led by Dr. C. Martin from SIMAP,  CNRS Grenoble, France.  The focus is on the development of experimental approaches to control the microstructure of hierarchical and anisotropic porous ceramics for electrochemical applications, to develop meso-scale simulation approaches to simulate the properties, and to validate and fine-tune the simulations by comparing them to measured properties.   Intellectual Merit: Many applications of porous ceramics require the optimization of a multitude of properties, which in turn place conflicting microstructural demands for optimum properties.  In this project, it was shown that hierarchical and anisotropic porous ceramics can be designed to satisfy these conflicting microstructural requirements.  Using a process known as freeze-casting, where ice-crystals are used to create aligned pores inside a material, we were able to develop a robust set of process controls to create distinct, repeatable microstructures over a broad range   of porosity and pore size as shown in Figure 1.  Additionally, we were the first to report a water based system for making the slurries of the both cathode and anode materials for solid oxide fuel cells.  We used advanced characterization techniques like X-ray tomography and 3D scanning electron microscopy to get the full three dimensional structure of the samples that we had prepared.  An example of the X-ray tomograph showing the 3D porous structure is shown in Figure 2.  In collaboration with colleagues from SIMAP we performed simulations on the performance of our unique porous microstructure. By performing both experiments and related simulations, we were able to gain unique insight into the electrochemical, mechanical, and thermo-mechanical performance of our freeze-cast structures.  For the simulations, we took realistic microstructures from the 3D images (for example those generated by X-ray tomography) and then filling these 3D images with thousands of particles that realistically represented the ceramic powders used in the initial slurry (shown in Figure 3). Once this was done, a wide range of properties could be simulated and compared to experimental results.  Just one of the many interesting results from simulations showed how densification during sintering (heating to high temperatures) does not occur evenly across our freeze-cast structures. In fact, there is a very specific dependence on the alignment of pores and the density of particles within the walls (Figure 4). Physical experiments agreed with these results showing the robustness of our simulation abilities.  During the course of this project, a number of tools and software packages were developed allowing researchers to simulate a variety of microstructures beyond the freeze-cast ones. For example, code was written that allows researchers to determine 3-dimensional pathways through a conductive, composite ceramic. This has been made freely available to researchers everywhere.  In conjunction with the main thrust of project on use of these designed porous ceramics for solid oxide fuel cells, as part of this grant, a number of side-projects were accomplished to explore the use of these materials for other applications. Students and interns used our freeze-casting research to study porous ceramics for potential applications in hypersonic aeronautical and space exploration vehicles, water filters for remote applications, Li-ion batteries, scaffolds for tissue engineering and biomedical implant materials.      In summary, using a coupled integrated and iterative experimental and simulation approach, experimental protocols were developed for the processing of hierarchical and anisotropic porous ceramics and their mechanical and electrochemical properties investigated experimentally and using meso-scale simulations (discret...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
