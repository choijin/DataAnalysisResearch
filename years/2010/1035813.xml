<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to study, develop and implement a comprehensive set of techniques that will eventually enable automobiles to be driven autonomously.   The approach taken is to (a) address cyber-physical challenges of reliable, safe and timely operations inside the automobile, (b) tackle a range of physical conditions and uncertainties in the external environment, (c) enable real-time communications to and from the automobile to other vehicles and the infrastructure, and (d) study verification and validation technologies to ensure correct implementations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits: The project seeks to make basic research contributions in the domains of safety-critical real-time fault-tolerant distributed cyber-physical platforms, end-to-end resource management, cooperative vehicular networks, cyber-physical system modeling and analysis tools, dynamic object detection/recognition, hybrid systems verification, safe dynamic behaviors under constantly changing operating conditions, and real-time perception and planning algorithms.   Multiple intermediate capabilities in the form of active safety features will also be enabled. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Automotive accidents result in about 40,000 fatalities and 3 million injuries every year in the USA. The global annual cost of road injuries is $518 billion. Many accidents are due to humans being distracted. Autonomous vehicles controlled by ever-vigilant cyber-physical systems can lead to significant declines in accidents, deaths and injuries.  Autonomous vehicles can also offload driving chores from humans, and make time spent in automobiles more productive.  Vehicular networks can help find the best possible routes to a destination in real-time.  Broader impacts in this area are amplified by the project's partnerships with companies in the transportation and agricultural technology industries, and in information technology.  Broader impacts are also sought through demonstrations and outreach to attract students into science and technology, and in particular to cyber-physical systems research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Connected and automated vehicles promise significant societal benefits.   Annually, there are about 35,000 automotive fatalities in the US and a staggering 1.3 fatalities around the world.    More than 10 times these numbers are injured, and automotive accident counts exceed more than 100 times these numbers.   These lead to several hundred billion dollars of economic damage, besides the grief, sorrow and long-term impact on individuals, their families and their communities.   Unfortunately, most of these crashes happen due to human distraction.   Connected automation can significantly reduce these numbers over time.    The average adult in the US spends more than 51 minutes per workday commuting to and from work as a single person in a vehicle.  We also waste about 38 hours per year (almost an entire work-week) stuck in traffic.    If vehicles can drive themselves, these mostly wasted durations can instead be used for productive purposes.   Finally, with automated vehicles, the elderly, the disabled and the legally blind, who are unable to drive themselves, can regain mobility options and independence and thereby have a much higher quality of life.  Significant progress has been made on multiple fronts including computer vision, behavioral logic to follow the rules of the road, redundancy management for tolerating fafults, path planning algorithms, control techniques, connectivity with other vehicles and the infrastructure, localization techniques to know where the vehicle is on a map for making navigation decisions, and to route planning.  The need for intelligent software to make complex driving decisions coupled with the difficulty of real-world driving environments makes connected and automated vehicles a flagship application domain for cyber-physical systems where the cyber-components of computing and communications must monitor and control entities in the physical world safely, reliably and in real-time.  This CPS project has indeed helped lay the scientific foundations for connected and automated vehicles.   In addition, the real-life demonstration of CMU's automated vehicle on publoc roads with uncontrolled traffic has illustrated both the safety potential and the remaining challenges that must be addressed before the human driver can be taken out of the driving equation.  In the process of demonstrating CMU's automated vehicle capabilities, vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication capabilities have been added to several road intersections controlled by traffic lights in the city of Pittsburgh, Cranberry township north of Pittsburgh, Washington DC around Capitol Hill and in Harrisburgh (the capital of Pennsylvania).   CMU's work in the field has been covered by hundreds of media outlets including the Associated Press, Reuters, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, USA Today, CNBC, ABC News, CBS, BBC, Wired, the Verge and Buzzfeed.     The project was also highlighted by two plenary talks given by the Director of NSF at the 2017 DC Auto Show where CMU's automated vehicle was displayed prominently and also used to provide demonstrations to NSF and media personnel.  A close working relationship with General Motors researchers and the spinout of a startup called Ottomatika (acquired by Delphi a global automotive Tier-1 supplier) has helped promote the practical adoption of many technologies and tools developed during this project.
