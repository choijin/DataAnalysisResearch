<AbstractNarration>For the past two decades, string theory has been one of the most intensely investigated areas of theoretical high-energy physics.  This is true chiefly because string theory offers what is currently the most successful method of unifying gravity with the other fundamental forces (strong, weak, and electromagnetic).  In this project, Professor Ovrut and his collaborators seek to create an international and interdisciplinary research group that will formulate a wide class of realistic string models, and, within this context, calculate fundamental properties of particle physics and cosmology.  Among the physics goals is to predict the mass spectrum of the new supersymmetric particles, explore possible new physics just above the electroweak scale, numerically compute Yukawa couplings, explore the implications of these theories for cosmology, and confront these theories with the data from the LHC and cosmological observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also envisioned to have considerable broader impacts.  Primary among these is the synergy of bringing together representatives of three disciplines (string theory, mathematics, and cosmology) in three different countries to solve some of the most fundamental problems in modern science.  This work could therefore become a vehicle for enhancing American and European scientific cooperation, as well as a concrete mechanism to train post-doctoral associates and graduate students in a multinational educational environment.  In particular, this work will give American and European students and post-doctoral associates unparalleled opportunities to study, conduct research and attend specialized courses, workshops, conferences and schools organized at our participating universities, Centers, Institute and Laboratory. There is also significant outreach potential by communicating the content of the research to interested non-scientists through public lectures and the media.</AbstractNarration>
