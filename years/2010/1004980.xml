<AbstractNarration>Project summary: With a recurring six-month hurricane season, projections of intense hurricane activity for the next two decades, and the experience of seven major hurricanes between 2004 and 2005, Florida is an ideal location for hurricane-related research. The University of South Florida will continue its summer REU to research the social aspects of hurricanes , i.e., how individuals, communities and institutions prepare for, experience and recover from hurricanes. Particular attention will be given to vulnerable populations including children, older adults, and those of lower socio-economic standing. Drawing faculty and mentors from anthropology, sociology, education, geography, psychology, public health and social work, the program is designed to achieve these objectives: 1) to provide an intensive, mentored interdisciplinary research experience for undergraduate students; 2) to train students in qualitative and quantitative methods appropriate to social science research; 3) to provide experiential learning opportunities to increase student knowledge of systems and networks integral to research within the context of disaster preparedness and response; 4) to increase student knowledge of ethical issues in research, including cultural competency and certification in IRB human subject protection. Each component of the REU is designed to enhance critical thinking skills of the student with regard to the social aspects of hurricanes and other disasters, with a focus on decreasing loss of life and building resilience in recovery. This foundation of knowledge and skills will prepare students for both basic and applied graduate research. The USF Office of Undergraduate Research and the Honors College have committed significant resources to ensure the success of this program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The need for effective hurricane preparation, response and recovery has been recognized nationally; the USF REU's focus on researching this important societal need from an interdisciplinary perspective will advance knowledge and understanding, bringing students together with nationally-recognized hurricane researchers, as well as first-responders. Severe weather events such as hurricanes carve a path of death and destruction throughout vulnerable communities, requiring a broader knowledge base to successfully prevent or mitigate these costly outcomes. Recently, research aimed at understanding the social dimensions of hurricanes has taken on increased importance, particularly investigations of vulnerable populations (such as children, older adults and low income individuals or families), communities with limited resources, and institutions charged with providing necessary services for health and safety. Research stemming from the REU has and will result in culturally and socially responsive evidence-based approaches to build protective factors and enhance resiliency of individuals, communities and institutions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The program is designed to prepare the next generation of graduate students and researchers through a structured program including mentored group research projects, seminars, ethics training, disaster management and response training, on-site experiential trainings and directed readings. A long-term evaluation procedure will track participants' subsequent application to and participation in graduate programs in relevant disciplines and areas. The REU's innovative incorporation of training in social dynamics and populations at risk as a component of hurricane-related group's impact will also be assessed. The REU will broaden participation of under-represented groups by recruiting students from FAMU and Alcorn State, two Historically Black Institutions which have committed to working with the REU team, from McNair programs at other institutions and from geographic regions impacted by hurricanes and other disasters. Both the students and the faculty will contribute to the dissemination of knowledge and broader societal impact. Research projects will explore a range of issues, including but not limited to: evacuation and transportation concerns; impacts of hurricane-related displacement on children, the elderly and vulnerable populations; and mobilization and utilization of community assets, particularly within distressed or resource-poor neighborhoods. Each project will have the potential to directly benefit both USF's west central Florida community, other hurricane-affected areas, and any disaster-vulnerable community, through a better understanding of potential impacts and successful practices. Students will present their research locally within the greater Tampa Bay area and at their home institutions, at the Florida Governor's Hurricane conference or an equivalent state-level venue, and at relevant disciplinary professional conferences. USF's Hurricane REU Site will become a model for community-serving research by undergraduates both through dissemination of results and presentations by REU faculty at conferences such as AAC&amp;U and the Gulf-Coast Summit.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Normal 0   false false false        MicrosoftInternetExplorer4                    This 9-week summer REU was designed to prepare the next generation of graduate student researchers interested in investigating how individuals, communities and institutions prepare for, experience and recover from hurricanes.  Particular attention was aimed at the social impacts hurricanes have on vulnerable populations including children, older adults, and those of lower socio-economic standing.  The cross-disciplinary model used in the REU placed student scholars alongside expert faculty mentors from anthropology, psychology, geography, aging studies, social work, and public health to carry out applied community-based research projects aimed at the advancement of knowledge in the social dynamics of hurricane vulnerability.  Outcomes from mentored research projects contributed to understanding socio-cultural and socio-demographic factors influencing disaster preparedness and response; inter-organizational and community response challenges; and societal factors influencing emergency management policies and practices. Research findings revealed disaster preparedness and recovery issues relevant to social and economic inequality; the influence of race and gender; the role of social networks; and vulnerability stemming from disparities in the availability, accessibility, and adequacy of community resources.                             Results from REU research projects were disseminated through a University-Community Research Symposium held on the campus of the University of South Florida at the conclusion of the summer program.  This provided student participants the opportunity to present professional quality posters and power point presentations showcasing the results, significant findings and implications of their work.  The symposium also provided the opportunity for a question and answer interaction with audience members centered on each mentored research project, and offered an outlet for open discourse on the study of hurricanes and natural disasters and their social impacts on individuals and communities.  Additional dissemination of project results included presentations by many of the REU student scholars at their home institutions.  Nearly all students were successful in having abstracts accepted to present their work at regional and national refereed disciplinary conferences including the National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR) and the American Association of Behavioral Social Scientists (AABSS).  Several REU students have continued their mentoring relationships with faculty experts as they prepare manuscripts based upon their research projects, for submission to scholarly journals.      Broader impacts from the REU included student participation in graduate school preparation seminars.  The purpose of the seminars was to demystify the graduate school admissions process and define academic and professional goals. Open discussion topics included developing mentor relationships with faculty, obtaining letters of recommendation, managing anxiety while navigating the application process, developing time management skills, and organizing large tasks into manageable steps.  Nearly all REU students were successful in being accepted into graduate schools of their choice including several accepted into graduate programs culminating in a doctoral degree.  Some REU students chose to apply for Fulbright scholarships in Australia and New Zealand, while several others were successful in being awarded scholarships for research internships in the area of natural disasters.
