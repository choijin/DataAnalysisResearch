<AbstractNarration>Doctoral candidate Courtney Kurlanska (SUNY Albany), under the direction of Dr. Walter Little, will be conducting research on the use of microcredit as a livelihood strategy among rural Nicaraguan agriculturalists.  This study will examine how the availability of microfinance influences livelihood decisions highlighting different factors such as age and gender. The shift towards microcredit as a solution to poverty has spurred an explosion of microlending programs around the globe many of which are targeted at specific groups such as women and youth.  Based on an ethnographic approach, this research will study the use of microcredit and microfinance as one of many economic strategies used by agricultural households in developing countries.  Through a combination of interviews, participant observation and the tracking of household expenses this research will consider how livelihood decisions are made and how access to microcredit alters those decisions.   In addition to data on household economic strategies the research will also investigate the beliefs and attitudes towards microcredit of both borrowers and those representing lending organizations.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is significant because it will contribute to a better understanding of the use of microcredit by borrowers and the social implications of providing resources to some members of a household while denying the same opportunity to others.   Understanding both the economic and social implication of microlending becomes crucial as development organizations continue to move forward with this strategy as a key component of the solution to poverty.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of this research was to examine how access to microcredit and microfinance opportunities alter or influence livelihood strategies employed by small-scale agriculturalists. Upon arrival at the research site it became evident that there had been a major shift in the microcredit landscape over the past 12 months. Whereas previously the area had been oversaturated with microfinance organizations the market had collapsed and many borrowers found themselves without access to credit.  Due to protests and new microfinance regulations many organizations were not even trying to collect debt payments.   Withinthe community microlenders were virtually absent.     Farmers who had come to expect credit had difficulty funding their agricultural activities when loans were no longer available. In order to deal with the lack of credit agriculturalists were turning to a number of informal and interpersonal arrangements to be able to farm their land.  There was a reduction in the use of chemical inputs such as fertilizers and an increase in joint farming which enabled households to share not only resources but risk as well.   These strategies often led to an overall lower level of agricultural production but a wider distribution of resources.  In a few instances this created a sense of solidarity, however, others expressed feelings of being exploited or taken advantage of by other community members.   This research is important because it examines the problems related to an unregulated microfinance industry and highlights the weakness in development models that are fundamentally based in microfinance.  Specifically this research presents the interaction of a neoliberal model of development with a government attempting to transition into a socialist democracy. While major decisions and conflicts occur at the international and national levels this research examines how these interactions play out at the local level. It brings into focus the everyday lives of individuals considering how these organizations influence household economic decisions and opportunities.
