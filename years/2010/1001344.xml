<AbstractNarration>The principal investigator plans to study geometry of moduli spaces of stable curves of Deligne, Knudsen, and Mumford and its higher dimensional analogues, namely the moduli spaces of stable surfaces introduced by Kollar, Shepherd-Barron, and Alexeev. The first goal is to uncover birational geometry of the compact moduli space of algebraic curves. The main conjecture is inspired by Mirror Symmetry from physics and classical algebraic geometry of linear series. It describes the cone of effective divisors and (some part of) the variation of  birational contractions of the moduli space of stable rational curves in terms of compactified Jacobians of reducible curves of high genus. The second goal is to develop new methods of explicitly describing the moduli spaces of stable canonically polarized surfaces and to apply these methods in several classical situations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometry studies algebraic varieties: shapes defined by systems of polynomial equations. Algebraic varieties have discrete characteristics that allow to classify their species: rational curves, Del Pezzo surfaces, Abelian varieties, Calabi-Yau varieties, varieties of general type, etc. Varieties of each type depend on certain continuous parameters (called moduli) and the set of all parameters has a rich structure of the so-called moduli space. One is particularly interested in compact moduli spaces that parametrize varieties with allowed mild degenerations. For example, a hyperbola xy=C on the plane can degenerate to the union of two lines xy=0 when C goes to 0. The principal investigator will study these compact moduli spaces and related problems in algebraic geometry. This centuries-old concept of pure mathematics has rich relationship with physics, and applications to computational algebraic geometry will lead to new algorithms useful in algebraic statistics and mathematical biology.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>One of the major goals of algebraic geometry is to understand and classify all possible types of geometric shapes (birational geometry) and how these shapes change and evolve when we change parameters (called moduli) describing these shapes. One of the major activities of the project was the study of moduli of one of the easiest possible geometric shapes, a stable rational curve. Despite being called a curve, it is actually a sphere with N punctured points (algebraic geometers define dimension using complex numbers instead of real numbers). Not surprisingly, a prevailing point of view was that the moduli space of such a simple object should be well behaved. However, we showed that the moduli space exhibits a rather unusual and unexpected behavior. In technical terms, we showed that it is not a Mori dream space, which provided a counterexample to a long-standing conjecture, as well as found many extremal divisors (hypersurfaces) in this moduli space. We have also found rigid curves inside the moduli space. This project was undertaken by the PI in collaboration with Ana-Maria Castravet and also involved undergraduate students, Morgan Opie and Nathan Harman. In a different project supported by the grant, the PI, in collaboration with Paul Hacking and Giancarlo Urzua, studied moduli of algebraic surfaces of general type, which is a 4-dimensional geometric shape, and in some sense the most typical one. We found an algorithm which describes what happens to this shape when parameters describing it change in a special way that forces a singularity to appear. We used this algorithm to describe special divisors (hypersurfaces) in the compactified moduli space (in algebraic geometry, spaces are often compactified to systematically understand the behaviour at infinity). This project also involved a graduate student Julie Rana and undergraduate students Nicolas Reyes and Charles Boyd. Finally, the third project, which involves another graduate student, Anastassios Vogiannou, was to develop a general approach to compactification problems. The results were disseminated in numerous conferences and colloquium talks.
