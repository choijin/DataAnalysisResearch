<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF Project Outcomes Report  Caroline Titcomb, MA  Doctoral Student, The University of Alabama, Psychology and Law     Intrafamilial Child Sexual Offending Etiology and Treatment: Should Biology Matter?     My originally proposed EAPSI project was titled Police Interviews and Psychological Vulnerability: Interrogative Interactions and Case Outcomes. The project sought to identify the extent to which psychologically vulnerable individuals were encountered by police investigators, and to inform substantial gaps in the literature and police training guidelines on the topic. However, once I arrived at Charles Sturt University (CSU) &ndash; Australian Graduate School of Policing (AGSP), our approval to access this data had been temporarily revoked due to newly initiated internal reviews of the data. As a result, the project described below became my primary EAPSI research. The study is called Intrafamilial Child Sexual Offending Etiology and Treatment: Should Biology Matter?     It often goes unsaid in media and legal reports that the majority of child sexual abuse cases are perpetrated by a victimÃ†s family member or a person close to the victim. This abuse occurs for a long time and on repeated occasions (an average of about 45 times per victim in one recent study).  Given the overwhelming prevalence of intrafamilial child sexual abuse, one would think that policies would be launched to treat and prevent such offending. This is not the case. Most legal policies focus on &shy;extrafamilial offenders, defined as offending perpetrated by someone outside the home. Such policies rarely involve rehabilitation or specialized treatment for the entire family; more often, they are retributive and punitively focused on the offender.  However, this type of offending abuse can be amenable to treatment. Treatment is the best way to prevent future abuse and help victims. The unbalanced policy attention may be because familial sexual abuse is considered "low risk."     Unfortunately, sexual abuse within the family unit &ndash; known as intrafamilial offending &ndash; is more likely to be unreported given the family relationship. Offenders who are identified as having sexually assaulted their biological children are sometimes deemed eligible for alternative sentencing. Diversion programs divert offenders from punitive prison terms and into specialized treatment and monitoring programs that are aimed at preventing future abuse. However, these policies often preclude nonbiological father offenders (i.e., stepfathers, de facto spouses, etc.) from participation in such programs.     As an EAPSI fellow working with Professor Jane Goodman-Delahunty at the CSU and AGSP, I gained access to one of the few diversion programs of its kind in the world &ndash; the New South Wales Pre-Trial Diversion of Offenders (Child Sexual Assault) Program, locally known as "Cedar Cottage."  Using one of the largest datasets of its kind, with over 200 clinical files, the goals of this study were: 1) To compare biological and nonbiological father offenders in relation to their demographic characteristics, criminal history, history of own abuse, and arresting offense; 2) To examine treatment outcomes and re-offence rates in these offender groups; and 3) To assess the validity of the "low risk" designation assigned to intrafamilial offenders.     Our findings indicated that biology should not take precedence over familial role when determining eligibility for diversion programs. They also helped refine long-debated questions about child sexual offender typology, suggesting that nonbiological father offenders should be grouped with biological father offenders rather than extrafamilial offenders. The absolute re-offense rates and length of protracted abuse within our sample attested to the importance of considering intrafamilial offenders within the population of child sexual offenders.     This research provided a unique opportunity to bring valuable insight to prevent recidiv...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
