<AbstractNarration>This Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) award will train a corps of doctoral students to become the leaders needed to develop innovative adaptive strategies to respond to unprecedented challenges as a result of climate change. Intellectual Merit: Changes in the hydrologic cycle are expected to decrease the supply of safe water, forcing vulnerable populations in poor countries to drink dirty water, leading to increased disease. Food production will become scarcer as unsustainable groundwater withdrawals are affected by increased drought. As contaminants continue to flow into water bodies and hydrodynamic patterns adjust to climate change, the coastal fisheries upon which human populations depend for food will face increased problems of eutrophication and anoxia. Integrated strategies are needed for predicting and adapting to climate driven stressors on water resources and human health. Among these strategies are smart growth land use practices resulting in reduced greenhouse gas emissions or water infrastructure systems that conserve water and energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The trainees will be scientific leaders and will engage in mentoring diverse high school students. Practical problems will be addressed by students through a capstone course centering on real problems in three very different areas of the world: the Chesapeake Bay watershed in the temperate developed U.S., the tropical underdeveloped Amazon basin in Peru, and the arid underdeveloped Nile basin in Ethiopia. IGERT students, highly trained in advanced water treatment and management, will learn to adapt skills and knowledge to address problems in diverse cultural, political and economic settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;IGERT is an NSF-wide program intended to meet the challenges of educating U.S. Ph.D. scientists and engineers with the interdisciplinary background, deep knowledge in a chosen discipline, and the technical, professional, and personal skills needed for the career demands of the future. The program is intended to catalyze a cultural change in graduate education by establishing innovative new models for graduate education and training in a fertile environment for collaborative research that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    IGERT: Water, Climate, and Health 1069213  The Project Outcomes Report for the General Public  The IGERT support was successful in encouraging PhD students to pursue collaborations with their peers and with IGERT faculty across departments and schools (Arts and Sciences, Public Health and Engineering) in the University. Hence students were exposed to different ways to investigate environmental problems, and they learned that solving many of today?s problems requires a multifaceted approach.  Among the most significant research accomplishments were those which showed how changing climate exacerbates water quality in under developed countries and the effect this has particularly on the development of young children.  Another study invented an inexpensive and easily implemented method for measuring temperature at a very local scale, particularly useful for urban areas where extreme heat events and air quality affect human health and mortality.  This study led to the founding of a startup company which will deploy the hardware developed by the IGERT students to get detailed heat measurements in urban areas both in the US and in the underdeveloped world, starting with Peru.  Another study showed how changes in rainfall resulting from climate change exacerbates problems for agriculture in the Sub Sahara and the potential effects on food production in marginal regions of the world.  Others explored innovative methods for water purification in parts of the world that differ economically and politically.  Others are using climate models to predict the effects of changing climate on human health and food production.   The need for interdisciplinary programs to address current and future questions regarding the environment and human health was clearly demonstrated in this project and was shown to be achievable at a University where the different disciplines necessary for addressing these questions exist in different schools on different campuses.   The Igert students became a closely knit group who worked together on problems that involved different disciplines ranging from water sanitation to climate modeling, and formed relationships that will continue beyond their years as graduate students.  Thus the IGERT experience prepared students for careers for the future, which is evident from the faculty and postdoctoral positions at prestigious universities that have been offered to those students who have completed their degrees.
