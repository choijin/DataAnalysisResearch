<AbstractNarration>The objective of the research is to generate knowledge of in situ nanomanufacturing process control through multiscale nanostructure growth modeling and growth of metal-oxide nanowires with excellent optical properties. Standard statistical quality control (SQC) faces new challenges of scale effects which is unique to quality control of nanofabrication processes. Particularly, key process variables, varying with location and time, are measured at macro/micro scales. The quality characteristics of nanostructures would better be characterized as space-time random field measured in nanoscale. Relating macroscale process variables to nanoscale critical quality characteristics and defects requires multiscale model integration for in situ process control. The research therefore aims to model nanofabrication process, more specifically, nanostructure growth for in situ quality control in nanomanufacturing. Novel metal-oxide nanowires will be synthesized and characterized for wide applications in nanoscale electronic and optoelectronic devices.&lt;br/&gt;Toward this goal, we plan an interdisciplinary research plan including: (1) modeling of nanostructure birth and growth processes by integrating space-time random field models with nanostructure growth mechanisms, (2) multiscale in situ quality control of nanostructure growth through macroscale modeling of growth rate difference between substrates and nanoscale modeling of growth rate difference between locally homogeneous regions within individual substrates, and (3) controlled growth of novel metal-oxide based nanowires with excellent optical properties. The experimental work will provide data for multiscale modeling of nanostructure growth processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is probably the first of its kind to control nanomanufacturing process quality through multiscale modeling of nanostructure growth processes. Successful completion of the research may assist to expedite the transfer of fast-developing nanotechnology from the laboratory to industry application at lower cost. The metal oxide nanowire fabrication research will provide promising building blocks for novel nano devices. A new breed of nanomanufacturing engineers will be educated through an integrated education plan.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[           The objective of this project is to generate knowledge of in situ nanomanufacturing process control through multiscale nanostructure growth modeling and growth of metal-oxide nanowires with excellent optical properties. This report summarizes the outcomes from research and education.  1. Research Outcomes  Integrated nanomanufacturing and nanoinformatics (INN): We first proposed the INN strategy for scalable nanomanufacturing and have been contributing the development of INN as an academic discipline. Unlike traditional manufacturing, nanomanufacturing (NM) involves product characteristics and process variables at multiple feature scales. However, control of the multiscale process/product variations (MPVs) in NM is constrained by the scarcity of measurement data, a lack of observation during processing, and limited physical knowledge. We first proposed that NM and nanoinformatics should be integrated together to address the challenge of MPVs for quality and productivity improvement.   Scale-up nanomanufacturing research and its classification: We first systematically defined the system-level scale-up nanomanufacturing research and provided its classification. Although the importance of scalable nanomanufacturing (NM) has been well-recognized, what constitutes the scale-up NM research has not been clearly defined.  We first provided our understanding regarding the research classification. Two categories of scale-up NM research are defined: (C.1) Scale-up process research: Identifying and developing NM processes and processing techniques with the potential of economical production at commercial scale, and (C.2) Scale-up methodology research: Establishing modeling, simulation, and control methodologies that enable and support economical production at commercial scale.  The first category focuses on the process-level issues, while the second devotes its attention to system-level methodological issues such as yield and quality improvement.  We further classify the scale-up methodology research (C2) into four sub-categories  based on their research objectives, nature of the problems, measurement of outcomes, and methodology domains: (C2.1) Quantity, from 1 to N, (C2.2) Size, from small to large; (C2.3) Throughput, from slow to high; and (C2.4) Yield, from low to high.  Nanomanufacturing process modeling and cross-domain model building and validation (CDMV) approach: We systematically developed three nanomanufacturing process modeling approaches: statistical modeling, physical-statistical modeling, and cross-domain model building and validation (CDMV). We identified the domain of applications for each modeling approach. The CDMV approach derives the process models from physical and statistical domains, respectively, and reinforce the understanding of growth processes by identifying the common model structure across two domains. This cross-domain model building strategy essentially validates models by domain knowledge rather than by (unavailable) data. It not only increases modeling confidence under large uncertainties, but also enables insightful physical understanding of the growth kinetics. We present this method by studying the weight growth kinetics of silica nanowire under two temperature conditions. The derived nanowire growth model is able to provide physical insights for prediction and control under uncertainties.  Model-guided experimental design strategy to investigate the nanostructure synthesis processes: We consider the problem of determining an optimal experimental design for estimation of parameters of a complex nanostructure growth process. We developed a new optimal experimental design strategy for estimating the non-linear change-point growth model. Further, a Bayesian sequential algorithm is proposed for obtaining the D-optimal design. The advantages of the proposed algorithm over traditional approaches adopted in recently reported nanoexperiments are demonstrated using Monte-Carlo simulations.  2.  Educ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
