<AbstractNarration>This project explores the use of speleothems from caves in the central Peruvian Altiplano to produce high resolution time series of delta oxygen-18 isotopes over the Holocene and Late Pleistocene time periods.  The researcher, and his colleagues, postulate that the time series would be a direct proxy for regional delta oxygen-18 of precipitation, which is correlative with both the amount of precipitation on the Altiplano and to the intensity and mean location of the South American Summer Monsoon (SASM).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The specific aims of the research are to investigate the use of delta oxygen-18 to potentially produce: i) decadally-resolved records of the Holocene to investigate sub-orbital climate variability; ii) 500-year annually-resolved series during the early and late Holocene and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and last interglacial to study El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) variability; iii) 50-year  resolution records of the glacial transition to better define the nature and timing of this critical climate transition in the tropics; and iv) 50-year resolution records of climate during the last glacial period, the last interglacial period, and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary broader impacts involve supporting a female graduate student in her studies and the development of English and Spanish language versions of a study guide for Haugapo Cave in Peru to be used locally and elsewhere.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Holocene and Late Pleistocene Climate Change in Tropical South America Based on Speleothems from the Peruvian Andes     PI: Prof. Stephen J. Burns, University of Massachusetts, Amherst     Our project used stalagmites from caves in the Andes Mountains of Peru to study how rainfall in the Amazon Basin varied over the past several hundred thousand years. The moisture source for rain and snow falling in the Andes is the Amazon Basin.  During the South American Summer Monsoon, air and moisture move from the tropical Atlantic Ocean across the Amazon Basin and ultimately up onto the Andes Mountains.  As rain falls from these airmasses they progressively loose one of the isotopes of oxygen (18O) relative to the other isotope of oxygen (16O).  The more rain that falls the more 18O is lost.  And by measuring the 18O/ 18O ratio of the CaCO3 of stalagmites, we can determine how the amount of rain falling on the Amazon Basin has changes over time.     Our results show that, on geologic timescales, Amazon Basin Rainfall is mainly controlled by two factors: the amount of sunlight reaching the Amazon Basin in the summer, and climate at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere.  The former is controlled by small changes in Earth's orbit and when less sunlight reaches the Amazon Basin, less rain falls.  The dominant periodicity found is ~20,000 years, the same as the precession of the equinoxes.  Amazon rainfall is also affected by changes in temperature and ice cover at high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere.  During cold periods with increased snow cover (glacial conditions), Amazon rainfall increases.  In particular, Amazon rainfall is very closely tied to rapid, millennial-scale warm/cold climate events called Dansgaard/Oeschger cycles that occurred from ~100,000 to 20,000 years ago.  During the warm phase of D/O cycles, Amazon rainfall decreases.  Our work is the first to positively identify the presence of D/O events in the Southern Hemisphere.
