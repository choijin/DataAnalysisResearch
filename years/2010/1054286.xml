<AbstractNarration>Henry F. "Fritz" Schaefer of the University of Georgia is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods  program  in the chemistry division to carry out research on the development of a new density cumulant functional theory and explicitly correlated atomic orbital based methods. These methods will be used to explore a variety of prototypical chemical problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first principles description of molecular species begins with a theoretical examination of the appropriate electronic energy surface(s). Such potential energy surfaces, which describe the fundamental manner in which atoms and molecules interact, are critical to even a qualitative understanding of how chemical reactions occur. The present research has two aims, distinct but related. The first involves the development, testing, and calibration of new methods for the approximate solution of Schr√∂dinger's Equation, the essential statement of molecular quantum mechanics. Secondly, these techniques and those previously developed here and elsewhere are being used to explore a variety of important prototypical chemical problems, including biomimetic studies of enzyme active sites. In addition to these applications, the work is having a broader impact through the training of a number of graduate students and the dissemination of the PIs' freely distributed software package PSI.</AbstractNarration>

Carmon Scholarship.    Research completed in the previous funding period encompasses theoretical development and chemical applications.  As mentioned, we have derived analytic gradients for DCFT, including new variants that improve the description of the one-particle density matrix N-representability conditions.  These new methods are more accurate, even for challenging radical systems, and simplify the computation of molecular properties.  In parallel work, we have developed as MP2-F12 formulation that is amenable to linear scaling through localization of atomic orbitals (AO-MP2-F12).  We have also collaborated with two experimental inorganic groups to understand new main-group metal-metal bonding, and to elucidate the subtle intramolecular interactions that are central to developing improved NiSOD mimics.
