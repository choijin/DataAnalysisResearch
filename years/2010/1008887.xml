<AbstractNarration>'Be a Scientist!' is a full-scale development project that examines the impact of a scalable, STEM afterschool program which trains engineers to develop and teach inquiry-based Family Science Workshops (FSWs) in underserved communities. This project builds on three years of FSWs which demonstrate improvements in participants' science interest, knowledge, and self-efficacy and tests the model for scale, breadth, and depth. The project partners include the Viterbi School of Engineering at the University of Southern California, the Albert Nerken Engineering Department at the Cooper Union, the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History, and the New York Hall of Science. The content emphasis is physics and engineering and includes topics such as aerodynamics, animal locomotion, automotive engineering, biomechanics, computer architecture, optics, sensors, and transformers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project targets underserved youth in grades 1-5 in Los Angeles and New York, their parents, and engineering professionals.  The design is grounded in motivation theory and is intended to foster participants' intrinsic motivation and self-direction while the comprehensive design takes into account the cultural, social, and intellectual needs of diverse families. The science activities are provided in a series of Family Science Workshops which take place in afterschool programs in eight partner schools in Los Angeles and at the New York Hall of Science in New York City. The FSWs are taught by undergraduate and graduate engineering students with support from practicing engineers who serve as mentors. The primary project deliverable is a five-year longitudinal evaluation designed to assess (1) the impact of intensive training for engineering professionals who deliver family science activities in community settings and (2) families' interest in and understanding of science. Additional project deliverables include a 16-week training program for engineering professionals, 20 physics-based workshops and lesson plans, Family Science Workshops (40 in LA and 5 in NY), a Parent Leadership Program and social networking site, and 5 science training videos. This project will reach nearly one thousand students, parents, and student engineers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multi-method evaluation will be conducted by the Center for Children and Technology at the Education Development Center. The evaluation questions are as follows:  Are activities such as recruitment, training, and FSWs aligned with the project's goals? What is the impact on families' interest in and understanding of science? What is the impact on engineers' communication skills and perspectives about their work? Is the project scalable and able to produce effective technology tools and develop long-term partnerships with schools? Stage 1 begins with the creation of a logic model by stakeholders and the collection of baseline data on families' STEM experiences and knowledge. Stage 2 includes the collection of formative evaluation data over four years on recruitment, training, co-teaching by informal educators, curriculum development, FSWs, and Parent Leadership Program implementation. Finally, a summative evaluation addresses how well the project met the goals associated with improving families' understanding of science, family involvement, social networking, longitudinal impact, and scalability.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A comprehensive dissemination plan extends the project's broader impacts in the museum, engineering, evaluation, and education professional communities through publications, conference presentations, as well as web 2.0 tools such as blogs, YouTube, an online social networking forum for parents, and websites. 'Be a Scientist!' advances the field through the development and evaluation of a model for sustained STEM learning experiences that helps informal science education organizations broaden participation, foster collaborations between universities and informal science education organizations, increase STEM-based social capital in underserved communities, identify factors that develop sustained interest in STEM, and empower parents to co-invest and sustain a STEM program in their communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ BE A SCIENTIST &mdash; Cinema COMPONENT  PROJECT OUTCOMES REPORT  What are the major goals of the project?  The goals of the Be a Scientist! program are to advance the Informal Science Education field by developing innovative, technology-based and scalable educational methods that  1) recruit a more diverse audience into STEM,  2) enable participants to develop a deeper understanding of scientific practice, and  3) assess longterm impact on participants.   Within the context of those overall objectives, the cinema team's goals are to document the experience of selected participants - children, parents, and engineering student instructors - over the five-year course of the program, creating story-based videos that explore the program's impact, model best practices, and serve to inform and inspire others as the program scales up and creates a template for others to follow.  Major Activities:   In collaboration with Iridescent (the informal science organization that conceived and led the project), the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts team planned from the outset of the grant that the fifth and final year of production would focus on overview videos of the four families we have followed from the beginning, with the intent of exploring the impact the Family Science Workshops might have had on them, especially the five children &ndash; Abigail, twin sisters Delilah and Joycelyn, Knik, and Martha &ndash; who we have focused on. All were approximately six years old when the project began, and happily all have stayed with the program throughout those years.  This has resulted in four final videos, about seven minutes each in length, that use footage from all five years. We see these children grow and mature, becoming more and more tenacious in their problem-solving and redesign efforts, more curious and observant, more eager, joyous and confident with regard to the challenges presented in the workshops. While our stories are anecdotal, what they show is supported by the data Iridescent has gathered about the effects of the workshops at all the schools indicating that these changes are not merely the result of standard child development but rather, in no small part, an enrichment and an awakening sparked by the program.   These overview videos join five others &ndash; one on each of the families and another on two USC engineering students who were among those taking an annual undergraduate course in which they developed the curriculum and then taught a workshop series based on the class plans they had developed. The SCA cinema team is currently completing post-production (editing, sound editing, subtitling, music scoring, color correction, mixing, etc.) on the final videos. USCÆs School of Cinematic Arts (SCA) has continued to provide free use the School's production and post-production equipment and facilities.  What opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided?  Our crew of SCA graduate and alumni students in the Production Division MFA program has consisted of some of the very best students in the program. Alejandro Martinez has continued as director/cinematographer for all five years; Rachel Mooradian is currently following in the footsteps of editors Melanie DÆAndrea and Josie Azzam; and Diego Perez has continued on production sound with backup from Ginge Cox, following Jesse Rosenman. Several others served as fill-in crew members. Jan Bezouska has provided sound design. Alexis Marsh and Samuel Jones composed the score. Dr. Jed Dannenbaum, Professor of Practice in SCAÆs Production Division and project Co-Principal Investigator, has served as writer-producer.  The student and alumni crew members continue to report that working on the project is inspiring and rewarding, and has affected their sense of what kind of media they hope to make as professionals.   How have the results been disseminated to communities of interest?  The completed videos can be viewed on the Irides...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
