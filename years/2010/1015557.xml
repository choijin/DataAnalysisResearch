<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ My research generally involves learning about human haptic (touch) perception and developing technologies that take advantage of this understanding. In particular, my work has focused on sensing the high-frequency vibrotactile acceleration signals that occurs when objects interact in the world, and feeding back these signals to human operators of robotic teleoperations systems, such as Intuitive Surgical's da Vinci Surgical System and Willow Garage's PR2. These signals allow the human operators to feel what the robot "feels".  Additionally these techniques can be applied to virtual simulations to improve realism and immersivenes.  In 2010, I  was fortunate enough to be selected for the National Science Foundation (NSF) East Asian and Pacific Summer Institute (EAPSI) to work for the summer in South Korea.  I was hosted by Dr. Seungmoon Choi, director of the Haptics and Virtual Reality (HVR) Laboratory, at POSTECH University in Pohang, South Korea.  Dr. Choi is a young professor who is already well recognized in the haptics community and I admire the quality of the papers and demostrations that have come out of his lab.    During my summer there, I primarily worked with Seokhee Jeon to integrate the virtual texture rendering techniques and hardware that we developed at the University of Pennsylvania Haptics Group with the "Haptic Augmented Reality: Stiffness Modulation" system that has been developed at the POSTECH HVR Laboratory. This system allows human users to interact with both real and virtual objects through a robotic haptic interface -- a SensAble PHANTOM augmented to have a vibration actuator, accelerometer and a force sensor -- which can change the characteristic feel of those objects (e.g. makes the object feel stiffer or softer and add a texture to the object).   Our method of texture rendering involves recording the tool accelerations that occur when a user drags a tool across a surface.  We record these accelerations at a range of different normal forces and scanning speeds. From these recordings we create stochastic texture models of the surface at different speeds and forces by using linear predictive coding (LPC) methods.  We then use these texture models to display realistic textures to users through a high-fidelity vibration (voice-coil) actuator which recreates the hand accelerations that would occur during a natural haptic interaction with a texture.   This recreation involves reading both the scanning velocity and the normal force the user is using to interact with the surface in real time.  These parameters are used to interpolate a texture model from the recorded models, which provides a desired tool acceleration signal that can be used to drive the vibration actuator.  In this way, we have been able to create realistic simulations of haptic textures.  The method of "stiffnesss modulation" developed at POSTECH essentially models all surfaces as non-linear springs.  In real time, an estimation of the depth at which the user's tool is pushing into an object is calculated and the normal force between the user's tool and the object is measured.  Using this depth and force information, they use the Sensable PHANToM Haptic Feedback Device to either push against the user (i.e. provide additional stiffness) or push with the user (i.e. reduce the stiffness).  This provides a very compelling change of stiffness feel to the object.  By the end of my time at POSTECH, we were able to successfully integrate our systems.  This work has the potential to help public welfare at large in the form of increased realism in training simulators for specialized skills such as surgery or dentistry.  However, we did not have the time to perform formal user studies on the system's effectiveness at the time.  Additionally, with the instrumentation of the stylus with a force sensor and accelerometer and the motion tracking capabilities of the PHANTOM allow us to capture data that characterizes the haptic experiences of objects.
