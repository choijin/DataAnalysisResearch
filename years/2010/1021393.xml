<AbstractNarration>Many perennial plants that live in hot climates have evolved to survive heat extremes.  It is assumed that the seemingly modest temperature increases of 5-6ºC predicted to accompany the next century of global climate change will have little effect on these plants. However, research on the effects of such temperature increases on plant cells growing near their thermal survival limits suggests otherwise, and has led to this project. Plants grow by the division of existing cells, and then enlarging the smaller, newly-formed cells. It has been shown that 5-6ºC temperature increases block the action of a critical growth hormone, auxin, that at lower temperatures activates genes required for plant cells to divide and grow.  In this project it will be determined whether 5-6ºC temperature increases block auxin's ability to activate genes that control cell division and growth in intact plants.  It will also be examined whether temperature increases block auxin action by inhibiting one particular enzyme called a Rac GTPase, an important protein in the chain of events that leads to the auxin-activated responses.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;This research will be conducted in the biology department of a small undergraduate college in which faculty members and students participate together in research. This project will encourage undergraduates to pursue research careers by: (1) recruiting and training two students each year to conduct research; (2) developing collaborative research projects between students; (3) creating a student-led science reading group; and (4) arranging student-hosted visits by prominent scientists who will consult with students and faculty on research. A regional faculty workshop will be held on the topic of integrating research into undergraduate teaching.  This study has implications for conservation management of native, heat-tolerant plants and the animals that may depend on them.  It may also find application in the development of strategies to genetically engineer heat-tolerant perennial crops and ornamentals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many perennial plants in hot climates have evolved to survive extreme heat.  It is assumed that the seemingly modest temperature increases of 5-6&deg;C predicted to accompany the next century of global climate change will have little effect on these plants, but research in Dr. Gary TallmanÆs lab at Willamette University suggests otherwise.  Working with undergraduate students and fellow scientists, Tallman studied the effects of 5-6&deg;C temperature increases on plant cells growing near their thermal survival limits.   Plants grow by dividing existing cells and then enlarging the smaller, newly-formed cells.  TallmanÆs research indicates that 5-6&deg;C temperature increases block the action of auxin, a critical growth hormone that, at lower temperatures, activates genes required for plant cells to divide and grow.  TallmanÆs lab used the award from the National Science Foundation to show that 5-6&deg;C temperature increases block production of nitric oxide, a gas required for auxin to activate genes for cell division and growth.  The group continues to examine whether temperature increases block auxin action by inhibiting one particular enzyme called a Rac GTPase, another important player in the chain of events that leads to the auxin-activated gene readout.  Tallman conducts research in the biology department of a small undergraduate college in which faculty members and students flourish intellectually and develop professionally through co-participation in research.  The NSF award was used to train undergraduates considering careers in research; enrich the research environment of his department; and further enhance integration of teaching and research both within his department and in similar universities in the Pacific Northwest.  Specifically, Tallman encouraged undergraduates to pursue research careers by: (1) recruiting and training two students each year to conduct research in his lab; (2) developing collaborative research projects between his research students and students in a colleagueÆs undergraduate molecular biology class; (3) creating a student-led science reading group; and (4) arranging student-hosted visits by prominent scientists who consulted with students and faculty on research.  He fostered scientistsÆ professional development by (1) training lab assistants for technical employment; (2) taking a sabbatical to improve his own skills; and (3) hosting a regional faculty workshop on integrating research into undergraduate teaching.   TallmanÆs research suggests that heat-tolerant perennials may trade survival for hormone-directed growth.  If so, climate change might be expected to change the natural landscape by further restricting the locations in which these types of plants can grow.  Should alternate locations present other challenges to the survival of these plants, they could become endangered due to climate change.  Thus, his study has implications for conservation management of native, heat-tolerant plants and animals that may depend on them.  TallmanÆs research may also find application in the development of strategies to genetically engineer heat-tolerant perennial crops and ornamentals.
