<AbstractNarration>Bowie State University's (BSU) project entitled: Building Excellence in Teaching, Training, Education and Research, will incorporate improvements and enhancements of STEM undergraduate education  based on lessons learned,  an evaluation of the strengths and accomplishments of the existing program, and an assessment of where BSU  needs to go to meet its existing needs. The project will expand outreach, teaching, and mentoring activities through the following three objectives: 1) redesigning gate keeper courses, curricular development, revision and enhancement reform, 2) expanding pathways for undergraduate recruitment, enrichment, retention and research experiences, and 3) strengthening faculty development activities. The goal is to improve all STEM programs at BSU by addressing existing weaknesses and by strengthening the research infrastructure &lt;br/&gt;The project will establish partnerships with industries and other academic institutions to increase research opportunities for BSU faculty and students.  The project will continue to serve as a beacon to the community, school teachers, students, and industry, putting the spotlight on the acute need for highly qualified STEM graduates. Partnerships with local industries, K-12 teachers, parents, and students, and community agencies will be established, to broaden the participation of minority students in STEM.  The interdisciplinary teaching curriculum and research infrastructure will be improved, which will increase the production of STEM graduates.</AbstractNarration>

Bowie State University is committed to quality education, offers a comprehensive set of undergraduate and graduate programs and serves over five thousand students.  BSU is an institution in the University System of Maryland (USM).   The University was one of six schools to receive a NASA/NSF Model Institution of Excellence (MIE) Award.

Easy access to faculty, role models,  peer mentors and learning teams, improved curricula, and faculty mentors with whom students can work on research projects are some of the factors that have created an environment that invites students to engage in learning by emphasizing collaborative, interdisciplinary, and inquiry-based experiences.    BSU embarked on its most comprehensive program to strengthen STEM education through the implementation of the NSF HBCU-UP Program, BETTER: Building Excellence in Teaching, Training, Education and Research.

BETTER and BETTER+ Projects impacted the STEM programs in the following areas: recruitment, retention and graduation of students in 4 years, integration of research in teaching, and support for the faculty development activities.  BSU has hosted the 7th Annual HBCU-UP National Student Research Conference sponsored by NSF.     A number of faculty members and students presented their research findings to various conferences such as Sigma Xi Annual Meeting and Research Conference; LS-AMP Board of Governors Meeting and Conference; Minorities in Research Science; Black Engineer of the Year Awards Conference; National Society of Black Engineers Convention; AMP National Meeting; Association of Southeastern Biologists Annual Meeting; and National Conference on Undergraduate Research  The program focused on faculty development through Mini-Grants. The most significant impact of these mini-grants was the number of students (66) involved. Their involvements, not only strengthened their understanding and interest in research but it led to a number of joint publications and presentations. . A large number of Journal and Conference research papers were published by STEM faculty and students.     In addition, Project BETTER and BETTER+ contributed in building new programs, curriculum reforms and outreach activities such as a new undergraduate degree program in Bio-Informatics. This program is designed to enhance all the STEM departments. The program is operational since fall 2010.     A NSA 'Center of Excellence in Information Assurance' has been established.     A Memorandum of Understanding involving Bowie State University, Virginia Commonwealth University, the US Army/Institute Surgical Research (ISR), and Body Media, Inc.;     A consortium of area colleges and universities (with 'HBCU-UP Grants') has been organized.
