<AbstractNarration>A reward has been made to the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies to offer its Translational Ecology for Undergraduates Program to 10 students for 12 weeks in the summers of 2011-2015. Students join the unique Cary Institute community of nearly 100 scientists, educators and staff. Students become producers of ecological knowledge, gaining first-hand experience of the rewards and challenges of a career in ecology. The program will help train a new generation of scientists who are both prepared and motivated to translate ecological science to the public.  The program weaves together activities in 5 strands: 1) cutting edge independent research projects working closely with a mentor scientist, 2) linkages to policy and management through a Case Study of a local environmental issue, 3) linkages to the public where students learn to write short, easy-to-understand summaries of ecology research projects, 4) linkages to education where students teach younger students and participate in an Education Roundtable, and 5) reflective practice, training and integration. Students receive training in Ethics and Responsible Conduct of Research and in safety, and participate in a Forum on Translational Ecology that showcases examples of translational ecology in action, as well as a diversity of professional role models and careers. Student and mentor survey characterize student growth and inform program improvement. The post-program survey is coordinated with the REU common assessment tool. Alumni are surveyed to identify long-term impacts on participants' motivation and success in career development. The twelve-week program is open to undergraduate freshmen, sophomores, juniors or first semester seniors who are US citizens or permanent residents. Participants receive a stipend, a meal allowance, free housing, and assistance with travel to and from the program. More information is available on the web at http://www.caryinstitute.org/education/reu.html, or by contacting PI Alan R. Berkowitz (berkowitza@caryinstitute.org) or REU Coordinator Patty Zolnik (zolnikp@caryinstitute.org).</AbstractNarration>
