<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project seeks to better understand the problem framing stage of complex problem solving; a key aspect of innovation.  The research team will study students? problem framing skills and establish the extent to which individualized, just-in-time feedback during the problem framing stage can help students develop the metacognitive skills needed to start solving complex problems.  A key aspect of this project focuses on personalized learning by extending the capabilities of online learning systems to address the broader analysis skills required in complex problem solving.  Specifically the team is interested in what student behaviors should trigger real-time feedback and determining how much real-time feedback helps students frame complex problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has broad applicability to many engineering programs.  Complex problem solving is a key skill that is very difficult to teach, and often requires significant investment of institutional resources.  The real-time feedback system will be developed as an open-source project, which will enhance the ability of other programs to build from and adapt this work.</AbstractNarration>
