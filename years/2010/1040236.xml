<AbstractNarration>1040236&lt;br/&gt;Sabatino&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new recently commercialized experimental technique measures time-resolved three-dimensional fluid-flow velocity fields. This revolutionary technology provides unprecedented access to the details of the physics of turbulent flows. The new instrumentation will be utilized both in an existing laboratory at Lafayette College that investigates flow through blood vessels as well as in a new water channel facility that is being constructed for the investigation of coherent structures in turbulent boundary layers. This request will upgrade an existing two-dimensional particle image velocimetry (PIV) system that was purchased with NSF support in 2006 (MRI award CTS-0618923) to add the capability for fully three dimensional velocity field measurements by means of a tomographic reconstruction technique. To complement the relatively low sampling frequency of the PIV, a laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) system is included in the request. The LDV system records high frequency point-wise data which can provide accurate turbulent statistics that are required to properly scale and quantify the turbulent flows, as well as obtain velocity energy spectra which cannot be established with the PIV. Designed to be able to record simultaneously with the PIV system, the LDV will also provide critical validation measurements for the emerging 3-D PIV technique. This requested instrumentation will extend the research concentrations of the investigators and expand the research training and research opportunities available to undergraduate students at Lafayette College.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project's principal outcome was the new insight into the fundamental fluid mechanics associated with how a fluid flowing over a solid surface transitions from a smooth laminar flow to a chaotic turbulent flow.  This transition is nearly ubiquitous in engineering applications that include the flow of air over an aircraft fuselage or wing, the flow of water around a submarine and the flow of combustion gases around the blades of a turbine in a gas-turbine engine.  The change from laminar to turbulent flow has a dramatic effect on the performance of a wing or turbine and the ability to predict when and where the transition will occur remains an elusive goal of the technical community.  This project used laser diagnostic equipment that can measure the speed and trajectory of a fluid, such as air or water, in three dimensions to provide a complete picture of a complicated flow pattern in time.  The laser diagnostic systems were used to measure the behavior of a fluid flowing over a smooth surface when a small disturbance is introduced into the flow.  The disturbance causes a coherent structure to form.  These structures are much like a smoke ring in air that remains identifiable for a long time after it has formed,  The laser diagnostic equipment allowed the coherent structures to be measured and tracked in time and space so that the conditions that would generate a structure strong enough to form a second disturbance on its own could be identified.  These set of conditions might be generalizable and help identify the state of a fluid flow that would have a high likelihood of changing from laminar to turbulent.  The project involved 8 undergraduate research assistants who were trained to use the laser diagnostic systems. and another 50 engineering students were exposed to the experimental techniques used in this study through demonstrations given by the PI.
