<AbstractNarration>This work will provide the first continental-scale sample of taxonomic, genetic and functional diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi from pine ecosystems. These fungi form symbiotic relationships with the roots of dominant forest plants, and provide them with nutrients and water in exchange for photosynthetically-fixed carbon. Despite the importance of ectomycorrhizal fungi in global nutrient cycles, little is known about large-scale patterns of fungal community structure relative to plants, animals, or even bacteria. This project will establish patterns of gene flow and selection for multiple ectomycorrhizal fungi across North America, use a hierarchical phylogenetic sampling design to measure variation in functional enzyme production across individuals, populations and species, and use RNA based metagenomics to measure functional trait expression on mycorrhizal root tips. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will result in a large, open access database of taxonomic barcode and functional genes that can be used by researchers to generate predictive models of fungal ecosystems. It will include training of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in cutting-edge techniques in an understudied field, will result in outreach activities targeted toward the general public, and will include activities for K-12 students and educators designed to foster early student interests in fungi.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This study was the first to examine the pattern of ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity associated with pine forests across the North American continent. These fungi are essential root mutualists of pines that are required for establishment, growth, and health of our forests, yet little was known about their distribution, function, and genetic structure across our continent.  The microscopic nature of fungi and technical difficulties associated with their identification are the primary reasons for our collective lack of knowledge.   In this study we assayed for the presence of these fungi in 68 sites across North America by DNA sequence analyses of the soil, by using pine seedlings as bioassays for the presence of active spores in the soil, and by collecting specimens of "crust fungi" &ndash; some of the least studied members of this group.  All three methods showed that species of these fungi are regionally limited, and that each area of the continent has specific fungal species that are characteristic of it.   This finding is important because it shows that species diversity of these fungi is patterned in a similar way to the plant communities, and thus preservation of fungal species will have a strong regional and habitat component.    The "spore bank", those ectomycorrhizal fungi that are present as reactive spores in the soil, are assumed to be important for regeneration of forests following disturbances such as logging or fire.  Two of our study sites burned in a wildfire during the study period, and by resampling these sites after the fire we were able to test this assumption.   We found that catastrophic wildfire reduced the spore bank abunance. Nevertheless all of the most common species that recolonized pine seedlings following fire were present as spores prior to the fire, and at least one of these species, Rhizopogon olivaceotinctus, appears to be adapted to fire and increased its abundance following this disturbance.  These results are important because the increase frequency of high severity fires will require massive forest regeneration.  We showed that the ectomycorrhizal component of this process seems to remain intact.   Suillus brevipes is an ectomycorrhizal fungus that is commonly found in regenerating pine forest across North America.  We studied its genetic diversity in six populations from across western and northern North America by sequencing entire genomes of 67 individual cultured isolates.  This approach provided unprecedented detail in the genetic structure of this species and allowed us to examine its gene flow and evolution.  We found that populations separated by as little as 200 miles had no exchange of genes.  This was surprising because the species prolifically produces microscopic spores that have the potential for long distance dispersal.  This result extends our finding of regional species differences to the  genetic level of individual species. In addition we found evidence for local adaptation in genes related to soil conditions and climate.  Thus, the genetic variation associated with regional differences is likely to be functionally important.    In total 14 peer-reviewed scientific papers and a book chapter have thus far been published from this work.  These papers are already being high cited by other researchers.  In addition parts of two doctorial dissertations were derived from this work, and two to three more peer-reviewed papers are likely to be published.   This work resulted in training and outreach at multiple levels. Two PhD students and one postdoctoral associate were trained during the course of this project. One more PhD student is still in residence. The postdoc, has now accepted a faculty position at the University of Montana, and one of the students is now an assistant professor at the University of Hawaii.  A student that completed her PhD in May 2016 went on to a postdoctoral position at the University of California, Irvine.   A total of 10 undergraduates were involved in the research, at least half of these have now gone on to graduate school, medical school, or are working in technical positions.  Outreach to general public included 10 talks at amateur mushroom societies or at National Park venues, and assistance at annual fungus fairs.  In addition we hosted the Bay Area Mycological Society at Berkeley.           Last Modified: 12/07/2016       Submitted by: Thomas D Bruns]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
