<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multi-User program (CRIF:MU),  Professor Steven Suib and colleagues Christian Brueckner, Amy Howell, Nicholas Leadbeater and Mark Peczuh from the University of Connecticut will acquire a console and probe to upgrade a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. This award will enhance research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as (a) synthesis by molecular design of catalysts, surfaces, ceramics, adhesives and other materials, (b) synthesis and exploitation of strained heterocycles with alpha-unsaturation, including beta-lactones, (c) synthesis and study of pyrrole-modified porphyrins, (d) synthesis of molecules and the characterization of their biological properties in comparison to natural products, (e) development of new synthetic methodology for organic chemistry, particularly that using microwave heating, (f) investigation of covalent and non-covalent molecular interactions in polymeric materials that result in self-assembled structures in the nanometer to micrometer regime, (g) study cell signaling and cell migration by using small molecule effectors of cellular function, (h) synthesis of well-defined polymers, normally amphiphilic block copolymers, for applications in self-assembly, and (i) understanding the role metal ions play in intracellular and intercellular signaling using molecular photocages, and the photochemistry of nitrobenzyl and azobenzene chromophores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to follow the progress of chemical reactions, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solids and in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to carry out frontier chemistry related research and to train students in modern research techniques. The spectrometer will be used by undergraduate and graduate students in research projects and in laboratory courses.</AbstractNarration>
