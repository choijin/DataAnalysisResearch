<AbstractNarration>SES: 1002973&lt;br/&gt;PI: John Markoff&lt;br/&gt;University of Pittsburgh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: Jane M. Walsh&lt;br/&gt;University of Pittsburgh&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project analyzes how the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW), a nonviolent, farmworker organization determined to improve living and labor conditions in Immokalee, FL, and its allied organizations, which include the Student Farmworker Alliance (SFA), Interfaith Action of Southwest Florida (IA) and the Alliance for Fair Food (AFF), work together while preserving the CIW?s autonomy. Through the use of archival materials, ethnographic research on both the aggrieved (CIW) and allied (SFA, IA and AFF) organizations, and interviews with staff, former staff and members of these organizations, this project seeks to understand how a social movement is able to attract and incorporate individual and organizational allied support yet maintain autonomy and avoid co-optation of the movement?s goals, organizational style, and collective actions.  Four questions guide this project: 1) how does the CIW attract allies? 2) how does the CIW incorporate these allies into each campaign and into the broader movement? 3) to what extent has the CIW retained autonomy and control of the movement?s goals, organizational style, and collective actions? and 4) to the extent that it does so, how was this autonomy achieved and how is it maintained?  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS:  The broader impact of this project is that it speaks to how transient workers with different ethnic and linguistic backgrounds who lack resources (such as the right to unionize and steady employment) have been able to work effectively with allies toward higher wages, improved working conditions and corporate policy changes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Goals:  This project has three main research goals:  1) Explain the conceptual distinction between aggrieved and ally groups and how both work together while preserving autonomy for the former;  2) Investigate the processes by which a social movement is able to maintain the face and voice of the aggrieved participants and avoid allied support that is paternalistic;  3) Investigate the motivations and reasons behind allied participation in a social movement.  The case study for this project was the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (aggrieved group) and its ally organizations including Student/Farmworker Alliance, Interfaith Action of Southwest Florida and Just Harvest USA (allied groups).  Findings:   1) The data suggest that the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW) and its allies comprise a network that is simultaneously centralized and decentralized. Social movement bridges (sometimes called bridge builders and bridge brokers in the literature), which include current and former allied staff and long time allies, tie the decentralized network into the geographically centralized community of Immokalee, FL.  2) The results indicate that the intangible benefits allies receive from their participation with the CIW aids in the maintenance of a substantial allied base and the fostering of a critical consciousness brings "outsiders" into the movement to work with as opposed to for Immokalee farmworkers, thereby evading paternalistic support.  3) This particular model of organizing (a combination of centralization and decentralization and the presence of intangible benefits) has the consequence of providing autonomy for both the CIW and its allied organizations.  Broader Impacts of the Project:  This project provides a social scientific analysis to social movement participants, who can potentially benefit from this perspective. By distributing copies of my dissertation, movement participants have access to my findings. The broad social benefits involve the articulation of pathways for the effective incorporation of groups frequently thought to be marginalized as well as groups often considered to be privileged into a single movement.
