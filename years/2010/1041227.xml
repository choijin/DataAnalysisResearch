<AbstractNarration>Marine environments are becoming more acidic as a result of increased atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide; this gas dissolves in sea water and is driving a process known as ocean acidification.   However, organisms that live on the ocean floor (e.g. crabs, sea stars and oysters) experience, as a result of their biological activity, daily variations in their pH (acidity) that are greater than those caused by the increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This project addresses the comparative effects on porcelain crabs of increased ocean acidity (which changes slowly over years) with the daily variation in pH that these animals experience.  The impacts of simultaneous changes in pH and temperature will be assessed, and it will be determined if early life history stages (i.e., crab larvae) are more sensitive to ocean acidification than adults.  The responses that will be measured include calcification of the shell, metabolism, altered expression of genes and the modification of proteins. This research is expected to produce new and ecologically important information, across multiple levels of biological organization, about the impacts of ocean acidification on a coastal marine organism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This research will provide interdisciplinary training for graduate and undergraduate students in biochemistry, genomics, physiology and ecology. Students who are members of groups underrepresented in science will be recruited through programs at the San Francisco State University Student Enrichment Opportunity office, and through collaboration between Cal Poly and Hancock University.  The investigators will incorporate this research in their undergraduate physiology classes, which emphasize active learning.  A workshop on proteomics for researchers interested in ecological physiology will be conducted at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.  The investigators will present public lectures on ocean acidification and climate change, and write articles on these topics in the popular press.  Teacher training workshops designed to enhance secondary education in climate change biology will be conducted at the Romberg Tiburon Center and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ocean Acidification: Synergistic Effects of Temperature and pH Variability on Physiology, Transcriptome and Proteome of Porcelain Crabs      The grant investigated the cellular response of marine organisms to three separate conditions: 1) temperature stress, 2) low pH stress, e.g., ocean acidification (OA), or 3) a combination of low pH, temperature and emersion (aerial exposure) stress, to look at the effect of multiple physical stressors simultaneously, as is predicted to occur with climate change.  Since low pH (or high CO2 partial pressures) affects seawater saturation levels of CaCO3, our work focused mainly on calcifying organisms, e.g., crustacean, which are dependent on CaCO3 to form their exoskeleton.  We analyzed proteins that changed with stress because they are the major catalysts of functional changes in cells and so far there have been very few studies using this analytical approach to assess the effects of OA.                 Porcelain crabs inhabit the inter- and subtidal zones along the Pacific Coast of North America.  They are an emerging model species for studies on environmental stress responses and were the major study organism of three of our experiments (in collaboration with Dr. J. Stillman from San Francisco State University, CA).  We exposed the intertidal porcelain crab Petrolisthes cinctipes to three different stress conditions: (Experiment 1) variable thermal acclimation regimes with a subsequent heat stress, (Experiment 2) low pH and emersion (low tide or exposure to aerial conditions as they occur in the crabÆs intertidal environment), and (Experiment 3) low pH and mild heat stress during emersion (Fig. 1).               In Experiment 1 we acclimated crabs to three different regimes of fluctuating temperature conditions: 10&deg;C, 10-20&deg;C and 10-30&deg;C.  After four weeks we exposed animals from all three acclimation regimes to a 30&deg;C heat stress.  The objective of this study was to identify the role of chronic fluctuations in temperature on the ability of the organism, specifically its claw muscle, to respond to a subsequent acute heat stress.  Proteins involved in energy metabolism, specifically in the transfer of phosphoryl groups and of glycolysis increased abundance in response to acute heat stress, the magnitude of which was dependent on the specific acclimation regime.  Hemocyanin showed increasing abundances with heat stress, possibly indicating greater demand for oxygen. Changes in cytoskeletal and actin binding proteins indicate a role for actin filament stabilization under acute heat stress following acclimation to extreme temperature fluctuations.  Acute heat stress lowered the abundance of proteins promoting inflammation, suggesting that it is suppressed during heat stress.                  In Experiment 2 we varied pH (8.15 versus 7.6) and aerial exposure (4 h of emersion) over a two-week period and subsequently characterized changes in protein abundance in gill tissue of adult crabs.  Our results showed that low pH conditions led to changes in the abundance of cuticle-forming proteins, possible causing a restructuring of the gill microstructure.  While low pH increased abundance of proteins of glycolysis, the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, simultaneous low pH and emersion caused a decrease of the same metabolic proteins.  Molecular chaperones involved in protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum showed lower abundance at low pH regardless of emersion stress, suggesting that the synthesis of excretory proteins was lower under more acidic conditions and uncoupled from emersion or hypoxic stress.  Most directly related to low pH stress, we found that low pH alone increased the abundance of proteins involved in the excretion of proton equivalents through the exocytosis of ammonium, but that simultaneous emersion to aerial conditions inhibited the same response.  Overall, these findings show that the cellular response to low pH (or OA) can lead to the excr...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
