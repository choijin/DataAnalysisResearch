<AbstractNarration>This program will undertake a series of observational and theoretical studies of the powerful jets which are seen to emerge at close to the speed of light from the centers of active galaxies and quasars, and also from some x-ray binary systems known as micro-quasars within our own Galaxy.  It will attempt to answer basic questions about the jets and their central engines, by exploiting the information in the linear and circular polarization of the radio emission.  The observations will yield other fundamental information such as the mix of positrons and protons in the jet, and the jet's kinetic luminosity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students, and working with local teachers and students in using the campus 24" telescope.</AbstractNarration>
