<AbstractNarration>This project will support the organization and execution of the Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) Workshop in 2011, 2012, and 2013.   This meeting of upper atmospheric researchers has been held annually since 1986, and more than 300 participants attend each year from 75 industrial, academic, and government institutions.  Typically, about a third of the attendees are students from more than 25 universities, including those from outside the US.   This proposal would support arrangements for meeting space, student travel accommodations, special event planning, meeting website content, and workshop materials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes for 4-year CEDAR Workshop NSF award for 2011-2014  Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) is a focused Global Change program sponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to enhance the capability of ground-based instruments to measure the upper atmosphere and to coordinate instrument and model data for the benefit of the scientific community. The upper atmosphere is affected by tides generated in the troposphere that propagate upwards, as well as by particles and electric fields carried to Earth by the solar wind. Thus the CEDAR community has ties to the much larger lower atmosphere scientific community, as well to the NSF Solar Heliospheric and Interplanetary Environment (SHINE) community, and very close ties to the NSF magnetosphere Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) community.  The major goals of this project were to organize, hold, and provide student travel funds to the annual summer CEDAR Workshops from 2011 to 2014, and to keep the database of names, addresses and emails current, as well as supporting community unity through wiki web pages and community emails throughout the year.  The CEDAR community website is a wiki site at http://cedarweb.vsp.ucar.edu where approximately 2000 international members have logins to be able to add text and enter material.  There has always been a strong emphasis on students in the CEDAR community, with tutorial speakers, a Sunday Student Workshop, and judges for Student Poster Prizes at the annual meetings.  About 375 participants come to the annual CEDAR workshops from about 85 institutions, where 20-25 of these are foreign institutions.  In 2011, we met jointly with the NSF Geospace Environment Modeling (GEM) magnetosphere group so there were about 550 participants.  About 40% of the participants at a CEDAR Workshop are students, and about 85% of them present posters of their work.  The students upload their posters on the wiki before the meetings so the judges can start to look at them.  There are about 30 individual workshops at each meeting where the agenda can be posted before the meeting and presentations can be added after the meeting for archival. The major plenary talks are videotaped and are available on-line as .mp4 videos at http://cedarweb.vsp.ucar.edu/wiki/index.php/Workshop:CEDAR_Videos so students and other researchers can see them at their leisure.  The CEDAR Workshops are premier workshops for student involvement and networking of the entire community, and contribute strongly to the educational development of the students who come and participate.
