<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation: Multi-user (CRIF:MU) program, Professor Robert Holman and colleagues Todd Davis, Lisa Goss, Joshua Pak and Rene Rodriguez from Idaho State University will acquire a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) with a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) attached to a mass spectrometer (MS). The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as (a) synthesis and controlled decomposition of single-source precursors for the formation of nanomaterials and (b) study and use of nanomaterials for the preparation of photovoltaic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass spectrometers (MS) are used to identify the chemical composition of a sample by measuring the mass of the molecular constituents in the sample. The DSC attachment allows the measurement of the difference in the amount of heat required to increase the temperature of a sample and reference as a function of temperature while the TGA capability shows the changes in weight of a sample as it is being heated. These techniques provide information on the chemical composition of various materials. The instrumentation will be used not only in research but also in research training and teaching of undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Department of Chemistry at Idaho State University houses several research projects that require modern thermal analysis capabilities.  Before the NSF award, we had outdated non-functional Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC).  With the award, we were able to acquire a new DSC and a simultaneous thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and mass spectrometry (MS) capabilities.  The acquisition of these capabilities meant saving money for sending out samples to external analysis firms at high costs and being able to train our students in modern instrumentations both in teaching and research settings.  As a result, we have increased the number of students majoring and completing chemistry degrees.  Our research activities now routinely involve not only undergraduate and graduate students but also local high school students.  During the grant period, we have been able to leverage these state-of-the-art capabilities to recruit and educate students, especially students from traditionally under represented groups in STEM fields, who may not have been interested studying chemistry or conducting research. In addition, these modern instrumentations excited many of our students about chemistry and inspired them to conduct many outreach activities, such as visiting local GK-12 classrooms and organizing large chemistry demo shows where local community members and children learn about importance of research, high education in STEM fields, and science literacy.  This grant program allowed the members of the Department of Chemistry at Idaho State University to be better equipped in essential teaching and research capabilities and help become a contributing part of the community.
