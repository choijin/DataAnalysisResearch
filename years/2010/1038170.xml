<AbstractNarration>The University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) Innovation through Institutional Integration (I-3) educational research project investigates the efficacies and efficiencies of four intervention techniques used at UMBC. These techniques are designed to increase and enhance the graduation and retention rates, and more broadly the educational experiences, of all students in the STEM disciplines particularly those from underrepresented groups.  In this project, UMBC conducts a randomized control trial comparing various combinations of interventions to obtain rigorous empirical estimates of their impacts on student success, as well as their cost-effectiveness.  The four interventions studied are: 1) Community-based study groups; 2) Pro-active mentoring and ongoing retention risk assessment by high-status faculty; 3) Pro-active mentoring and ongoing retention risk assessment by staff members; and 4) Freshman active learning experience in CASTLE (the College of Natural and Mathematical Sciences -CNMS- Active Science Teaching and Learning Environment. In addition to carrying out extensive analyses to identify treatment effects, this project compares the cost-effectiveness of the various interventions in order to identify the techniques that have both high impact and low net costs. The cost-effectiveness analysis will be used to guide policy makers in deciding how to best allocate resources to achieve specific ends. To analyze cost-effectiveness, UMBC collects three types of costs for each intervention: direct, indirect, and administrative costs.  Ultimately, this work investigates the assumption that an essential approach for expanding participation and increasing retention/graduation rates is to identify the components of successful interventions that have the greatest impact at the lowest cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project partners senior administrators, department chairs, faculty, professional advisors and project principal investigators to enhance the success of intervention techniques and their likelihood of being institutionalized beyond the funding period.  It incorporates leading theory-based intervention components and state-of-the-art evaluation techniques to substantially advance knowledge regarding interventions that enhance student achievement in the STEM disciplines.   The integration of the identified cost-effective techniques across extant programs will enable UMBC to make the best use of scarce resources, increase and diversify STEM graduates, and provide a framework for institutionalization of UMBC programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The UMBC iCubed project used a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to study the effectiveness of specific academic support initiatives involving students in their first year of college who are pursuing STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) majors at UMBC.  The overall goal of the research was to conduct a rigorous, comparative study of four cost-effective intervention techniques designed to improve undergraduate student success in STEM majors.  We believe that the identification and application of techniques that have high impact and low net costs are essential to accomplish our central goals of broadening participation and increasing STEM graduation and retention rates. Beginning with Fall 2011 and continuing through the first three years of the project, up to 2400 undergraduates drawn from the 2011, 2012, and 2013 freshman classes were invited to participate in one of five groups.   Student participants were randomly assigned to one of the following four interventions or to a "treatment as usual" group over the fall and spring semesters of their first year at UMBC:  Facilitated      community-based study groups  Direct      mentoring from high-status professors in their majors One-on-one      guidance from professional staff specific to career goals  Enrollment      in special active learning math courses   During the last two years of the study, the focus shifted to an examination of the results, institutionalization of appropriate techniques, and dissemination of findings.  The analysis of the results of this study includes detailed comparison of measures of student success (such as semester retention and progression rates) and the scalability of successful components.   We are currently monitoring and studying the continuing academic performance of iCubed students at UMBC, but preliminary results suggest positive outcomes for several interventions.  For students who entered their second year, those who were assigned to proactive mentoring by faculty, study group support, or active learning are statistically more likely to complete more STEM credits than students who were assigned to treatment as usual. The results also suggest approximately a 3 credit increase over treatment as usual students suggesting a shorter time to graduation.  The effects for active learning and study group support are smaller than the effects for proactive mentoring by faculty but are still statistically higher than the treatment as usual group.  Students who are assigned to study group support are significantly less likely to withdraw from STEM courses during their first year as compared to treatment as usual.   One of the unanticipated, but critical, outcomes of the project highlights the importance of collaboration and relationships across multiple units to implement the study. We intend to conduct a social network analysis to map the relationships that shaped the UMBC iCubed network over the years, identify central actors, document social network characteristics (density, centrality and reciprocity), and explore the flow of information and resources through network ties.
