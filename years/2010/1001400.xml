<AbstractNarration>1001400 &lt;br/&gt;VanBriesen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to collect and organize critical data into a cyberinfrastructure demonstration within Dunkard Creek Watershed.  This will enable visualization and simulation to improve decision making and to demonstrate the utility of comprehensive watershed data access for rapid response to catastrophic events.  The relevant data are being collected by multiple state and federal agencies, non-governmental organizations and university researchers in an intensive response to a disastrous fish kill that occurred in early September, 2009.  More than 10,000 individual fish, representing 18 species, as well as 16 species of mussels, were lost in an ecosystem collapse that spanned thirty miles of the creek.  The cause of the event is still under investigation but has been linked to an invasive algal species bloom enabled by high salt concentrations in the creek (TDS greater than 20,000 mg/L was reported in the stream).  Dunkard Creek feeds into the Monongahela River, where 11 public drinking water providers use this water as a source.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many different types of data (water chemistry, biological diversity, fish autopsy) are being collected over a significant geographical area in a short time frame using multiple methods (fixed sensors for water chemistry, grab samples followed by laboratory assessment for chemical and biological parameters, expert in-person evaluation of fish and ecosystem conditions) by multiple different organizations.  The intensity of the data collection and its high variability represent a rare opportunity to demonstrate the potential of cyberinfrastructure to manage data and provide integrated modeling for watershed decision-making.  The one year project will involve collection of historical data, organization of all data associated with the ongoing assessment in response to the fish kill, and creation of a watershed model and visualization analysis tool.  Due to the uncoordinated but intensive focus on this issue right now, it is critical that they begin to organize and analyze all the data sources as soon as possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Watershed-level data and models will provide support to policy-makers at the local, state and federal level.  The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection proposed new regulations in April 2009 to reduce allowable salt discharges into all waters of the state; however, the position of Dunkard Creek - meandering at the border of West Virginia and Pennsylvania - makes decisions regarding its use complicated.  Integrated cyberinfrastructure that enables visualization and 'what if' scenarios will inform citizens about the effect of changes to permitted activities in the watershed.  The watersheds in southwestern Pennsylvania support diverse assimilative uses, including legacy acid mine drainage as well as new water removal and wastewater discharge associated with Marcellus Shale Gas Development.  Improved understanding of all water and wastewater flows within potentially affected watersheds will enhance public discussions of the suitability of decisions being made throughout the region.  By integrating the development of the cyberinfrastructure with educational and outreach activities in the region they will enable public use of the data as well as to inform policy decision making regarding watershed activities and future monitoring plans.  Due to the passionate community outcry surrounding this event, it is critical that they develop models and visualization tools to assist with public understanding as soon as possible.</AbstractNarration>
