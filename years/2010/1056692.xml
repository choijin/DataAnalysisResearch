<AbstractNarration>This research will study nitrogen cycling in two paired, forested watersheds of the northeastern U.S.  Scientists will experimentally increase the abundance of the rare, naturally occurring, stable isotope of nitrogen (15N) to track the movement of nitrogen from precipitation through trees, microbes, soils, soil solutions and finally into streams.  This research will be carried out in two adjacent forested watersheds at the Bear Brook Watershed in Maine.  One watershed has been treated with nitrogen fertilizer for 22 years to mimic air-pollution effects on forests and streams - one of the longest studies of its kind in the world. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Nitrogen dynamics in forested watersheds are of intense scientific interest because nitrogen is typically the most limiting plant nutrient in land-based ecosystems.  And yet, during the last half of the 20th century, emissions of nitrogen and sulfur from fossil-fuel combustion and other sources created "acid rain," causing the leaching of soil calcium and aluminum. These emissions also resulted in excess nitrogen inputs to forested watersheds, a condition referred to as nitrogen saturation, which yields increased amounts of nitrogen in streams draining forests. In the 21st century, nitrogen dynamics altered by climatic change will also influence forest health and downstream ecosystems.</AbstractNarration>

Researchers then began to study the movement of the stable isotope form of nitrogen into soils, ground vegetation, tree components, and eventually to streams. Research is showing that there are differences in the characteristics of soils, soil organic matter and microbial communities as a result of the long-term treatments to West Bear that is influencing the movement of the tracer through the ecosystem. Research is showing where the 15-N is within the suite of organic matter molecules that will allow us to better predict the fate of added nitrogen to forest soils, information that is of relevance to various pollution concerns.
