<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;This project is to analyze earthquake data collected after a large earthquake sequence occurred in the Malawi section of the East African Rift zone.  InSAR data from the area will also be analyzed to determine how the region was affected by the earthquakes.  The goal of the proposed work is to obtain a better understanding of the deformation associated with the inception and early stages of rifting of a continent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This project has a large component of international collaboration.  The PIs have a strong relationship with the Malawi Geological Survey department and will host Malawi colleagues in the U.S. so they can learn earthquake relocation techniques.  The PIs will also travel to Malawi to speak with various groups, and help to install the software needed for seismic analysis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In December 2009, the region of Karonga, in northern Malawi, east Africa, was rocked by a sequence of moderate but damaging earthquakes, with three events with magnitude of almost 6 occurring over a ten-day period, with numerous smaller but widely felt events.  The events resulted in four casualties, 300 injuries and displaced over 5000 people.  This earthquake sequence is unusual and scientifically interesting for two principal reasons. First, with three damaging events with very similar magnitudes over a two-week period, it deviated from a typical earthquake sequence of a mainshock followed by much smaller aftershocks.  Second, nearly all other damaging earthquakes within the East African Rift (EAR) system appear to be on major, well-mapped extensional faults (e.g. 2006 M 7 Mozambique event), but the locations of the main Karonga events and associated surface deformation imply that they occurred due to slip on small, previously unknown normal faults within the crust above the major extensional fault.  Following the damaging events, scientists from Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and the Earth Institute at Columbia University deployed a temporary seismic network in the region at the request of the Director of the Malawi Geological Survey Department (MGSD).  This network recorded over 2000 aftershocks in a four-month period in early 2010.  These data provide a unique opportunity to better understand processes of continental rifting that are responsible for this unusual sequence.  It also offers an unprecedented opportunity for outreach and capacity building to help improve the monitoring and assessment of seismic hazard in Malawi.  Our results indicate that the unusual nature of the Karonga sequence is due to a complex faulting environment.   The aftershock data uniquely reveal that several hanging-wall faults were active in the 2009-2010 earthquake sequence.   Much of the activity is localized on a shallow, previously unmapped structure that is clearly distinct from (much shallower than) the major extensional fault in the region.  In addition, significant activity extends to one or more additional shallow faults that parallel the first, including evidence of active faulting beneath Lake Malawi.  This result implies that large, damaging earthquakes in regions of continental extension are not limited to the large, well-mapped structures, but can occur on a myriad of smaller structures.  Furthermore, multiple such faults can produce damaging earthquakes in a region at any given time.  This knowledge can be incorporated into hazard assessments in east Africa and other extensional settings.   Our project also had broad and lasting impact on improving earthquake monitoring and hazard assessment in Malawi.  We successfully engaged the Malawi Geological Survey in both the data collection and research activities associated with the Karonga events.  Deploying and operating the temporary monitoring network provided the MGSD with the experience necessary to convince the Malawi government to invest in a permanent monitoring network.  To build on that success, we hosted a three-week training and research visit at Columbia for three staff seismologists from the Malawi Geological Survey.  During this time, we worked with them on the analysis of the Karonga sequence and on developing tools that could be used to analyze data from their new national network. We followed this with a visit by Lamont scientists to the MGDS headquarters in Zomba, Malawi to continue with training and installation of software that can be used by the MGDS for data analysis.  By supporting the technical and scientific development of MGDS personnel, Malawian scientists and the government are better prepared for assessing and ultimately mitigating seismic hazard.
