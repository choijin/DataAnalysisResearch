<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V Wecoma, a 185? general purpose research vessel operated by Oregon State University as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet.  The vessel is owned by the National Science Foundation. The request includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) SBE 45 Micro TSG&lt;br/&gt;2) SBE 38 Digital Thermometer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcomes Report Oceanographic Instrumentation 2010 Oceanographic Cents and Facilities Section Award 1013131 Oregon State Universty   Summary              We were funded in the 2010 Oceanographic Instrumentation proposal to purchase:   -       Upgrade the under way salinity measurements with two SBE 45 Thermosalinograph (TSG).   -       Upgrade the under way sea surface temperature (SST) sensors with the purchase of three SBE 38 Digital Thermometers.              The items were purchased and installed. The budget of was fully utilized. Detailed Information  II. Sea water measurements; sampling and analysis  SBE 45 Micro Thermosalinograph (TSG)               We purchased two of the SBE 45 TSG instruments. The old æhome grownÆ TSG system was removed. The new SBE 45 was re-plumbed to our current clean seawater system with very little adaptation needed. The new calibrated serial output of the SBE 45 was easily integrated into our new OSU Data Acquisition System (DAS).

Salinity and Sea Surface Temperature are fundamental oceanographic data phenomenon required by all oceanographic disciplines. Every properly fitted oceanographic vessel should have an accurate high-resolution salinity and temperature sensor with proper backups. This grant fulfilled the upgrade of these instruments for the R/V WECOMA. We now have the most up to date high frequency sensors that fit with the University-National Oceanographic laboratory System (UNOLS) sampling standard.              Advance Discovery and Understanding While Promoting Teaching, Training and Learning:  The equipment purchased is being used in a variety of settings to advance discovery and understanding through upgraded capabilities of the R/V WECOMA. The R/V WECOMA is used by a variety of investigators on numerous NSF projects.  The equipment resides and is maintained in a shared use pool that is available to all funded NSF projects on UNOLS vessels. Upgrades to the capabilities of the ship and equipment pool naturally enhance the opportunities for new discoveries and greater understanding of oceanic processes across disciplines.  In addition, continuous upgrade programs ensure that the most modern and effective tools are available to new investigators and graduate and undergraduate students.  Providing modern tools and the best data possible is critical for the training of the next generation of ocean scientists. These instruments increase the accuracy and resolution of our under way data. This allows for higher quality and more reliable data for the users of the R/V WECOMA and the shore side data centers use in the future.  Enhance Infrastructure for Research and Education:  The primary purpose of the Oceanographic Instrumentation Program is to improve the infrastructure available to ocean scientists, and students at sea. Updating and improving our salinity and sea surface temperature measurements enhances the quality and usability of ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
