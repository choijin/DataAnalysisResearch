<AbstractNarration>In this proposal, the PI will develop numerical methods and their mathematical analysis, ultimately their implementations in studying wave phenomena in nano-electronics, coupled arrays of quantum dots, and phase shift masks in lithography. Propagation of classical electromagnetic and quantum waves plays a key role in these physical and engineering systems. In order to gain a quantitative understanding of the wave phenomena in those systems, accurate and efficient numerical simulations are needed with appropriately designed numerical algorithms.  The targeted applications motivate our research with the following three proposed numerical methods: [1] An adaptive conservative cell average spectral method for Wigner equations in electron transport of nano-electronics; [2] A fast integral solver for quantum wave scattering in 3-D quantum dots in layered media [3] A parallel spectral element method based on eigen-oscillations for complex Helmholtz equations. The potential technology impact of this research is to understand the physics involved and provide design guidelines for nano-electronics such as nano-MOSFETs, phase shift masks, and quantum dots.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The numerical methods developed in this research will be used for the engineering design of quantum devices with significant impact on maintaining US technology preeminence in the development of new VLSI microchips, and  next generation X-ray  lithography in microchip manufacturing. Also, graduate students trained in this project will provide skilled workforce in the competitive high technology job market as well as potential academic researchers.</AbstractNarration>
