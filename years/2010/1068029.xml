<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award is to develop new modeling methodologies for concurrent product assembly module design and supplier selection. Such methodologies will support quick and efficient adaptation of product assembly modules for high product variety, and allow identification of key interrelation between product module re-configurations and supply chain performance. The approach of this research is to develop three methods and integrate them:  (1) graph theory based assembly representation method incorporating product and supply-chain information, (2) subassembly generation method by hierarchical multi-layer assembly decomposition, and (3) mathematical models for linking subassembly modules with suppliers for supply chain efficiency using multi-objective computation methods. Case studies will be conducted jointly by participating universities and industry partners in order to validate the above methods. Deliverables of this research include mathematical models, heuristics algorithms, software and materials for education and technology transfer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The success of this research project will transform assembly decomposition and supply chain design from disjointed processes into an integrated decision-making process, providing a more holistic view of the manufacturing enterprise and its all value stream partners. The graph-theoretic assembly representation and decomposition methods will provide innovative ways to model and plan assembly products more effectively, and will increase the level of concurrent engineering. These enhanced modeling capabilities and decision making tools will help minimize unnecessary lengthy iterations between the design department and suppliers, and improve U.S. manufacturing competitiveness by helping bring products to the market rapidly at reduced cost. The developed methodologies and models can lead to software systems and information technology infrastructure useful to industry. The education program will promote learning, teaching and transfer of new technologies to industry.</AbstractNarration>
