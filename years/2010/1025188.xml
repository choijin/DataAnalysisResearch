<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to understand the fundamental dynamics of the turbulent motions commonly observed in atmospheric and oceanic flow, or more precisely in geophysical flows over a broad range of periodicities induced by stratification and rotation. The scales of motion found in fluid flow, identified by the amount of energy in fluid motions in each spatial scale, are strongly determined by the kinematic quantities which are conserved following the motion.  This project uses computationally intensive integrations of Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) models to elucidate the fundamental dynamics which determine the power spectrum of geophysical flows and the transfer of energy between scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A first-principles theory of the spectral distribution of energy in turbulent fluids has been a grand challenge in fluid dynamics since the inception of the topic.  Progress towards such a theory could be transformative for the development of atmospheric and oceanic models, particularly for the development of closure schemes and turbulence parameterizations used in these models.  In addition, the work will have a strong educational component, through the education of a graduate student and the mentoring of two postdoctoral researchers.  In addition, a workshop is planned for the summer of 2012 on geophysical turbulence.  Outreach will be conducted through the Cooperative program for Operational Meteorology, Education, and Training (COMET, at the National Center for Atmospheric Research), through the development of "learning objects" on turbulent flows, to be posted on the COMET website in English, French, and Spanish.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Geophysical flows are highly complex, involving a broad range of spatial and temporal scales.  More specifically, there are strong interactions between waves and coherent structures on the times scales that are important for weather prediction and climate. Using a combination of analysis, modeling and numerical computations, the project has contributed to the understanding of coherent structure formation in fluid flows, accounting for the earth's rotation and the density stratification of the oceans or atmosphere.  Project broader impact includes two-way transfer of knowledge between applied mathematicians and geoscientists, as well as training of junior researchers across these two disciplines.  In recent years, studies have used the evolution of a localized dipole as an idealized model of eddies and jet streaks in the atmosphere, reminiscent of high winds (jet streaks) located in between a region of high pressue and an adjacent region of low pressure (a dipole).  A challenge is to predict both the trajectory and the changing structure of the dipole as time evolves.   Using a hierarchy of models, our research was able to distinguish between different classes of wave-vortical interactions primarily reponsible for changes in trajectory vs. changes in structure.   Atmospheric flows are further complicated by the presence of water in the form of water vapor and liquid water (e.g., clouds and rain).  Moist convection in the atmosphere is characterized by phase changes of water, and consequently by large amounts of latent heat release during storms and extreme weather events.  Despite the societal importance, it remains a challenge to understand and accurately simulate multi-scale convective organization, for example, squall lines, hurricanes and monsoons.   One of our project achievements was to derive and test a minimal model of precipitating, turbulent convection with simplified thermodynamics to represent bulk cloud physics and convective organization.  We demonstrated that the model is able to capture important features of both scattered convection and squall lines.  Scattered convection is organized into a squall line when the background wind at low altitudes is sufficiently strong.   The distinguishing feature of our minimal model is the assumption that three microphysics processes - condensation, evaporation and conversion of cloud water to rain water - all happen so fast that the details may be ignored. On the other hand, the formulation preserves the fundamental conservation laws of momentum, energy, entropy and total water.  With such a minimal model, one can isolate the physical mechanisms that are independent from the microphysics, as well as perform mathematical analyses.  For example, our linear stability analysis showed that the growth rate of an unstable cloudy region of the atmosphere depends on rainfall speed. This analysis is suggestive for how the intensity of an emerging storm may depend on rainfall speed.          Last Modified: 10/16/2014       Submitted by: Leslie M Smith]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
