<AbstractNarration>OISE-1019261  &lt;br/&gt;This award is for &lt;br/&gt;Summary:  The proposal is for support of a U.S.-UAE workshop on building Science and Engineering &lt;br/&gt;Associations for Women in Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) Countries scheduled for May 2-4, 2010 in Abu Dhabi, UAE. The project is a follow-up to the recently completed program ?Professional Mentoring of Women in Science and Engineering? funded by the  State Department, which brought 19 Arab women from MENA countries to the University of Michigan-Dearborn (UM-Dearborn) for an 8 week fellowship for professional mentoring and to create a sustainable network between the women and their university and industry mentors. The workshop will include participants from the initial program, US engineering and natural science faculty, and other US and MENA academic and industry participants. There will be approximately 100 participants, including 10 female faculty members from the U.S. funded by this proposal. The US organizer is Dr: John Cristiano, of the UM-Dearborn&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  The workshop is to bring women in science and technology together to further and foster international collaborations and to build research and networking skills among the participants from the US and from the MENA region. The participants will identify best practices for forming collaborations including mentoring and industry interactions, and discuss ways to create science and engineering associations, and to stimulate technical collaborations between Institutions in MENA and the US. Topics to be discussed are IT, computer, civil and mechanical engineering as well as natural sciences. Participants will discuss global questions including network security and environmental issues.  Recommendations will be made to adopt the most suitable potential research topics in the context of socio economic and environmental considerations. Establishment of a US-MENA ?Research Collaboration Opportunities? database is planned to foster future collaborations among workshop participants and other STEM women. The PI will prepare a report on the workshop to include recommendations for ?next steps? and a third-party evaluation of the program. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The workshop will increase the participation of women from both US and MENA countries. Increasing the participation of US female faculty will provide an opportunity for them to connect globally with women who share common research interests. It will serve as catalyst in the formation of associations to support potential research collaboration.  The new association will help support research funding opportunities and sharing new research approaches and ideas. Dissemination of the information regarding research challenges, collaborative partners and funding opportunities will be shared on public website.  Teaching women scientists and engineers how to build associations and international collaborations has the potential for very broad impacts within the researchers? home countries.  The award funds will fund six senior and four junior scientists/engineers from the U.S. The workshop will help increase the number of female US faculty members participating in activities with the MENA region.  This project is jointly funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Program of Diversity and Outreach in the Directorate of Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[MENA Women in Science and Engineering Workshop University of Michigan-Dearborn July 31, 2011 Background  The workshop was co-organized and locally hosted by the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology in Abu Dhabi, the UAE from 2-4 May 2010 and focused on "association building" and  "international research collaboration." Sponsors of the workshop were the National Science Foundation, The U.S. State Department, the Abu Dhabi Education Council and the Dow Chemical Company.   The goals of the workshop were to sustain the momentum among  the  Department of State ECA "Professional Mentoring of MENA Women in Science and Technology" participants and expand the collaboration between MENA women scientists and engineers, U.S. based faculty mentors and U.S. industry researchers, resulting in new partnerships.  The objectives were:   To jump-start the establishment of "women in science and engineering organizations To actively promote joint research between US and MENA based researchers To encourage data sharing To increase industry awareness of, and support for academic research initiatives To better coordinate and target resources       Broader Impact  The following descriptive statistics illustrate the breadth of involvement and impact of the workshop:  Total Registered:                                               225  Women:                                                               185  Women with a Ph.D.:                                             46  Countries Represented:                                         17  Number Affiliated with a University:                     156 (including 80 students)  Number of Different Universities Represented:     20   Intellectual Merit  The workshop actively promoted research collaboration and the creation of new "women in science and engineering" associations. The encouragement of technical contributions through the building of sustained networks among the female participants resulted from the workshop. Databases on research opportunities and on funding sources have been created and will serve as resources for both U.S. and MENA female researchers.     Conclusions   A number of groups, clubs and other organizations exist in many of the MENA countries to promote women in the sciences and engineering.  Some local, MENA based chapters of international organizations such as the IEEE, SME and IIE have been created in some countries of MENA, but their membership levels and types of activities vary greatly.  Women are not always encouraged to join.  Women in MENA can join international organizations as individual members, but tend not to benefit fully.  Creating new, independent associations in the MENA region is difficult in many of the countries because the legal system does not allow for it. Most associations have to have either government sponsorship or university sponsorship.  Establishing purely professional associations for women is impossible.  Most professors at MENA based universities have to apply to their universities and/or governments for funding, and funds are very limited. Decisions are typically made on a first come, first served basis.  This is true even in the richer Gulf countries.   MENA researchers do not have access to good sources of information/databases on other research that is being conducted in their respective technical areas elsewhere in the MENA region or globally.  All participants indicated that such a database, with free access, would be highly desired and appreciated.      Research Collaboration Among MENA and US Women Scientists   Dr. Amal Al-Ghaferi, Assistant Professor of Materials Science at the Masdar Institute of Science and Technology, is on a one year sabbatical at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to pursue research on hybrid organic-inorganic solar cells.  Dr .Al-Ghaferi also continues to collaborate with Dr.  Churgiyan Kurdak at the University of Michigan Ann Arbor, Physics Department, in the area of nano-technology.
