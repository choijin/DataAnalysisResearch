<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Students Travel Support to Attend ICOPS 2010  PI: M. Laroussi, Co-PI: S. Dhali  Old Dominion University  Norfolk, VA     The IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS)     The IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science (ICOPS) is sponsored by the IEEE Nuclear and Plasma Sciences Society.  ICOPS brings together researchers and scientists from the plasma physics community in order to foster enhanced studies on Plasma Science and Engineering.     The 37th ICOPS was held at the Marriott Waterside, Norfolk, VA, from June 20 to 24, 2010. The technical program included plenary, oral, and poster sessions. A commercial exhibition and a short course on plasma modeling and simulation were also offered. 562 abstracts from 37 countries were accepted.

The conference organizers requested $10,000 from NSF to help defray the costs of students travel grants to the conference.        Intellectual Merit     The students awardees attending the conference have the opportunity to present and discuss their work with senior scientists and fellow students. In addition, the studentsÆ exposure to fellow researchersÆ work enriches their experience and offer them learning opportunities.     Broader Impact     The students awardees attending the conference get not only the opportunity to learn technically but they also get to meet fellow researchers from all over the world including other students. This  contributes to their growth both technically and socially.      Students Travel Awards     Students were especially encouraged to attend the conference. 28 students were selected from a pool of 41 applicants to receive travel grants. 25 of these accepted the award. The travel grant covered the registration fee and 4 hotel nights. To optimize the cost students were required to pair up in double occupancy hotel rooms.     Application Process     The application process was entirely web-based. From the conference web site the applicants click on a link that takes them to the application page.
