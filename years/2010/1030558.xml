<AbstractNarration>In this project, researchers at the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee will continue their research into the fluxes, pathways and residence times of particles and their associated nutrients and energy in nearshore waters of Lake Michigan.   Their overall objective is to further explore the use of dual fast process chronometers (90Y/90Sr) and 234Th/238U disequilibria) as tracers of rapid particle dynamics. In Lake Michigan, dreissenid mussels now dominate these nearshore dynamics and the project objectives, therefore, focus on this influence.  There are three specific objectives: (1) Examine what effect the in situ benthic mussel population density has on in situ particle (nutrient) removal from the water column. (2) Examine what effect an in situ benthic mussel population has on in situ particle (nutrient) removal under seasonally changing thermal conditions.  (3) Examine the residence time of mussel-filtered particles (in the form of feces and pseudo-feces) and the inventory of 90Y and 234Th on the nearshore non-depositional lake bed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Coastal zones are under increasing nutrient and toxic stress, and developing and improving techniques for tracking suspended materials on short time-scales will have broad applicability in both Great Lakes and marine biogeochemistry. Understanding the transport of contaminants is also relevant to the heightened concerns over water security, particularly in the Great Lakes from which nearly 40 million people draw drinking water. The utility of radionuclides as tracers for following and quantifying environmental processes is an expanding field, and novel radionuclide techniques have wide potential application in limnology, oceanography, ground water and surface water hydrology, and terrestrial-aquatic system coupling. These tools are an essential component of the environmental research toolbox.  Relatively few laboratories in the Great Lakes region are capable of making radiometric measurements; improving this capability has regional importance.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit     Boundary scavenging is broadly defined by enhanced removal of particle-reactive elements in the coastal ocean and the nearshore of both large and small lakes. Mechanisms of boundary scavenging in margin waters can be divided into water column factors of enhanced particle settling and benthic factors of direct sorption on bottom or near-bottom sediment. Determining which mechanism controls scavenging is critical to interpreting proxies of particle flux and estimating the vertical transfer of particle-bound material in shallow aquatic systems.  Naturally occurring particle-reactive radionuclides (like 90Y and 234Th) are powerful tools that can be used to measure particle dynamics and the transfer of material between the water column and bottom of an aquatic system. Accurately measuring the transport of material in shallow and coastal areas is critical to our understanding of how bottom-living organisms are supplied with energy and contaminants, how oxygen depletion develops, and how chemical signatures in bottom sediment can be used to interpret water column processes of the past.  In this study of nearshore Lake Michigan, measurements of disequilibrium between the (daughter/parent) radionuclides of 234Th/238U and 90Y/90Sr could not be explained using water column particles as the dominant mechanism of scavenging. Instead, it appears that nuclide fluxes are strongly controlled by cross-shore transport and vertical convection, with bottom scavenging serving as the dominant mechanism of nuclide removal from the water column (Figure 1).  The mechanism of nuclide removal (i.e., particle settling versus bottom scavenging) has a large impact on mass flux estimates. Bottom scavenging and vertical convection that decreases nuclide activity in the measured water column will result in an overestimation of mass flux to the bottom if nuclide scavenging is mistakenly assigned to settling particles.     Broader Impacts     Our published method for measuring 90Y and its parent 90Sr was used by other researchers to quantify the amount of 90Sr radioactivity that was released to the Pacific Ocean from the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear accident in Japan.      We published findings that 90Y/90Sr can be used to measure drinking water age (retention time) in a community water distribution system. The publication was co-authored by an NSF REU (undergraduate) student and the effort involved university, national laboratory, public utility, and private industry personnel. The findings have garnered considerable attention from private industry as a means of calibrating hydraulic models of community water distribution systems to improve drinking water quality.
