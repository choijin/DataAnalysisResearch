<AbstractNarration>This award supports the renewal of the REU site in Physics and Astronomy at Vanderbilt University.   The Vanderbilt University Summer REU program offers undergraduate physics and astronomy students the opportunity to work closely with faculty on forefront research projects in a variety of subfields of physics. Students will be supported for ten weeks in the summer months to perform research in areas including astronomy, biological physics, condensed matter physics including nanoscience, laser physics, nuclear physics, and particle physics.   Social group activities will further help to foster a group identity for the students and enhance their educational experience. Vanderbilt has extensive research facilities, including several centers, which are be available to REU students. As a capstone experience, there will be a final joint banquet with the Fisk University REU program, preceded by a poster session where each student will summarize their work.</AbstractNarration>
