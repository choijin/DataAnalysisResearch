<AbstractNarration>NebraskaNOYCE is a collaboration involving the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL), Omaha Public Schools, Lincoln Public Schools, Grand Island Public Schools, Nebraska's Educational Service Units Coordinating Council, the University of Nebraska Foundation, and the Nebraska P-16 Initiative seeking to increase the number of high quality mathematics teachers in Nebraska's high need schools.  Program objectives are to: 1) create a high quality one year (14-month) program leading to a Master of Arts for Mathematics Teachers (MAMT) degree and certification to teach mathematics; 2) recruit and significantly support 16 STEM professionals who enroll as NSF Teaching Fellows (TFs) in the MAMT degree program and continue to support them with mentoring and salary supplements while they fulfill a four-year teaching commitment to teach in a NebraskaNOYCE partner school district high need school; 3) recruit 24 NSF Master Teaching Fellows (MTFs) who commit to teach for five years in a high need school and support them with professional development, graduate level coursework and salary supplements as they become Master Teachers, able to significantly contribute to mathematics teaching and learning in their school and district; 4) provide mentoring and continuing professional development for TFs and MTFs while they fulfill their teaching requirement, creating a model for how mathematics and education faculty work in partnership with district mathematics leaders in pursuit of the common mission to improve mathematics teaching and learning in high need schools; and 5) bring NebraskaNOYCE to sustainability through the pursuit of university, private, and corporate funds that support mathematics teacher education and the university-local school district partnership. The innovative one-year masters/certification program offers an attractive option for STEM professionals who want to consider becoming a mathematics teacher.  The recruitment of 16 Teaching Fellows preparing to teach mathematics, represents a 35% increase in the number of new mathematics teachers produced at UNL. The program places each TF in the classroom of a MTF for field experience. This tightly knit collaboration offers the TFs intensive, sustained field experience in diverse classrooms designed to connect theory and methods to classroom practice under the direct guidance of a MTF. The partner districts serve 31% of Nebraska's public school students, but 43.4% of Nebraska students from families below the poverty line, 78% of the state's African-American students, and 46% of the Hispanic students in the state. The project builds on a robust statewide partnership and two NSF MSPs - the Math in the Middle Institute Partnership (M2) and NebraskaMATH.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The overall goal of&nbsp;<strong><em>NebraskaNOYCE</em></strong>&nbsp;is to increase the number of high-quality mathematics teachers in Nebraska&rsquo;s high-need schools. Work designed to achieve this goal was organized around five objectives. Objectives 1-3 address the Intellectual Merit of NebraskaNOYCE, while Objectives 4-5 address Broader Impacts.</p> <p><strong><em>Objective 1:</em></strong>&nbsp;Create a high-quality one-year (14-month) program leading to a Master of Arts for Mathematics Teachers (MAmt) degree and certification to teach mathematics. This objective was accomplished during Year 1. The MAmt was created as a 41-hour graduate program, including a yearlong internship. We recruited 13 Teaching Fellows (TFs) across two cohorts. We created a publication to report on the creation of the MAmt program and the success of the TFs. The publication was widely distributed to the UNL community and to teachers and administrators in partner districts. Anecdotal evidence of the quality of the MAmt program is provided by principal interviews conducted by our evaluator, RMC Research. Principals of current Teaching Fellows report TFs are stronger than typical first-year teachers and credit the yearlong internship, in particular, as a contributing factor to this clear difference. The MAmt program was based on a similar model UNL had created for certifying elementary education students (MAet). The success of the MAet and MAmt programs, and the equivalent program in science (MAst, supported by a different Noyce grant), have helped to propagate this model of post-baccalaureate master&rsquo;s programs to other content areas, including English and foreign languages.</p> <p><strong><em>Objective 2:</em></strong>&nbsp;Recruit and significantly support STEM professionals who enroll as TFs in the MAmt and continue to support them with mentoring and salary supplements while they fulfill a four-year teaching commitment to teach in a&nbsp;<strong><em>NebraskaNOYCE</em></strong>&nbsp;partner school district high-need school. We met this objective through graduating 13 TFs across two cohorts, and having 12 of them complete their four-year teaching commitment in high-need Nebraska partner districts. Most of them were placed in classrooms of Master Teaching Fellows (MTFs) for their yearlong internships, and they continued to be mentored by both MTFs and UNL faculty throughout their first few years of teaching.</p> <p><strong><em>Objective 3:</em></strong>&nbsp;Recruit 24 MTFs who commit to teach for five years in a high-need school and support them with professional development and salary supplements as they become &ldquo;master teachers&rdquo; who are able to significantly contribute to mathematics teaching and learning in their school and district. We exceeded this objective, ultimately supporting 30 MTFs, who all met their teaching commitment in high-need Nebraska schools.</p> <p><strong><em>Objective 4:</em></strong>&nbsp;Provide mentoring and continuing professional development for TFs and MTFs while they fulfill their teaching requirement, creating a model for how mathematics and education faculty work in partnership with district mathematics leaders in pursuit of the common mission to improve mathematics teaching and learning in high-need schools. Twelve of our MTFs are still pursuing a doctorate from UNL, three earned doctorates, and one earned a second master&rsquo;s degree; Noyce PIs serve on their doctoral committees. All 30 MTFs and 6 TFs have been employed as either a lead instructor or supporting instructor for a UNL graduate course for teachers, thus offering a substantial professional growth opportunity as they teach peers. MTFs and TFs have put on in-service activities, including workshops, books studies, mentored novice teachers, and created an online Twitter community. The travel funds we provided to MTFs helped them to pursue professional development opportunities outside of Nebraska, including attending regional and national conferences.</p> <p><strong><em>Objective 5:</em></strong>&nbsp;Bring&nbsp;<strong><em>NebraskaNOYCE</em></strong>&nbsp;to sustainability through the pursuit of university, private, and corporate funds that support mathematics teacher education and our university/local school district partnership.&nbsp;The MAmt program has been institutionalized, with one cohort of pre-service teachers who have started each year since Noyce funding. Each partner district agreed to release MTFs from eight days of teaching per year so the MTFs could engage in leadership activities. During Years 6-7, districts were not obligated to release MTFs. However, many still did, which allowed MTFs to attend statewide and national conferences (including NCTM annual conference and Innov8), as well as to provide opportunities for students in high-need schools to participate in events like math competitions and robotics competitions. The Nebraska Math and Science Summer Institutes continue to employ MTFs and TFs as lead and assistant instructors for graduate courses for teachers.</p> <p>In August 2016, UNL was awarded a Math Science Partnership grant through the state of Nebraska&rsquo;s Department of Education funds: Nebraska Partnership Teaching to Enhance Achievement in Mathematics and Science (TEAMS). TEAMS works with 50 teacher leaders to plan and deliver integrated mathematics and science professional development to K-12 teachers statewide. The MTFs and TFs (and science Noyce Scholars from UNL&rsquo;s science Noyce grant) form the backbone of our teacher leader cadre. A key part of the grant&rsquo;s plan was to mentor teacher leaders; MTFs and TFs are providing much of this mentoring.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/20/2017<br>      Modified by: Wendy&nbsp;M&nbsp;Smith</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1035268/1035268_10019966_1505508535436_NoyceMTFGroup2014--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1035268/1035268_10019966_1505508535436_NoyceMTFGroup2014--rgov-800width.jpg" title="NebraskaNOYCE MTFs"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1035268/1035268_10019966_1505508535436_NoyceMTFGroup2014--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="NebraskaNOYCE MTFs"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Master Teaching Fellows from Nebraska in attendance at the 2014 Midwest Regional Noyce conference in Omaha, Nebraska</div> <div class="imageCredit">Lindsay Augustyn</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Wendy&nbsp;M&nbsp;Smith</div> <div class="imageTitle">NebraskaNOYCE MTFs</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1035268/1035268_10019966_1505508338959_FischbeinTFSVIMG_2869--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1035268/1035268_10019966_1505508338959_FischbeinTFSVIMG_2869--rgov-800width.jpg" title="TF Fischbein"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1035268/1035268_10019966_1505508338959_FischbeinTFSVIMG_2869--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="TF Fischbein"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Teaching Fellow Sarah Fischbein of Cohort 1 teaches a lesson to her math students at Goodrich Middle School in Lincoln.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Stephanie Vendetti</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Wendy&nbsp;M&nbsp;Smith</div> <div class="imageTitle">TF Fischbein</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1035268/1035268_10019966_1505508396599_GoodellandWestIMG_1968--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1035268/1035268_10019966_1505508396599_GoodellandWestIMG_1968--rgov-800width.jpg" title="MTF and TF collaboration"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1035268/1035268_10019966_1505508396599_GoodellandWestIMG_1968--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="MTF and TF collaboration"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">TF Jamisen Goodell of Cohort 2 and his cooperating teacher, MTF Sherry West, co-teach a math lesson at Lincoln Southeast High School.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Lindsay Augustyn</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Wendy&nbsp;M&nbsp;Smith</div> <div class="imageTitle">MTF and TF collaboration</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1035268/1035268_10019966_1505508213110_DavisAabergVisit--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1035268/1035268_10019966_1505508213110_DavisAabergVisit--rgov-800width.jpg" title="MTFs Davis &amp;

A key part of the grant?s plan was to mentor teacher leaders; MTFs and TFs are providing much of this mentoring.          Last Modified: 09/20/2017       Submitted by: Wendy M Smith]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
