<AbstractNarration>This REU program is centered on collaboration primarily between the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) and the City University of New York (CUNY). The funding requested will provide opportunities for undergraduates to conduct research in astronomy, astrophysics, and earth science at the AMNH. Additional research opportunities will be available at several of the CUNY campuses. Eight students per cohort will be supported through the grant, each program runs for ten weeks during the months of summer. Students from minority serving institutions and from schools with limited research activities are encouraged to participate. As part of the collaboration, special effort is made to recruit students from the CUNY system. In addition to their primary research activities the students will also participate in AMNH programs, take field trips, attend colloquia, and report of their summer projects at either a professional meeting or a scientific symposium that is open to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The very nature of an REU site results in a broader impact, in terms of educational activities. A stated goal of this program is to produce a diverse set of students who are well trained and well educated in the fundamentals of the scientific enterprise. By working to recruit and include participants from underrepresented groups in the CUNY system, the broader impacts of this REU program will likely be particularly effective in reaching into populations that have little exposure to research science and/or little actual research experience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Friends and colleagues, Dr. Jim Webster and Dr. Charles Liu directed a research center for undergraduate scientists in the fields of earth and planetary sciences and astrophysics at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in New York City.     Jim, Charles, and their colleagues at AMNH and at the numerous campuses of the City University of New York (CUNY) annually assessed several hundred applications for 8 NSF-funded student researcher positions, and then hosted the students at the AMNH for ten weeks during the summer.  The student researchers became true junior colleagues, conducting a wide variety of studies including laboratory analyses of rocks, minerals, gems, and meteorite samples; experimental research on volcanic processes that is based on melting rock samples at high temperatures and pressures in a laboratory; supercomputer simulations of complex physical systems like infant solar systems, plasmas, and the large-scale structure of the universe; and reduction and analysis of numerous astronomical data sets ranging from brown dwarfs and low-temperature stars near the Sun to distant galaxies and supermassive black hole systems billions of light-years away.     The student researchers made meaningful progress in all their research projects, and with support from this grant, a majority of them were able to present their work at major professional conferences each year. Examples include meetings of the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, the American Astronomical Society, the American Geophysical Union, and the Geological Society of America.  Their research work was also incorporated into full-length professional publications in the leading scientific journals of their field, written by the students themselves as well as their research mentors.     This undergraduate research site at AMNH proved to have a reach that extended well beyond these 8 NSF-funded student researchers.  Together with their CUNY and AMNH colleagues, Charles and Jim were also able to welcome other undergraduate researchers not supported by this grant into this student research community of earth and planetary sciences and astrophysics.  All together, more than 50 other students from a wide variety of academic, economic, and ethnic backgrounds were able to participate in field trips, museum exhibition and laboratory tours, seminars, professional development activities, and other social activities throughout the summer.  At the end of the 10-week summer period, all the students presented their work at a research symposium held at AMNH, open to the entire museum community and the general public.  Together, these student researchers have contributed to humanity's understanding of Earth and the universe, and have also taken important steps toward joining America's scientific community.  With their work and their interactions with people of every background and profession, they are sharing scientific knowledge with all of us, and achieving the crucial goal of increasing the scientific and technological capabilities of our nation.
