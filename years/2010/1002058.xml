<AbstractNarration>ECCS - 1002058&lt;br/&gt;Wataru Nakagawa&lt;br/&gt;Montana State University&lt;br/&gt;Hybrid Micro/Nano-Optical Devices for High-Fidelity Imaging&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to develop next-generation optical micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) through the use of nanostructured surfaces, leveraging their underlying compatibility to realize multifunctional hybrid micro/nano-optical devices. The result will be MEMS-based systems capable of optical performance commensurate with bulk optics, leading to new fully miniaturized high-fidelity optical imaging systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: Optical nanostructures have emerged as a viable alternative to implement high-reflectivity and anti-reflection coatings as well as polarization control elements. A desirable characteristic of these devices is that the required optical properties can be engineered through the nanoscale structure, freeing the choice of materials (e.g. for manufacturability or compatibility). In this project, nanostructured devices using MEMS-compatible materials and manufacturing processes will be developed and integrated with a MEMS device. These multifunctional hybrid devices will be optimized for specific target applications in compact high-resolution imaging systems, and validated in applications-oriented optical microsystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The synthesis of two rapidly advancing areas of optical technology - MEMS and nanostructures - will enable the development of high-performance, miniaturized, multifunctional optical devices. Such devices have potential applications ranging from medical imaging and environmental monitoring to consumer electronics such as cameras and display systems. This work will also offer a wealth of opportunities for the education and training of participating students in engineering research and systems development, and will include efforts to encourage undergraduate and pre-collegiate students to pursue education and careers in science and technology fields.</AbstractNarration>
