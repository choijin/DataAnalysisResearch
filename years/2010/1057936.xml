<AbstractNarration>As a consequence of the 2009 White House 60-Day Review, it became clear that the academic community working on cyber-security is in dire need of real data. The PREDICT portal is an effort to catalog and house the increasingly available research data, and per NSF's request, the needs of the academia for data have been documented.  On the other hand, agencies, companies and organizations that do have data are seeking research innovations in the ?arms race? against cyber-attacks.  The  ?Cyber-security Data for Experimentation? will bring together people from companies/organizations, academia, and government agencies to discuss (1) models of engagement that will allow the research community to conduct experiments with real-world data sets, (2) how to share research results, and (3) how funding agencies can facilitate the process. A guiding principle of the workshop is that the resulting models should be feasible with the built-in incentives to all parties involved, and the guarantees against violations of privacy or other regulations. The workshop will be organized around panel discussions of three topics: (1) Data availability and use conditions, (2) Research that can greatly benefit from available data to make much needed progresses in cyber-defense, and (3) Engagement models and related IP issues. This will be a one-day workshop, in the DC metro area, held on August 27th, 2010.  The workshop will be broadcast to the community at large and will be open to questions and suggestions from the listeners.</AbstractNarration>

Existing databases need labelling &ndash; for example, if youÃ†re looking at a traffic flow and you want to identify what protocols were in use, you need somebody to annotate it with the ground truth (what protocols actually were in use) or youÃ†ll never know if your algorithms are producing useful answers.
