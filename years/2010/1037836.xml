<AbstractNarration>1037836&lt;br/&gt;Dauenhauer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The European organization Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) is convening a Strategic Initiative Workshop entitled, Sustainable Production of Transportation Fuels and Chemicals: Challenges and Opportunities. This event will host world experts in catalysis to address four key strategic areas: 1) heavy feed stocks: coal and tar sands, 2) light alkanes and natural gas, 3) biomass and renewables, and 4) assessment of new technology. The purpose of the event is to identify the key challenges in the development of new&lt;br/&gt;technologies focused on alternative feedstocks and to highlight the opportunities that can lead to breakthroughs necessary for the transformation to new materials and fuels. Paul Dauenhauer of the University of Massachusetts requests $25,000 to support the travel and lodging for 10 United States researchers to attend the conference. The team of researchers selected for participation will highlight existing NSF-funded American research centers that are currently focused on utilization of biomass and alternative carbon-based materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The design of new technologies focused on utilization of alternative feedstocks provides the opportunity to improve energy independence, reduce the impact on the environment and improve the economic prosperity of the United States. Participation of a team of U.S. researchers from a wide selection of NSF-funded research centers in this international conference highlighting technology for utilization of alternative feedstocks should enhance domestic research by providing an excellent opportunity to share and learn about the newest research developments in alternative feedstock utilization technology. Additionally, participation will increase interactions and offer new collaborations with other academic, industrial,and governmental researchers from around the world.  The interaction gained by U.S. participation in this international conference will potentially impact the overall research strength of NSF funded alternative feedstock programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This funded proposal led to participation of ten U.S. researchers in the Strategic Initiative Workshop to represent ongoing alternative feedstock research at existing research centers.  These members utilized travel funds to attend the conference and highlight the goals of U.S. alternative feedstock research, describe the most recent research contributions of U.S. research centers, and interact and generate collaboration with international research partners.  The Strategic Initiative Workshop hosted by the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) entitled, "Sustainable Production of Transportation Fuels and Chemicals: Challenges and Opportunities," brought together many of the worldÆs experts in the process technology necessary to advance utilization of alternative feed stocks.  The thematic approach to this workshop focused on four key areas: 1) heavy feed stocks: coal and tar sands, 2) light alkanes, 3) biomass and renewables, and 4) assessment of technologies.  Each highlighted area will was led by invited world experts in the field.  Contribution and participation by United States researchers towards new technology within each of these important scientific areas increased AmericaÆs capability towards conversion to alternative materials and feedstock independence.  United States participants specifically represented the following research centers:  National Science Foundation &ndash; Energy Frontiers in Research and      Innovation.  Maximizing      Conversion of Biomass Carbon to Liquid Fuel led by Rakesh Agrawal. Department of Energy &ndash; Energy      Frontiers Research      Center:       Rational Design of Innovative Catalytic Technologies for Biomass      led by Professor D.G. Vlachos of the University of Delaware. National Science Foundation &ndash; Energy Frontiers in Research and      Innovation.  Conversion      of Biomass to Fuels using Molecular Sieve Catalysts and Millisecond      Contact Time Reactors      led by Professor M.Tsapatsis. Department of Energy &ndash; Energy       Frontiers Research       Center.       Center for Catalytic Hydrocarbon      Functionalization led by B. Gunnoe. National Science Foundation &ndash; Energy Frontiers in Research and      Innovation.  Lignin Deconstruction for the Production      of Liquid Fuels led by Rodnet Andrews. Department of Energy &ndash; Energy       Frontiers Research       Center.       Center for Direct Catalytic Conversion of Biomass to Biofuels led      by Maureen McCann. National Science Foundation &ndash; Energy Frontiers in Research and      Innovation.  Green      Aromatics by Catalytic Fast Pyrolysis of Lignocellulosic Biomass led by      G.W. Huber. National Science Foundation &ndash; Energy Frontiers in Research and      Innovation.  The Science and Engineering of      Microalgae Hydrothermal Processing led by P. Saage. Department of Energy &ndash; Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy.       National Advanced Biofuels Consortium led by T. Foust.   Participation of a team of U.S. researchers from a wide selection of NSF-funded research centers in a recent international conference focused on technology for utilization of alternative feed stocks significantly enhances domestic research by:  Providing      an excellent opportunity to share and learn about the newest research      developments in alternative feedstock utilization technology. Interact      with other academic, industrial, and governmental researchers from around      the world. Expand the      network of international researchers focused on alternative feedstock      research. Generate      new collaborations and new knowledge that will improve sustainable      technology development.   The interaction gained by U.S. participation in this international conference significantly improves the overall research goals of NSF funded research centers and U.S. alternative feedstock research.
