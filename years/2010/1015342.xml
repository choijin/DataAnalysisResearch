<AbstractNarration>This project is part supported by the Ecology of Infectious Diseases program.  It will investigate the transmission of the human pathogen S. marcescens, which causes white pox disease (WPD), to the marine invertebrate Elkhorn coral.  This coral was once the most common coral in the Caribbean and is now designated as a Threatened Species under the US Endangered Species Act. The goal of the study is to develop models to describe the population dynamics of Elkhorn coral, to predict transmission and future impacts of WPD (or acroporid serratiosis) and to help devise control strategies by understanding the factors that drive the emergence and maintenance of this disease. The modeling effort to capture the dynamics of a marine disease system is another strength of the research. Factors such as water quality, climate variability and patterns of human population density will be considered. Sampling will be performed biannually in summer and winter (or quarterly if WPD outbreaks occur) in Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary and Dry Tortugas National Park.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The science team will build upon previous work and broaden the understanding of a reverse zoonosis involving the transmission of a human pathogen to a threatened species of Caribbean coral. This is the first time a human disease has been shown to cause population declines of a marine invertebrate. The results will help understanding the pathogen and dynamics of this disease and the transmission and evolution of marine infectious diseases.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      Coral reefs are one of the most diverse environments on Earth.  More than a half billion people are entirely dependent on them for their food and income.  Globally, coral reefs are in severe decline.  In the Florida Keys, half of all corals have died in the last two decades, while at the same time coral-reef activities there generate $3 billion/yr. Our project documented the continued decline of the iconic branching elkhorn coral (Acropora palmata) (98% loss over the last two decades), and used modern approaches in molecular biology and mathematical modeling to better understand the recent appearance and devastating consequences of "white pox disease," a major source of this decline.  This project was developed to study a novel marine reverse zoonotic disease. While it is common for disease pathogens to pass from wildlife to humans (for example, Bird Flu, A.I.D.S., Giardia), we observed that a common enteric bacteria (Serratia marcescens, which can cause opportunistic infections in humans) was a cause of mortality in the elkhorn coral.  This causal link was established by satisfying Koch?s Postulates, the ?gold standard? of disease investigations.  Serratia marcescens isolated from untreated human waste water could induce the disease in an otherwise healthy colony of elkhorn coral. This established a highly important link between human activities (and wastewater infrastructure problems) and coral decline and demonstrated that S. marcescens could persist between a freshwater and marine environment to colonize the coral host. This work has revealed several additional fascinating dimensions to this disease that were previously unrecognized and in some cases parallel observations on disease dynamics in other systems, leading to important shifts in our understanding of infectious diseases.  Our team documented a dramatic shift in the virulence of the disease over a 20-year time period.  When white pox disease first appeared in the 1990s, it caused massive partial mortality (die-off of parts of the coral tissue) as well as whole-colony mortality (complete loss of the entire coral colony) (1994 - 2004).

In support of this, we found that unlike surveys of disease lesions conducted prior to 2004, when S. marcescens was likely to be found in association with white pox lesions, recent lesions were only occasionally confirmed to harbor this pathogen, suggesting additional factors were at play in this disease. In parallel with a developing understanding of human diseases, our work has supported the inadequacy of a one-pathogen, one-disease paradigm. Results from analyses of whole bacterial communities suggest that while communities from healthy corals are stable, disruptive events can cause large shifts in the microbial community.  We hypothesize a whole-organism "dysbiosis," a stress-induced reduction of surficial microbial communities to protect corals from disease.  It is likely that massive shifts in the entire community of bacteria, promoted by factors still not well understood, are involved but can cause very rapid changes (e.g., &lt;24 hours). Among the many environmental stressors that can affect coral health, and likely a response in microbial community, are short and longer term changes in temperature. While abnormally elevated water temperatures can cause mortality outright during warm-water "bleaching" events, our findings also show that disease-related mortality can occur during non-bleaching years.  Our data show that both temperature and nearest colony distance also influence the incidence of disease.  Taken together, these data suggest the dual components of temperature as a stressor, and water-borne transmission of potential pathogens, as mortality predictors.
