<AbstractNarration>Calcium/calmodulin-mediated signaling plays critical roles in plant growth and development as well as in response to biotic and abiotic stimuli.  This project follows up on recent work from the PI's laboratory on identifying, characterizing and manipulating calcium/calmodulin-binding proteins in the context of calcium/calmodulin-mediated regulation of plant growth, plant-microbe interactions during bacterial and fungal symbioses and plant immune/defense responses.  AtSR1/CaMTA3 and CCaMK/DMI3 are two examples of calcium/calmodulin-regulated proteins that play central roles in plant-microbe interactions.  AtSR1/CaMTA3 acts as a negative regulator and controls plant immunity/defense mediated by salicylic acid (an aspirin-like compound).  CCaMK/DMI3 plays a central role in controlling bacterial and fungal symbioses in plants.  Despite recent advances in the understanding how calcium/calmodulin is involved in the regulation of AtSR1/CaMTA3 and CCaMK/DMI3, many underlying basic questions are not clear and warrant further research.  This investigation will use multi-disciplinary approaches to dissect the AtSR1/CaMTA3 and the CCaMK/DMI3-mediated signaling.  Specifically, this investigation will identify interaction partners and study their functional significance during plant-microbe interactions.  This research could have major impacts on future agricultural and environmental issues.  Studies on plant defense could lead to the production of disease-resistant crop plants while studies on plant-microbe symbioses could lead to the production of crop plants with increased nitrogen and phosphorus acquisition, thereby reducing the dependence on fossil fuel-based fertilizers.  The broader impacts include training of undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers who are interested in careers in science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Since 2005, the PIÆs team has published a series of papers documenting the role of calcium/calmodulin-mediated signaling in plant growth (Nature 437:741-745, 2005) and plant-microbe interactions (Nature 441:1149-1152, 2006; Nature 457:1154-1158, 2009 &ndash; highlighted in Cell 136:195, 2009).  The major findings are:  the role of calcium and calmodulin in plant growth and the concept of producing size-engineered plants; the significance of the CCaMK gene and its involvement in symbiotic nitrogen fixation (see Agricultural Implications below); and the role of AtSR1 gene in disease resistance/immunity.  Both CCaMK and AtSR1 genes were cloned and characterized in the PIÆs lab.  Disease resistance/immunity and nitrogen fixation are of global agricultural and ecological significance.  These findings are expected to have far-reaching impacts in understanding and controlling plant defense and nutrient acquisition.   Recent follow-up investigations have revealed that, during the establishment of plant defense/immunity, AtSR1 gene is regulated by ubiquitin-mediated turnover.  A manuscript entitled "Regulating Plant Immunity through Ubiquitin/Proteasome-mediated modulation of Calcium/Calmodulin Signaling" was published in The Plant Journal (2014).  Apart from this publication, NSF-supported work has resulted in a series of other publications (see below) and in 2015, a patent was obtained by the PI (Patent Number: 9,074,005) in 2015.  Agricultural Implications:  Nitrogen and phosphorus are the two most important plant nutrients required for normal growth and development.  A limited number of plants have the capacity to fix atmospheric nitrogen through bacterial symbiosis and a larger number of plants acquire phosphorus through fungal symbiosis; the rest need to obtain their nitrogen and phosphorus in the form of soluble compounds in soil.  For the majority of crop plants, the need for nitrogen and phosphorus is supplied through the use of chemical fertilizers.  However, application of chemical fertilizers is costly and the process by which these fertilizers are produced is energy-intensive and contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.  Furthermore, a substantial portion of the fertilizer applied to agricultural land is not used by the crop and is lost as run-off into streams and rivers resulting in deleterious impacts on the environment.  Hence, there is a great deal of global interest in understanding bacterial/fungal symbioses and transferring this know-how to non-leguminous crop plants that currently cannot establish bacterial/fungal symbioses.  In 2006, the PIÆs team, in collaboration with Dr. Giles Oldroyd of the John Innes Centre, UK, published a paper in Nature on CCaMK.  This joint research has continued and the team has shown how bacterial and fungal symbioses can be "turned on" and "turned off" by manipulating CCaMK.  A manuscript describing these findings was published in The Plant Journal (76:287-296, 2013).
