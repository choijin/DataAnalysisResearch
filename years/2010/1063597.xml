<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to develop a semantic foundation, cross-layer system architecture and adaptation services to improve dependability in instrumented cyberphysical spaces (ICPS) based on the principles of "computation reflection". ICPSs integrate a variety of sensing devices to create a digital representation of the evolving physical world and its processes for use by applications such as critical infrastructure monitoring, surveillance and incident-site emergency response. This requires the underlying systems to be dependable despite disruptions caused by failures in sensing, communications, and computation. The digital state representation guides a range of adaptations at different layers of the ICPS (i.e. networking, sensing, applications, cross-layer) to achieve end-to-end dependability at both the infrastructure and information levels. Examples of techniques explored include mechanisms for reliable information delivery over multi-networks, quality aware data collection, semantic sensing and reconfiguration using overlapping capabilities of heterogeneous sensors. Such adaptations are driven by a formal-methods based runtime analysis of system components, resource availability and application dependability needs. Responsphere, a real-world ICPS infrastructure on the University of California at Irvine campus, will serve as a testbed for development and validation of the overall ?reflective? approach and the cross-layer adaptation techniques to achieve dependability. Students at different levels (graduate, undergraduate, K-12) will be given opportunities to gain experience with using and designing real-world applications in the Responsphere ICPS via courses, independent study projects and demonstration sessions. Students will benefit tremendously from exposure to new software development paradigms for the ICPSs that will be a part of the future living environments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The CYPRESS (CYber Physical RESiliance and Sustainability) project explores techniques for dependability and resilience in instrumented cyber-physical spaces (ICPS) where physical spaces have been instrumented with "intelligence" through heterogeneous sensing, actuation and communication mechanisms.  CYPRESS, a joint three-year project between SRI International (SRI) and University of California Irvine (UCI), exploited an "observe-analyze-adapt" (OAA) architecture in which an ICPS has a model of itself, its objectives, and its effects on the environment. The ICPS achieves dependability objectives through adaptation using runtime application of formal analysis methods. The proposed dependability techniques are cross-layer in nature and range from the combination of multiple networking and messaging technologies to adaptive sensing and information fusion. Broader Impact Outcomes 1.     Over the course of the project various students were trained through summer internships at SRI. Mentorship by Dr. Talcott and Dr. Denker from SRI continued throughout the year. In Year 1 and 2, two UCI graduate students spent three summer months each year at SRI. In Year 3, one graduate student spent 3 summer months at SRI. The students participated in meetings with researchers from SRI and other interns working on other projects. They regularly gave progress reports and presented one research presentation to SRI senior researchers at the end of a summer internship.    2.     CYPRESS researchers organized a focused workshop on Reliable Cyber-Physical Systems (WRCPS 2012) (http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dsm/wrcps2012) that was co-held with the IEEE Symposium on Reliable Distributed Systems in October 2012 in Irvine CA.  3.     The project resulted in two M.S. theses, and two Ph.D. theses. Activities and findings were disseminated in three book chapters, 4 journal articles and over 20 conference publications (see http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dsm/cypress/publications.html for a listing of all publications).     Intellectual Merit Outcomes The following list includes achievements that were collaboratively achieved by SRI and UCI.  Detailed Case Study Development 1.     High-rise campus building instrumented with sensors for a surveillance related application &ndash; the surveillance scenario morphs into a situational awareness application when there is a fire in the building. 2.     Brake-by-wire architecture for vehicle design.  ICPS Modeling and State Management  1.     Techniques to understand and model the multinetwork environment in an ICPS network to study the dependability of the communication network. Specific networks that were modeled in this environment include WLAN (802.11 access point), 802.11 ad hoc, mesh networks, Zigbee, DTN and 3G networks.  2.     Development of network analysis techniques that address fault tolerance and performance requirements. Our approach analyzes and verifies selected network architectures. The design tradeoff analysis applies to choices of physical components (e.g., standard or high-integrity network components), path redundancy and system redundancy in the design, and choices of different types of traffic (e.g., scheduled time triggered, rate constrained or best effort). The analysis techniques were applied to analyze design tradeoffs of the brake-by-wire and the surveillance use cases ICPS Infrastructure Resilience Techniques  1.     Design of MINA to address todayÆs networking landscape that is characterized by diverse access technologies including cellular, WiFi, Ethernet, MANETs, and ZigBee. Proper management of this heterogeneous networking infrastructure is a key challenge to full exploitation of its many opportunities. MINA is a reflective (self-observing and adapting) middleware approach to realization and management of dynamic and heterogeneous multi-networks in pervasive environments. A novel aspect of MINA is that it embodies an OAA loop to a) achieve a reasonably accurate, centralized global view of the mul...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
