<AbstractNarration>This project delivers a white paper that raises and addresses the following question: How might the educational institutions consciously help meet the much greater national cybersecurity need, demand, and supply over the long term? The CyberCorps®: Scholarship for Service (SFS) universities and colleges represent a large fraction of the national capacity to produce a potentially very large and diversified cybersecurity workforce. In part motivated to build programs to achieve the Center of Academic Excellence designation or an SFS award, these universities and colleges collectively have a capacity to train or educate many more people than the roughly 1500 US citizens and SFS graduates who have committed to at least two years to work for the federal government and a few other designated organizations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary outcome of this award is the paper:  S. E. Goodman, "Building the NationÆs Cyber Security Workforce: Contributions from the CAE Colleges and Universities," ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems, Vol. 5, No. 2, Article 6, 9 pages, July 2014.  A copy of the front page of this paper, including the abstract, is attached to this report. The primary purpose of the effort was to help make the case for the CAEs  to expand their efforts, in particular to students outside of CS, in order to more  fully address the very large national workforce needs.  During the life of the award I spoke at about a score of universities and conferences on the subject of building the national cyber security workforce. I am prepared and intend to continue such presentations and discussions beyond the life of this award.  This effort also helped inform me in my role as co-chair of the National Academies Committee on Professionalizing the Nation's Cybersecurity Workforce, and influenced the much expanded coverage of the most recent Georgia Tech SFS proposal to NSF.  The workforce study for the National Academies came out as:  Burley, Diana L., Seymour E. Goodman, co-chairs, Professionalizing the NationÆs Cybersecurity Workforce?
