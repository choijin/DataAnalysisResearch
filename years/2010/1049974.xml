<AbstractNarration>Interactive systems are software systems that incorporate "human-in-the-loop" in achieving complex tasks. This proposal introduces Interaction History Management Systems (IHMSs): systems that capture and manage sequences of user interactions that determine the behavior of an interactive system. The interactions managed by an IHMS may be system- and domain-specific and can include SQL queries, search keywords, annotations of results and applied processing algorithms. By managing the histories of such interactions, it becomes possible to optimize and add additional functionality (e.g., versioning, time travel, use analysis) to the underlying interactive system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores the design and optimization of IHMSs to support the formulation of "systematic reviews":  human-accumulated evidence that provide empirical data for the effectiveness of treatment strategies of a given patient's diagnosed disease or disorder. The project leverages research in several computer science areas such as query and workflow management, query recommendations and query provenance while it explores new interdisciplinary research domains. It also has high impacts in the domain of healthcare: it leads to the next generation of collaborative, streamlined systematic reviewing systems and therefore improves the effectiveness of evidence-based healthcare practice.  Computer science students will be trained in healthcare applications and interdisciplinary research.

Intellectual Merit:   This project brought together machine learning and database optimization techniques in the task of interactive data exploration. While machine learning algorithms can be used to model user interests, they are not concerned with how to steer users along interesting trajectories in a big data space or how to minimize the cost of data acquisition to improve user interactive experience. This project addressed this challenge by providing a suite of techniques that draw insights from machine learning algorithms to guide the exploration of a data space, and leverage the knowledge of exploration patterns to optimize query processing inside the database.      Broader Impacts:      Our proposed system will be crucial for deriving insights from huge and complex datasets found in many big data applications such as scientific, biomedical and healthcare applications. Human effort of exploration across these  datasets will be significantly reduced, as users will be methodically steered through the data in a meaningful way.
