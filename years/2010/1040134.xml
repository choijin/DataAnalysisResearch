<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program Professor Karin Crowhurst and colleagues Eric Kelson, Paul Shin, Thomas Minehan and Yann Schrodi from California State University Northridge will acquire a 600 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as the investigation of protein dynamics and structure in the neurotrophin and RGS families of signaling proteins; to better understand the mechanisms of signal transmission and regulation; synthesis of C-aryl glycosides to use as nucleoside analogues and for sequence-specific DNA binding; preparation of ruthenium complexes that selectively catalyze inner-sphere hydride transfer to ketones; synthesis of trinuclear group 4 metal complexes to catalyze nitrogen activation/hydrogenation; and design and synthesis of enediyne-based aromatase modulators, a promising class of therapeutics for breast cancer treatment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists and biochemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.</AbstractNarration>

Proteins are the workhorses of living things &ndash; they are responsible for transmitting signals in the brain, carrying oxygen and other nutrients throughout the body, catalyzing reactions, metabolizing things we eat, providing immunity and generally regulating all of the activities that take place in the body. Biochemists can use NMR to study protein structure and reactions (similar to chemists and their studies of smaller molecules) but they also use NMR to study protein interactions with other molecules, their internal movements and other properties that allow us to better understand how proteins work.  We had requested funds for a 600 MHz NMR because it gave us the most flexibility in terms of the number of different types of projects we could pursue.  Protein studies require "high field" spectrometers such as a 600 MHz instrument, because they have a lot of atoms and are more difficult to study.  A higher field provides better resolution in this situation.  Some molecules that are studied by the chemists in our department have some complex characteristics that are difficult to study at lower fields (such as 400 MHz) and as such they benefit from this kind of NMR, as well.  Since the NMR was installed two years ago it has been very well-used.  Because protein experiments are long and challenging, Dr. Crowhurst (the biochemist) has recorded the majority of the experiments on the NMR. She has been working on projects that are both directly related to her research and also in collaboration with a biochemist at another university.

Many other institutions require students to give their samples to a technician who then runs the experiments for them.  We prefer to allow students to run the experiments themselves, as it provides them with tools that will be useful in future research positions (or PhD programs) and gives them a definite advantage when they apply for chemistry and biochemistry jobs. It also improves the studentÆs interest and enthusiasm for scientific research, and of...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
