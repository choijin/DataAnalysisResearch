<AbstractNarration>The long-term goal of this project is to develop a unique method to generate libraries of novel compounds that are likely to contain specific molecules that have important biological activities.  These libraries will be composed or peptides with enhanced capabilities for in vivo applications. Peptides are ideally suited for in vivo studies (i.e. biomolecular imaging and gene delivery) due to their high target binding specificity, potency and low toxicity. As a result, peptides provide an effective means to investigate specific aspects of cellular pathways without disrupting critical cellular functions. Despite their inherent specificity and potency, peptides suffer from low stability and reduced membrane permeability -- factors that limit their biological stability and utility for in vivo studies. To overcome these limitations, a recombinant expression system (the "PURE" system) will be used to synthesize peptides composed of nonstandard or 'unnatural' amino acid building blocks. The premise for using unnatural amino acids is based upon the chemical composition of a potent class of natural products known as nonribosomal peptides (NRPs). NRPs contain a variety of unnatural residues that equip these biomolecules with enhanced functional capabilities. However, the synthetic pathways involved in NRP production are complex, and have not proven amenable to screening libraries for novel functionalities. Unlike conventional expression systems, the PURE system affords precise control over each of the reaction components required for protein/peptide synthesis. This allows potential substitution of the standard L-amino acids by a variety of unnatural amino acids to generate NRP-like peptides. Efficient in vitro assays (i.e. adenylation, nuclease protection, etc.) have been identified that can be used to determine quantitative criteria (binding affinity constants) that establish a threshold for translation of a substrate. With these criteria in hand, diverse peptide libraries composed of L- and unnatural amino acids will be synthesized. The research project merges well established and emerging cell expression techniques; the intellectual and scientific merits of this translation system could greatly enhance the development and economic expression of peptide diagnostics and reagents that will impact the field of chemical biology in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will also offer educational training and experience in basic research to the students of The University of Southern Mississippi (USM). As a member of an underrepresented minority group, the principle investigator is keenly aware of the need to increase the level of exposure and participation of minority groups in science. At USM there is a significant pool of students from underrepresented minority groups that the PI can involve in research and mentor. This summer an underrepresented undergraduate student participating in the Research Experience for Undergraduate (REU) program at USM will participate in the research project. The principle investigator also currently mentors students from the Alliance for Graduate Education in Mississippi (AGEM). A primary goal of AGEM is to increase the number of underrepresented minorities entering academe in STEM related fields. To raise the level of scientific literacy of the public through outreach activities, the PI will partner with the eMerging Careers Institute (ECI) to disseminate scientific information through an online publication designed to impact youth and young adults. ECI provides high school and junior college youth of Alameda County with pathways to explore career options, and compete in the job market. ECI is developing a similar program in Mississippi and the PI will work with ECI on the development of its scientific focus. The PI believes that these activities will be an effective means to increase the participation of underrepresented and underserved groups to help benefit science and society as a whole.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The long-term research goal of this proposal is focused on developing new methods to generate peptides with enhanced biological stability.  Peptides have long been sought after as tools to investigate biological systems due to their high binding affinity and potency.  Despite these advantages, peptides are not widely used as biological diagnostics because they are rapidly degraded within or quickly eliminated from the body. In order to improve the biostability of peptides, the PIÆs research lab is focused on using unique substrates known as unnatural amino acids to improve peptide stability.  An unnatural amino acid is roughly defined as an amino acid that possesses chemical complexity beyond the twenty natural (L-) amino acids of the genetic code.  The premise for using unnatural amino acids is based on the chemical composition of a potent class of natural-product like peptides referred to as nonribosomal peptides (NRP).  NRPs typically contain an abundance of unnatural amino acids.  It is widely believed that unnatural residues equip NRPS with enhanced biological activity vs. natural peptides.     The PIÆs laboratory investigated the ribosomal peptide synthesis pathway in order to uncover new ways to generate peptides composed of unnatural amino acids.  The ribosomal synthesis pathway was selected because this system can be used to produce large amounts of individual peptides (i.e. peptide libraries).  The PIÆs investigations focused on the three most stringent stages of ribosomal protein/peptide synthesis:  i) amino acid activation, ii) aminoacylation and iii) transport of acylated tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) to the ribosome.  Each stage represents a barrier of entry to the incorporation of unnatural amino acids into peptides.  Therefore, the elucidation of the intricacies of these critical stages may offer information that can be exploited to permit the incorporation of a vast array of unnatural amino acids into peptides.      A nonexhaustive list of typical unnatural amino acids (UnAAs) screened by the PI at the first and second stage of protein synthesis is included in Table 1.  UnAAs that were identified as positive hits are denoted with a (+) symbol.  The readout for a typical activation screen is displayed in Figure1.  UnAAs that possessed activation signals &gt;1% were considered for further analysis.   The stringency of individual components of the ribosomal pathway was also examined to determine the limits of substrate (amino acid) selectivity.  A great deal of effort was focused on aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs).  aaRSs were selected for analysis because these proteins act as the initial "gatekeepers" of the ribosomal peptide synthesis pathway.  The PIÆs investigations revealed that a number of aaRSs possess expanded substrate specificity.  Substrate specificity was evaluated by incubating aaRSs with dissimilar (or noncognate) L-amino acids.   A list of aaRSs and the corresponding activated non-cognate substrates are displayed in Table 2.  These results suggest that a significant number of aaRSs, most notably PheRS and ValRS, may recognize a larger number of UnAAs.  The final theme of the PIÆs studies focused on the synergistic interaction between synthesis components during the second and third stages of ribosomal synthesis.  At stage two, amino acids are attached to the end of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) by aaRSs to form species referred to as aminoacylated tRNAs (aa-tRNAs).  At stage three, EF-Tu transports the aa-tRNAs to the ribosome where the AAs are connected to the growing peptide chain.  There is emerging evidence that indicates stages two and three occur simultaneously &ndash; this combination of steps is referred to as tRNA channeling.  In the context of peptide synthesis, aaRSs operate in concert with EF-Tu to generate aa-tRNAs.  It is suspected that certain aaRSs (class I) undergo tRNA channeling and subsequently generate enhanced levels of aa-tRNAs.  This relationship is shown in Figure 3.  The PI believes that ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
