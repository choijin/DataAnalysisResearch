<AbstractNarration>The objective of this MRI acquisition for thin film processing and characterization equipment is to enhance the present capability of the Microelectronics Laboratory at Tuskegee University, and to support undergraduate and graduate teaching and research.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The equipment requested will meet current research needs for processing test structures and devices including, but not limited to, the study of thin film solar cell materials and devices, growth and characterization of ZnO for device applications, Si/Ge MOS device studies for integrated photonic device processing, study of devices on organic semiconductor films, grayscale lithography by polymer photomask for micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) and carbon nanotube film patterning for flexible microelectronics.  The proposed equipment will result in a fundamental understanding of basic physical, chemical and metallurgical mechanisms involved in the various processes employed in the fabrication of multi-junction solar cells.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Acquiring the requested equipment will permit training of underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students in emerging areas in the advanced technology sector. These well-trained graduates will bring much-needed diversity to the nation's technological workforce involved in research and manufacturing.  Outreach activities are planned that will bring local high school students and teachers to participate in some of the laboratory activities thus motivating high school students from an under-represented community to pursue a college degrees in science and engineering.  It is anticipated that the fundamental studies delineated in this proposal will eventually result in design and manufacturing methodologies that will help the nation to become more competitive in the global market.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ MRI: Acquisition of Instruments for Thin Film Processing and Characterization  Principal Investigator: Li Jiang, Tuskegee  University  (Project period: 09/15/2010-08/31/2012)     Five pieces of major research instrumentation for thin film processing and characterization were acquired and installed at the Microelectronics Laboratory at Tuskegee University (a historically black college and university) with support from the NSF MRI grant.      As a result,   (1) The research infrastructure of the Electrical Engineering program at Tuskegee University has been enhanced. The Microelectronics Laboratory will permit training of both undergraduate/graduate students in emerging areas in the advanced technology sector.     (2) We have used the acquired equipments in making progress in five research projects, especially in the fundamental studies on the basic physical, chemical and metallurgical mechanisms involved in the various processes employed in the fabrication of supercapacitors, multi-junction solar cells, integrated optoelectronic devices and nano-composite patterning for Microsystems.     (3) 4 faculty members, 1 postdoctoral fellow, 7 graduate students, 10 undergraduate students and 8 high school students were involved in research projects that have used the acquired research instrumentation. During the two year project period, we were able to disseminate the research results through 5 referred international journal papers, 1 book chapter (in production), 7 conference abstracts, 5 international/regional conference presentations and 2 master these.     (4) Outreach activities were performed by the investigators of this project and by the grad/undergrad students working in the lab. Minority middle school and high school students from our community were involved and the outreach activities were also partially supported through NSF REH program and the Society of Women Engineers (SWE) WOW program.     (5) Human Resource Development: During the two year project period, the Electrical Engineering Department at Tuskegee  University has produced five master graduates with their thesis work completed at the Microelectronics Laboratory and numerous undergraduate graduates with their undergraduate research or senior design projects conducted at the Microelectronics Laboratory. Some of the these students are currently pursuing Ph.D. degrees at research institutes such as Stanford University and the University of Delaware while others are working in industry such as Intel Corporation in Washington State and General Mills in Michigan.
