<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit. This project integrates studies of oceanographic circulation, larval dispersal, invertebrate life histories, population genetics, and phylogeography to explore questions of contemporary and historical connectivity in relatively unexplored deep-sea chemosynthetic ecosystems. Five deep-sea seep systems in the Intra- American Sea (IAS) are targeted: Blake Ridge, Florida Escarpment, Alaminos Canyon, Brine Pool, Barbados (El Pilar, Orenoque A, Orenoque B). This project will evaluate connectivity on spatial scales that match those at which vent systems are being studied (3500 km), with a set of nested seeps (within the Barbados system) within which connectivity can be explored at more local spatial scales (30 to 130 km), and with species that span depth (600 m to 3600 m) and geographic ranges (30 km to 3500 km) and that have diverse life-history characteristics. The primary objective is to advance our general knowledge of connectivity in the deep sea. The focus is on species and processes occurring in the IAS, with attention to oceanographic circulation, life histories, and genetics. Questions that apply in shallow-water systems motivate this study:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. What phylogeographic breaks occur in the system? It is important to distinguish between phylogeographic history and connectivity. A phylogeographic break with no shared alleles between populations implies a long history of isolation or possibly cryptic speciation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Are populations connected by ongoing migration? This is the fundamental question about connectivity and the scale of genetic variation in marine species with planktonic larvae.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. What biophysical processes underlie observed connectivities? Biological processes (e.g., larval distributions in the water column, timing of reproduction, and planktonic larval duration) and physical processes of transport and dispersion interact to determine connectivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The oceanographic model for the IAS will be improved and coupled to a Lagrangian larval transport model. The field program includes time-series sampling of larvae at seeps with records of current velocities, water column sampling to determine larval distribution potential, shipboard studies of larval biology and behavior, and sampling of benthic target species. Phylogenetic and population genetic tools will be used to explore historical and contemporary gene flow. Iterative interactions among the science teams will advance our understanding of connectivity in the deep sea and to develop effective and best methods for hypothesis testing under the constraints of working in a relatively inaccessible environment. Since their discovery, deep-sea chemosynthetic ecosystems have been novel systems within which to test the generality of paradigms developed for shallow-water species. This study will explore scale-dependent biodiversity and recruitment dynamics in deep-sea seep communities, and will identify key factors underlying population persistence and maintenance of biodiversity in these patchy systems.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Building capacity (knowledge and expertise) in studying spatial and temporal scales of connectivity and the oceanographic and life-history processes that underlie genetic subdivision in the deep sea is critical in light of emergent policy regimes in both Exclusive Economic Zones and on the High Seas related to marine spatial planning. A seascape genetic approach will be adopted to advance beyond the state-of-the-art through inclusion of biophysical modeling, observations of larval biology and ecology, and a comprehensive suite of molecular tools. Results will be broadly disseminated to advance scientific understanding through peer-reviewed publications and will enhance the capacity to undertake coupled oceanographic-life history-genetic studies through (i) training of 6 graduate students and 1 post-doc, (ii) through incorporation of approaches and results in presentations at professional meetings and workshops, and (iii) through presentations and discussions seminars and classes for graduate and undergraduate students. Results of this work will be used to inform policymakers engaged in the design of deep-sea networks of marine reserves. In addition, two innovative activities will be undertaken: a field-oriented interdisciplinary deep-sea research course for advanced PhD students and post-docs, and an artist-in-residence at sea that enhance the broad impact of the research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Since their discovery, deep-sea chemosynthetic ecosystems have been important systems within which to test the generality of paradigms developed for shallow-water species. This study allowed us to explore scale-dependent genetic diversity in populations of deep-sea seep species, and to identify key factors underlying population persistence and maintenance of biodiversity in these patchy systems.  We built capacity (knowledge and expertise) in studying spatial and temporal scales of connectivity and the oceanographic and life-history processes that underlie genetic subdivision in the deep sea that is critical in light of emergent policy regimes in both Exclusive Economic Zones and on the High Seas related to marine conservation. We adopted a seascape genetic approach that advanced beyond the state-of-the-art through inclusion of biophysical modeling, observations of larval biology and ecology, and a comprehensive suite of molecular tools. The goal of this study was to contribute to our understanding of how invertebrate taxa that are endemic to chemosynthetic ecosystems may be connected through dispersion in evolutionary time and dispersal in ecological time.  In this multi-institutional, multidisciplinary project, a team of geneticists, benthic ecologists, larval ecologists, and physical oceanographers completed three major field expeditions using submersibles, remotely operated vehicles, and autonomous vehicles to chemosynthetic ecosystems of the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and Western Atlantic Margin.  We are using population genetic tools to explore the genetic diversity and relatedness of tubeworms, mussels, brittlestars, and other taxa in the western Atlantic.  Among our advances was the development of a bioinformatic pipeline to manage and analyze gene sequences from dozens of loci.  This pipeline is now being applied to clams and mussels that we sampled during our field expeditions to document how genetic diversity varies among populations across the geographic range of a species.  This genetic structure will be interpreted within the context of high-resolution, 3-D regional oceanographic transport models developed independently by our collaborators.  We also explored the history of dispersion of two clam taxa from the Pacific into the Atlantic and their subsequent speciation.  As we worked with our colleagues studying larval ecology, we came to appreciate the need for a precision larval sampling tool that could be deployed very near the seabed as well as in the water column. For nearly half a century, opening-closing nets towed by a surface ship have been the standard tools for sampling zooplankton.  These nets capture zooplankton in the water column through oblique tows from about 100 m above the seabed to the surface &ndash; any one tow typically integrates zooplankton across very broad (100-200 m) depth intervals.  Our collaboration with engineers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution led to an entirely new kind of zooplankton sampler designed for use by the autonomous vehicle Sentry.  The zooplankton sampling system, known as "SyPRID" (Sentry Precision Robotic Impeller Driven), can be deployed 1.5 m above the seabed and can also sample with precision any specified depth in the water column, with simultaneous measurement of environmental parameters (e.g., dissolved oxygen, temperature, salinity, etc.). In addition to the undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral interdisciplinary training undertaken during the project, a highlight of the broader impact was the engagement of artists at sea.  Outcomes of this work include an on-line exhibition "Art &amp; Science: Envisioning Ocean Depths" (http://oceanography.ml.duke.edu/discovery/) and "Two Miles Deep", a video by cartoonist Jim Toomey (Sherman?s Lagoon; https://vimeo.com/133530590).  During our 2015 expedition, we discovered a 19th century shipwreck in more than 2000m off the coast of North Carolina; the location of the discovery was shared with NOAAs Maritime Heritage Program and the find became a worldwide news story (e.g., http://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/20/us/shipwreck-discovered-north-carolina-feat/).
