The OU-RET program conducted 6-week summer programs during the summers of 2011, 2012, 2013. Thirty-two math and science teachers with diverse backgrounds, from 20 high schools and one middle school in Oklahoma, participated in the program. The schools included urban, suburban and rural schools with diverse student bodies. There were 11 teachers in the first year, 15 teachers in the second year, and 16 teachers in the third year.

During the RET program, qualitative and quantitative data were gathered in digital form using surveys, journals, discussions, project document uploads, audio recordings of on-site observations, closure interviews, and focus groups to provide a robust portrait of participant activities and perspectives.  Based on analysis of the data, it was found that teachers who negotiated and communicated their perceptions and needs, developed most successfully in the RET program.
