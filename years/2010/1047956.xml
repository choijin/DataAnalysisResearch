<AbstractNarration>As supercomputers become more powerful, they become more complex. In order to take advantage of the increased power, scientific applications that run on these supercomputers will have to become more complex and will have to take advantage of more processing cores. Even those who are expert at optimizing these applications are quickly being overwhelmed. The Workbench for HPC Applications (W-HPC) project is transforming the way these experts develop, debug, optimize, and run their applications. Using the Eclipse platform, W-HPC provides a robust and portable way to manage computational science and engineering code development for a range of research disciplines. W-HPC also includes a targeted education and outreach program including outreach to minority-serving institutions that will train new users, explain the advantages of using Eclipse-based tools, and encourage users participate in the development of new tools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next generation of petascale systems will give unprecedented power to the scientific community as they tackle grand challenge problems. However, in order to take advantage of the huge potential performance improvements, application size and complexity will increase substantially as projects become multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary. The Workbench for HPC Applications project is transforming the way the community develops, debugs, optimizes, and runs its applications. As part of the project, the Eclipse Parallel Tools Platform (Eclipse PTP) is being enhanced. Eclipse PTP provides an open source, robust, portable, and sustainable development environment suitable for use with a broad range of scientific codes. Targeted education and outreach activities are also part of the project. They will train new users, explain the advantages of using Eclipse-based tools, and encourage users participate in the development of new tools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     The Workbench for High Performance Computing (WHPC)  project aims to deliver a capable workbench for developing high performance computing (HPC) applications by improving the usability and productivity of the Eclipse Parallel Tools Platform (PTP).  The Eclipse Parallel Tools Platform supports development of C, C++, and Fortran Applications using MPI, OpenMP, as well as offering support for PGAS languages UPC and the subset of Co-Array Fortran supported in Fortran 2008.  The WHPC project uses an application-centric approach, working directly with users and user codes, using these codes and specific application development and optimization tasks, to stress Eclipse PTP, identify where Eclipse PTP falls short and needs improvement, as well as derive priorities for desired improvements each year.  Additionally, the WHPC project has an ambitious outreach and user engagement component, a dedicated training effort, and an effort to incorporate Eclipse Parallel tools into Computational Science and Engineering (CSE) curricula.    Impacts     What is the impact on the development of the principal discipline(s) of the project?  The project has provided a capability to enhance the software engineering activities associated with scientific code development, especially in the context of high performance computing, by supporting a number of important capabilities with our software product:     facile interfaces to source repository systems (of a wide variety, eg, CVS, SVN, Git, mercurial, ...) language correctness checking automatically at the source level compiler and performance tool feedback at the source level issue and repository integration through the Mylyn bridge, allowing issues to be directly associated with source in the source repository documentation support through the Eclipse help system (which also can be integrated with systems such as doxygen) build and run support on a variety of remote high performance systems (both specific and generic)    Our project is providing these capabilities, and more, through a single, consistent interface that avoids the need to learn often confusing and conflicting command line versions of the tools needed to achieve the same software engineering goals on today's HPC systems.  What is the impact on other disciplines?  Eclipse Parallel Tools has continued to be used by collaborators that play a dual role, both as a contributor to Eclipse PTP, as well as a user of PTP in separate scientific code development activities.  Eclipse PTP has been used to support the Gromacs (www.gromacs.org) open source molecular dynamics package, as well as the Uintah (www.uintah.utah.edu) Computational Framework, as well as in the project work of the Blue Waters and  XSEDE Advanced User Support staff.     What is the impact on the development of human resources?  The project has made significant impact on the development of human resources in a number of ways. First, most directly, for the courses incorporating educational material regarding the development of scientific codes using Eclipse PTP, the students have been provided with advanced ways to develop parallel codes (of multiple paradigms) on remote HPC resources, within an environment that is state of art for software development and is widely used for modern programming languages such as Java. For students either new to programming or new to scientific programming but familiar with, for instance, development of Java codes using Eclipse, this represents a significant reduction of the difficulty of developing codes in an unfamiliar language such as C or Fortran, using new parallel paradigms such as MPI or OpenMP (or OpenACC), making such an effort almost as easy as what they may be accustomed to in their Java development environment. This capability can not only be used to complete course exercises, but also in their careers as they move on beyond their undergraduate and graduate studies.  Additionally, the project has offered numerous training opportunitie...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
