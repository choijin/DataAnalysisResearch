<AbstractNarration>COMPRES is a community-based consortium that supports research in the materials properties of Earth and planetary interiors with particular emphasis on high-pressure science and technology and related fields. It is charged with the oversight and guidance of important high-pressure laboratories at several national facilities, such as synchrotrons and neutron sources. These have become vital tools in Earth science research. It facilitates the operation of beam lines, the development of new technologies for high-pressure research, and advocates for science and educational programs to the various funding agencies.</AbstractNarration>

COMPRES educational activities includes instructional workshops aimed at graduate students and post-doctoral students, online courses, and online content in the area of high-pressure science. These activities make it possible for students to access and fully utilize the most advanced techniques for addressing scientific questions that are on the cutting edge of research. Through a lecture series, COMPRES reaches out to undergraduates in universities across the nation, introducing them to ongoing research in studies of the EarthÆs deep interior and the scientific opportunities available in the discipline of mineral physics.  Through this range of activities, COMPRES has promoted our understanding of the Earth, from the near-surface to the very center of our planet. The results of research performed by COMPRES have advanced our understanding of the following questions:  What is the cause of plate tectonics?  How do solid rocks flow at great depth?  What are the causes of earthquakes and volcanism where tectonic plates converge? How can we use seismology to tell us the chemical composition of EarthÆs mantle and central core, and what is the atomic structure of materials at depth? How do the mantle and core interact at their boundary 3000 km beneath the surface, and how much heat is transported across the core-mantle boundary (ultimately up to the surface)? Is there water in the EarthÆs interior, and if so how many ocean equivalents are there? Why do diamonds exist in rocks from EarthÆs deep interior, and how deep do they come from? Do materials become weaker or stronger as particle size gets smaller? What are the properties of materials like iron and hydrogen at pressure equal to those in the center of the Earth?   Research performed by COMPRES has contributed to answering all of the above questions. New techniques have been developed to perform new types of experiments at high pressures using diamond-anvil devices and large presses with multiple anvils. It is now possible to accurately characterize the crystal structure and physical properties of materials at ultra-high pressure conditions. New techniques allow measurements of heat transport at high pressures and temperatures, and thus the thermal structure of the deep Earth.  Earth scientists have been leaders and innovators in high-pressure research, driven to answer fundamental questions about the Earth such as those listed above. As a result, mineral physics research has had a broad impact on all areas of high-pressure research, including physics, chemistry and materials sciences. The research and training enabled by COMPRES will continues to impact many related areas of science, including natur...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
