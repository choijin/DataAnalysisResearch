<AbstractNarration>The research topic of this IRES program is an area of astrophysics involving theoretical and observational studies of stellar pulsation, particularly Cepheids. Students from an undergraduate institution in New York State (SUNY College at Oswego) will go to the Department of Astronomy at National Central University in Taiwan for a six-week summer program to participate in the ongoing research activities in that department.  The analyses of stellar pulsar observations are tied directly to current models of stellar evolution. Simulations of observed pulsation properties provide a stringent test of the models. Such research is also relevant to understanding extragalactic distance scales. Recognition of possibly systematic effects in the pulsar spectra could contribute to a more accurate estimate of the Hubble constant, a key parameter in astrophysics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program will also provide cultural and language training to the students to broaden their understanding of the Chinese environment in Taiwan as well as global cooperation in science.  This international experience will broaden the students? understanding of the world, especially East Asia, and prepare them to engage with international colleagues in the future course of their careers. The PIs are making an effort to include underrepresented minorities, and the experience should stimulate the participating undergraduates to continue their studies in graduate school. This program should be particularly valuable for the Oswego students, who will come from a small undergraduate school to a research university in a different culture.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF award 1065093 "Astrophysics IRES in Taiwan: Connections Between East and West" funded 6 undergraduates/year, for a total of three years from 2011-2013, to spend 6 weeks in undertaking research projects in Astrophysics at the Graduate Institute for Astronomy, National Central University, Taiwan. In addition, participating students spend 3 weeks on the SUNY Oswego campus prior to departure learning elementary Mandarin and getting familiar with Taiwanese culture. Students also spent this time starting work on their research projects.  In terms of the NSF's first merit review criteria, intellectual merit, students worked with the PI and other faculty members of the Graduate Institute on a wide variety of projects ranging from developing Cepheid Period-Luminosity relations at mid-infrared wavelengths to Galactic Astronomy to the relationship between asteroid diameter and period rotation to the astrophysical applications of principal component analysis of variable star light curves.  Notable results include the development of the first mid-infrared Cepheid Period-Luminosity relation for the Small Magellanic Cloud - published in ApJ. The Cepheid Period-Luminosity relation is a critical component in developing the size-scale of the Universe.   In terms of the broader impact, firstly, students were fully integrated into their research groups at the Graduate Institute, they were able to develop an international network of faculty and post-docs that will be of considerable use in their future careers. Their work impacted the research work of the host institution.  Secondly, the students received training in scientific computing, stellar evolution/pulsation, introductory cosmology and astrophysics.  Secondly, students stayed on the National Central University (NCU) Campus and were taken on a number of field trips at weekends to strengthen their cultural experience - these included visits to the Lulin Observatory and the National Palace Museum. This provided them with a deeper understanding of Taiwanese life and culture and will provide them with a rich background in today's competitive global marketplace.  Thirdly, the success of the first year of the Project prompted National Central University to invite SUNY Oswego to extend the number of students from 6 (funded by NSF for Astrophysics research) to up to 20 - with partial funding provided by NCU and SUNY Oswego ($500 each) to the non-NSF funded 14 additional students. Additionally the non-NSF funded students were able to engage in research projects from a vareity of disciplines in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). Thus in 2012 17 undergraduates went to NCU and in 2013 15 went to NCU and 2 went to National Yang Ming University to work on Biophysics projects.  Thus the broader impact of the IRES project is considerable:  1) A significant agreement between SUNY Oswego and NCU to enable students from all STEM disciplines to come to NCU to undertake research projects.  2) The extension of this to other institutions in the University System of Taiwan - such as National Yang Ming University in Taipei.  3) The prospect of a SUNY wide agreement between SUNY and the University System in Taiwan.
