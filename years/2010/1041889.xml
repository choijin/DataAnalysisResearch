<AbstractNarration>Conference: The 9th International Marine Biotechnology Conference, October 8th - 12th 2010 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support the attendance of US postdoctoral scientists and students at the International Marine Biotechnology Conference to be held in October 2010 in Qingdao, China. This conference will bring together an international community of scientists interested in molecular approaches to understanding, protecting and enhancing global marine resources. Topics included at the conference include the role of marine microbes in biogeochemical cycles; marine bioenergy; extremophiles; the "-omic" disciplines in marine biotechnology; biotic carbon sequestration; biomineralization and nanobiotechnology; marine metagenomics. These are important areas of research from which novel observations and ideas relevant to changes in the earth's climate and to bioenergy are emerging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: Participation in this conference will expose US students and postdoctoral scientists (including women and members of minorities underrepresented in science) to emerging science in the area of marine biotechnology. It will permit them to present and discuss their own results with leading international scientists and provide them opportunities to develop new collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by Cellular Systems, Biomolecular Systems, and Biological Oceanography.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Conference: The 9th International Marine Biotechnology Conference, October 8th - 12th, 2010  Funds were used to make it possible for American scientists to travel to the 7th  International Marine Biotechnology Conference in Qingdao, China on October 8-12, 2010.  The International Marine Biotechnology Conference (IMBC) is a triennial conference designed to generate new research collaborations and improve links between academia, industry and government, to identify opportunities for Marine Biotechnology to contribute to sustaining marine natural resources, to stimulate business development of marine biotechnology industries, and to communicate to society in general the role Marine Biotechnology can play in enhancing the quality of life and the environment. In 2010, the conference was held in Qingdao, China. Past IMBC conferences have been in Japan, the U.S., Norway, Australia, Canada, and Israel.   The objectives of this proposal were to: 1) facilitate attendance by a broad range of U.S. scientists at the IMBC2010; 2) ensure that U.S. postdocs and students are exposed to the latest global advances in Marine Biotechnology; and 3) encourage collaboration between U.S. scientists  and those from other countries in the important and rapidly developing field of Marine Biotechnology.  The IMBC conference itself was a success, with over 600 attendees from more than 40 countries.  Eleven of the 12 NSF-supported American scientists made presentations at the conference on topics of global interest, including marine bioenergy, coral reef biology, the role of ocean bacteria in greenhouse gas dynamics, and sustainable aquaculture.  The US is facing strong competition internationally, and these conferences are a way to both stay competitive and establish valuable collaborations with scientists from all over the world.  In marine science especially, it is important to have international collaborations, because the worlds oceans transcend international political boundaries. We all share them.  An important aspect of the funding is that it helped under-represented minorities from the U.S. to attend the conference. This is crucial for developing American scientists who can be tomorrowÆs leaders in marine science.  Ethnic diversity of scientists in both public and private sectors is still far lower than in the general population.
