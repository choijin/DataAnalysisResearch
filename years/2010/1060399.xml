<AbstractNarration>This project is designed to award 20 annual scholarships to financially-needy undergraduates with demonstrated academic potential. Student success is centered on a strong, supportive learning community; regular seminars on career and graduate school placement, research, and industrial applications; and partnerships with research universities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the disciplines of laboratory-based biology and chemistry, the project has the following objectives: &lt;br/&gt;(1) Increase enrollment of underrepresented groups in laboratory-based biology and chemistry programs. &lt;br/&gt;(2) Increase retention and baccalaureate degree completion of biology and chemistry students. &lt;br/&gt;(3) Increase the number of graduates who continue studies in these fields. &lt;br/&gt;(4) Integrate student support, especially advising and career development, within these academic disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;(5) Provide undergraduate research and industry internship opportunities. &lt;br/&gt;(6) Demonstrate collaboration between faculty and student services staff. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The institution has high quality undergraduate biology and chemistry programs that are taught within interdisciplinary learning communities. A committed project team and superior laboratory and instructional resources provide a rich academic environment. The project includes creative and effective services for scholarship recipients that include pre-fall institutes; regular seminars; field trips; and internship and research opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: A thorough and flexible recruitment/selection plan ensures broad participation from underrepresented groups (students of color, women, persons with disabilities, first generation, and low-income). Specifically, outreach activities to local and urban high schools and community colleges are designed to attract more diverse students to biology and chemistry at the college. The project is continuing and improving a successful track record in placing students in graduate schools and industry. Project leaders are disseminating findings in journals, at professional meetings, and through a network of institutional research professionals.</AbstractNarration>
