<AbstractNarration>Overview: The objective of this project is innovative research for developing III-nitride fin field-effect transistors on silicon substrate. The approach utilizes silicon support fins with (111)-oriented sidewalls for selective area growth of symmetric III-nitride heterostructures using metallorganic vapor phase epitaxy. Materials growth, nanofabrication, simulation and modeling, and electrical tests will be carried out to exploit the enormous flexibility in engineering the fin energy band structure, leading to unprecedented control of electronic properties. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: This proposal presents transformative ideas, leading to novel and effective electronic device architectures for high-power transistors on a silicon platform. The proposed innovations will address fundamental and applied research related to materials growth, nano- and micro-scale design and development of wide band gap semiconductor transistors, and fabrication principles for fin architectures on structured silicon substrates. The III-nitride/Si fins will exhibit new band structure physics that will be exploited for innovative enhancement-mode devices. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: Efficient transistors are needed for high power radio-frequency modulation in wireless communications, DC power conversion, and imaging. Nanoscale biological and chemical sensors are needed for environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics, and homeland security. Normal-off state transistors for chip-scale miniature electronics are important for future ?green energy? applications. This proposal will enhance graduate and undergraduate education opportunities at Texas A&amp;M and Texas Tech Universities and, strengthen diversity at each institution, lead to REU supplement requests, and initiate a program targeting junior and senior high students who are demographically underrepresented in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
