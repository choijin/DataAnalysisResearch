<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for students and PostDocs to attend the 5th International Conference on MicroManufacturing, which will be held in Wisconsin, April 5-8, 2010.  Support will go with highest priority to Ph.D. students, then M.S. students, then undergraduate students, and finally PostDocs.  Priority will also be given to those students presenting papers and members of underrepresented groups.  Selection of applicants for support will be made by a committee whose members will consist of members of the conference organizing committee.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This opportunity will enable students to participate in the conference with other researchers in their field.  It will provide valuable insights into the research that others are doing and help them better frame their own work.  It will benefit the nation through improved effectiveness of funded research and higher quality graduates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported 27 graduate and undergraduate students to attend and present their research at the 5th International Conference on MicroManufacturing (ICOMM/4M 2010), that was held April 5-8, 2010, in Madison, WI.  The ICOMM/4M 2010 Conference was jointly organized by the International Conference on MicroManufacturing (ICOMM), based in the USA, and the International Conference on Multi-Material Micro-Manufacture (4M), based in the EU, bringing together a worldwide community of micro-manufacturing experts.  The studentsÃ† registration cost and lodging was covered by this grant.   The students had four keynote presentations and 79 research presentations that they could attend, all given by the leading international experts in micro-manufacturing.  They were also provided the opportunity to interact with senior researchers and fellow students from around the world.  The conference was attended by 165 engineers, researchers, and industry leaders representing 81 institutions from 20 countries in North America, Asia, and Europe.  These experiences will foster new ideas and a deeper fundamental understanding of this field for the students that were supported by this award.   This award also offered the 27 students an opportunity to practice their communication skills and network with researchers and engineers from around the world fostering future collaborations. This conference experience will be invaluable for the highly talented group of students who, as future manufacturing professionals and academics, will drive U.S. efforts to improve its competitive edge in the practice and research of manufacturing.
