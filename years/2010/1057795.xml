<AbstractNarration>This research award in the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program supports work by Professor Chip Nataro at Lafayette College to investigate the interaction of phosphorus containing compounds with sulfur, selenium and transition metals. Subtle alterations to the ancillary groups bound to phosphorus can significantly impact the properties exhibited by the phosphorus. The electrochemical and structural properties of phosphine sulfides and phosphine selenides will be examined to further understand the reactivity of these compounds in particular after they undergo oxidation. Similarly, when phosphorus is coordinated to a transition metal, oxidation of the ancillary groups on phosphorus can have a significant impact on the reactivity of the transition metal. Undergraduate students will be actively involved in this work which will serve as a strong foundation for their further scientific contributions in industrial or academic settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phosphorus containing compounds are used in a variety of different applications but of particular interest are their applications in industrial catalytic processes. By further examining the reactivity of these compounds, in particular after undergoing oxidation, more efficient and effective applications for these phosphorus containing compounds can be envisioned.</AbstractNarration>
