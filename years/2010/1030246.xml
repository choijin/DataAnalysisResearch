<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award  is to develop a control theoretic framework and efficient numerical schemes for nonparametric estimation of shape and dynamics constrained functions, with applications to emerging fields such as systems biology. The project will focus on three important and interrelated components: (i)  smoothing spline estimation of functions subject to constraints; (ii) computation and analysis of penalized polynomial spline estimators for constrained functions; and (iii) applications to genetic regulatory networks, degradation analysis in reliability engineering, and joint-drug treatment in biomedical research. The underlying theoretical foundation is based on constrained optimal control, complementarity theory, and asymptotic statistics. The obtained estimation algorithms will be implemented on various biological, biomedical and engineering systems subject to constraints.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Constraints are pervasive in engineering and science. Efficient estimation methods to be developed in this research will yield better understanding of complex biological systems, and provide accurate predication of products' lifetime and joint-drug effects on patients. The proposed research goes beyond traditional areas of control technology with many novel applications in statistics, systems biology, reliability engineering, and biomedical practice. The research findings of this project will be disseminated through PIs' close collaboration with engineers and an epidemiologist. This project also intends to integrate research with education and outreach activities at University of Maryland Baltimore County and Purdue University. Examples include developing new curricula and recruiting students to gain hands-on research experience. Undergraduate summer research and K-12 training will be supported with particular focus on minority and women participants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The following research tasks have been carried out during 2013-2014:  (1) Modeling and inference on functional data analysis with an application to the  CD4 counts data; (2) Functional Cox models wit an application to the Mexican  fruit flies data.     As one of the most important prognostics of the infections of  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), CD4 count has been incessantly investigated  by scientists from many aspects. Biologists make use of a wide range of  well-established statistical methods, including but not limited to, univariate and  multivariate regression, categorical analysis and longitudinal data analysis, to  model the CD4 count data and draw practical conclusions. However, nobody has proposed a statistical  analysis strategy motivated and designed specifically to fit the unique characters of  the CD4 count data, which will be discussed comprehensively in this project. In general, statistical modeling is an iterative process. It is fully reflected in this  study focusing on investigating the CD4 data, which is a longitudinal data set with a  random number of sparsely distributed repeated measurements of the CD4 counts  taken at non-equal time intervals for each sample object.   First of all, tools of functional data analysis (FDA) are employed to explore the  features of the CD4 data, both numerically and visually. In particular, we apply the  nonparametric repeated Hanning method (Tukey, 1977) to smooth the CD4  percentage, which is the sample CD4 count as compared to the whole number of  lymphocyte cells, curves over visits for each patient. The amount of smoothing is  determined when the estimated autocorrelation coefficients are stable or negligible  (Lambert and Liu, 2006).  Since the CD4 percentage  trend have been shown to  be linear after smoothing, we fit a simple linear model of CD4 percentage to visit  for each subject of at least 3 visits and obtain the estimates of both intercept and  slope. As the smoothed curves are linear, there is no landmark for us to refer.     Other than exploratory analysis, another important application of FDA is to answer  scientific question of interest. In this project, we formulate a simultaneous multiple  hypotheses of testing whether the CD4 slopes are positive or not, with the intention  to locate HIV-resistant subjects with non-decreasing CD4 curves, i.e., the HIV/AIDS  nonprogressors.  Our interest is to make simultaneous inference about n=219  assertions about the slopes. We formulated the simultaneous testing problem of  multiple slopes and derived the IM (Martin and Liu, 2013) for inference. These 8  nonprogressors, in together with an additional 2  nonprogressors, also identified by using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure  controlling FDR. A variety setting of simulations were also performed, showing that  the FDR procedure outperform the IM procedure in identifying no less true positives,  while in the other hand the IM always identifying no less true negatives than the  FDR. Most importantly, the IM procedure provides a way of measuring uncertainties  of the assertion directly through the belief functions and the plausibility functions,  which stand for the lower probabilities and the upper probabilities, respectively.  However, as a post hoc adjustment of multiple p-values, the FDR procedure  does not provide any uncertainty justification. This project is the main part of a  student Shuang He's dissertation. She has successfully passed her defense and  is now working at Eli Lilly Company.   This second project is motivated by a study on the Mexican fruit flies (Carey et al., 2005).  There were 1152 flies in that paper coming from four cohorts but we are using the  data from cohort 1 only, which consists of the lifetime and daily reproduction (in terms of number of eggs laid daily) of 288 female flies. We are interested in  how the daily reproduction will affect the survival time of Mexican fruit flies. The  egg-laying curve will serve as our longitudinal ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
