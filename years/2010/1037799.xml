<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project seeks to create veterans' communities of interest that collaborate across Texas A&amp;M Univeristy and with its partners to enhance the educational experience and number of veterans pursuing B.S. engineering degrees at TAMU.  These communities will enable the project team to investigate challenges for veteran students, leverage and integrate existing student services, and establish academic enhancements that meet the needs of veterans.  Local partner colleges and military bases will participate in the project.  The project team plans to use an industrial engineering approach of integrating proven actions, which may provide clear lessons to universities on attracting and retaining veterans as well as the one time and recurring costs of doing so.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project is to apply the lessons on how to recruit military personnel who are leaving service to inform practice and increase the pipeline into engineering.  The project will conduct interview of veteran students to discover barriers to enrollment, retention, and graduation; this approach could provide useful information to a range of practitioners.  Overall, the main benefits to society are increasing the enrollment of under-represented student populations in engineering and increasing the enrollment of student in engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[          TAMU AggiE-Vet -- Enhancing VeteransÆ Success in Engineering at Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU)      Intellectual Merits included the creation of veteransÆ communities of interest that collaborate across Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) and with its partners to enhance the educational experience and number of veterans pursuing B.S. engineering degrees at TAMU. TAMU AggiE-Vets created new knowledge related to veterans enrolled in engineering programs by investigating current challenges for veteran students.  Some of these challenges included the removal of barriers that inhibited veteran students from participating in high impact educational opportunities.  In this project the emphasis was in promoting the participation of veteran students in undergraduate research programs.  Broader Impacts included discovery and actions to promote veteran learning, and the development and broad dissemination of project solutions and services for veterans and their families. Broadened participation of a diverse group underrepresented in engineering majors occurred with links to the other NSF funded programs including the LSAMP program.  This project also had a significant and lasting impact in the relationships between the college of engineering and the different veteransÆ offices at TAMU. Today there is a stronger, cohesive and more proactive collaboration between the engineering academic units and these veteransÆ affairs units within TAMU.  This has been of the key accomplishments of this project.                  Last Modified: 02/02/2016       Submitted by: Cesar O Malave]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
