<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project will address feedback mechanisms between the ionosphere and geomagnetic storm dynamics and will investigate a possible role of the ionosphere on the variability of magnetic storm intensity.  A particular scientific objective is the investigation of universal time (UT) dependence of geomagnetic storm intensity.  A combination of data analysis and numerical experiments will be used to evaluate the effects of the ionosphere on the UT-dependence in geomagnetic storm intensity.  This project incorporates numerical experiments using modeling components from the University of Michigan Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) to gain insight into the role of the ionosphere on geomagnetic storm intensity.  The study will also use GPS-determined global Total Electron Content (TEC) maps to characterize the middle and high latitude ionosphere during all levels of magnetic activity.  Magnetic activity indices and TEC data will be used to empirically evaluate a possible feedback mechanism of the ionosphere on the storm intensity. The data will further be used to constrain the model experiments.  Using the coupled space-weather model, SWMF, the project will investigate the degree to which high-latitude oxygen ion abundance changes vs. season and magnetic activity, using the TEC data to evaluate the validity of the ionospheric component of the SWMF simulations.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This research project focused on the fundamental change in Earth&rsquo;s space environment that occurs during periods of high geomagnetic activity. During geomagnetic storms, while the solar-wind driven aurora heats the atmosphere at 100 miles altitude over Earth&rsquo;s poles, the density of the ionosphere changes most everywhere else around the Earth. At middle and low latitudes, the plasma can grow to very high densities, but this high density plasma confronts zones of very low density extending from the polar regions. Seen on a regional scale, these interactions look almost like storm fronts in weather, forming often in the afternoon during storms. The effect is to introduce significant errors in geo-positioning systems like GPS, through both the very high densities and the sharp changes in density at the boundaries, and in the rapidly changing high density regions themselves. As an intellectual pursuit, the scientific community is compelled to understand this phenomenon as a major feature of our planet during magnetic storms, and as a critically difficult-to-predict hazard of space weather. The broader impact of our research touches the technological systems affected, and by extension the operational needs of the U.S., including FAA WAAS and radio communications. It is in this context that we research the development of ionospheric enhancements during magnetic storms.</p> <p>It is becoming clear that the CONUS is one of the regions of the planet most susceptible to this effect. In fact, the ionospheric plasma is very often seen to extend from the southern USA up to Alaska during even moderate storm events (See Image 1). Though there are several explanations for this effect, there has not been a simulation effort, involving any of the advanced coupled atmospheric ionospheric models developed in recent years, to back up any of the theories that would explain the reason or support the observation that the American sector is most susceptible to these storms. This project implemented a number of components of the U Michigan Geospace Modeling Framework to provide the most complete simulation of storm onsets occurring when different longitudes of Earth were in the afternoon sector, and compared the ionospheric disturbance to the related atmospheric drivers.</p> <p>An interesting factor in this research is that ionospheric plasma is a key constituent of the magnetospheric plasma during storms. These oxygen ions flow upward from the auroral zones at maximum magnetic activity and flood the magnetosphere. In fact, these oxygen ions can carry half or more of the storm-time electrical current in the magnetosphere. All of this comes from the ionosphere and most from plasma that flows from middle to high latitudes during storms, just as can be seen in Image 1. So if there is some region of the planet where this afternoon process is stronger, then magnetic storms could be stronger when that sector is in the afternoon, in the biggest feedback loop in the Earth system. What we see when we compare numerical models of storm time TEC at middle latitudes to average magnetic storm strength (Image 2) is something that corresponds to that theory. That is, the American sector has the highest storm time plasma densities , that could be responsible for the fact that the largest magnetic storms occur soon after the American sector is in the afternoon.</p> <p>It is becoming clear that the CONUS is one of the regions of the planet most susceptible to this effect.
