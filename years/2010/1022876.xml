<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the fate of dissolved organic matter (DOM) released in increasing amounts to Arctic surface waters through such disturbances as fire, thermokarst failure, and thawing of permafrost. The investigators hypothesize that newly available soil carbon will be labile to photochemical and microbial attack, and will enhance the degradation of resident DOM in the system resulting in poorer quality DOM exported to the ocean. They plan to develop a mechanistic understanding of these processes by: (A) Determining how fast photochemical reactions and microbial processing will alter resident DOM and the newly-released DOM in surface waters, and (B) Measuring the fate of DOM in surface waters, either as CO2 released to the atmosphere or as organic carbon altered and transported to coastal oceans. This would be accomplished with a series of laboratory experiments to determine rates of photodegradation and microbial processing of DOM from different sources, and a series of landscape comparisons and sampling transects to characterize DOM degradation in small basins and large rivers extending 250-300 km from the headwaters to the Arctic Ocean. By integrating this process-based research with ongoing projects studying the formation of thermokarst failures and the impacts of burning on plant and soil carbon allocation, the investigators will address questions such as whether carbon export from tundra to oceans will rise or fall, how reactive is that exported carbon, and what will be the ultimate impact of impending disturbances, including climate change, on the net carbon balance of the Arctic and its interaction with the global carbon cycle. The investigators will work with several established programs at UNC and UM to (1) recruit women and minority student participation and research in this project specifically from Historically Black Colleges, (2) participate in a workshop on mentoring strategies for minorities, and (3) develop additional outreach activities, including talks to middle and high schools by the PIs, graduate, and undergraduate students. Presentation of data will coordinate with NSIDC and Arctic LTER data management.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Scientific Merit.  This research project investigated how organic carbon (C) in frozen soils (permafrost) is converted to the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2).  These soils underlie much of the Arctic, and they are beginning to thaw with global climate warming.  The conversion or organic C to CO2 released to the atmosphere begins by making organic carbon soluble in the form of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), which is then oxidized by microbes or sunlight to CO2.  Overall this conversion accounts for as much CO2 released from lakes and streams globally to the atmosphere as the net amount of CO2 absorbed by the ocean from the atmosphere.  More specifically, the DOC released from soils to inland waters has two fates:  it can be fully oxidized to CO2 and returned to the atmosphere, or it can be partially oxidized and moved from land through rivers to the ocean.  This research found that both complete and partial oxidation pathways of DOC degradation are important for C budgets in the Arctic.              Given that climate warming is accelerating the thaw of permafrost soils, which currently store twice the C found in the atmosphere, understanding controls on the fate of DOC is critical for the debate on whether newly-thawed and exposed arctic soil C will be oxidized to greenhouse gases and create a positive feedback on global warming.  Controls on the oxidation of DOC have been previously attributed to degradation by bacteria, but we showed that sunlight oxidized DOC 2 to 15-times faster than did bacteria in the water column of arctic streams and lakes.  Thus, in contrast to previous assumptions, sunlight-driven processes (i.e., photo-degradation) dominated DOC degradation in arctic inland waters.  For example, photo-degradation of DOC is currently about one third of the total CO2 released from surface waters, and is thus an important, newly measured component of the arctic C budget.  Sunlight will continue to be important for DOC fate in a warming Arctic because permafrost carbon brought to the surface in thermokarst failures (landslides created when ice-rich ground thaws and collapses) was more readily converted to CO2 by bacteria when exposed to sunlight (by ~ 40%) compared to permafrost carbon held in the dark.  Finally, we showed that one of the main pathways by which DOC is converted to CO2 by sunlight can also occur in the dark, that is, in the absence of sunlight in soils and sediments.  These findings strongly suggest that both dark chemical processes and photochemical processes are important for C degradation across landscapes.      Broader Impacts.  The real driver of climate warming is the human input of heat trapping gases to the atm, now at a rate of 7-8 billion tons or gigatons (Gt) per year.  This perturbation to the global C cycle has reached the point where other parts of the natural cycle are poised to change their behavior.  For example, much of this tremendous store of C in high-latitude soils has been encased in permafrost for many thousands of years, but as climate warms the permafrost thaws and that previously-frozen C can once again participate in the global C cycle.  Because there is a tremendous amount of this permafrost C, more than twice that found in the atmosphere, if it thaws and is converted to CO2 it could potentially cause a major positive feedback that drives more rapid global warming.  The outstanding question, then, is what is the arc of change of these alterations in the carbon cycle, and how will they determine the climate of our world in the next 50-100 years.  Another perspective on the importance of this change is that, given the increasing pressure for international climate treaties to limit CO2 emissions, consider that to stabilize the atmospheric content at 450 ppm CO2, about a 3degree Celsius increase, the world can emit another 45 Gt of C.  This amount could easily come from the C stored in permafrost, meaning that nations who share arctic territory may be severely constrained i...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
