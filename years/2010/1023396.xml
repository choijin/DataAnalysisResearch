<AbstractNarration>Arctic environments have been profoundly affected by global climate change, and changes in tundra habitats, including changes in snow conditions, climatic variability and habitat types are predicted to have major impacts on the biodiversity and distribution of arctic biota. One likely impact of climatic change will be a decoupling of biological interactions among organisms at different trophic levels, leading to a 'phenological mismatch' in the seasonal timing of life-history events for plants, insects, birds and higher-level predators. Arctic breeding shorebirds are expected to be 'integrative sentinels' for the effects of global climate change because high energetic requirements, long-distance migratory movements, and synchronized timing of seasonal activities increase their vulnerability to changing environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will examine the effects of environmental conditions in the Arctic on the ecology and trophic relationships of two species of migratory shorebirds: Semipalmated Sandpipers (Calidris pusilla) and Western Sandpipers (C. mauri). One challenge for assessing the ecological consequences of climate change is a lack of baseline data for most organisms. A unique feature of this project is that the researcher collected detailed data on the seasonal timing, demography and movements of sandpipers in a 4-year period (1993-1996) at an undisturbed 4 square km coastal tundra study site near Nome, Alaska. In this 3-year field project (2011-2013) the research team will monitor shorebird populations and four key environmental factors: climatic conditions, arthropod emergence, abundance of small mammals and predators. They will also deploy geolocator tags to determine migration routes and nonbreeding sites for the study populations. Data on shorebird ecology will be collected using standardized field protocols at the same site, under the direction of the lead investigator who collected the original data, and will span a 15-20 year interval of environmental change. The broader context of our research will be the comprehensive knowledge of the annual cycle of migratory sandpipers that has been developed under the 16-year research program of the 'Western Sandpiper Research Network'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is one of the first field studies to test predictions of the 'phenological mismatch' hypothesis for arctic-breeding shorebirds and to examine long-term changes in trophic interactions among food resources, migratory sandpipers, and their predators. The hypothesis will be rejected if long-term changes are lacking but standardized sampling will provide a framework for future studies of ecological resilience. The hypothesis will be supported if warming climatic conditions have changed the timing of insect emergence without changes in phenology of shorebird nesting, potentially leading to declines in densities of nesting birds. Strong inferences about the effects of arctic conditions can be made because the study species breed sympatrically but have different migration routes and nonbreeding areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide insights for conservation of migratory birds that breed at high latitudes in the Arctic. Traditional methods for surveying arctic birds are based on nest monitoring and this project will evaluate the extent to which more intensive demographic approaches are a useful alternative. The project will offer training opportunities for one PhD student and up to six undergraduate students. Outreach in the community of Nome, Alaska will include annual meetings with native stakeholders, interviews with journalists, and preparation of public display media for the Nome visitor center.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary.  The goal of our field project was to investigate the long-term effects of environmental change on the breeding ecology of arctic-breeding shorebirds at Nome, Alaska.  Our three focal study species were Western Sandpipers, Semipalmated Sandpipers, and Red-necked Phalaropes.  The sandpipers are long-distance migrants that breed on arctic tundra but winter at coastal sites in central and South America.  Birds were captured in mistnets and at nests, and were uniquely marked with colored leg bands and engraved flags.  We collected demographic data on shorebird ecology, including timing of breeding, reproductive success, and annual survival rates.  We also collected data on environmental conditions, including climate, timing of emergence and abundance of invertebrate prey, numbers of lemmings, and sightings of foxes, jaegers and other predators.  Our investigation included long-term comparisons across two decades of environmental change between the 7-year periods of 1993-1999 and 2008-2014.  We were also able to make comparisons across a network of arctic field sites because our field site at Nome was 1 of 10 sites that investigated shorebirds with the same set of standardized field protocols as part of the Arctic Shorebird Demographic Network directed by the Manomet Center for Conservation Sciences.  Intellectual merit.  Our project made four new contributions to arctic science.  First, we found that timing of nesting in sandpipers is not advancing but has been delayed by 3-7 days compared to birds breeding at the same site two decades ago.  Most investigations of reproductive timing in plants and animals have reported advances, but our arctic study is one of the few examples of delays in seasonal phenology.  Second, the main environmental factor affecting timing of egg-laying was spring temperatures during May, and all three species of shorebirds showed delays in breeding during cold springs.  Long-term climate data from Nome show evidence for warming trends in winter but unexpectedly a cooling trend in May during the breeding season of shorebirds.  Third, climate change led to phenological mismatches for arctic-breeding shorebirds.  We calculated mismatches between breeding shorebirds and their invertebrate prey at ten arctic sites for a three year period.  The strongest drivers of mismatch were daily temperatures during egg-laying, and the total amount of food available at an arctic site.  Last, we used new light-sensitive geolocator archival tags to collect the first data on migratory movements for shorebirds breeding in western Alaska.  We successfully deployed and recovered tags on small-bodied sandpipers that were &lt;25 g in body mass.  Birds were captured and tagged at Nome, but migratory tracks showed that our single breeding population had a huge nonbreeding distribution ranging from southern Canada to Colombia in South America.  Broader impacts. Our field project had a series of broader impacts.  All field work was conducted on private lands of the Sitnasauk Native Corporation who supported this project by allowing access to study plots for our long-term monitoring of breeding sandpipers.  The field project at Nome was a collaboration between investigators at Kansas State University and Simon Fraser University in Canada.  We also participated in the Arctic Shorebirds Demographics Network which includes arctic sites in Russia, Alaska, and Canada.  Project activities at Nome provided training opportunities for two postdoctoral fellows, two graduate students, and seven research technicians.  Research products have included two peer-reviewed articles, two graduate dissertations and theses, and 12 conference presentations.  Public outreach included public presentations to the community of Nome, Alaska and feature articles in the Nome Nugget.  All long-term field data from the project have been archived at the ACADIS, a repository for arctic data.  The research was conducted under federal and state permits for wild...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
