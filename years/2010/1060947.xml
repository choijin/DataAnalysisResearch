<AbstractNarration>Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus are the two nutrients required in large quantity by phytoplankton in the ocean, and together they limit productivity throughout most of the tropical, subtropical, and temperate ocean. Both the cycling of N and its input/output budget have been argued to control the fertility of the ocean and the ocean's role in setting atmospheric CO2.  The CaCO3 tests of foraminifera can represent a substantial fraction of marine sediments and have been used extensively in paleoceanography; they are an obvious target for isotopic analysis of microfossil-bound organic matter. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, researchers at Princeton have developed a protocol for the isotopic analysis of foraminiferal shell-bound N.  The current protocol is at least 100 times more sensitive than typical on-line combustion, allowing for rapid progress with a N isotope archive that was previously not feasible to measure. Measurements on surface sediments and a downcore record from the Caribbean show the promise of foraminifera-bound del15N (fb-del15N) to provide both a robust N isotope archive for paleoceanography, and one with a unique potential of richness, given the existence of multiple foraminiferal species with different depth habitats and behaviors.  Moreover, the finding from the Caribbean Sea record -- reduced N fixation in ice age Atlantic -- has changed the scientific conversation about the nature of the input/output budget of oceanic fixed N and its potential to change ocean fertility and atmospheric CO2.  However, the controls on fb-del15N have not yet been adequately studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, as a first major step in developing a foundation for the paleoceanographic application of fb-del15N, the same Princeton University team will study its genesis in the water column, transport to the seafloor, and early diagenesis. They will undertake this study in the Sargasso Sea south of Bermuda. This is one of the best studied regions of the ocean, in general and with respect to foraminifera, and a region that has been has been a focus of the N isotope research of the PI for the last decade and others previously. Moreover, its significant seasonality -- in physical oceanography, biogeochemistry, and foraminiferal species abundance -- will facilitate the effort to understand the controls on fb-del15N at a mechanistic level.  The research team will participate in six Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) cruises over two years, collecting foraminifera and other N forms likely to provide insight into the controls on fb-del15N. From the nearby Oceanic Flux Program (OFP) moored sediment traps and from shallow sediments collected in the region, they will pick foraminifera shells and again make relevant ancillary measurements. This work will establish the relationship of foraminiferal biomass to shell-bound del15N for different species, and comparison of the foraminiferal isotope data with the upper ocean N pools will yield empirical isotopic relationships and work toward a mechanistic insight of fb-del15N (e.g., the importance of different N pools to the diets of different foraminifera; the role of algal symbionts). The sediment trap and surface sediment data will support the plankton tow data by integrating over longer time scales and will also address questions regarding late stage (e.g., gametogenic) calcification and the early diagenesis of fb-del15N and fb-N content. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:   This study will yield an improved understanding of the nutrient dynamics of foraminifera, a class of organisms whose shells are a central tool in micropaleontology and paleoclimatology.  The project will also build on the principal investigator's involvement in the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences as an asset for integrating ocean-related education and research at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.</AbstractNarration>

Year-to-year variations are typically minor and affected by random chance. If we seek to understand how climate and the environment behave on a meaningful time scale, we must observe them over at least many decades, probably centuries, as these are the shortest times over which conditions change significantly. The problem is that we only recently starting measuring the global environment, and we will not accumulate enough data if we just collect it one year after the next. Instead, scientists have to find ways to reconstruct changes before the time that measurements were being made. This usually involves a natural property that can be measured in material from a natural record such as a sediment or glacial ice core. We often refer to this measurable natural property as an environmental or climate "proxy," signifying that it provides a replacement (albeit an imperfect one) for direct instrumental measurements of the environment.  The purpose of this project was to provide background information on a new "proxy" that the principle investigatorÆs research group recently developed for reconstructing nutrient conditions in the ocean. Nutrients are chemicals required for the growth of plankton, and their availability often controls the biological productivity of the ocean. This biological productivity can affect natural resources such as fisheries and can also affect climate by changing the concentration of the greenhouse gases (most importantly, carbon dioxide) in the atmosphere. The proxy being studied is the ratio of stable nitrogen isotopes of the organic matter trapped in the fossil shells of single-celled protist zooplankton called "foraminifera." It took decades to develop the ability to make this measurement, in part because there is so little organic matter in the fossil shells. With the ability to make the measurement in hand, the NSF-funded project produced data to test the proxyÆs ability to reconstruct nutrient conditions by studying the proxy in the modern ocean and in the fossils of recently deposited sediments that should reflect modern conditions.

The isotopic differences among foraminifera species were shown to be relatively constant through time and similar in the surface ocean, sinking material, and the sediments. The nitrogen isotope ratio of individual foraminifera species showed signs of tracking the very subtle seasonal variation in the phytoplankton nitrogen isotopes at BATS, providing unexpected evidence that the proxy can be very precise. Moreover, there was no significant change in the foraminifera shell nitrogen isotopes from the surface ocean to the sediments, providing a partial check on whether this proxy will be well preserved ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
