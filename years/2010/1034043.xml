<AbstractNarration>The goal of this research is to test the hypothesis that stormwater Best Management Practices (BMPs) positively influence ecosystem function of urban streams at multiple spatial and temporal scales.  This project will assemble a comprehensive set of measures to determine the impact of BMPs on water quality in several urban watersheds.  Interdisciplinary aspects include water quality analyses, stream morphology, and ecological monitoring and modeling. Placement, design, and density of BMPs will be investigated to determine the optimal benefit for stream ecosystem services, such as nutrient uptake, metabolism, temperature and biological indices.  The results of monitoring BMPs will be combined with ecological modeling of nutrient concentrations to identify the areas best served by BMPs and how well the BMPs function to achieve the over-arching goal of improved stream health.  Inclusion of thermal pollution is an important component of this research.  Undergraduate students will be heavily involved, and will gain experience in design of environmentally friendly BMPs.  The involvement of a stakeholder group will transfer the results to people who can use the results to influence current stormwater regulation and management practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bruce K.
