<AbstractNarration>The Partnership in Securing Cyberspace through Education and Service project produces students who, by the time they become government employees, have been educated by professors who are internationally recognized specialists in computer security and information assurance (CSIA) and by guest lecturers who are on the leading edge of technical and policy development of CSIA in government systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are guided through a curriculum that provides a thorough understanding of the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Government in cybersecurity, an overview of its technical aspects, and familiarity with current management tools and cyber legislation currently proposed and under discussion. The project prepares George Washington?s CyberCorps students to succeed by developing their technical, analytical, managerial, presentation, and writing skills with regard to CSIA issues.  It provides a baseline of common knowledge of relevant federal policies and mandates and an informed picture of federal government roles, responsibilities, and processes.  &lt;br/&gt;Students can choose from dozens of courses in seven departments covering various aspects of computer security.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project add great value to our students? storehouse of knowledge, information they immediately use in their federal careers. The project also identify bright students from traditionally underrepresented groups and actively encourage them to expand their horizons and to prepare for government jobs in CSIA.  Of special interest is its program where students with bachelor?s degrees from the very diverse University of Hawaii study for a graduate degree in Washington before going to work for the government.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project provided two-year full scholarships (tuition, books, stipend, and room and board) for students to study computer security and information assurance at GW or a partner university. After completing their coursework, students went to work to protect the nation's information infrastructure by working as security experts in a government agency, national laboratory, or federally funded research and development centers.  The project supported 20 students, eight of whom were women. While the majority were in computer science, other majors included forensic sciences (high tech crime investigation), information systems technology management, engineering management, international affairs, international science and technology policy, and political science.  Our Scholarship for Service (SFS) graduates completed a course of study that includes cybersecurity course work in their major department and sometimes other departments, plus a required seminar that runs throughout the studentsÃ† time at GW and includes speakers on issues such as privacy, intellectual property, computer crime, and information warfare, and provides numerous opportunities to engage the speakers in informal discussions of the efficacy of the technological armada of security and information assurance tools utilized in response to these issues.   Guest talks by government officials and professionals working on government projects are a regular feature of this class. During weekly meetings, students presented their analyses of current cyber attacks, vulnerabilities, and mitigation techniques to their peers, visiting speakers, and course instructors. Students also prepared written system security plans for their instructor and presented these to their peers.  In addition, the project included a workshop on "Lessons Learned from Diverse and Successful SFS programs".  This boot camp informed new SFS institutional recipients about practical issues in managing their grants.  Best practices and lessons learned were explained by a team of veteran mentors, principal investigators who have been successful in educating students in cybersecurity and information assurance and in placing their graduates into government service.
