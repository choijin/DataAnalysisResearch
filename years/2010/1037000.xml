<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on high-latitude cloud and aerosol properties via observations conducted at the Arctic Facility for Atmospheric Remote Sensing (AFARS), operated by the University of Alaska Fairbanks.  AFARS supports of two polarization lidars, a polarimetric Doppler W-band radar, and a suite of ultraviolet, visible, and infrared radiometers.  Researchers will use these instruments, along with cloud microphysical models and satellite measurements from the A-train constellation, to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  1) Characterize the macrophysical and microphysical properties of mid and high level clouds in the Arctic and compare them to midlatitude clouds&lt;br/&gt;  2) Study aerosol intrusions into the Arctic and improve their characterization through multi-wavelength depolarization methods&lt;br/&gt;  3) Study recent findings that aerosols, such as transported Asian dust, volcanic dust, and forest fire smoke, are indirectly affecting clouds&lt;br/&gt;  4) Combine polarization lidar and polarimetric Doppler radar to study precipitation physics&lt;br/&gt;  5) Test the ability of satellite methods to characterize the observed clouds and aerosols&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this activity comes through use of a combination of ground-based remote sensing and satellite-based observations in characterized clouds and aerosols in the environmentally critical yet under-sampled Arctic region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this activity will center on the education and continued career development of a graduate student and post-doctoral researcher, respectively.  Additionally, results from this work are potentially important for understanding climate change feedbacks involving alterations in cloud cover and cloud microphysical properties in high-latitude regions.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Under this award we conducted new lidar (laser radar) studies of ice clouds in the Arctic. Recent studies have indicated that these clouds may play an important role in the radiation budget of the Arctic. These studies were conducted at the Arctic Facility for Atmospheric Remote Sensing (AFARS). The study focussed on high-level Cirrus clouds and mid-level clouds. These Arctic observations were assessed against earlier studies at Utah that were conducted with the same lidar system and provide a consistent comparison. The study of Cirrus clouds shows that the Arctic and mid-latitude observations are consistent and indicate that these clouds are formed by regional as opposed to local weather systems. The study of mid-level clouds revealed that these clouds occur commonly and are prevalent through the year. These clouds are thinner than the traditional altostratus clouds and are under-represented in climate studies. The AFARS observations were compared with observations from the CALIPSO satellite and showed that there is good agreement between the ground-based and satellite-based measurements of these clouds. The ground-based system measures clouds at higher precision than the satellite, but is limited to a single site, while the satellite provides global measurements of the clouds. This study shows that studies of these clouds can be extended from single-site observations to the global perspective, and yield a global assessment of their role in the climate system. The award supported training of graduate students in meteorology and remote sensing. The results of these studies have been reported in the scientific literature and an MS Thesis.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/17/2015<br>      Modified by: Kenneth&nbsp;Sassen</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
