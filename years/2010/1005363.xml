<AbstractNarration>The supported research will determine characteristics of atmospheric turbulence unique to near-surface airflow interaction with plant canopies, and in-turn identify mechanisms controlling the release and transport of small particles (e.g., pollen grains, spores, seeds, etc.) within such canopies.  Dynamic interactions will be represented by a combination of field-observations, laboratory water-channel experiments and high-resolution numerical simulations advance the prediction of particle transport in boundary layers beyond current models, which represent turbulent transport via steady, homogenous diffusion coefficients.  In this way, the role of individual coherent flow structures in releasing, capturing and transporting particles will be quantitatively determined.  This research will combine flume experiments with artificial canopies under controlled laboratory conditions, field experiments in the context of actual crops (as facilitated by Pennsylvania State University's Rock Springs Farm research facility), and numerical experiments using large-eddy simulation (LES) models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit of this effort derives from improved understanding of vegetation-atmosphere interactions involving turbulent processes generated by agricultural crops typical of those across the Midwestern U.S., which has relevance both to atmospheric behavior and biological processes within plant canopies.  Broader impacts of this research will center on improved representation and prediction of modes of atmospheric turbulence generated within and above plant canopies, and will involve strongly interdisciplinary work at the interface of the atmospheric and biological sciences.  A variety of graduate and undergraduate educational opportunities will be provided within diverse field-experiment, laboratory and numerical analysis settings, and will include student participation in an Aerobiology Field Course to be conducted at the PSU field research facility.</AbstractNarration>

This issue is relevant to a wide range of problems including aeolian transport of sand and dust from vegetated arid regions and the dispersion of seeds, pollens and pathogenic spores from crops and forests.

The approach combined field experiments in maize and wheat fields in Pennsylvania and Illinois and numerical simulations of particle transport by wind motion using two distinct modeling approaches: large-eddy simulation (LES) and Lagrangian stochastic models (LSMs).  The main outcomes of the present research are listed below:  1)     We have collected the most complete set of measurements of particle dispersion within and above plant canopies to date. Measurements were performed for maize and wheat fields using a very large concentration-sampling array consisting of 60 samplers. The maize field data includes simultaneous sources at several release heights and special runs with sources at different distances from the field edge. This data set is explored in many of the papers listed below and could be very useful for the community in developing and validating future models and theories.  2)     We developed better understanding of the interaction between wind turbulence and plant elements (branches, leaves, stems, etc.). In particular, our work quantified for the first time how the bending of plant elements impacts some of the properties of wind turbulence inside the vegetation. The main conclusion was that, all else being equal, plants that bend in response to strong wind gusts allow deeper penetration of turbulence inside the vegetated region increasing transport of energy and particles.  3)     We developed a new approach to include this effect in numerical models that simulate wind turbulence inside plant canopies. We also showed that models that include this effect are more capable of reproducing statistics of turbulence and particle transport from measurements in maize fields.  4)     We have performed the most extensive assessment of numerical models (LES and LSM) used to study particle dispersion inside plant canopies, identifying limitations of the models and pointing out the most reliable approaches (for example, the clear advantage of using LES over LSM).  5)     We have used the LES model to study effects of source location on escape fraction of particles. This information is of great importance in practical applications, such as studies of dispersal of pollens and pathogenic spores. In particular, our results show that dispersal from sources near field edges behave very differently from sources in the middle of large fields.  6)     We have developed a new theory for dispersion of particles released from point sources within and above plant canopies. This theory allows for quick estimation of the transport of particles released inside the canopy downwind from the source.  7)     So far a total of 7 journal papers were produced and a number of presentations were given in conferences by the principal investigators and graduate students involved.  8)     This projected created opportunity for training of one M.S. (Simone Gleicher) and one Ph.D. (Ying Pan) student. In addition, two undergraduate students (Kehui Zhang and Andrew Thomas) participated in the field components of this project and both decided to pursue graduate education.
