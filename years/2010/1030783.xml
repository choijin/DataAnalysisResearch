<AbstractNarration>This project brings together research on advanced (nano) and recycled materials suitable for plastic pipe infrastructure, life cycle costing, and a practical tool targeted to pipe manufacturers and public utility end-users.  Experimental testing methods combined with multi-scale modeling will be used to characterize the material response of nanoclay reinforced plastic pipe when subjected to stress conditions expected during the service life of infrastructure pipe; and to determine nanoclay and recycled plastic compositions that meet service life standards for pressure and non-pressure conditions. Multiscale models will be developed based on polymer molecular structures to capture the cracking behavior and to predict the lifetime of pipe made from appropriate mixes of pristine and nanoclay reinforced recycled plastic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research results from material testing, to multi-scale model, to life cycle model, will formulate the empirical basis for a practical and publicly available pipe cost tool directed at pipe manufacturers to guide the selection of material in designing nanocomposite plastic pipe.  Successful completion of this project will have a broad impact on engineering materials and will also strengthen graduate and undergraduate education in the awareness of new construction materials and their advantages and limitations regarding performance and associated costs. Multiple case study projects with real-world infrastructure application will be created based on the proposed research to serve as platforms for graduate students to provide mentoring to undergraduate students.  Students will learn both the engineering fundamentals and environmental and cost aspects of emerging construction materials and the importance of implementing engineering research into practice.  The recycling of plastics along will the science associated with the process will ground an environmentally themed K-12 education program.</AbstractNarration>

Research findings showed that:  1) Blending brittle recycled material with ductile pristine HDPE decreased the fracture toughness and the crack growth resistance;  2) Adding 6-wt% nanoclay to pristine HDPE and 2-wt% nanoclay to recycled blends resulted in a transition from ductile to brittle failure. Micrographs (Image 1) depict the fracture surfaces of the material containing 75-wt% of recycled HDPE (P25R75) with nanoclay composites.  3) The long-term stress cracking behavior of pristine/recycled HDPE and pristine/recycled HDPE nanocomposites were expressed via the logarithmic stress intensity factor K and the logarithmic failure time:  a) Failure behavior in recycled/pristine HDPE blends showed that increases in recycled HDPE decreased failure time in pristine/recycled HDPE blends: increasing the recycled content from 25% to 50% decreased the failure time by 69% under the same stress intensity (K).
