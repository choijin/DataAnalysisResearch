<AbstractNarration>The 2010 M=7.0 Haiti earthquake ruptured a 40 km long fault, had a seismic&lt;br/&gt;moment of 5.44 x 1026 dyne cm, and caused a devastating destruction in the Haiti?s capital, Port-au-Prince. A magnitude 7 earthquake typically displaces the Earth?s crust by 3-5 meters and deforms the crust over a wide area along the fault. It also induces large transient displacements, termed postseismic deformation. We propose to monitor the posteseismic deformation induced by the Haiti earthquake using TerraSAR-X (TSX) data. The investigators and their team will task the satellite to acquire data in the next 12 months over the ruptured&lt;br/&gt;segment of the Enriquillo Fault. The post-seismic deformation is time dependent. Thus it is important to acquire data right after the earthquake. The results of this study will be used to re-evaluate the seismic hazard of the Port-au-Prince area for both short-term (aftershocks) and long-term (next big earthquake) seismic activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will take advantage of the high resolution TSX data and&lt;br/&gt;the 11-day repeat orbit to acquire detailed time series of postseismic deformation following the 2010 Haiti Earthquake. Although X-band data is often considered inappropriate for crustal deformations studies, due to the rapid coherence degradation, the successive acquisitions with short repeat time will allow us to maintain coherence throughout the yearlong acquisition plan.</AbstractNarration>
