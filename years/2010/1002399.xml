<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professors Lawrence Hall, Mary K Gaillard, Ori Ganor, Hitoshi Murayama, and Bruno Zumino at the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These five faculty members are pursuing a many-faceted program of research in theoretical high-energy physics.  Professor Ganor conducts research in M-theory, string theory, supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories, and field theories in higher dimensions, and he will search for possible tests of string theory and M-theory in cosmology. Professor Gaillard studies effective supergravity theories at the quantum level, with an emphasis on those derived from the weakly coupled heterotic string. She will explore the implications of these theories for collider physics and cosmology. Professor Hall will study unsolved issues involved in electroweak symmetry breaking, and connections between particle physics and cosmology.  For example, he will study how inflation and dark energy can be incorporated into fundamental theories. Professor Murayama will study the physics behind the electroweak symmetry breaking.  He will also study underground physics such as neutrino physics and the physics of dark matter and proton decay. Finally, Professor Zumino studies various aspects of non-commutative quantum field theories and (super)string theories.  He plans to go beyond the known mathematical techniques in order to develop a deformation quantization of differential forms for gauge theories and a functional super-star product for (super)string field theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts.  Collectively, this research group provides training to students and postdocs who become the next generation of scientists. They also promote diversity through a female PI, and they seek and encourage participation by women students and scientists. Because the general public is deeply interested in fundamental questions, the Berkeley theory group will also work with QuarkNet teachers to bring the excitement of forefront research to high-school students. Strong ties to the Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe (IPMU) in Tokyo through Murayama's directorship will also bring international connections to students and postdocs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our project addressed age-long questions of humanity concerning where do we come from, why are we here, and where we are going.  Scientifically, these questions translate to understanding laws of nature, dark matter, dark energy, origin of matter, and nature of spacetime.  Our project provided a significant progress in elucidating these big questions, by connecting cosmology and particle physics, and string theory.    For example, PI Murayama could solve half-a-century-old problem concerning the origin of very low-energy excitations in many systems spanning from atomic, nuclear, astro, to particle physics.  co-PI Hall developed how the concept of Multiverse can be tested by experimental observations.  Multiverse is a hypothesis that there are something like 10500 Universes equally eligible, yet only a small fraction of them provide habitable conditions to intelligent lifeforms.  co-PI Gaillard worked out falsifiable consequences of string theory, arguably the "Theory of Everything".  co-PI Ganor developed mathematical foundations of the string theory.    Given the broad appeal of our research program, all of us have been extremeley active in public outreach.  We also promoted diversity by getting a large number of female students and postdocs involved.  PI Murayama was invited to speak at the United Nations headquarters in New York about how basic science promoted world peace.
