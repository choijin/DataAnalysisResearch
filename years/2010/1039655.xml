<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation award funds the acquisition of a 400 MHz Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometer to sustain research programs in organometallic, organic, bioinorganic, and biochemistry. Research performed using the new NMR includes studies on the impact of metal-metal bonds on ligand-based reactivity, development of cutting-edge Cu-catalyzed click methodology for the syntheses of fluorophores as light-emitting materials, analysis of molecules that influence lateral root formation in Arabidopsis thaliana , and copper interactions in zinc-binding peptides and developing porphyrins with light-harvesting properties for solar energy conversion applications.  These projects utilize the multinuclear (e.g., 31P, 19F, 11B) and variable temperature capabilities of the new NMR and take advantage of the increased sensitivity to permit efficient acquisition of data from routine 1D and sophisticated 2D experiments.  At Macalester College, vigorous scholarly activity by faculty and students facilitates the creation of new knowledge and ensures that the next generation of scientists receives state-of-the-art training.  High quality research training of undergraduates is enabled by the new NMR. The NMR is also used in summer research programs to stimulate interest in science among high school students from underrepresented groups. Results from the NMR studies will be broadly disseminated through abstracts and peer reviewed publications, as well as by active participation of students and faculty at professional meetings.</AbstractNarration>
