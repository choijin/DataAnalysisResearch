<AbstractNarration>Salmon species are tremendously important both culturally, as an icon for Native North Americans, and economically. Their populations are also among the most variable from year to year, a trait that is of considerable importance for local economies based on wild salmon fisheries because it creates a high degree of financial risk or uncertainty. Understanding what controls the dramatic annual swings of salmon stocks and predicting these swings is a matter of significant practical importance. This problem was apparent in California with the 2009 ban on salmon fishing, a management decision causing a loss to state revenues in excess of $220 million.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, a new paradigm for ecological dynamics will be developed, one that differs dramatically from the classical views of fisheries management and population biology that are based largely on classical ideas of equilibrium and stability. The goal of this project is to develop and use new tools from nonlinear science that use prediction, as opposed to post hoc fitting, as the ultimate measure of merit. This new paradigm does not require equilibrium concepts and stability, but views the fisheries problem as a dynamic complex system of nonlinear co-dependent interactions. It explicitly recognizes the growing evidence from field measurements on natural populations that nonlinear complexity and instability are ubiquitous, and that static or multiple equilibria, though simple and conceptually manageable, are likely to be idealized exceptions rather than the rule. The state space reconstruction methods that will be developed will use time series data to reconstruct and predict non-equilibrium salmon population dynamics for the 9 major Fraser River sockeye stocks, with the ultimate view toward implementing these methods for managing this fishery.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary     Although ecosystems are often acknowledged to be nonlinear or interdependent, the reductionist approach where components are treated as independent is still commonly applied. This is especially true for fisheries, where traditional single species models consider environmental effects independent of natural population fluctuations. As a consequence it is not surprising that traditional fisheries models do not fit data well, and more importantly, they do not perform in forecasting fish stocks. In this project, we develop and utilize the data-driven framework of Empirical Dynamic Modeling (EDM) as an alternative approach for analyzing real systems that are not in equilibrium, but are constantly changing. EDM assumes no equations, but mechanistically reconstructs the ecosystems dynamic behavior directly from time series. EDM was applied to data from Fraser River sockeye salmon, demonstrating the presence of nonlinear behavior, and produced significantly improved forecast models. Our real-time forecast for 2014 returns (made using data ending in 2012) was correct, while the official DFO forecasts were not informative.     Intellectual Merit     (1) We confirmed the presence of nonlinear behavior in Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks. Consequently, we developed EDM models that include environmental effects in a nonlinear fashion that significantly outperform traditional fisheries models. These EDM models also show no evidence that population behavior changes with climate regimes, suggesting that these models will remain predictive in the future as ocean conditions change.     (2) We developed a fundamentally new method for identifying causation between time series variables. This method (convergent cross mapping, CCM) addresses the common problem of misusing correlation in dynamic systems.  It is summarized in the following video animation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fevurdpiRYg&amp;list=PL-SSmlAMhY3bnogGTe2tf7hpWpl508pZZ     (3) We conducted a meta-analysis on a database of fish population time series, finding that many populations show both predictability and nonlinearity. These results indicate that the EDM framework can be generally applied to many different fisheries systems.     (4) We developed a freely available software package that implements EDM methods for the R programming language (https://www.github.com/ha0ye/rEDM).     Broader Impacts     (1) In collaboration with the investigators for this project, CanadaÆs fishery management agency (Fisheries and Oceans Canada, DFO) will be implementing EDM models as part of the tools used to predict and manage Fraser River sockeye salmon.     (2) EDM methods were communicated and shared with fisheries scientists from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in two separate workshops on nonlinear time series methods, held at the bequest of NOAA senior science advice. Their objective was to "fast-track" EDM concepts and methods into current stock assessments. The investigators for this project are currently working on several new projects with NMFS scientists as a consequence of these collaborations.     (3) Several workshops have been coordinated to train other scientists in the use of EDM methods and the software package developed for this project, including the 2015 ESA meeting, an international workshop in at the Stockholm Resilience Center, and the National Center for Theoretical Sciences in Taipei.     (4) Collaborators have already used EDM to study dynamic systems in other domains (e.g., grassland ecosystems, EarthÆs climate cycles, human flu outbreaks).     (5) This project provided direct and indirect financial support for 3 doctoral students. In addition to training in scientific and writing skills, these students have presented at scientific conferences, published numerous papers, and collaborated with many peers and other scientists.     (6) The causality method (CCM) developed by this project is fundamental, widely cited and has been applied in a v...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
