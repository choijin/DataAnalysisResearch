<AbstractNarration>The 2010 ?Flow and Transport in permeable Media? meeting includes  a detailed program plan for the general meeting, with topics discussing subsurface imaging, soil and climate interactions, upscaling and biologic processes of soil media and multi-scale physics modeling.  The meeting is both integrative as well as timely and addresses many current topics of interest in both hydrologic sciences as well as surface earth processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, there is a pre-meeting weekend Graduate Research Seminar on ?Emerging Research Opportunities and Challenges In The Characterization And Simulation Of Geological CO2 Storage?. The discussants will focus on a current topic that poses interesting and important couplings for reaction and transport in the national interest. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
