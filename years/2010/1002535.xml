<AbstractNarration>Amarillo College is producing technicians with the cutting-edge expertise necessary to meet the needs of alternative-energy industries locally and nationwide through integration of the new AAS degree in Solar Energy Technology into its Renewable Energy degree program. Through strong partnerships with current and potential solar industries and labs in the region, Amarillo College, in conjunction with regional secondary and post-secondary institutions, is taking advantage of its strategic location in the Texas Panhandle. This region is located in both the sun and wind corridors of the nation and enjoys an average of 270 days of sunshine each year (16th in the nation), while being noted as the third windiest area nationally. The Solar Energy Technology program focuses on the development of skills necessary for installation, maintenance, and manufacturing of solar energy technology. Through its efforts, Amarillo College is developing a well-trained alternative-energy workforce for which there is a growing demand both regionally and nationwide, while serving as a model for other two-year colleges poised to help meet the burgeoning workforce needs in the emerging industry of solar energy resources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Amarillo College received federal funding from the National Science Foundation for the Advanced Technological Education project:  Solar Energy Technology (SET) . The project goal was to design and structure a solar energy technology AAS &ndash;Associate of Applied Science Degree program that has advanced technology education as its center. The four project goals were to:  (1) Create three courses and the associated labs, and modify and enhance STEM- Science ,Technology, Engineering, &amp; Mathematics courses that will enable Amarillo College to grant a solid Solar Energy Technology option in the Renewable Energy AAS degree. (2) Develop strong partnerships with business and industry, post-secondary institutions, and the area public school systems in solar energy initiatives and articulation agreements. (3) Develop systems to utilize alternative methods of instruction, to offer the curriculum at satellite campuses. (4) Inform the stakeholders about the Solar Energy Technology project- its goals, objectives, and requirement for success- and to provide training and pedagogy for all instructors at all levels of the curriculum.  The three new courses are:  HART 1311- Solar Fundamentals- Study of heat transference,  motors , pumps, and other mechanical devices, solid state switches, photovoltaic plates  and energy conversion, thermal dynamics, and solar energy.  Outcomes: Demonstrate safe and proper work habits, categorize heat capacitance and specific heat values of various materials, categorize heat movement through reflection, absorption, radiation, and magnification, categorize the collection ,control, dissipation, storage and distribution of heat energy, and maintain and repair mechanical equipment.   ELMT 1402- Solar Photovoltaic Systems-  Design and installation of solar photovoltaic systems and their applications.  Outcomes: Design solar photovoltaic arrays, define industry terms, investigate certification requirements, and install and troubleshoot systems.  HART 1393- Special Topics in Solar Technology/Technicians-  Topics address recently identified current events, skill, knowledge, and or attitudes and behavior pertinent to technology or occupation and relevant to the professional development of the student.  Outcomes: Learning outcomes/objectives are determined by local occupational need and business and industry trends.  Project Outcomes:  Amarillo CollegeÆs Solar Energy Technology project was able to meet all objectives stated.  In particular, excellent equipment was obtained to provide hands on lab experiences, appropriate courses which conform to the state of Texas workforce education outline were developed and in place, and numerous visits to public schools, colleges and universities were made to insure outreach and collaboration were emphasized.  The curriculum completion by students not only allows them to seek job opportunities throughout Texas and neighboring states, but allows for transfer to two universities in the area:  Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Tx and West Texas A &amp; M University in Canyon, Tx.  Articulation agreements and collaboration have also been pursued with Clarendon Community College, Frank Phillips Community College both in Texas, and Eastern New Mexico State University in Portales, New Mexico.  Intellectual Merit:  Before the start of Amarillo College's ATE project, there was little progress in the education and training specifically designed for solar energy technicians in the Texas Panhandle region. No surrounding community college or university offers a similar program or training. This project has focused on the development of the required skills for solar energy technology, and Amarillo College has been the first in the area to move into this uncharted territory. Nationally, there is a call for strong efforts in wind and solar energy development. With its new Solar course design, curriculum, and equipment, Amarillo College is helping to meet the goal of preparing a future generatio...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
