<AbstractNarration>Mathematically, the research focuses on interactions between combinatorics, geometry, and algebra.  The projects are centered around specific applications to natural sciences, including evolutionary biology, medical imaging, dynamics of chemical reactions, algorithms and computational complexity, and theoretical high-energy physics.  More specifically, the projects include: (1) algorithms for finding centroids in spaces of phylogenetic trees, and general gradient optimization methods for piecewise differentiable functions on polyhedral spaces, with applications to evolutionary biology and medical imaging, and to computational complexity of convex polyhedral spheres; (2) applications of commutative algebra of binomials to dynamics and stability of mass action kinetics in chemistry; (3) efficient algorithms for combinatorial game theory using connections to commutative algebra, based on techniques involving generating functions; and (4) commutative algebra and algebraic geometry of algebraic varieties, with large group actions, arising in high-energy physics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interactions between modern combinatorics, geometry, and algebra have become increasingly rich in recent years.  This research will explore and deepen these connections at their interfaces with a number of other disciplines, including biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, statistics, and operations research.  The specific mathematical projects focus on computational geometry and optimization; the algebra of polynomials; and smooth geometry in the presence of symmetry.  Despite the range of the proposed intellectual activities in mathematics and its applications, they are drawn together by unifying themes in geometry and algebra.  By supporting personnel (undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers), this project will have substantial positive effects on education through research in the aforementioned areas.  Fostering ties between these areas, among personnel as well as in scientific discovery, is an explicit, central objective.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The intellectual merit of the research lay in its exploration and deepening of interactions between modern combinatorics, geometry, and algebra, in mathematical projects ranging from computational geometry and optimization on spaces composed of flat pieces to algebra and geometry of solutions to highly symmetric polynomial systems of equations, especially decompositions of the solution sets into manageable, understandable pieces.  The mathematical projects resulted in specific applications to natural sciences, including algorithms and computational complexity for combinatorial games, stability theorems for dynamics of chemical reactions, algorithms for averaging phylogenetic trees, and statistical methodology for medical imaging of brain arteries.  The latter two projects involved statistical analysis in contexts where the data objects or sets of data objects are singularly geometric in nature, a theme which this research initiated and developed in abstract mathematical ways.  The broader impact contributions of the project fell under six categories: (i) mentoring undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers, particularly by integrating these activities with specific proposed research projects; (ii) expository work, including lectures and minicourses as well as written books and expository articles; (iii) organizing opportunities for learning and spreading research, such as workshops, summer schools, and conferences; (iv) interdisciplinary activities that enhance connections between mathematics and the sciences; and (v) outreach, including lectures by the PI to audiences composed of high-school teachers or high-school students, organization of a public lecture by a prominent local TV chief meteorologist about conveying uncertainty to the public, subsequent consultation by the PI with the meteorologist and his team about how to present data uncertainty for primetime on-air public consumption, and mass-media publication of an analysis by the PI concerning how to estimate the odds of winning Warren Buffett's $1 billion payout for a perfect NCAA basketball bracket; and finally (vi) participation in development of a university program that prepares middle-school STEM teachers for the challenging Durham Public Schools environment.  By supporting personnel, the requested funds had substantial positive effect on education and outreach through research in combinatorics, geometry, algebra, and their interfaces with a number of scientific disciplines, including biology, medicine, chemistry, computer science, operations research, and statistics.
