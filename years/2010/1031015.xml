<AbstractNarration>The Community Platform for Oceanic and Climate Education, Careers, and Workforce Development is a three-year ITEST strategy project targeting students, parents, and caregivers in Prince George's County, Maryland. The project examines how knowledge of remote sensing data, as well as ocean and climate science influence student interest in and preparation for careers in STEM. The project activities address the four domains that influence career choice: community, school, family, and peer groups. Project partners include Prince George's County Public Schools, U.S. Satellite Laboratories, Jackson State University, Alcorn State University, South Carolina State University, Oregon State University, and NOAA-Cooperative Remote Sensing Science and Technology (CREST) Center at the City College of the City University of New York.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project design is guided by the principles associated with lifelong learning, communities of practice, and connectivity through social networking. As a result of this effort, elementary and middle school students will participate in afterschool year-round SMILE Clubs (Science and Math Investigative Learning Experiences).  A customized home-based curricula will be developed for families with middle school youth, using NOAA's SOS (Signals of Spring), which focuses on ocean literacy and SPRINTT (Student Polar Research with IPY National Teacher Training), which enables families to develop a polar systems research project. Parents and caregivers receive four weeks of training on SOS and SPRINTT on Saturday mornings in the first year of the project before it is implemented in subsequent years. Finally, undergraduates in the Louis Stokes Mississippi Alliances for Minority Participation (LSMAMP) at Jackson State University, NOAA/CREST, and other partner universities act as cybermentors for 10th grade students in year-round science and math clubs. Teacher activities include an online community of learning (with support from NOAA's Climate Service Portal), an annual community forum to discuss the use of cyberinfrastructure as a learning tool, and online mentoring by NASA Endeavor Fellows in the final year of the project. Professional development is provided for teachers who serve as SMILE Club advisors, in addition to weekend seminars and webcasts for math and science teachers that use the home-based curricula. This project is designed to serve 340 students, 36 teachers, and 20 parents and caregivers. The mixed-methods evaluation addresses the following question:  "To what extent and under what conditions do community networks affect student knowledge of remote sensing for ocean and climate literacy and influence their interest in pursuing more education and careers in STEM using this technology?" The evaluation plan includes a logic model, as well as questions and instruments that address each domain in the community platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, the project addresses a range of familial and community factors that impact educational and career trajectories in climate science. The application of a community platform to impact lifelong learning incorporates an innovative approach to teaching and the use of networking technologies. This work may increase the understanding of climate science among students, parents, and teachers, while expanding the field's understanding of effective strategies to engage and sustain student interest in climate science and remote sensing.</AbstractNarration>

Students have increased their knowledge as shown on tests as well as self-report surveys. All the students would recommend their programs to other students.

When students were asked to respond to how the field trip to UMES affected them, they wrote that they gained new ideas and knowledge, learned about college life, and were inspired to become scientists. The Climate Science Academy student video on ocean acidification from Year 1 won 1st place in the 1st Annual KQED Science Youth Media Festival that was held at the California Academy of Sciences.    SIGNIFICANT RESULTS  Developed videos of study interviews with NOAA scientist and posted on YouTube. Parents report their children are more interested in STEM and will continue to pursue STEM. Students have been inspired to become a marine biologist because of the visit to University of Maryland Eastern Shore. Community resources for climate, ocean, and weather have been identified for students and parents.  OUTCOMES As a result of the CSA students and their families together analyzed data.  Parents reported they believe their students would continue with STEM activities such as enrolling in STEM classes in high school.  The parents reported their children now have career path such as being a chemistry teacher, an engineer, a doctor, robotic engineer, and a lawyer. The students have demonstrated an increased knowledge in climate change, melting ice, and sea level rise, the movement of birds, how humans affect the environment, and the decisions humans can make to affect climate change.  The students reported they could teach someone else what they learned using the computer and hands-on activities. MAJOR ACCOMPLISHMENT CyberMentoring - Nineteen high school students conducted studies with eight NOAA scientist on career development and career insights for high school students. Interviews are posted on YouTube.  The STEM Cybermentoring Initiative through the Climate, Ocean and Weather Institute provides high school students with an opportunity to study and interview National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) scientists in varying fields of interest.    Eight science classes from Gwynn Park High School selected to study eight NOAA mentors (one for each class).  The students generated questions for their NOAA mentor and finalized between 6-8 questions that were posted on the mentors' wiki pages.  Two to three students from each of the eight classes participated in a field trip to the NOAA facility in which the studies were conducted and videoed, total 19 students participated to develop cybermentoring studies to reach more than 300 of their peers.  Students posted links to their video interviews for their classes to view.   Click the link below, then click the mentors name and you will be able to link to the video of the mentor studies posted on YouTube.  http://steermentoring.pbworks.com/w/page/77461694/STEER%20CyberMentoring   Website: http://thecowinstitute.us/   Contact Information: sylvia@suitlandonline.us               Last Modified: 09/14/2015       Submitted by: Sylvia L Quinton]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
