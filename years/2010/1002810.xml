<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI focuses on the understanding of fundamental principles of directed assembly of novel highly branched nanostructures: (1) star block copolymers with responsive ionic blocks and (2) highly branched inorganic-organic nanostructures with multiple arm functionalities.  Expanding a traditional set of characterization tools to neutron small angle scattering and neutron reflectivity will allow deeper understanding of the intra- and intermolecular organization of complex macromolecular assemblies at interfaces.  The group will focus on morphology, microstructure, and conformation of fully organic and hybrid organic-inorganic branched nanostructures at different interfaces as a function of chemical composition, external conditions, and surface topology/functionalities:  &lt;br/&gt;-- surface behavior of star block copolymers with emphasis on complex stars with ionic blocks with different molecular architectures on planar and templated surfaces with tailored functionalities and topography under different environmental conditions which vary conformation and composition of responsive ionic blocks;&lt;br/&gt;-- design and the formation of highly branched inorganic-organic polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane nanostructures with different branching and chemical composition of functionalized arms and their assembling behavior at tailored surfaces and interfaces;&lt;br/&gt;-- the understanding of surface behavior and spectral properties of novel "multispectral dots" as inorganic-organic nanostructures with low light scattering and absorption and their directed assembly into nanoengineered materials.&lt;br/&gt;The PI expects that these novel nanostructures assembled onto templated functionalized surfaces with the ability to guide their organization might possess potentially intriguing responsive and spectral properties critical for such fields as chemical sensing and flexible nanocomposites.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An impact of this project is anticipated in both advanced research and higher education.  First, the fundamental understanding will be critical for further progress in applied research and developments of novel organized hybrid nanomaterials with unique physical (optical and surface) properties that are applicable in such diverse fields as energy conversion, colometric and chemical sensors.  Second, advances in student education will be achieved through internationally-enhanced training with emphasis on early involvement in interdisciplinary collaboration with diverse academic and government research labs in US and Europe.  Through this intense collaboration, the research will enable Ph.D. students to become mature scientists familiar with cutting-edge research in nanomaterials.  &lt;br/&gt;The PI will continue his efforts to increase the number of students pursuing advanced degrees in science and engineering by actively working with the President's Undergraduate Research Award and Summer Undergraduate Research Programs at GT.  The PI places continued emphasis on recruiting under-represented students.  One of PI's minority graduate students will be involved as a mentor with GT Center for Education Integrating Science, Math, and Computing (CEISMC) working with minority middle/high school students in Atlanta Public School System helping to prepare minority students for college life.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Branched polyelectrolytes with ionizable functional groups such as cylindrical brushes, dendritic, hyperbranched, grafted, and star architectures possess complex and unique assembly behavior in solution at surfaces and interfaces as compared with their linear counterparts.  In our research, we focus on various architectures and understanding of the assembly behavior.  We report here an approach in which star-shaped organic-inorganic scaffolds bearing eight cyclooctyne moieties can be rapidly functionalized via strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) to synthesize a series of nearly monodisperse branched core-shell nanoparticles with hydrophobic POSS cores and hydrophilic arms.  We established that SPAAC is a robust method for POSS core octafunctionalization with the reaction rate constant of 1.9&times;10-2 M-1s-1.  Functionalization with polyethylene glycol (PEG) azide, fluorescein azide, and unprotected lactose azide, gave conjugates, which represent different classes of compounds: polymer conjugates, bioconjugates, and fluorescent dots.  These resulting hybrid compounds were preliminary tested for their ability to self-assemble in solution and at the air-water interface.  We observed the formation of robust smooth Langmuir monolayers with diverse morphologies.  We found that polar lactose moieties are completely submerged into the subphase whereas the relatively hydrophobic fluorescein arms had extended conformation at the interface, and PEG arms were partially submerged.  Finally, we observed the formation of stable micelles with sizes in aqueous solutions with size and morphology of the structures dependent on the molecular weight and the type of the peripheral hydrophilic moieties.
