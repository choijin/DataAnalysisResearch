<AbstractNarration>This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at Mote Marine Laboratory in Sarasota, FL. The program will support ten students during a ten-week summer research program. The goal of Mote Marine Laboratory?s Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program is to provide research experiences in estuarine science to U.S. college and university undergraduates with special focus on recruiting minority groups underrepresented in science and engineering. Students will be paired with Mote researchers from six research centers and will conduct mentored research projects on one of four major threats to coastal habitats: aquatic pollution, natural toxins, habitat alteration, and coral reef decline. All students enrolled in Mote?s REU Program participate in: 1) laboratory-wide and program-specific orientations; 2) discussion groups on essential career skills in science; 3) research seminars presented by Mote staff and visiting scientists, 3) field trips to other science facilities, and 4) ethics training. All participants will complete a project proposal at the beginning of the program and written and oral reports at the end of their internship.</AbstractNarration>
