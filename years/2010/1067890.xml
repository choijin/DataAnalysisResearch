<AbstractNarration>This award provides support to defray expenses of US participants to visit the Centre de Recerca Matematica (CRM) in Barcelona during the program "The Cuntz Semigroup on the Classification of C*-algebras" which is being held in the period January through July 2011. The vast majority of the award funds will provide the opportunity for young US mathematicians, including graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, to attend significant portions of the CRM program. In particular, the award will support the attendance of these young mathematicians at an advanced course entitled "Dynamical Systems, C*-algebras and Classification," which will be held during June 14-23, 2011. The award is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The classification of C*-algebras via K-theoretic invariants has recently been invigorated by the discovery that the Cuntz semigroup - roughly, a semigroup of isomorphism classes of countably generated Banach modules over a C*-algebra - contains an enormous amount of information. Explicit calculation of this semigroup has led to classification theorems for C*-algebras of minimal dynamical systems, among others. The connections between classification, C*-algebras, and dynamics have been further strengthened by progress on proving the hyperfiniteness of amenable group actions on the Cantor set. Another new front has opened at the interface of descriptive set theory and operator algebras, where the Borel complexity of various equivalence relations (including, naturally, isomorphism) allows one to quantify the complexity of various classification problems in C*-algebra theory. Thus, the Cuntz semigroup and classification problems in C*-algebra theory form an active and rapidly developing branch of functional analysis, one which will afford many research opportunities. The award provides a very good opportunity for young mathematicians with research interests in the area of C*-algebras to be exposed to the latest developments in the field, to interact with researchers from other countries, and to possibly initiate future collaborations. Among other things, this award will contribute to the future vitality of the field, and hopefully lead to further applications and connections with other areas of mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We supported 19 US based researchers to participate in various conferences and graduate level lecture series at the Centre de Recerca Matematica.  Of those fully supported, meaning airfare and local expenses, 5 were graduate students and 7 were junior researchers (postdocs and not yet tenured faculty).  We also had 4 people from traditionally underrepresented groups (2 hispanics, one female and one pacific islander).  The seven senior researchers primarily received travel support and were asked to provide local expenses from other sources.  Several of the senior people gave lectures at one or more of the conferences held at Centre de Recerca Matematica, while four of them gave the graduate level mini-courses intended to bring the junior people to the forefront of research. This vital contribution to the education and research preparation of these future scientists was made possible by this award.  In terms of broader impacts of this award, it was a highly leveraged contribution to the scientific training of some very talented young people.  Indeed, the Centre de Recerca Matematica provided all the administration, including arranging housing for all US participants, and provided some reimbursement for a few US based researchers not covered by this award. The fact that we could support so many people freed up money on their end to invite other researchers, including a large number of European graduate students and postdocs, that otherwise might not have able to come.  This led to a vibrant and exciting research environment where our young people were able to interact scientifically with many European and Asian colleagues that will undoubtedly lead to research collaboration in the future.
