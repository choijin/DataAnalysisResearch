<AbstractNarration>This project, supported by the Biotechnology, Biochemical and Biomass Engineering program, in the CBET division within the Engineering directorate, and the Networks and Regulation Cluster within the MCB division within Biology directorate at NSF, will create new computational tools that can be widely used to enhance the understanding of bacteria that are important in biotechnology and the environment.  Even though a thousand microbial genomes have been sequenced many of these sequenced organisms have not been well characterized experimentally. However, the information in these genome sequences can be used to generate computational models of metabolism and transcriptional regulation. The goals of this project are to use such models to design experiments that improve the understanding of metabolism and regulation in these less characterized organisms. By combining computational and experimental approaches the PI will elucidate the metabolic and transcriptional regulatory networks in two strains of Shewanella (bacteria with environmental and biotechnology applications). The results from this project will be an improved understanding of metabolism and regulation in these bacteria and a collection of computational tools for experimental design and model refinement that can be broadly applied to other sequenced organisms. Undergraduate students will participate in both computational and experimental research activities as part of this project. On-line course materials and pre-conference workshops will be developed related to these research activities to educate undergraduate and graduate students at UW-Madison and other institutions. In addition, workshops and events will be organized for female K-12 and graduate students to learn more about careers in science, engineering and academia.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p> <p>Many less-characterized microbes have important biotechnological, environmental, or health applications, yet we know relatively little about their metabolism and how their metabolism is controlled through regulation. This knowledge is critical if we want to alter their behavior?e.g., to improve chemical production or bioremediation. Computational approaches that facilitate experimental design, data analysis, hypothesis generation, and computational model refinement are needed so that we can rapidly build predictive models of these less-characterized microbes, increase our understanding of their metabolic and regulatory networks, and improve our ability to predict and engineer microbial behavior. This project developed computational models of less-characterized microbes and innovative approaches to (1) design experiments to test metabolic and transcriptional regulatory models and (2) identify model changes needed to reduce the number of inconsistencies between model predictions and experimental data. The approaches generated by this project will lead to more complete and accurate models for a number of different microbes and enhance the use of microbes in a variety of applications.</p> <p>This project developed metabolic and thermodynamic models for strains of <em>Shewanella, Syntrophobacter, </em>and <em>Methanospirillum </em>? microbes with bioremediation and/or biotechnology applications. We built models for different <em>Shewanella</em> strains and identified conserved and variable metabolic capabilities across the genus (Figure 1). We constructed thermodynamic metabolic models of <em>Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans </em>and <em>Methanospirillum hungatei</em> to investigate how thermodynamics constrains the metabolic behavior of these microbes in mono- and co-cultures.<em> </em>We developed computational algorithms to design conditions where a reaction (Figure 2) or metabolite is essential for growth, which were then used to identify new metabolic functions for genes in an organism (Figure 3). We developed approaches for analyzing gene essentiality data to infer essential biomass components (Figure 4) and metabolite concentration ratios. We also developed algorithms to consider multiple criteria for metabolic engineering strain design and to trace active or high-flux paths through metabolic networks. This pathtracing approach was subsequently used to identify common precursors of different commercial chemical products. We also developed new approaches to build models of transcriptional regulatory networks from experimental date, to integrate metabolic and transcriptional regulatory models, and to design growth phenotyping experiments where different models made different predictions. We published reviews on building metabolic models and using them to analyze experimental data or predict experimental outcomes.</p> <p>Since the computational tools we developed can be generally applied to metabolic and/or regulatory models derived from genomic data, they will help a wide variety of researchers interested in studying pathogenic, environmental, and industrial microbes. As such, this research will impact a wide range of fields where models can be used to analyze data and study or engineer microbial behavior, including metabolic engineering, microbiology, biotechnology, evolutionary biology, symbiosis, pathogenesis, drug development, and systems biology.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Broader Impact</strong></p> <p>The development of experimental design methods to test and refine models will lead to more accurate models which will impact a variety of disciplines that utilize them. These models can be used in a wide variety of applications to identify strategies for improving chemical production (e.g., biofuels and lycopene), to find strategies for improving bioremediation, and to evaluate host-pathogen interactions and identify new drug targets. All developed models and algorithms were made openly available (via publications and our website) to be used by the greater scientific community. Our research results have been disseminated through 13 publications to date, conference presentations, seminars at universities and companies, and a patent application.</p> <p>This project supported the education, training and research activities of five graduate students. Students were educated and trained in microbiology, optimization, and metabolic modeling through classes and workshops at UW-Madison. They co-taught modeling workshops offered at UW-Madison to other students and post-docs on campus and at scientific meetings to researchers off campus. In addition, we worked with seven undergraduate students through different NSF funded summer research programs. Many of the undergraduate students were from under-represented groups in engineering, including women and minorities. We taught the students how to build and simulate metabolic models, use models to design microbes with desirable phenotypes, grow bacteria, genetically modify bacteria, and clone genes into plasmids to control expression. Three of the undergraduate students also did outreach with the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America. The graduate students worked closely with the undergraduate students to further develop their teaching and mentoring skills.</p> <p>In addition to training students in my research group, I have recorded lectures and demonstrations on metabolic modeling. I have also given research seminars to undergraduate students through the Wisconsin Energy Institute and NSF funded Research Experiences for Undergraduates programs, and the general public through the Wisconsin Alumni Association?s ?Badger Cafe? and ?Wednesday Nite @ the Lab? (broadcasted on Wisconsin Public Television). To further engage female students in engineering, I have participated in events organized by Society of Women Engineers and the UW College of Engineering.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/03/2019<br>      Modified by: Jennifer&nbsp;L&nbsp;Reed</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1053712/1053712_10070502_1549208370201_NSFOutcomesFigure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1053712/1053712_10070502_1549208370201_NSFOutcomesFigure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1053712/1053712_10070502_1549208370201_NSFOutcomesFigure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Various FOCAL Statistics for Genome-Scale Models</div> <div class="imageCredit">Tervo CJ and JL Reed.
