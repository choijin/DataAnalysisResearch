<AbstractNarration>Technical: This project aims to advance the understanding and control of the properties of direct band gap semiconductor ZnGeN2 and related compounds. These materials are structurally related to GaN, InN and AlN, and share some of their properties, such as band gaps that span the wavelength range from the ultraviolet to the near infrared. Theories have predicted some distinctly different properties, in particular their doping and defect properties, nonlinear optical properties, and lower ionicities. These important differences motivate interest in studying ZnGeN2 and related materials, to both expand our fundamental understanding of materials and to explore their potential for applications to optoelectronics that would take advantage of their unique properties. The project develops new growth methods for these materials and explores their thermodynamic properties. Investigations of the linear optical properties allow comparison of experimental results with recent predictions of the electronic band structure and phonon spectra. Investigation of the transport, optical and structural properties aids in the identification of native and non-native defects of the unintentionally doped material, a first step toward control of the transport properties for optoelectronic applications.&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. It should benefit society in expanding the knowledge base for exploration of new materials of potential interest in the development of new technologies. The research is of broad interest to the condensed matter physics and materials science communities and promotes the education and training of graduate and undergraduate researchers. The participation of undergraduate researchers will be particularly strong, involving students from Case Western Reserve University and John Carroll University. Focused efforts will be made to recruit underrepresented minority students. Research results will be broadly disseminated through scientific publication and participation in conferences and public lectures.</AbstractNarration>
