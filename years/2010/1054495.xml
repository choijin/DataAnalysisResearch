<AbstractNarration>Geometric objects called lattices have had countless essential applications in mathematics and the sciences.  Recently, they have emerged as a new and very appealing foundation for cryptography, offering asymptotic efficiency, worst-case hardness guarantees, and apparent resistance to quantum computers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is dedicated to a broad study of lattices in cryptography and related areas.  Specifically, it addresses three main directions: (i) a foundational investigation into the worst-case and average-case complexity of lattice problems, and connections with number-theoretic problems such as factoring; (ii) constructions of essential cryptographic notions such as proof systems and pseudorandom objects; (iii) the design of efficient, practical algorithms supporting fast implementations of lattice-based schemes.  Results from this project may one day lead to wide adoption of faster and more secure cryptography in a wide variety of computing and networking applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;At the heart of any cryptographic protocol are assumptions about the scheme's operating environment and the attacker's interactions with it --- but more fundamentally, about the amount of computing resources required to break it.  The past few decades have seen tremendous success in using an area of mathematics called "number theory" to build cryptography that provides rich functionality while withstanding very strong attempts at breaking the schemes.  For instance, today's widely used cryptosystems are believed to be secure for hundreds of years, even when attacked by the most powerful computers ever designed.  However, this security comes at a price: the systems are not especially efficient on today's (or tomorrow's) computing platforms.  A further worry is that "quantum computers" can, in principle, completely break many of today's most widely used cryptosystems.  While quantum computers have so far only been demonstrated at very small scales, their long-term possibility necessitates new approaches in cryptography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometric objects called "lattices" have recently emerged as an entirely different, and very attractive, mathematical foundation for cryptography.  Lattice-based schemes offer significant utility and efficiency, especially on highly parallel machines, and appear to be secure even in the face of quantum attacks.  Due to their novelty, however, many basic questions are unanswered or entirely unexplored. This project conducts a broad study of lattices in cryptography, ranging from a foundational investigation of their hard problems and connections to other number-theoretic problems, to new designs of essential cryptographic objects and studies of their concrete efficiency and security.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has yielded major advances in the foundations, applicability, efficiency, and implementation of cryptography based on lattices. Such cryptosystems can offer many advantages over today's commonly used ones, including apparent security against attacks by quantum computers, high speed and parallelism, and rich functionality like computing "blindly" on encrypted data. The project has advanced this field across its spectrum, from the theoretical foundations of its security; to significant efficiency improvements; to lattice-based realizations---some the first of their kinds---of important cryptographic objects; to software for more easily implementing rich and complex lattice cryptosystems.  A small selection of the project's intellectual contributions are as follows:  It introduced the Ring-LWE problem, gave strong theoretical evidence for its security based on algebraic lattices, and used Ring-LWE as the foundation for several kinds of very efficient and/or functional cryptosystems. It gave the first non-generic construction of pseudorandom functions (PRFs), a central tool in cryptography, from lattices. Subsequently, it constructed various kinds of rich constrained PRFs, a powerful tool whose only known realizations (for such rich constraint classes) are based on lattices. This line of work also introduced the Learning With Rounding problem, which has been the subject of much further study and other applications. It gave a new, much faster and more error-tolerant method for bootstrapping, a central operation in computing on encrypted data (i.e., Fully Homomorphic Encryption). The ideas from this work were built upon to eventually bring the cost of bootstrapping to less than 1/10th of a second. It developed a modular, extensible, open-source software framework for more easily and succinctly implementing a wide variety of lattice-based cryptosystems and encrypted-data computations.   The project also has had significant broader impacts on education and the use of lattice cryptography in practice and on the Internet. On the educational side, the PI developed a new graduate-level course on Lattices in Cryptography, and wrote a widely used monograph that covers both the modern foundations and many recent developments in lattice-based cryptography, to help graduate students and advanced undergraduates get started in the area.
