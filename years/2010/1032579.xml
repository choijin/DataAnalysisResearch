<AbstractNarration>1032579&lt;br/&gt;Decho&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;A major determinant in enhanced antibiotic resistance of hospital-acquired (i.e. nosocomial) infections, and implant-device associated infections is the embedding of bacteria in extracellular polymers (EPS). This proposal seeks to fabricate novel nanoparticles capable of killing bacteria in biofilms via antibiotics, quorum sensing quenchers, and quorum sensing disruptors conjugated to the nanoparticles.  The mutlifunctionalized nanoparticle strategy of penetrating, analyzing and destroying highly resistant bacteria embedded in a protective EPS, is conceptually simple, but involves complex chemistry using CLICK chemistry for efficient synthesis and RAFT methodology for massive functionalization on each nanoparticle.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;A strength of this proposal is the multidisciplinary linkage of nanochemistry with biofilm microbiology research and its applicability to a range of biofilm problems. The applicant proposes a 4-phased outreach plan, which includes outreach activities in elementary school, development of an instructional video for middle school, multiple lectures in the two graduate-level course and recruitment of minorities to the research group.</AbstractNarration>

This issue, although health-related, addresses the fundamental biology of bacteria and how they resist antibiotics.   A basic research project was conducted to investigate the potential capabilities of nanoparticles as antibiotic delivery vehicles (ADVs) against infection causing bacteria. Nanoparticles are ultra-small particles, approximately 1-100 nanometers (nm) in diameter.  Owing to their very small sizes, nanoparticles often possess unique physical and/or chemical properties.

This formed the basis of our research.     In this work, silica nanoparticles, approximately 15 nm in diameter, were engineered with either surface carboxylic acid groups, or having elongated RAFT molecules with attched carboxyl groups that extended from the surfaces of the nanoparticles.

In more practical terms, the results of this study offer the likely possibility that nanoparticles can be used to overcome antibiotic-resistant bacteria u...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
