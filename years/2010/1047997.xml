<AbstractNarration>This award is part of the Software Infrastructure for Sustained Innovation. The Office of Cyberinfrastructure, the Division of Computer and Network Systems, and the Division of Materials Research contribute funds to this award. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing large computational codes such as those used to perform simulations in quantum  mechanics to calculate properties of materials, or to predict the  aerodynamics forces around airplanes, still typically require several human-years.  However the pace of research and industrial product development demands much more rapid software tool development to make progress and to remain competitive. This award contributes to developing the capability to rapidly create high performance large scale codes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will augment a computer programming language with a very high level language that is interactive in the sense that the developer will enter language commands and get instantaneous interpreted answers, instead of  processing the whole code.  This approach of creating an interactive extensible language framework will provide a way to help speed development of large scale computer software.  Efforts will be specifically targeted at software for materials science applications. This will enable progress in large scale computational research that aims to predict properties of materials starting from a knowledge of the constituent atoms and the way they are arranged in the material. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award contributes to the education of knowledgeable specialists capable of developing large and complex computational codes.  The PIs will design new graduate level courses outside of the current curriculum to increase the number of students who receive training in effective development of software for materials research and scientific computing in general. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award also supports the research team's efforts to broaden participation of underrepresented groups through the existing Alice in Wonderland Program, which aims to recruit members of underrepresented groups at the high school level, and to attract female high school students to science and engineering by  involving them in research over the summer before they make decisions  about colleges. They will also revive the Summer Undergraduate Interns program to recruit undergraduate students interested in high performance computing for summer internships.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[A major issue within large scale computational research is the sluggish pace in which scientific software is developed. Three decades of improvement in hardware have yielded a gain of at least six orders of magnitude in speed (per MooreÆs Law), while developing large codes such as those in research areas focusing on the electronic structure of materials or fluid dynamics, still typically requires years of concerted effort. Meanwhile, the current wave of multidisciplinary efforts is creating an acute need to build effective large scale scientific software. This unprecedented demand for new scientific simulations on the one hand and the inadequacy of existing methodologies on the other, is likely to lead to a significant software "crisis." This situation is aggravated by the growing scarcity of knowledgeable specialists capable of developing large computational codes.  Work within this grant addressed this problem by formulating an interactive extensible language framework and development environment that contains new high-level language constructs that will help speed code development. The work targeted the rapid development of software for materials science applications, via a combination of interactive tools, a high-level extensible language, and feedback tools for fine-tuning the produced codes. The framework included constructs to help with high-performance parallel programming. Though the high-level language study is specific to applications in materials science, this work should make an impact broadly in the general area of computational sciences.  The investigating team consisted of  specialists within computational materials science, algorithms, and programming languages. In the long run, the effort developed, should stimulate a more disciplined and efficient approach to code development in the computational sciences and lead to an introspection in the field on how to improve scientific software development methodologies.  Over a dozen publications were produced outlining progress made in formulating extensible language frameworks and in developing new approaches to materials science applications.  In particular, a textbook was produced allowing the testing of these algorithms using simplified numerical approaches for predicting the physical properties of targeted applications, including molecules and crystals at the nanoscale.  Broader impact activities within this grant attracted underrepresented groups, reaffirmed educational components and maintained contacts to the private sector.  A notable effort centered on the "Alice in Wonderland Program," which was developed at the University of Texas.  This teaching activity recruited members of underrepresented groups at the high school level to participate in our materials research activities. The goal of this program was to attract female high school students to physics, materials science or chemical engineering by involving them in research over the summer before they make decisions about colleges. The interns attended a short course given at the start of the program by graduate students and worked in research labs under the mentorship of senior scientists.  Workers under this grant, also developed new courses, outside of the current curriculum, to address the lack of computational specialists in multidiscipline fields.
