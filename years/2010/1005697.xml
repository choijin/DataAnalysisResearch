<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; We propose to construct a multi-scale, multidisciplinary ocean observing system that will provide a permanent presence in the ocean, with unprecedented power and interactive capability for advanced sensors and platforms, and real-time access to data and advanced visualization tools. The Ocean Observing Initiative (OOI) will transform ocean research and education by establishing an open, integrated, networked observing system that will enable next-generation research, discovery, education, and public engagement on a range of topics as broad as climate variability and ocean ecosystems, turbulent mixing, plate tectonics, and sub-seafloor biogeochemistry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OOI will enable multiple scales of marine observations to be integrated into one observing system via common design elements and an overarching, interactive cyberinfrastructure. The Consortium for Ocean Leadership will coordinate and manage the construction of the OOI, with subawards to the Implementing Organizations for the Coastal/Global Scale Nodes, the Regional Scale Nodes, Cyberinfrastructure, and Education and Public Engagement. The coastal-scale assets of the OOI will expand existing observations off both U.S. coasts, creating focused, configurable observing regions. Regional cabled observing platforms will ?wire? a single region in the Northeast Pacific Ocean with a high speed optical and power grid. The global component addresses planetary-scale changes via moored open-ocean buoys linked to shore via satellite. A unifying cyberinfrastructure will link all the components of the system, and permit researchers to control sampling strategies of experiments deployed on one part of the system in response to remote detection of events by other parts of the system. The whole of OOI allows scientists and citizens to view phenomena irrespective of the observations' sources (e.g., coastal, global, regional, ships, satellites, IOOS). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The OOI will address the Broader Impacts aspects of NSF research by implementing an Education and Public Engagement (EPE) component to address informatl learning and post-secondary education. This science education component will take advantage of the Internet, using Internet resources and the wide range of information and services that can be accessed online. The OOI EPE component will focus on ?free choice? learning in a variety of physical and virtual settings. In addition, the EPE component will support online post-secondary career, technical and educator training programs, with a focus on increasing participation and diversity in ocean science.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) is an MREFC (Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction) project funded by the National Science Foundation.  The project was awarded to The Consortium for Ocean Leadership, and executed in cooperation with major sub-awardees at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, University of Washington, Oregon State University and Rutgers University.         The OOI is composed of science-driven platforms and sensor systems that measure physical, chemical, geological and biological properties and processes of the ocean from the seafloor to the air-sea interface.           The OOI network was designed to address critical science-driven questions that will lead to a better understanding and management of our oceans, enhancing our capabilities to address critical issues. Greater knowledge of the oceanÆs interrelated systems is vital for increased understanding of their effects on biodiversity, ocean and coastal ecosystems, ecosystem health and climate change. The OOI puts ocean observing data in the hands of a vast user community of oceanographers, scientists and researchers, educators, students and the public.         The OOI consists of seven arrays located across the North and South Atlantic and Pacific, including one cabled, two coastal, and four global arrays. The OOI marine instrumented infrastructure includes 41 moorings, 20 seafloor packages, 32 buoyancy-driven gliders, and 2 propeller-driven Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs).  Over 800 instruments representing 75 models of specialized instrumentation including seafloor HD video and still images from some locations are distributed across this infrastructure and produce more than 40,000 unique streams of data.           Data from the OOI marine infrastructure are streamed in near-real time through fiber-optic cables and broadband satellite to operation centers and then transferred to the OOI Cyberinfrastructure (CI) for processing, storage, and dissemination. All OOI core data are freely accessible to the public, scientists, and educators to download.         OOI data are downloaded and displayed through the OOI system software (OOINet), to connect and enable the coordination of operations of the OOI marine components (Global, Coastal, and Cabled Arrays) with the scientific and educational pursuits of oceanographic research communities.  The OOINet online interface permit 24/7 connectivity and brings sustained ocean observing data to a user at any time, any place, on any computer or mobile device. Anyone with an Internet connection can create a login on OOINet and access OOI data.    OOINet allows users to visualize data through an interactive plotting tool, while also being able to asynchronously download datasets in various formats. Data are searchable through OOINet via an interactive map or by searching individual instruments or data products. Images and video can also be downloaded through this interface. In addition to displaying current near-real time data, OOINet provides an historical archive of all OOI data.         OOI online tools were also created to support the creation and sharing of educational resources utilizing OOI data by undergraduate faculty at universities and community colleges.  Software tools developed for undergraduate teaching using OOI data support students in developing evidence and reasoning skills.  By incorporating this framework of claims evidence, and reasoning for scientific explanation into online exercises, instructional strategies, and assessments, the OOI seeks to build studentsÆ conceptual understanding and improve their ability to think and communicate more scientifically.         Educational tools include the following: (1) Visualization Tools allow students to explore and analyze real-time or archived ocean data from the OOI. (2) Concept Maps help students illustrate how ocean data and findings are tied to what they are learning in the classroom. (3) The Vocabulary Navigator allows stude...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
