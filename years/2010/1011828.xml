<AbstractNarration>As the amount and complexity of the data increase and as the questions being addressed become more sophisticated, bioinformatics and computational biology researches have been formed which integrate expertise in computer science, mathematics, statistics, and biochemistry into the biological and biomedical researches. Bioinformatics and computational biology cover a broad range of research topics from genomic, proteomic and molecular biology data analysis to tissue engineering, cell engineering, medical image analysis and biological and medical devices.  The increasingly wide use of digital and high-throughput technology has enabled&lt;br/&gt;biological and biomedical researchers to generate massive amounts of data from laboratory&lt;br/&gt;experiments, survey data, health records and a wide array of biomarkers. In addition, the availability of public genomic databases and the associated analysis on comprehending sequences and annotations, protein-protein interaction data, protein structures and domain information has increased the need for the development of new approaches in computer science to inform new computational tools and methodologies directed towards integration and extraction.  The 2010 ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics and Computational&lt;br/&gt;Biology (ACM-BCB 2010) is the first ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) conference in&lt;br/&gt;the areas of bioinformatics, computational biology, and biomedical research. It marks the start of ACM?s efforts to better support the bioinformatics and computational biology community. The conference is scheduled to be held at Niagara Falls Conference center, in Niagara Falls, New York.  The best student paper awards will be an excellent means to promote graduate students? involvement with cutting-edge computer science research. In addition, through  the ACM-BCB conference, ACM hopes to build the bioinformatics and computational biology community and establish an ACM Special Interest Group in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (SIGBio). A community meeting will be held during the ACM-BCB2010 conference at Niagara Falls to assess and develop the support for forming the ACM SIGBio, further helping to insure the active participation of computer science in this multidisciplinary area.</AbstractNarration>
