<AbstractNarration>Hydrofracture events associated with lake drainages in Greenland create surface-to-bed conduits through which surface melt reaches the bed at rates ranging from that of summer-long melt-stream discharge to that of large, transient pulses during sudden lake drainages. While recent work suggests that enhanced seasonal lubrication may have less of a destabilizing effect on the Greenland Ice Sheet than once feared, the interaction between surface melt and ice flow remains poorly constrained and its influence is not well represented in current ice-sheet models. This project aims to contribute toward improving future sea-level rise assessments by achieving a firm, physically based understanding of ice-sheet hydrofracture, and by characterizing the influence of surface melt on ice-sheet flow over seasonal and inter-annual time scales. Acquisition of this knowledge is an important step toward integrating the influence of increased surface melt in model-derived sea level projections. The investigators will use an experimental design of integrated ground- and satellite-based observations coupled to numerical models to determine the processes that govern hydrofracturing and use this understanding to determine whether the area of the Greenland Ice Sheet?s bed exposed to surface meltwater will increase substantially in a warming climate. The results of this research will be disseminated to the public through extensive ongoing efforts of these investigators including K-12 activities and public lectures. The direct involvement of a photographer-writer team will also bring a local dimension to understanding and communicating the impact of climate change on Greenland communities. Our results will also be of immediate interest to scientists working to understand past and future changes to the Greenland Ice Sheet, including theoretical and modeling studies. This project will also include direct graduate student involvement in field and research activities at both WHOI and UW.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was a collaborative effort between investigators at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the University of Washington, who are submitting one unified report.  Each summer in Greenland, melt water pools in thousands of large lakes on the surface of the ice sheet. The melt water often is able to breach the thick underlying ice (several thousand feet thick), causing the lakes to drain rapidly (in a matter of hours) through narrow but deep cracks to base of the ice sheet.

This project was aimed at better understanding the processes that cause lakes to drain and to understand how lake drainage might extend to higher elevations in a warmer climate.  Water is denser than ice, so as water from summer melting fills the many cracks and crevices on the surface of the ice sheet, the water pressure in the crack tip (greater than the pressure from the surrounding ice) causes the crack to deepen as long as water more water is available to fill in from above. This water-driving "wedging" process is called hydro-fracturing, and it is natureÆs analog to the "fracking" processes now widely used in the petroleum industry. Because the ice sheet is so thick (over half a mile in many places), a large volume of water is needed to drive a crack open all the way through to the bottom. Lakes on the surface of the ice sheet provide just such a reservoir, and thus they play a crucial role in hydro-fracturing to the bed and ultimately in increasing summer flow speeds.

These streams then  transport the water over distances of 10s of miles before intersecting existing hydro-fracture sites at lower elevations where the melt water eventually drains to the bed.  As a result, on short time-scales warmer temperatures are not likely to lubricate much greater areas beneath the ice sheet as had been feared.  The overall finding of this and a prior related study is that lake-driven hydro-fracture and the resulting lubrication of the bed are not likely to destabilize the ice sheet drastically as temperatures rise. While this result is comforting to those affected by sea level, this process only represents one way th...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
