<AbstractNarration>Active galaxies (AGN) harbor a super-massive black hole at their core surrounded by an accretion disk. Little is known about the interaction between the accretion disk and the black hole, an interaction that produces powerful beamed jets of highly-energetic particles and radiation. The spectrum of this radiation is a strong indicator of the acceleration mechanisms involved. VERITAS, the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System, located in Southern Arizona at the Whipple Observatory Base camp, is an array of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes designed to detect very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays (100 GeV - 50 TeV) that shower in the earth's atmosphere. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While the direct-detection of dark matter has not yet been achieved, indirect detection efforts involve searching for VHE gamma-rays. Dwarf galaxies and globular clusters are believed to be good candidates for dark matter because the virial velocities of the star populations within them exceed what is expected from the luminous matter and in fact give an indirect measure of the dark matter present. They are ideal for VHE gamma-ray searches because they are nearby and have no known VHE emitters within their cores. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will bring astrophysics experiences to Cal Poly. The goals of the proposed analysis effort are to improve the VERITAS gamma-ray detection algorithms and to use the improved sensitivity to study the acceleration mechanisms in AGN and to search for dark matter.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RUI grant will bring year-round research opportunities to two students. Undergraduate students will be given broad exposure to the science while working on a focused and tractable research project suitable for a senior thesis.  Cal Poly is also one of the leading producers of high-school physics teachers in the state. The STAR program is an excellent venue for working with teachers to develop teaching supplements that can be used in 6th and 8th grade curricula where Science and Astronomy are taught.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The VERITAS collaboration has detected more than 42 very-high energy (VHE) gamma-ray sources with the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array, located at the Whipple Observatory in Southern Arizona.  Of note in the list of blazar detections is 1ES1440+122 [1, 2] which was the first Blazar discovered with the HFit algorithm [3] developed by the PI through this grant.  Blazar 1ES1741+196 which was discovered to be a TeV emitter by MAGIC was also detected by VERITAS using the HFit algorithm [4].  Our multi-wavelength analysis of the spectrum suggests that it belongs to a relatively new class of object, the extreme-high-frequency peaked BL Lacertae (extreme-HBL).  In addition to the discovery and detection of blazars, the HFit algorithm is also used to search for Dark Matter [5].  This is because it significantly reduces bias in the backgrounds thereby improving our understanding of the images used to search for Dark Matter.   The primary goals of this project were to improve VERITAS gamma-ray detection algorithms and to use the improved algorithms to study the acceleration mechanisms of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and dark matter while bringing astrophysics experiences to Cal Poly undergraduate students.  Active galaxies are believed to be powered by a supermassive black hole located at the center of many galaxies.  The primary physical features are a disk of stellar material that is accreting onto the black hole and a jet of very energetic particles emitted near the black hole?s event horizon that is directed perpendicular to the accretion disk. AGN are classified as Blazars when the jet of high-energy particles is oriented such that it points toward our telescopes on earth.  The key to understanding the physical mechanisms close to the black hole is to measure the energy spectrum of the blazars.  We also search for VHE emissions from dwarf galaxies that are relatively nearby, have a very high dark matter content, and few or no other sources of VHE gamma-rays.  Our hope is to detect the extremely rare decay or interaction of dark matter particles which make up about 25% of the universe but have so far eluded direct detection.  We undertook a variety of projects that were scientifically productive and positively impacted the broader community. The broader impacts of this work include the educational development of undergraduates and community outreach.  Students have been involved in the project at all levels, from development of the computational algorithms to the analysis of blazars and the effect of the Extra-Galactic Background Light on the blazar spectrum.  They have even contributed to publications. Cal Poly is an undergraduate institution, and the experience of working side by side in the field with professional physicists is an important part of our student?s career development.  Undergraduate students and the PI have participated in professional conferences, collaboration meetings, working meetings with collaborators at UC Santa Cruz, and observing shifts at VERITAS.  In addition, the PI gave several public talks and served on the VERITAS Science Board as the representative for the VERITAS Associate Members.     References    1.
