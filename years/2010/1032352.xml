<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Funds were requested to support U.S. participation in the International Polar Year (IPY) Oslo Science Conference, which was held in June 2010. The scientific program comprised six themes:  Theme 1: Linkages between Polar Regions and global systems  We cannot fully understand processes and changes in the Polar Regions just by studying the Arctic and Antarctic separately. This theme will focus on how closely related both the Arctic and Antarctic are to the rest of the global system.  Theme 2: Past, present, and future changes in Polar Regions  Polar Regions experience and record past environmental and climatic changes. Reconstructions and observations of polar changes and understanding of the processes at play are crucial for projecting future evolutions.  Theme 3: Polar ecosystems and biodiversity  Polar ecosystems span a vast range of contrasting environments from open ocean to multi-year sea ice and from dry lakes to glaciers. This theme includes the full range of microbial, invertebrate, plant, fish, avian and mammalian species interacting with their polar environments.  Theme 4: Human dimensions of change: health, society, and resources  IPY 2007&ndash;2008 was the first International Polar Year with a designated field for the social sciences and humanities. This theme presents the rich legacy of the array of research that has been undertaken across fields such as culture, history, economics, human and social development, governance, heritage, health, and adaptation to change.  Theme 5: New frontiers, data practices, and directions in polar research  The Polar Regions evoke a sense of discovery. This theme highlights research that challenges current thinking. Topics include ecology, evolution, and biodiversity; satellite and in situ observing networks; integration of the physical, life, and social sciences; exploration of subglacial aquatic environments; and utilization of next generation technologies.  Theme 6: Polar science education, outreach, and communication  The success of this IPY derives in part from the close connection between science and outreach. This theme presents the many IPY education and outreach activities initiated by educators, journalists, media professionals, and researchers, often in unique partnerships.     This conference served as the first opportunity after completion of IPY field activities for direct interaction among all IPY projects, and it stimulated further interdisciplinary collaboration in polar research and outreach. This conference demonstrated the strengths of these new linkages, the positive impacts of connecting science and outreach during IPY, and the valuable inclusion of additional nations and partnerships.  The IPY Oslo Science Conference demonstrated IPY's remarkable accomplishments in science and outreach. It represented an essential opportunity to display and explore the full breadth and implications of IPY activities. It highlighted the extraordinary interdisciplinary and multinational efforts in research and in communication of research to the public.  The conference demonstrated the benefits of open data sharing and the prospects for future discoveries based on the data collected. It provided a timely forum for demonstrations and discussions of wider aspects of the IPY legacy, including future polar research. Presentations of IPY activities in education, outreach, and communication were well attended.    International PolarTEACHERS Conference  "How to use polar science in your classroom" Oslo, June 6-7, 2010   On June 6&ndash;7, 2010, 114 teachers from twenty countries came together at the Oslo Science Conference for a Polar Teachers Workshop. The educators attended polar science presentations and participated in activities related to the topics presented by scientists. Some of the teachers gave oral or poster presentations at the Education Outreach and Communications sessions. Educators were paired with early career scientists for collaboration and discussion during the c...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
