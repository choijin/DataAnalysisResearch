<AbstractNarration>Labate, DMS-1008900&lt;br/&gt;Guo, DMS-1008907&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Following the spectacular success of wavelets in signal and&lt;br/&gt;image processing, several attempts have been made to adapt their&lt;br/&gt;optimal efficiency from the one- to the multi-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;setting.  In fact, in spite of their remarkable properties,&lt;br/&gt;wavelets are not very efficient in capturing the intrinsic&lt;br/&gt;geometry of multidimensional phenomena.  In recent years,&lt;br/&gt;directional multiscale methods such as the shearlet&lt;br/&gt;representation, introduced by the investigators and their&lt;br/&gt;collaborators, have emerged as the most effective extension of&lt;br/&gt;the wavelet framework to the multidimensional setting.  Indeed,&lt;br/&gt;the shearlet representation encompasses the mathematical theory&lt;br/&gt;of affine systems and, to date, is the only method able to&lt;br/&gt;combine optimal sparsity and fast transforms through the power of&lt;br/&gt;multiresolution analysis.  The proposed research focuses on&lt;br/&gt;applications of the shearlet approach to a number of challenging&lt;br/&gt;problems of analysis and processing of multidimensional data. &lt;br/&gt;First, the shearlet representation is applied to provide a&lt;br/&gt;precise geometric characterization of the discontinuities of&lt;br/&gt;multivariate functions and distributions.  Combining techniques&lt;br/&gt;from harmonic analysis and differential geometry, this provides&lt;br/&gt;the groundwork for the development of improved algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;edge detection and feature extraction.  Second, the shearlet&lt;br/&gt;framework is applied to develop a new generation of methods for&lt;br/&gt;the regularized inversion of ill-posed problems.  Building on the&lt;br/&gt;ability of shearlets to provide sparse representations of Fourier&lt;br/&gt;integral operators, efficient decompositions for the Radon and&lt;br/&gt;Ray transforms are computed.  These are used to develop&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for the Radon inversion from local and incomplete data&lt;br/&gt;and for image deconvolution.  Third, a novel mathematical and&lt;br/&gt;computational approach for viewpoint-invariant texture retrieval&lt;br/&gt;is introduced.  This is achieved by jointly designing a framework&lt;br/&gt;for feature extraction and similarity measurement in an&lt;br/&gt;appropriate statistical setting, and relies on the unique ability&lt;br/&gt;of shearlets to capture local geometric information. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Over the past several years, there has been a continuously&lt;br/&gt;increasing pressure to handle more efficiently the ever larger&lt;br/&gt;and higher dimensional data sets generated from a wide range&lt;br/&gt;applications such as electronic surveillance, remote sensing, and&lt;br/&gt;medical imaging.  The challenge is to rapidly, accurately and&lt;br/&gt;reliably extract the relevant information, so that it can be&lt;br/&gt;efficiently processed, transmitted and stored.  The project&lt;br/&gt;focuses on the applications of the shearlet representation -- a&lt;br/&gt;method introduced by the investigators and their collaborators&lt;br/&gt;that provides a unique combination of optimal sparsity and&lt;br/&gt;computational efficiency, within an innovative mathematical and&lt;br/&gt;computational framework.  The notion of optimal sparsity, in&lt;br/&gt;particular, implies that this approach has the ability to very&lt;br/&gt;effectively and reliably identify the most relevant features&lt;br/&gt;contained in the data.  Specifically, this project leads to&lt;br/&gt;advanced techniques for edge detection, feature extraction, and&lt;br/&gt;texture retrieval from medical, industrial and satellite imagery. &lt;br/&gt;This results in innovative and improved computational algorithms&lt;br/&gt;for the analysis and processing of high-dimensional data and&lt;br/&gt;facilitates technological advances in sensitive applications such&lt;br/&gt;as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, data classification and&lt;br/&gt;electronic surveillance.</AbstractNarration>
