<AbstractNarration>Technical: This project aims for greater understanding of semiconductor surface morphology evolution during low energy ion bombardment. The approach is to investigate the effect of seed atoms on nanostructure growth during ion bombardment to identify elementary mechanisms causing self-assembled nanostructure formation. To elucidate the physical processes active, synchrotron-based x-ray techniques along with wafer-curvature stress measurements, atomic force microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and cross section transmission electron microscopy will be used to provide detailed information about the structure and chemical composition of the nanostructured surface. Emphasis will be placed on developing quantitative models to predict the dependence of nanostructure growth morphologies and kinetics on the seeding conditions. &lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with technological relevance in electronics and photonics. An improved understanding of the surface processes active during ion bombardment could impact sputter etching, sputter deposition, ion beam assisted deposition and plasma processing. The seeding approach examined in this project may allow the control of nanostructure semiconductor surfaces in a straightforward, inexpensive manner. The project is interdisciplinary, providing graduate, undergraduate and high school students with advantageous opportunities to do research that bridges basic research and application, and research across traditional fields of materials science, chemistry, physics, and engineering. In addition to experiencing, and contributing to an important topic centered in forefront materials research, they will learn basic skills required in the use of a wide range of materials characterization tools. Students will interact with a growing materials research community at Boston University and the graduate student will also have an excellent opportunity to participate in the multi-disciplinary synchrotron research environment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In many processes of technological interest energetic atoms or ions bombard the surface of a material.  This happens, for instance, during processes of thin film growth and surface cleaning which are central to the semiconductor industry.  In some cases it has been shown that the bombardment of surfaces by ions can lead to the spontaneous formation of nanostructures on the surface.  If this could be controlled, it could potentially be a very inexpensive way to pattern surfaces for applications in information and energy technologies.  In addition, as information devices become smaller (driven by smaller transistors in the integrated circuits), better understanding and control of nanoscale surface evolution during thin film deposition and cleaning processes becomes crucial.     We have been investigating the fundamental processes causing surface nanopatterning on the important semiconductors silicon and germanium.  There has been much controversy over this for the past 20 years.  Our experiments show that the dominant mechanism governing the surface behavior for the important case of argon ions bombarding silicon is the incident ions knocking surface atoms "downhill" or "uphill" in contrast to much of what had been previously assumed.  We have also discovered that it is difficult for current computer simulation approaches to accurately predict surface evolution during ion bombardment because of limitations to the formalism used in their calculations.     Beyond the research results themselves, this program has been educating students at the postdoctoral, graduate, undergraduate and high school levels with hands-on training in materials science and technology so that they can form the skilled workforce of the future.
