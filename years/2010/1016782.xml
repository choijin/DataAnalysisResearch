<AbstractNarration>From the ?smart grid? to healthcare to national security systems,&lt;br/&gt;wireless devices are playing an increasing role in technological&lt;br/&gt;solutions. Their security and trustworthiness should be a major&lt;br/&gt;concern.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fingerprinting is an important technique in the cyber-defender&lt;br/&gt;arsenal, because it helps expose deceptions essential to modern&lt;br/&gt;multi-step network attacks. We develop methods and tools for wireless&lt;br/&gt;physical (PHY) layer testing, thus improving trustworthiness of&lt;br/&gt;wireless devices and equipping cyber-defenders with the tools they&lt;br/&gt;need to protect wireless networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Active fingerprinting methods are the most direct and effective ones,&lt;br/&gt;because they allow the administrators to initiate fingerprinting when&lt;br/&gt;necessary, probe for a broader range of expected behaviors (thus&lt;br/&gt;increasing the attacker?s workload to fake behaviors in order to&lt;br/&gt;escape detection), and are easily tweaked (further increasing said&lt;br/&gt;workload).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We develop robust fingerprinting techniques for wireless devices&lt;br/&gt;that are based on active probing -- in the physical layer of 802.11&lt;br/&gt;and 802.15.4 networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To empower exploration of the attack surface of actual wireless&lt;br/&gt;networks and to facilitate active physical-layer testing of wireless&lt;br/&gt;devices, we also will develop a framework for crafting and injecting&lt;br/&gt;"marginally" malformed physical layer signals that correspond to&lt;br/&gt;common 802.11 and 802.15.4 frames. In particular, we will facilitate&lt;br/&gt;fuzz-testing of wireless devices.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both fingerprintable responses and (possibly exploitable)&lt;br/&gt;vulnerabilities of wireless devices amount to differences in&lt;br/&gt;implementations of protocol logic. We will develop methods for testing&lt;br/&gt;this logic in the wireless PHY layer, and look for potentially harmful&lt;br/&gt;security vulnerabilities in its common implementations.</AbstractNarration>
