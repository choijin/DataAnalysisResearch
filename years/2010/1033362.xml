<AbstractNarration>1033362&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kapoor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research to be carried out is directed toward a more fundamental understanding of the micro-electrical discharge machining (micro-EDM) process employed for high precision shaping and manufacturing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The specific objectives are to:(1) gain better control of the plasma used to remove debris and (2) achieve improved understanding of the physical mechanisms of debris formation and removal. These objectives will be realized through the execution of four principal tasks: (1) improve precision by stabilizing the plasma; (2) model the flow characteristics of the melt pool; (3) develop a magnetic field-assisted debris removal technique; and (4) experimentally validate the model used to predict the detailed heat transfer and fluid flow processes that ultimately drive the process. The model will also be used to develop new magnetic field-assisted debris removal configurations that will assist the experimental design. A micro-EDM test bed with optical emission spectroscopy and underwater acoustic emission sensor capabilities will be employed to characterize the plasma. Advanced material diagnostics will also be used for debris characterization. Novel magnetic field-assisted debris removal concepts will be developed and tested. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project will result in new features of the micro-EDM process and, in turn, manufacturing precision that might not be achievable by other means. This will enable manufacture of high-precision, micro-scale components and devices characterized by complex geometries fabricated from a wide range of engineering materials. This will help meet a wide spectrum of current and future needs in applications including but not limited to: medicine and health care, communications, optics, and defense. The project will involve researchers from academic and research institutions in India and South Korea. Efforts will be made to boost the participation of members from underrepresented groups by leveraging programs such as the Women in Engineering Program, the Minority Engineering Program, and the McNair Scholar Program.</AbstractNarration>
