Epitaxial films of this wide band gap semiconductor, prepared by metalorganic chemical vapor deposition, will be intentionally doped to control its electrical and optical properties. High structural quality, bulk hBN crystals will be grown from molten metal solutions, so the impact of extended defects on its properties can be determined. The hBN materials will be prepared with isotopically-enriched boron-10, to take advantage of its high thermal neutron capture cross section to enhance detector sensitivity. Definitive values of the fundamental properties of hBN will be determined by advanced materials characterization techniques. Solid state neutron detectors, including devices employing a novel multiple layer structure that can accommodate short mean free paths of charge carriers, will be fabricated, and their neutron detection ability thoroughly tested. Ultimately, the detectors developed is expected to have a major impact on nuclear threat detection and could lead to a large variety of useful devices, ranging from small disposable detectors to large area monitors, and provide an alternative to helium-3 based detectors. Graduate and undergraduate students from both participating institutions will be actively involved in this highly interdisciplinary research project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merits  The goal of this project was to carry out fundamental studies on the hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) semiconductor to enable the development of essentially ideal solid state thermal neutron detectors.  Two aspects were studied at Kansas State University: the growth of hBN single crystals and a theoretical and experimental analysis of the interactions of neutrons with hBN.  Crystals were grown by dissolving hBN powder in a molten nickel-chromium solvent, then precipitating by slowly cooling the solution.  Crystals as large as 5.0 mm across and several tens of microns thick were produced (Figure 1).  Several characterization techniques, including Raman spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction confirmed the hBN crystals were high quality.  Peaks in photoluminescence spectra taken from the crystals at energies of 5.48 eV and 5.74 eV indicated the quality was similar to the best optical properties hBN reported in the literature.  The etch pit densities from defect sensitive etching were approximately 5 x 106 cm-2.   Irradiated boron nitride samples exhibited a sharp increase in conductivity after a fluence of 1014 neutrons/cm2.  The photoluminescence spectra from such samples developed lower energy peaks indicative of plane stacking disorder.  The reaction between boron-10 and neutrons produce lithium ions and alpha particles that were predicted by SRIM to travel less than 2.5 microns and 5 microns respectively.  Complete absorption of 95% of the thermal neutron will require a hBN thickness of 800 microns.  Theoretical analysis using Monte Carlo techniques was performed to explore the impact of crystal thickness on the ion energy deposition in the crystal.  Increasing crystal thickness to approximately 10 microns will increase the number of charges produced inside the layer, thereby improving detector performance.     Broader Impacts  This project supported two students who earned MS degrees in Chemical Engineering and Mechanical and Nuclear Engineering.  The students were trained in materials synthesis and characterization, and solid state neutron detector fabrication and performance.  The results from this research were presented at two professional conferences.  The testing of neutron detectors was highlighted during several group tours of Kansas State University nuclear reactor including tours for dozen of visitors during All-University Open House.
