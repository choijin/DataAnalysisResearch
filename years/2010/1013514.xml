<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a nanopatterning process called molecular transfer lithography to form high-resolution and high-aspect-ratio functional nanostructures of advanced materials.  Differentiated from other nanopatterning methods, the molecular transfer lithography approach uses water-dissolvable templates of polyvinyl alcohol, which are replicated from master topography and then coated with functional material films prior to conformal transfer onto substrates.  By subsequent processing of the materials while on the template, either through modification of the material surface or the template surface itself, precise control of the nanostructure, interface, and the composition will enable the high-resolution printing of novel functional materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this project will be the potential to provide a nanomanufacturing technique to enable the printing of high-resolution and high-aspect-ratio functional nanostructures for applications in optics, photonic devices, alternative energy devices, sensors, customized semiconductors, and displays.  In addition, this nanopatterning technique uses water-dissolvable templates, which eliminates the need for wet processing of the materials and offers a more environmentally-friendly process.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In creating new or improved products from the controlled application of nanomaterials, the molecular transfer lithography method, which involves pre-coated and processed water-dissolvable templates, enables new classes of functional materials for manufacturing that previously were difficult, impossible, or too costly to achieve as high resolution patterns.  The applications for the technology includes customized integrated circuits, advanced informational displays, solid state lighting, and new types of biological microdelivery devices.  Moreover, by pre-coating the water-dissolvable template with the functional materials and shipping to the processing facility on demand, the procedure eliminates the need for wet processing of solvated materials at the fabrication facility, enabling a more convenient and environmentally friendly processing operation, with higher throughput and lower costs as well by elimination of processing steps.   To establish the feasibility of the molecular transfer lithography (MxL) processes for functional material nanopatterning, the highlights of this SBIR Phase I project included:  (1) Commercial transfer tooling was developed and demonstrated for wafer-scale processing and proven within an industrial setting for the fabrication of a photonic device; (2)  Through an industrial application, the fundamental premise of the MxL approach was proven in which functional materials are processed fully on templates at one geographical location and then shipped to a second geographical location where they are put into service without the need for further preparation of either the template or substrate, just requiring an adhesion operation.  This convenient mechanism thereby provides a dry method of processing resists, which therefore eliminates the need for wet processing and coatings of resists, and its solvents, within fab environments; (3) A demonstration of the direct control of an interfacial layer to affect improvements of the shape of nanostructures as well as the attachment of functional materials directly on the surface of the template prior to transfer; (4) A wide range of functional materials, now available for patterning by the MxL procedure, was demonstrated to include, besides resists, curable polymers that can be pre-cured prior to shipment, solvated materials that are transparent and electrically conductive, nanoparticle loaded materials within a polymer matrix, nanoscale spin-on glass materials, low-k dielectrics, and water-soluble based polymer materials;  (5) In drawing a conclusion of a viable business model, price points were demonstrated for both the functional templates and tool indicating a foundation to develop a sustainable business model; (6) In addition to new products and processes, patent applications were filed for methods and tooling, and collaborative research was conducted with leading institutions.
