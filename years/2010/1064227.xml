<AbstractNarration>Understanding scientific activity increasingly requires advancing understanding of the interactions of research teams, the dynamics of skill formation, research productivity, and the transmission of knowledge.  This project creates and analyzes data on research histories of individual scientists. The particular focus is on the effect of research histories on productivity, and on the role of economic and social networks in six fields which account for the majority of scientific research: biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, medicine, and physics. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposal advances understanding in three areas.  The first is the comparative role of individual research histories and social capital on knowledge creation by individual researchers, particularly focusing on mobility.    The second is the factors contributing to the commercialization of academic computer science.  The third concerns the role of social networks in the productivity of scientific institutions.  In exploring changes in social networks, the work builds on new research and exploits the complementarity between networks and cyber infrastructure.  &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The research contributes to the science of science policy data infrastructure by making data available to researchers at the National Bureau of Economic Research and at RPI.  There is also a substantial component which addresses the training of student assistants and advanced students writing on social networks.  Finally, the results of the research strengthen understanding of the changing practice of science and its interactions with public policy, especially policy towards information technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Knowledge, Networks, and the Productivity of Scientists and Engineers  Individual Research Histories and Social Capital     Final Outcomes Report     Research histories of U.S. scientists and engineers form the nucleus of this study.  They are the essential first step that makes subsequent analysis possible.  To uncover the histories, methods of computer science are applied to data on scientific publications, with the aims and objectives of economics in mind.  With considerable accuracy, these methods determine whether the same name listed as author on a group of papers is the same person.  Once a scientist is identified as author on a group of papers, his or her research history is identified. This is because the group of papers contains earliest and latest years, most common field of science, employing institutions listed most frequently on the papers, numbers of papers per year, and citations received per year by papers in the future.  Clearly, this yields a research history that has a beginning and end, most common field of science, sequence of employing institutions, and time-profile of papers and citations received by the papers.  The study produces these histories for every scientist employed in all major U.S. research institutions, for each of twenty fields of science, during the years 1981-2011.  It must be emphasized that all histories are anonymous: a numerical ID represents a person and never a name.  Research histories are measures of accomplishment in social networks of scientists.  Using the methods of this project citation and collaboration networks become ?people? networks that are characterized by research histories.  In these people networks, every person is a node of the network with a research history that reflects a mixture of ability and opportunity that lead to prior scientific achievement.  Research histories make past scientific accomplishments observable. In citation and collaboration networks of scientists, research histories form ?social capital? surrounding a scientist, contributing to research productivity along with resources of the scientist and his or her research history.  With these observations in mind, let us turn to research papers produced by the project.  In the first paper, we study determinants of research productivity of PhD researchers employed by software and internet services companies.  In this case research histories include researcher productivity in graduate school, productivity of PhD advisors, and productivity of company research working groups.  We find significant effects of all three on patenting by the researchers.  Productivity in graduate school has the largest effect, company research working groups have the second largest effect, and PhD advisors have the third largest effect.  And yet, all three effects are highly statistically significant.  The second research paper studies the interaction between universities and economic growth.  The paper concerns the response to growth opportunities that differ by field of science.  The network of donors to universities responds to these growth differentials.  For students and families, private donors, and state and federal government, giving shifts towards fields where growth occurs more rapidly.  This network of responses adds to growth and increases the value of the university.  Using a panel of the top 150 U.S. universities, as well as 20 fields of science and engineering during 1981-2011, the paper verifies these predictions.  In the third paper, we characterize evolving networks of scientists and engineers at the institution and field level.   Science and engineering networks in the United States have become more densely connected, suggesting greater sharing of ideas and greater research efficiency.  Regression analysis of network density and the importance of individual institution-fields finds that growth in federal support of research is a key driver of density and importance.  Thus, science policy may contribute to rising efficiency of networks of scientists and engineers.  Using data on materials scientists employed in the U.S., the fourth research paper studies the comparative importance of individual research labor, individual research histories, and histories in surrounding citation and collaboration networks on research productivity of individual scientists. In preliminary findings, research labor and individual research histories are more important for scientific productivity in materials science than spillovers through networks.  However, spillovers from cited authors and coauthors also make important contributions to productivity.  In the fifth paper, we use network analysis to trace four historical shocks through networks of scientific institutions.  The networks consist of scientific collaborations and citations that encompass all major U.S. research institutions and fields of science during 1981-2011.  We study four major shocks: the breakup of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, the rise of Microsoft Research, the rise of Google Research, and the retrenchment, after the fall of the Soviet Union, of defense-related research in federal agencies, national laboratories, and science-intensive contractors.  For the breakup of AT&amp;T, preliminary results show that shocks spread beyond AT&amp;T, and that the decline within AT&amp;T leads to further decline in neighboring institutions.
