<AbstractNarration>The National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) has been underway since 2001, with attempts at coordinating federal work dating back even earlier. Over its history, NNI has been instrumental in establishing more than 60 state-of-the-art interdisciplinary research and education centers working in fields as diverse as health, aeronautics, energy, and defense. In this award, researchers at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at the University of Arizona will conduct a longitudinal examination of the output of the twenty years of nanotechnology research and development (1991-2010), including statistical trends and topic analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This will be accomplished using a information diffusion model to understand the influences on nanotechnology R&amp;D and the outcomes resulting from the many billions spent on these efforts over the past two decades. Sources of data will include articles and scientific papers, United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) patents, and NSF awards. This modeling technique, typically used in the context of epidemics and the spread of infectious diseases, will be used to analyze emerging topics and possible future knowledge patterns. By examining the patterns by which information diffuses from scientific discovery into patents and commercial products, the model can be used to help estimate the probability of a granted patent document to be cited by others in the future. This is important as in a rapidly changing field such as nanotechnology, past performance is not necessarily the best predictor of future success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this analysis can help stakeholders, policymakers, and funding agencies such as NSF understand what the impact of funding and knowledge diffusion is on nanotechnology research and development. This understanding can then in turn be used as a tool to help influence future policies, procedures, and R&amp;D funding.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nanotechnology is the branch of engineering and technology that deals with matter at the atomic and molecular levels ("nanoscale").  Since the United States initially founded, in 2000, the worldÃ†s first formal national program to advance nanoscale science, engineering, and technology, the competition for global leadership in nanotechnology has only continued to escalate.  Other countries around the world have not only increased their investment in nanotechnology research and development (R&amp;D), but have also formed their own national-level programs to help ensure their success in this field.  This study was proposed to examine the output of over twenty years of nanotechnology research and development, from 1991 to 2012. One purpose was to study how nanotechnology information spreads within a scientific community, and discover potential public policy implications. Another purpose was to help develop good measures, models, and techniques for examining the flow of knowledge (often referred to as knowledge diffusion in scientific literature) within the nanotechnology R&amp;D community. The final purpose was to examine support of nanotechnology R&amp;D efforts, especially the funding provided to scientists by the National Science Foundation.  We used several large data sets in this project.  We obtained 514,300 nanoscale science and engineering (NSE)-related research articles; 142,842 NSE-related patents; and award information for 16,283 NSE-related NSF awards.  One of the important findings is that the impact of NSF-funded NSE researchers and the findings they produce is significantly higher than that of other inventors and researcher groups.  In looking at the output of other countries, we also found, for example, that the U.S. has the most nanotechnology patents; however, China surpassed the U.S. in scientific literature published in 2010.  China also showed the fastest growth rate both in issuing patents among the top 20 assignee countries and in publishing scientific publications.  We also examined the influence of individual status on the knowledge diffusion process at an institutional level. Individual status refers to the characteristics of individuals in a network. There can be various types of statuses in a network.  For example, some individuals are connected with a large number of other individuals, thus forming a central hub (degree centrality).  Other individuals may connect groups within a network to each other (boundary spanning). We studied the impact of individual status on knowledge diffusion. Publication data from both China and U.S. institutions in the nanotechnology field were examined. We used the data to experiment with various statistical techniques, such as Cox proportional hazards regression model, which looks at influences on events over time, and with various social network measures, such as degree centrality, which serves to indicate the important nodes in a network.  One of the interesting findings was that inventors with high degree centrality were more likely to share knowledge by collaborating with each other. Also, knowledge transfer was likely to originate from "boundary-spanning" inventors (those who connect groups within a network). These two findings suggest that inventors in key positions in the knowledge-diffusion networks greatly enhance the levels of knowledge sharing and knowledge transfer. Therefore, funding these key inventors could, potentially, be more effective than funding others. The effects of NSF funding on nanotechnology knowledge sharing have also increased since the NNI in 2001. This suggests that the NNI has successfully stimulated nanotechnology knowledge sharing, and more funding can be used to support nanotechnology researchers to increase their levels of knowledge sharing.
