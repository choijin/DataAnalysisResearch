<AbstractNarration>The investigator and his colleagues apply a curvelet-based, multi-scale geometric (CBMSG) methodology  to the identification, characterization and classification of scale-dependent geometry  within three-dimensional, evolving Lagrangian-scalar  and vortex- surface scalar fields in several differing turbulent flows. The CBMSG methodology first decomposes the given  field into scale- dependent component fields. Structures from each field are then extracted by iso-surfacing  and the geometry of each structure is characterized by a finite set of geometrical parameters obtained as functions of moments of the joint probability distributions of the surface shape-index and curvedness. This allows pictorial depiction of the set of structures at each scale as a cloud of points in a visualization space. The density of points within this space provides information on the statistical geometry of scale-dependent structures embedded within the original  field. An important component of the research is the development of methodologies for numerically simulating the time-wise evolution of Lagrangian scalar fields as they are convected, deformed and stretched  by turbulent velocity fields. This is achieved using a novel particle backward-tracking method that constructs directly the time-backward or reverse Lagrangian map.  Specifically, the  research  includes study of the geometry of high-resolution, Lagrangian-scalar-field evolution for homogeneous turbulence, the statistical geometry of both Eulerian and Lagrangian fields for turbulent channel  flows and the development of a methodology for tracking vortex-surface fields for inviscid and viscous fluid flow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The shapes or geometry of objects in nature often plays a crucial role in their behavior.  The form of a bird or insect wing, the detailed shape of a biological cell or of a complex molecule or the organization of a tree into a large trunk, smaller branches and leaves are all related to their special function. This geometry can be changing and not static; for example the ``eddies'' comprising water or other fluid motion have long been recognized to have repeatable shapes as can  seen in  cloud formation, in breaking  sea waves and  in the billowing and folding shapes of a rocket exhaust or an oil leak from the sea floor. Typically, this complex natural geometry cannot be easily perceived in terms of a single simple  shape but must be understood as an amalgam of interconnected but different forms.  Trees and clouds are good examples.  The aim of this research is to develop quantitative, statistical methods for characterizing the complex three-dimensional geometry of the eddies that comprise turbulent fluid flow.   The methods and techniques&lt;br/&gt;used come from modern computational applied mathematics. The immediate practical application is that the results will inform the development of advanced computational methods for the  numerical prediction of turbulent fluid flows in a wide range of industrial and environmental settings, including  pollutant and climate modeling. While the present focus is  on the geometry of  eddies that comprise  fluid-dynamic turbulence, the methods developed have more general applicability, in principle to any of the above illustrative examples. This research is expected to lead to impact in other areas of science and engineering where the visualization and reduction of complex ``organic'' geometry embedded within huge data bases  remains a challenging problem.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Fluid-dynamical vortices are a common phenomenon in our everyday world. We see vortices at all scales of nature from the great red spot of the planet Jupiter, to the sprawling swirl of a large hurricane, in the destructive howl of a tornado, to the  condensation in the contrails of a jetliner at altitude,  to the whirlwind  dust devil on the plain and in the familiar bathtub draining vortex.  These are  but easily visible examples.  Intense fluid swirling motion associated with vortices occurs in almost every energetic movement of the air and water,  for example in atmospheric storms and in the few inches of rapidly flowing air next to the skin of a fast moving aeroplane.  Yet despite their ubiquity, and  more than a century of both  intense casual and scientific study, we still do not possess a complete understanding of the physical mechanisms underpinning the formation and  dynamics of  vortex motion in a general setting.  The aim of this project was specifically to attempt to produce and visualize, on a large digital computer, numerical simulations of the creation and movement of intense vortices of the kind that appear spontaneously in the transition from a laminar, or smooth fluid motion, to state of fluid turbulence.  Specifically, the project  first developed  a theoretical framework  for both identifying and tracking the formation of vortex objects in the laminar-turbulent transition event, and then tested this  within a canonical  model fluid flow called the Taylor-Green vortex, named for two well known fluid dynamics of the past.  The methodology employed an approach that enabled the detailed tracking of almost all   particles that comprise the fluid.  This is sometimes called a ``Lagrangian'' method after the Italian mathematician and astronomer, Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736-1813).  Figure 1 shows a snapshot of a  tangle of intense vortex tubes that appear spontaneously in the fluid dynamical, laminar-turbulent transition event. They can be visualized in this way using a diagnostic signature tool for  the  simultaneous identification and following of vortices that was created as part of the project.  The physical significance of this work is that it has enabled the tracking of vortex formation in a new and useful way.  It is expected that the understanding of vortex motion obtained from this work will inform the building of quantitative models that underpin the numerical simulation (or prediction)  of complex fluid-dynamical motions dominated by vortices.
