<AbstractNarration>This CAREER project investigates Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching (MKT) from the perspective of coherent understanding.  The PI will explore not only how much knowledge teachers possess but also how they organize that knowledge, and how that organization shapes their practice. This proposed project builds on scholarly work about the development of expertise from the learning sciences and the work about the mathematics knowledge teachers need and how that knowledge develops from mathematics education. The PI's research approach was innovative and will use a mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate how much knowledge teachers possess and how they organize that knowledge for teaching.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The CAREER: Coherence as a Basis for Understanding Teachers? Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching was funded in 2010 and ended in 2017. As a grant for providing a foundation for successful careers in academia, this project was a clear success. During the project, the PI was promoted from Assistant Professor to Associate Professor, became the chair of her department, and served as an Interim Co-Director for the Kaput Center for Research &amp; Innovation in STEM Education. Soon, she will be transitioning to be the permanent director of the Kaput Center, which allows her to work with other researchers to build their own research agendas.     This CAREER grant focused on three key research questions:  How do teachers? conceptual organizations of MKT for proportional reasoning relate to their performance on assessments of content knowledge? How do teachers? with varying levels of content knowledge compare to experts in terms of their conceptual organization of the domain? How is the coherence of teachers? conceptual organizations related to their classroom practices for teaching proportional reasoning?   To answer these questions, we asked 32 practicing middle school teachers to complete an assessment about Proportions, to complete a think-aloud protocol focused on solving proportional problems and examining the thinking of others, and to participate in a 90 minute interview in which we had them explore dynamic proportional relationships using software and analyze the thinking of others.     We are using a variety of analysis methods &ndash; both qualitative and quantitative &ndash; to answer these questions. We used the knowledge in pieces framework as our conceptual lens and are applying Epistemic Network Analysis as one of our key analytical lenses.     To date, we have produced two published journal articles, 10 peer-reviewed published proceedings papers, and 24 presentations (across six organizations). We have 2 accepted presentations, one presentation proposal under review, and three journal manuscripts in preparation.
