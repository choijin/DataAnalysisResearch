<AbstractNarration>Across many scientific disciplines, the availability of very large&lt;br/&gt;amounts of data is creating a paradigm shift. The goal of this project&lt;br/&gt;is to develop Scolopax, a tool for finding interesting patterns in&lt;br/&gt;classification and prediction models trained on large high-dimensional&lt;br/&gt;data. These patterns can capture previously unknown relationships&lt;br/&gt;between the variables of a complex process, hence are essential for&lt;br/&gt;exploratory analysis and scientific discovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project explores several research directions to lay the&lt;br/&gt;foundations for Scolopax: (1) Design of a new query language that can&lt;br/&gt;express all common pattern search preferences. (2) Algorithms for&lt;br/&gt;learning a query so that even non-technical users can formulate&lt;br/&gt;non-trivial queries through an interactive process. (3) New rewrite&lt;br/&gt;rules and efficient data management approaches to automatically&lt;br/&gt;transform queries into fast implementations on a cluster or Cloud. (4)&lt;br/&gt;Design of new semi-parametric data mining techniques that are amenable&lt;br/&gt;to scalable training, evaluation, and pattern confidence computation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;User-friendly query writing functionality makes Scolopax accessible to&lt;br/&gt;scientists and citizen scientists alike. Its planned deployment&lt;br/&gt;through popular Web sites, e.g., those hosted by the Cornell Lab of&lt;br/&gt;Ornithology, has the potential to enable new scientific&lt;br/&gt;discoveries. By letting citizen scientists not only contribute data,&lt;br/&gt;but also make their own discoveries using the data, Scolopax also&lt;br/&gt;serves as an important enabler and motivator for outreach programs and&lt;br/&gt;greater involvement of citizen scientists.
