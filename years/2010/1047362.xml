<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) phase I aims to demonstrate the feasibility of constructing a novel machine for manufacturing low-cost glass-to-metal seals for insulating window glazing. Applications include vacuum glazing which insulates as well as a wall (R11 to R20), representing a major improvement in window technology. It will also provide an opportunity to improve existing window technology. The one remaining barrier to economic viability is a low-cost process to metallize the perimeter edges of glass panes. The current state of the art requires a vacuum chamber large enough to hold glass as large as 2 meters x 3 meters. The large chamber and associated vacuum pumps are capital- and operating-cost intensive, largely wasted on smaller panes. This project involves building and operating an innovative vacuum deposition device which can metalize the edges of glass panes of virtually any size. The capital cost and operating cost of this device will scale up based on pane perimeter, not pane area. The proposed activity will leverage accumulated knowledge in plasma-aided manufacturing, and advance it, to overcome longstanding technical barriers to provide a major advance in glazing technology. It will improve the understanding of how closely vacuum glazing approaches its potential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The commercial potential of this project will be accrue primarily to the retrofitting of residential buildings. By 2050, if 2 trillion square feet of glazing can be retrofitted with this technology, the avoided energy loss would amount to 12% of residential heating and cooling energy, or 1% of U.S. energy use. Avoided greenhouse gas emissions for the entire U.S. would also be 1%.This project arises from the goal of achieving cost parity, that is, vacuum windows that cost no more to manufacture than conventional argon-filled Insulating Glass units. If cost parity is achieved, the avoided costs of drilling natural gas wells equivalent to this energy savings will more than pay for the required installed glazing capacity. Successful development of this machine will lead to achieving cost parity, enabling rapid market penetration through retrofit of existing buildings as well as new construction.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Public Outcomes Report  SBIR Phase I: Manufacturing Low-Cost Metal-to-Glass Seals for Insulating Glazing Intellectual Merit &ndash; This project demonstrated the technical feasibility of building a machine for manufacturing low-cost glass-to-metal seals for highly-insulating evacuated window glazing. Key outcomes and findings include:  The feasibility of using a novel "vacuum print head" approach to coat the perimeter of a large glass pane was demonstrated (see Figure 1).  The metal coatings adhered strongly, and survived bonding to metal foil by hot soldering and cold welding. Leakage of helium across a cold-welded seal could not be detected. The process was operated at room temperature, allowing both low-emissivity-coated and tempered glass samples to be metallized. Unless the throughput of a vacuum print head can be improved, a full size vacuum coating chamber will provide lower cost per unit of glazing area.  Unexpectedly, this project resulted in a novel vacuum cold welding process, with potential applications in glazing, displays and instrumentation. Broader Impacts/Commercial Potential &ndash; The results of this project strongly support the technical viability of manufacturing vacuum glazing. Such glazing promises five times less heat loss than the current dual-pane argon-filled glazing. Universal transition to vacuum glazing could reduce total U.S. energy use by 5%. Commercial window companies have expressed interest, and even placed orders for samples to test. Understandably, they cannot shoulder the high risk of funding the remaining R&amp;D effort, despite the potential high reward. Furthermore, they insist that, technical feasibility aside, any new sealing technology must not increase their cost to manufacture insulating glass. Achieving "cost parity" will reduce commercial risk by encouraging rapid market penetration of vacuum glazing regardless of tax incentives or energy prices.  The outcomes of this NSF-funded research provide an important first step in demonstrating that cost parity is achievable. Future work must show that vacuum glazing, such as the design shown in Figure 2, can actually be manufactured for the same cost as current glazing. But it appears to be possible. "I like the simplicity" said the R&amp;D director for one prominent window company, citing potential savings from the elimination of bulky spacers, desiccant, glue and argon gas from inventory, and lower costs for leakage-related warranty.
