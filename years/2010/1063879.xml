<AbstractNarration>0968003 Georgia Tech; Andy Bommarius &lt;br/&gt;0968972 University of Kansas; Eric Munson &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this proposal is to start a new I/UCRC "Pharmaceutical Manufacturing and Formulation" (CPMF) with a focus on addressing current challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, and developing solutions towards more selective and robust manufacturing processes, more stable formulations, and better characterized and consistent products. The lead institution of the proposed Center is Georgia Tech with a site location at the University of Kansas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CPMF proposes to explore areas important to pharmaceutical manufacturing and improved formulations for pharmaceuticals. The Center plans to develop methods and technologies that will produce better pharmaceuticals, make them last longer, be more effective, and safer. By combining the efforts of Georgia Tech, Duquesne University and the University of Kansas, the PIs have proposed a number of potentially important projects that could significantly advance the applied knowledge necessary to make better pharmaceuticals. CPMF will allow pharmaceutical companies a lower cost approach to advancing risky research in a cooperative manner such that important manufacturing needs and innovations can be pursued with shared risk and mutual gain. CPMF has assembled a very strong group of researchers who are well-qualified to perform the research outlined in the proposal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center will promote the rapid development of safe and efficacious drugs and drug formulations, and will identify potential problems with proposed drug formulations, with the potential of improving or even saving human lives. The Center plans to involve graduate students and post-doctoral associates in performing and presenting their research, thereby creating an opportunity for them to interact with counterparts from pharmaceutical and medical areas. Plans for dissemination of results are well thought out and audiences are appropriate. The proposed Center also plans to put emphasis on recruiting under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of Kentucky site for the Center for Pharmaceutical Development focuses on the characterization and understanding of new ways to formulate drugs so that these drugs can be administered safely and at lower cost.  The Center is based on a cooperative agreement between the National Science Foundation, the participating Universities, and member Pharmaceutical companies.  The Pharmaceutical companies provide the funding to support the research performed at the Universities, and the National Science Foundation monitors the center activities and ensures that the Center guidelines are followed.  At the University of Kentucky site, the primary focus is on understanding solid oral dosage forms, such as tablets, and how new drugs can better be delivered from tablets.  One of the biggest challenges facing pharmaceutical companies in the development of new drug candidates is that they do not dissolve in water.  This effect, called solubility, has become the number one problem in the formulation of new drugs.  In the past, drug companies would simply not develop that potential drug candidate, but now they are forced to develop these candidates as there are no good alternatives.  One way of developing a new drug candidate is to make a metastable form of the drug.  The metastable form is much more soluble, but the risk is that the drug could convert to a more stable form upon storage, and if that occurs, then the drug would no longer have the same therapeutic effect, forcing a potential drug recall.  The research at the University of Kentucky is focused on ways to understand how the drug is stabilized in this metastable environment, and to provide a level of prediction about whether it might actually convert into the more stable form during storage.  In addition to this work, the drug also has to stay dissolved in the gastrointestinal tract to be absorbed into the bloodstream.  If it does not stay dissolved, then it will not be absorbed, and also lose its therapeutic effect.  The research being performed studies how the drug is maintained in the dissolved state long enough for it to be absorbed into the bloodstream.  This research ensures the safety and efficacy of new drugs that are being developed.       Last Modified: 07/12/2016       Submitted by: Eric J Munson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
