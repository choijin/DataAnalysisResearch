<AbstractNarration>The PI will conduct a series of laboratory experiments to study how the surfaces of comets are affected by impacts. Using facilities at the Experimental Impact Laboratory at the NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC), she will prepare targets consisting of refractory minerals that are either known to be present in comets or are suitable analogs for cometary material; the targets may be solid crystals, crushed, or combined with volatiles in low density dust-ice mixtures. The targets will then be impacted at velocities of a few km/s, characteristic of impacts in regions from the Main Asteroid Belt to the Kuiper Belt. The resulting impacted material will be analyzed by a variety of microscopic and spectroscopic techniques, in order to determine (1) whether shock features matching those observed in Comet Wild 2 dust samples (obtained by the Stardust spacecraft) are formed, and (2) whether impacted materials can account for the observed mid-infrared spectra of comets and Trojan asteroids. The goal is to obtain constraints on collision-driven evolution that will elucidate the dynamical histories of comets and asteroids. Students from the PI's university, a Hispanic Serving Institution, will participate in academic-year projects and summer internships at JSC conducting this research, and curricula will be developed for students in the Liberal Studies program that trains K-8 teachers</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Evidence of the collisional history of comets and asteroids has been emerging from analyses of cometary forsterite and enstatite returned from Comet Wild 2 by the Stardust mission (Keller et al.Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 72, 2008; Tomeoka et al. MAPS 43, 2008; Jacobs et al. MAPS 44, 2009). Likewise, shock metamorphism is observed in many meteoritic forsterites and enstatites (McCausland et al. AGU, 2010), suggesting similar collisional histories for asteroids.  This inspired the following science driver: Is there a way for data collected purely by telescopes to tell the story of the collisional history and space weathering that has occurred over the lifetime of small bodies? What kind of laboratory experiments could be designed to allow us to investigate how physical effects from shock (e.g. planar dislocations in the crystalline lattice structure) manifest in spectral data?  With these science drivers in mind, we proposed to:  (1) Conduct a suite of impact experiments followed by petrographic and spectral analyses to identify alterations observed in impacted comet and asteroid analogue minerals.  Comparison of fresh analogues with analogues that have been impacted could mimic an evolutionary scenario on small bodies.  (2) Inspire the next generation of students by (a) creating a course for undergraduates and future teachers to give them a real-world view of science, and (b) including students in all aspects of research, encouraging them to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).   To this end, ~260 laboratory experiments were designed to quantify the effects of impacts on the near- to mid-IR spectra of common cometary materials. A suite of relevant impact experiments have been carried out using the NASA Johnson Space Center Experimental Impact Laboratory at velocities ranging from ~1.79 ? 2.81, and temperatures ranging from 25?C to -100?C. Targets included a suite of minerals typically found in comet dust and in asteroids and meteorites, including olivines, pyroxenes, carbonates and phyllosilicates/serpentines.  Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometers were used to collect 7-15mm mid-infrared spectra that can be directly compared with spectra of comets and asteroids taken with telescopes. This wavelength range covers key crystalline resonance features. We broadly compared results from many experiments under differing temperatures and velocities and target physical state (solid versus crushed). The spectral results, combined with the TEM imaging, were designed to compare how the crystalline structure itself will fracture and what signatures are observed for differing thermal stresses, total impact energy, and with/without void spaces present in the target.

Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) imaging and models indicate evidence of shock similar to that seen in Stardust samples of forsterite and enstatite from Comet Wild 2 (c-planar dislocations observed). This is also consistent with results we find in models and spectra of our lab-impacted forsterite. Experiment/Research Outcomes ? includes a database of mid-infrared spectra for ~260 experiments, each with a suite of spectra taken that samples the collected material from the experiment. Also includes TEM imaging of impacted forsterite and enstatite. Key to this research, undergraduate students have taken part in all aspects of the research throughout the lifetime of the grant, including the laboratory experiments, and the huge task of prepping all the impacted mineral material for analysis with the lab FTIR, and collecting spectra on the handful to dozens of samples collected for each of the hundreds of experiments.

Workforce, education, and STEM Training Outcomes ? this grant in part has supported 3 post-doctoral scholars, 7 undergraduate research students, and a course offered yearly for liberal studies majors.
