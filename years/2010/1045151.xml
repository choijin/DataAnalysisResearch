<AbstractNarration>The main goal of this research is to further develop, apply, and analyze a &lt;br/&gt;computational tool that can be used to examine the transport tendencies along &lt;br/&gt;the U.S. East Coast including Florida, Georgia, and both Carolinas as they &lt;br/&gt;relate to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The central piece of this &lt;br/&gt;computational tool will be the Advanced Circulation (ADCIRC) hydrodynamic &lt;br/&gt;model. ADCIRC is a finite element model for solving time?dependent, free &lt;br/&gt;surface circulation and transport problems in two? and three?dimensions. &lt;br/&gt;Existing finite element meshes of the region will be further developed to &lt;br/&gt;provide an unprecedented level of resolution and physical detail, including &lt;br/&gt;detailed coverage of coastal rivers and lagoons, tidal creeks, the Atlantic &lt;br/&gt;Intracoastal Waterway, and tidally flooded marshes. The ability to accurately &lt;br/&gt;simulate the tidal dynamics of this region, as well as hurricane storm surge, &lt;br/&gt;will be coupled with recent and ongoing development of the transport &lt;br/&gt;capabilities of the ADCIRC model using discontinuous Galerkin methods. The &lt;br/&gt;integration and further development of these three key components, i.e., the &lt;br/&gt;high-resolution finite element meshes, the ability to accurately simulate &lt;br/&gt;tidal and storm surge dynamics, and robust, mass-conserving transport &lt;br/&gt;algorithms, will provide a powerful computational tool that will be used to &lt;br/&gt;simulate the transport tendencies of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill along the &lt;br/&gt;U.S. East Coast.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Deepwater Horizon oil spill began on April 20, 2010 as a result of an oil &lt;br/&gt;well blowout that caused an explosion on the Deepwater Horizon offshore &lt;br/&gt;drilling platform located forty miles southeast off the Louisiana coast. A &lt;br/&gt;major and immediate concern related to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill is the &lt;br/&gt;possibility of the oil slick reaching the Loop Current ? a warm ocean current &lt;br/&gt;that enters the Gulf of Mexico flowing northward through the Yucatan Strait &lt;br/&gt;and that exits flowing east through the Florida Straits continuing northward &lt;br/&gt;along the east coast of Florida as the Gulf Stream. Oil entering the Loop &lt;br/&gt;Current would eventually be transported far afield to the Atlantic Ocean where &lt;br/&gt;the presence of large-scale eddies that separate from the western edge of the &lt;br/&gt;Gulf Stream have the potential to carry oil toward the U.S. East Coast. There &lt;br/&gt;is additional concern regarding the transport of oil that may occur during the &lt;br/&gt;upcoming Atlantic Hurricane Season, which has been forecasted by NOAA to be an &lt;br/&gt;?active to extremely active? hurricane season. The transport of oil towards &lt;br/&gt;the U.S. East Coast ? by means of reaching the Loop Current or from the onset &lt;br/&gt;of a hurricane ? would obviously have a major detrimental impact on the &lt;br/&gt;coastal environment, severely damaging their beaches and coastal wetlands, &lt;br/&gt;which serve as critical habitats to the fish and wildlife. The primary &lt;br/&gt;objective of this proposal is to provide a computational tool that will be &lt;br/&gt;used to help analyze and assess possible damage from the Deepwater Horizon oil &lt;br/&gt;spill along the U.S. East Coast including Florida, Georgia, and both Carolinas.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the fate and transport of oil spill remnants (e.g., tar&lt;br/&gt;balls) entrained in Gulf Stream eddies and feeding the U.S. East Coast will be &lt;br/&gt;modeled along the shelf and into the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway and &lt;br/&gt;estuarine systems. Using available data sources, simulations will be performed &lt;br/&gt;to ultimately identify areas especially susceptible to receiving transported &lt;br/&gt;oil and likely areas of deposition.  The model and results will also be &lt;br/&gt;transferable to other regions of the Gulf of Mexico.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Deepwater Horizon oil spill began on April 20, 2010 as a result of an oil well blowout that caused an explosion on British PetroleumÆs (BP's) Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling platform located forty miles southeast off the Louisiana coast. A major and immediate concern related to the spill was the possibility of the oil slick reaching the Loop Current &ndash; a warm ocean current that enters the Gulf of Mexico flowing northward through the Yucatan Strait and that exits flowing east through the Florida Straits continuing northward along the east coast of Florida as the Gulf Stream. Oil entering the Loop Current had the potential to be transported far afield to the Atlantic Ocean, where the presence of large-scale eddies that separate from the western edge of the Gulf Stream could act to carry oil toward Florida's east coast. Shortly after the spill, Florida's Attorney General sent a letter to BP executives, asking the company to immediately acknowledge its liability for any damages Florida incurred during the 2010 Hurricane Season from the oil spill.  Intellectual Merit:  The focus of this NSF project was to develop a set of computational tools that could be used to help analyze and assess possible damage from the oil spill in shelf, estuarine and intracoastal regions along the U.S. East Coast, especially the transport of oil from the Gulf of Mexico towards the coast of Florida by means of reaching the Loop Current and the transport tendencies of Florida's intercoastal regions. The two central components of this modeling system are the ADCIRC (ADvanced CIRCulation) and ADMESH (ADvanced MESH) modeling tools, which were further developed and applied for this specific scenario under this project.  ADCIRC is a computational model that has been extensively used to model flows for processes such as tides, storm surge, and flows within ocean basins, on shelves, in bays, through inlets,  and in rivers. An oil transport model was added to ADCIRC to simulate the fate and transport of oil due to different physical forcings, including tides, steady and seasonal constituents, ocean surface currents, winds, and riverine inflows. Simulated hydrodynamics (time series of water levels) for a period of ninety days following the oil well blowout showed excellent agreement with data recorded at five National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) coastal gaging stations near the site location of Deepwater Horizon; e.g., see Figure 1. Simulated transport was analyzed in terms of spatial and temporal evolution as driven by the different physical forcings and was compared to oil spill trajectory maps and collected oiled coastline data. Transport simulation results revealed: (i) no single forcing (tides, winds, or ocean surface currents) was isolated as being the dominant forcing; (ii) winds acted to push oil to the west and northwest towards Louisiana; (iii) tides, in combination with winds, prevented some of the wind-driven oil from reaching the Louisiana Delta; and (iv) ocean surface currents drove an eastward and northeastward transport of oil.  Overall, simulations captured the wind-driven transport of the oil slick and showed potential for tar balls to be carried into the Atlantic via the Loop Current, e.g., see Figure 2. Given this potential, subsequent simulations investigated the transport tendencies of FloridaÆs East Coast nearshore and estuarine waters, where the specific influence of tides, winds, and the Gulf Stream, including spin-off eddies, on circulation and transport were investigated and quantified.  A prerequisite for performing these types of hydrodynamic and transport simulations is a detailed digital map, or computational mesh, of the geographic area of interest. The creation of such a mesh is typically a very time-consuming and user-intensive process. To address this issue, an advanced, automatic mesh generation tool, called ADMESH, was further developed to quickly and automatically generate high-quality computatio...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
