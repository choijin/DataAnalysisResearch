<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL&lt;br/&gt;Solid state inorganic materials encompass a vast array of compounds. The functional properties&lt;br/&gt;associated with these materials involve a host of technologically important applications, such as&lt;br/&gt;superconductivity, energy storage, gas storage, etc. The syntheses, thorough characterization, and theoretical analyses are crucial for advances in the field, as well as in the design of superior materials. Thus it is vital that established scientists, junior faculty, postdoctoral associates, and students involved in solid state chemistry research interact with the larger materials community. The Materials Research Society (MRS) meeting is an important forum for this community.  Building on a 16 year tradition, symposium EE ? Solid State Chemistry of Inorganic Materials VIII ? is the eighth biennial symposium at the Fall MRS meeting.  The topical areas to be addressed include:  Novel Synthetic Methods; Theoretical Studies and Computational Modeling; Materials for Energy Conversion and Storage; Magnetic, Electronic and Optical Properties of Materials; and Nanomaterials and Porous Solids. Funding from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program will be provided to junior faculty, post-doctoral associates, and students to attend and present their research at this meeting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The MRS meeting is an international forum bringing together experts from many disciplines to share and discuss important issues of fundamental and applied material science and technology.   A prestigious and diverse list of invited speakers will cover these scientific areas with the intent by the organizers to establish an important forum for accelerating understanding in solid state chemistry systems.  The symposium allows established scientists as well as newcomers to share their results and ideas. The symposium also allows experimentalists to meet with theorists, and academic science to interact with applied technologies. Registration and travel support is requested for junior faculty, post-doctoral associates, and students to attend the meeting and present their research.</AbstractNarration>
