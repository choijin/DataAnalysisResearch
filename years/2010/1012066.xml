<AbstractNarration>Through this planning visit U.S. researchers Heidi Feigenbaum of Northern Arizona University and Yannis Dafalias, from the University of California-Davis, will initiate an international cooperative research project with Czech partners to examine computational phenomenological plasticity.  Their counterpart, Jiri Plesek, will head collaborative efforts at the Czech Academy of Sciences' Institute of Thermomechanics.  Results from the planned long-term collaboration should improve our fundamental understanding of the mechanics of materials and, if successful, may lead to new models to improve predictions for practical engineering and materials problems, ranging from predicting ratcheting strains to elastic spring back during metal forming.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The U.S. team's strengths in deformation and plasticity theory as well as directional distortion and simulation offer an excellent complement to those of the Czech partners in computation and theory.   Specifically, Plesek's group will contribute the finite element platform with which the Feigenbaum-Dafalias models will be implemented. Together their goal is to refine plans for calculating model constants by using experimental results and analytical solutions to examine the fundamental modes of deformation, such as tensile tests and ratcheting.  For better calibration, they intend to work toward implementing governing equations in the framework of a large deformation finite element computer code.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project planning visit fulfills the program objective of advancing our knowledge of the mechanics of materials by enabling researchers in the United States and Europe to share resources and expertise in areas of mutual interest and competence.  This U.S.-Czech team intends to produce a simple, accurate metal plasticity model that addresses directional distortional hardening.  Broader impacts may include the eventual ability to avoid failures in structures that are subject to cyclic plastic loading throughout their life-spans.  Long-term success could mean future savings in cost and time, coupled with heightened safety through improved engineering applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Travel to Prague by the PIs occurred July 29 &ndash; August 2, 2012 for this international planning visit.  In addition, Dr. Dafalias traveled to Prague from March 11-13, 2013 and Dr. Feigenbaum joined the research meetings via Skype.        Intellectual Merit:     The purpose of this trip was to further develop several recent plasticity models that include distortion of the yield surface, namely those from Feigenbaum and Dafalias, to reach the stage of practically applicable theory, which may be employed to solve real-life engineering problems of elasto-plasticity.  In classical plasticity theory, the yield surface delineates purely elastic from elasto-plastic behavior and is a function of stress and a set of internal variables.  Directional distortional hardening refers to the change of shape of the yield surface as plastic deformation occurs.  It is important to accurately predict yield surface shape to correctly predict the ensuing strain rate direction, since most models assume that the strain rate is in the direction normal to the yield surface.  EngineersÆ current inability to accurately predict yield surface distortion, and in turn plastic strain, causes less structural reliability, inefficient design, and potential for structural failure.      Broader Impacts:  Additionally, these trips aimed to strengthen the collaboration between the PIÆs and Dr. Plesek at the Institute of Thermomechanics at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic and to prepare future research.  Benefits to society will be seen should the new model improve predictions in practical problems.   For example, ratcheting is the accumulation of plastic strain during cyclic loading.  Using directional distortion has been shown to improve predictions of ratcheting.  This can be used to improve safety and reliability in applications such as nuclear power plants, chemical industries, offshore structures, machinery components, and steel building and bridge structures       Outcomes:    During these trips, the following topics were discussed: calibration of material parameters associated with the Feigenbaum and Dafalias models for directional distortional hardening, finite element implementation of these models so that real-world problems can be simulated, how current models may be altered to improve ratcheting (accumulation of plastic strain due to cyclic loading) predictions including changes to kinematic hardening and/or directional distortional hardening, limitations of current models and new models for better capturing both directional distortion and the cross-effect.   The major findings and results from these meetings include:  A technique to calibrate the simplest of the Feigenbaum and Dafalias directional distortional models.  Implementation of the simplest of the Feigenbaum and Dafalias models into a finite element platform, which in turn can be used to simulate real-world engineering problems.   The collaborative relationship between the PIÆs and the team at the Institute of Thermomechanics at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic has been strengthened and the PIÆs have submitted a full proposal to continue this collaboration and extend this work to use yield surface distortion to improve predictions during cyclic plastic loading, which has proved to be elusive despite many years of research.
