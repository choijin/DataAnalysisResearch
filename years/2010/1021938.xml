<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial funding for U.S. ocean scientists, particularly those in the academic research community, to participate in the activities of the North Pacific Marine Science Organization (PICES).  This organization was established in 1992 to promote and coordinate marine scientific research in order to advance knowledge of living marine resources, land-ocean and atmosphere-ocean interactions, ecosystem components and processes, resource usage, ocean response to global weather and climate change, and human impacts in the North Pacific. Members presently include Canada, China, Japan, Korea, Russia, and the United States. Participation by U.S. scientists in Annual Meetings, scientific committee working groups and workshops, will also be funded through this award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The availability of travel funds not only provides influence on the scientific planning for large scale international collaborations, but also provides the opportunity to entrain colleagues and graduate students into research collaborations, scientific sessions, and workshops. The scale of the North Pacific Ocean demands broad collaboration, and the intellectual merits of international collaboration leads to increased understanding of how diverse scientists address their research. Entrainment of young scientists from both the US and foreign countries into these collaborations represents one of the capacity building strategies of PICES, and one which has a broader impact on US science through appreciation of the diverse multicultural approaches to science. Funds have been add sufficient funds to this project to provide full travel support for young (&lt;35 yr of age) academic scientists to the PICES annual meeting. With matching funds from PICES this will allow participation by 3 young academic scientists annually.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The funding was provided to advance and improve scientific understanding of climatological, physical and ecological processes and interactions in the North Pacific by encouraging and facilitating contribution by US academic experts to the multinational discussions that occur at the intergovernmental North Pacific Marine Science Organization's (PICES) annual meeting and workshops.  PICES countries are Canada, China, Japan, Korea, Russian Federation, and the USA.  The significant impacts of the project are: (1) provided travel support for several young scientists from the US to participate in PICES activities, including leadership roles.  Many have remained engaged with PICES through subsequent years; (2) with approval of the NSF, this award provided partial support to three young female scientists from the US to attend a PICES-ICES Early Career Scientist Symposium in Majorca, Spain in April 2013.  One of these has subsequently been very engaged in PICES and is currently chairing a working group of the organization.; (3) Overall, during the three years of this project, the funding enabled travel support for 53 participants to attend annual PICES meetings (18 travelers to 2010 meeting in Portland, OR; 16 travelers to 2011 meeting in Khabarovsk, Russia; 16 travelers to 2012 meeting in Hiroshima, Japan; 3 travelers were partially funded to 2013 meeting in Nanimo, Canada--14 others were partially or fully funded by another NSF award) or intersessional workshops (3 in 2011; 6 in 2012; 3 in 2013; and 1 in 2014). All travel funding was provided to University or Private Academics from the US, who were able to attend intersessional or annual meetings of PICES.  Most academic participants of PICES received partial travel support in order to be able to support a greater number of US academics to PICES events.  Overall, US academics supported by this award provided expertise to an average of 17 PICES expert groups per year, and the 53 participants over the four annual meetings were authors on 94 scientific papers or posters presented at the meeting and were conveners of 29 topic sessions or workshops.  The scientific contribution of US academics to PICES is very significant.  Without the support of this award it is likely that the contribution of US academics at the PICES annual meeting would be much less, perhaps reduced by as much as 60%.
