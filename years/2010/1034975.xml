<AbstractNarration>/UCRC for Wood-Based Composites Center &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1035009 Virginia Polytechnic; Charles Frazier &lt;br/&gt;1034975 Oregon State University; Frederick Kamke &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Wood-Based Composites will focus on advancing the material science of wood and wood-based composites. Virginia Polytechnic (VT) and Oregon State University (OSU) are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with VT as the lead institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center will advance the materials science of wood and wood-based composites, by improving the understanding of how wood interacts with adhesives, sealants, and composite manufacturing variables. The Center will promote research in building systems, mechanical and adhesive fastening between wood and non-wood materials, as well as novel material testing and modeling. The PIs also intend to further establish an internationally recognized research center that can help shape public policy, as related to timber management, reforestation, and the reduction of fossil fuel usage by using the advanced products. The two institutions involved in the proposed center have experience in working with industrial partners and conducting research projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of more advanced wood-based composites to be used in applications that currently depend primarily on steel, aluminum or concrete would have a positive impact on the environment and help combat climate change. The proposed Center plans to attract graduate and undergraduate students from a variety of disciplines, and to provide them with an opportunity to interact with industry leaders, thus giving them an understanding of how to apply and transfer fundamental research and impact the industry and the economy.</AbstractNarration>

Furthermore, as CO2-reduction strategies develop, policy-makers and the public will realize that promotion of the forest products industry is an effective Earth-friendly strategy for carbon sequestration.
