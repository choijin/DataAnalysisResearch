<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The research conducted during my NSF-EAPSI fellowship at Nagoya City University in Japan uses a combination of Econometric and Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) analysis to evaluate the potential effects of the Special Safeguard Mechanism (SSM), which is a controversial proposal, included in the current Draft Modalities for Agriculture in the World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations under the Doha Development Agenda. The SSM under discussion would allow developing country members of the WTO to levy additional safeguard tariffs on agricultural commodity imports under certain conditions in the market. The SSM includes two triggers, one based on the price of imports and one on the volume of imports. This research investigates the specific economic implications of the SSM to inform governments and policy makers of the effects that the policy may have on global commodity markets. Specifically, this work investigates the history of safeguards within the WTO and the specific design of the SSM, econometrically estimates the frequency and duration of potential SSM invocation, and quantifies the potential effects of the SSM on cereal grains markets. This work highlights that although the policy is proposed as a pro-development mechanism, the potential for poverty alleviation as a result of the SSM is questionable. The work resulting from my NSF-EAPSI fellowship has broader impacts by providing direct policy implications as the study investigates a current proposal that is being negotiated within the WTO. An extension of my NSF-EAPSI research has provided for the development of replication and simulation exercises that are currently being used in graduate and post-graduate courses in agricultural policy analysis at Purdue University.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/31/2011<br>      Modified by: Amanda&nbsp;M&nbsp;Leister</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
