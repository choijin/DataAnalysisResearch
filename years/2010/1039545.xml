<AbstractNarration>The International Meshing Roundtable was created in 1992 to form a focal point for discussing mesh and grid generation and related topics. The International Meshing Roundtable is organized by Sandia National Laboratories, and thus has always taken place within the United States. This conference is the only U.S.- based conference with a sole focus on mesh and grid generation. Other potential topics for discussion at the meeting include: computational geometry issues for meshing, parallel meshing, mesh adaptation, analysis&lt;br/&gt;of meshing algorithms, and applications of meshing including computer graphics, geometric modeling, biomedical applications, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 19th International Meshing Roundtable will be held October 3-6, 2010 in Chattanooga, TN. The conference will include short courses, a keynote talk, a banquet with a speaker, three invited talks, presentation of conference papers, presentation of research notes, a poster session, a professional development session targeting students and postdocs, and a reception.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports student and postdoc participation in the conference. In particular, NSF support will be used for student/postdoc conference registration and travel, and for professional staff support.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mesh generation refers to the discretization of a geometry which serves as an approximation of the geometry as required by geometry-based analysis techniques.  Meshes have been used in computer simulations in engineering, science, and medicine, as well in numerous applications including computer graphics and clothing design, for example.  At the 19th International Meshing Roundtable, there were numerous presentations on recent research that has been conducted on mesh generation and related geometric topics.  The presentations took the form of presentations by invited speakers and contributed presentations in the form of refereed conference papers, research notes, and poster presentations.  The presentations focused on new algorithms for mesh generation and geomtery, analysis of mesh generation and geometry algorithms, and novel applications in these areas. The conference website is http://www.imr.sandia.gov/19imr/index.html .  In particular, the peer-reviewed papers that were presented at the conference were published in the following book:  Shontz, Suzanne M., editor, "Proceedings of the 19th International Meshing Roundtable", Springer-Verlag, p.510, 2010.  Additional research notes that were presented at the conference can be found online (along with the refereed conference papers) at http://www.imr.sandia.gov/papers/imr19.html .  All of the research presented at the conference advances the knowledge of the international community in the areas of mesh generation and geometry techniques, analayis, and applications, and will impact the fields of computer science, mathematics, engineering, science, medicine, and other application areas where meshes and geometry may someday prove useful.  Our NSF grant was used to offer students and postdocs travel grants to attend the conference.  This enabled students to present their research in the form of conference papers, research notes, and papers.  Some students were also funded to attend the conference to learn about research in the area.  The conference presented students and postdocs with the opportunity to gain invaluable feedback on their research endeavors.  There were a few sessions at the conference, open to all, that were especially geared towards student and postdoc attendees.  These sessions included pre-conference short courses which trained attendees in various new areas of mesh generation.  There was also a professional development session in which students heard experts speak on their careers in academia, government, and industry in the United States and abroad.
