<AbstractNarration>Over the past decade, Internet usage has grown by more than 3.5 times,&lt;br/&gt;to about 1.6 billion users; about 300 million of these are broadband&lt;br/&gt;subscribers.  Unfortunately, despite this growing penetration and users'&lt;br/&gt;increasing reliance on broadband networks for critical or&lt;br/&gt;performance-sensitive applications, neither the research community nor&lt;br/&gt;industry knows much about the performance of access links, or how users&lt;br/&gt;configure and use networks inside the home.  The lack of visibility into&lt;br/&gt;today's home networks makes it nearly impossible to understand the&lt;br/&gt;problems that users experience in these networks, let alone how to fix&lt;br/&gt;them.  A critical first step towards improving our understanding of home&lt;br/&gt;networks is gathering data from homes.  Towards this end, we are&lt;br/&gt;developing a home network measurement infrastructure consisting of (1)&lt;br/&gt;customized routers deployed in homes and (2) a central data collection&lt;br/&gt;server.  We are deploying both the measurement infrastructure across&lt;br/&gt;hundreds of homes and collecting a corpus of active and passive&lt;br/&gt;measurements that will shed more light into home network performance and&lt;br/&gt;use.  Given the proliferation of network devices in the home and the&lt;br/&gt;general public's growing attention to the performance of access&lt;br/&gt;networks, we expect that the infrastructure that we deploy and the data&lt;br/&gt;that we gather from this infrastructure will play in important role in&lt;br/&gt;improving our collective understanding of how home networks are used and&lt;br/&gt;how well they perform.  We will disseminate our results through&lt;br/&gt;conference and journal publications, as well as talks with and&lt;br/&gt;presentations to researchers, policymakers, and practitioners.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Most homes in the US today have broadband connections to the Internet, and this has been the case for several years.  However, relatively little is known about how home networks are used&mdash;especially compared with the many published studies of wide-area and enterprise network usage.  Although internet service providers (cable and telephone companies) have a great deal of data about residential networks, that information is not available to researchers, for reasons of privacy.  Moreover, it generally treats the entire home network as a single unit:  for technical reasons, it is difficult for the provider to distinguish between different devices inside the home network.  However, most homes with a broadband connection today have a small "router" box, which acts as a gateway between the inside home (typically wireless) network and the greater Internet&mdash;all information that goes from the inside to the outside, or vice versa, passes through this gateway.  This home router is ideally situated to collect data about between devices on the home network and the Internet, including which devices are used most, how usage patterns change over time, etc.  They are also in a good position to measure the performance of the residential network&mdash;in particular, whether consumers actually see the speeds advertised by their network service provider.  The goal of this project was to create software to run on home routers that would collect such data.  The availability of such software allows researchers to perform studies with users who are willing to allow their routers to be used to collect data.   The portion of the project conducted at the University of Kentucky Lab for Advanced Networking focused on collecting information about where information is flowing:  which devices on the inside are talking to which destinations on the outside, and how much they are talking.  Unfortunately, there are some concerns that might keep people from wanting to take part in such a study.  The first is privacy:  people may naturally be reluctant to reveal details about their Internet activities, even to advance scientific understanding.  The second is performance: some people may be concerned that the data collection would slow down their network speeds.   These concerns are quite valid.   So we developed software that could overcome them while still collecting useful data.  The system we developed, when installed on a home router&mdash;it cannot be installed without permission of the home user&mdash;collects data about the structure of the information flow between the inside home network and the rest of the Internet.  It removes all identifying address information from the collected data before storing it on an external server; only the information about how many devices, how many external destinations, and how much data flowed between each pair, remains.  Moreover, our software reduces the overhead required to collect this information by a factor of about 20.  The result is that participants' privacy is preserved, and the effect on their network performance is imperceptible.  We believe that our software will make it easier to recruit subjects for large-scale home network data collection experiments.  As an added benefit of installing our system, we present the user with a "dashboard" that shows a graphical summary of the data collected.  The nearby images are screen shots of two of the five data views available in the dashboard.  One shows the number of "flows" or connections between inside and outside network destinations; the other shows the relative amount of data flowing into inside devices from outside sources.  Our software is open source&mdash;available to anyone who wants to use it.  It has been thoroughly tested, and has been running in several homes for months.  We expect that our software will enable new studies of home network usage, and help provide answers to questions like these:  How does the number of network devices change over...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
