<AbstractNarration>Abstract - Machiraju, Rangarajan, and Thompson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As computer power continues to increase, the complexity of simulations also increases thereby producing datasets of unprecedented size.  Without effective analysis tools, results from these large-scale simulations cannot be utilized to their fullest extent. This research addresses the problem of large-data visualization and exploration by employing interactive multi-scale machine learning, which exploits an efficient feature-based, multi-resolution representation of the data. The investigators are leveraging methods from the field of machine learning to perform two distinct tasks: identify regions of interest and enhance robustness of feature detection algorithms. The primary outcome of this effort is the realization of a framework for exploring large datasets. Further, this work is introducing a large body of work in machine learning to the field of visualization. Successful completion of this research will help overcome the brittleness of existing visualization methods and foster expedient discovery in many areas of science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The multi-resolution techniques developed here will employ a two-fold strategy. First, semi-supervised learning based on training with the domain expert is used to develop strategies for selective spatial and temporal refinement of the data.  A classifier is constructed to tag the output of the coarse resolution feature detection (i.e. regions) as either interesting or not interesting. Then at the finest scale, interesting local data chunks containing features of interest are identified for further analysis. Second, several local feature detection algorithms, or weak classifiers, are combined into a single, more robust compound classifier using adaptive boosting, or AdaBoost, and a data adaptive variant called CAVIAR that facilitates validated feature detection. Ideally, the compound classifier combines the best of all weak classifiers as they respond to the underlying physical signal. This research is demonstrating the effectiveness of these methods by applying existing local detection algorithms for visualizing vortices in turbulent flow fields.</AbstractNarration>

We applied the AdaBoost (adaptive boosting) algorithm to flow field field data: We accomplished the original goal of our proposal, which was to adapt the popular AdaBoost ensemble learning algorithm to the analysis of flow data.

We observed that just employing the four detectors as weak learners did not result in satisfactory performance.

Further, we observed that the balance of true positives and true negatives in the training data significantly impacted the efficacy of the compound classifier. Finally, we attempted to include spatial information into the classifier, but were not successful.    We developed a novel consensus-based vortex detection strategy:  As an alternative to the AdaBoost algorithm, we developed a novel analysis technique that employed a consensus-based uncertainty model and introduced spatial proximity to enhance vortex detection results obtained using the point-based methods.  While there exist several popular vortex detection methods that are efficient, local, and easy to implement, most of them require a user-specified, hard threshold and produce binary outputs. Because choosing the right threshold is non-trivial, different vortex detectors can produce different results, which is a source of uncertainty. Our new algorithm employed use four existing point-based local vortex detectors and converted them into fuzzy possibility values using a soft-thresholding approach. We applied a majority voting scheme that identified candidate vortices with a higher degree of confidence. We also introduced a spatial proximity-based analysis to discern the final vortex regions. Our results showed that incorporating this additional information produced improved results relative to the AdaBoost algorithm.     We investigated the role of the expert in machine learning as applied to complex flow data: We developed an interactive procedure to extract a vortex based on coherence of st...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
