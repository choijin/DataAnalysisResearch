<AbstractNarration>This project funds scholarships for a total of 35 undergraduate STEM students and post-baccalaureate career changers in STEM disciplines to become grades 9 through 12 teachers in high-need urban schools located in New York City.  Education and induction of these students is carried out by a partnership involving the Natural Science and the Graduate Education Departments at Fordham University, the Wildlife Conservation Society at the Bronx Zoo, other area informal science centers, and several area school districts. Upon acceptance into the education program, both undergraduate and graduate Scholars are individually paired with an in-service teacher who serves as their mentor while they are in school and through the induction period. Pre-service teachers participate in internships during the summer, and there a variety of internship opportunities open to them. For example they can learn how to motivate students to learn by using animals; they can work with New York in-service teachers who are also interning at informal science sites; and they can develop curriculum that can used in formal and informal science settings. Towards the end of their educational training, the Noyce Scholars participate in a 3-day per week clinical experience in one of the partnership schools. During induction, teachers meet with their mentor in-service teacher, participate in an online e-community site, and attend a retreat at the Zoo.</AbstractNarration>

Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this Report are those of the PI and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation; NSF has not approved or endorsed its content.  Award Title: Fordham University/Wildlife Conservation Society Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program Federal Award ID: 1035391 Report Submission Period: 08/04/2010 to 08/31/2018   Lead Program Coordinators:   Dr. John Craven, Project Director  Dr. Grace Vernon, Co-PI  Dr. Deborah Luckett, Co-PI  Dr. Jennell Ives, Co-PI  Intellectual Merit. To date, program objectives were being met by 21 recipients of NSF funding to complete to their Master Science in Teaching (MST) along with a commitment to teaching at least 2 years in a High Needs School Districts in exchange for funding received.  Broader Impact.  The Fordham University/Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) partnership tapped the resources of the Wildlife Conservation Society (Bronx Zoo) and Fordham University Graduate School of Education?s deep store of research and teaching expertise to recruit and prepare high quality science teachers committed to teaching in a high needs school district.  Overall Outcomes of the Fordham University/Wildlife Conservation Society Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program are broken out by program goals.  Four key program goals and their outcomes are provided below.  Goal 1. Respond to the critical need for K-12 teachers of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) by encouraging talented STEM students and professionals to pursue teaching careers in secondary schools.  Outcome: Twenty-one (21) highly qualified science majors and/or career changers were funded by the program to complete their certification program and teach in a high needs school district.  Goal 2. Provide funding and programmatic supports to talented STEM majors and professionals as they prepare to become K-12 teachers,  Outcome: Funds from NSF were used to support the candidates in the program to cover tuition (up to 100%), support summer training experiences in non-formal learning environments, and attend professional society conferences such as the National Science Teachers Association?s National Conference.  Goal 3. Increase the number of K-12 teachers with strong STEM content knowledge who teach in high-need school districts by requiring scholarship and stipend recipients to complete two years of teaching in a high-need school district for each year of support.  Outcome: All STEM majors and/or career-changers supported by NSF to complete the teacher education program were required to sign a formal, legal commitment obligating them to teach in a high needs school district in exchange for financial support for tuition, summer training, and other professional development requirements required by the teacher education program.  Goal 4. Produce science teachers who can both make and provide evidence of their positive impact on student learning.  Outcome: All 21 awardees in the program were required to complete a documentation to demonstrate their ability to positively impact student learning in the classroom.  In the last 3 years of the program, awardees were required to submit a portfolio for external evaluation that focused largely on impact on student learning (i.e. the EDPTA).  EDTPA submissions from program graduates resulted in a 100% pass rate.
