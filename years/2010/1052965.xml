<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for US students and lecturers to attend the first "Biennial African School on Fundamental Physics and its Applications" to be held at the Stellenbosch University near Capetown. The school will last 3 weeks and be located in the region of sub-Saharan Africa. There will be three main topics at the school: 1) theoretical physics, 2) experimental sub-atomic physics and 3) accelerators and technologies. The contents will be aimed primarily at doctoral students and on students finishing their last year of university studies, but young researchers will also be encouraged to apply. This school will serve as an opportunity for US students and professional physicists to interact with their counterparts in sub-Saharan Africa and to form collaborations and partnerships.</AbstractNarration>

This was the first school of its type to be held in sub-Saharan Africa. The school drew students from all of Africa (but mostly from the sub-Saharan part), as well as from Europe and North America.

The school also allowed for cultural and intellecutual exchanges between the US-based lecturers and students, and the African participants.&nbsp;</p> <p>A total of 65 students participated in ASP2010, including 61 students from 18 African countries, one student from India and one each from the US, Canada and Switzerland. Sixteen percent of the students were female.
