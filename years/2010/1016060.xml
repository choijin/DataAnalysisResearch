<AbstractNarration>A large number of structural components in engineering  can be classified as &lt;br/&gt;plates. Typical examples  of civil engineering structures are floor and &lt;br/&gt;foundation slabs, lock-gates, thin retaining walls, bridge decks, and slab &lt;br/&gt;bridges. Plates are also indispensable in ship building, automobile, and &lt;br/&gt;aerospace industries. The  stress resultants of a thin plate can be calculated &lt;br/&gt;through the 3-dimensional elasticity equations. However, under certain &lt;br/&gt;hypotheses, the 3-dimensional elasticity equations for a  plate  are reduced  &lt;br/&gt;to the 2-dimensional equations. The Kirchhoff plate model  is well suited for  &lt;br/&gt;thin  plates. However,  the governing equation for the displacement of  this &lt;br/&gt;plate model is the fourth order differential equation. The conventional finite &lt;br/&gt;element method is difficult to apply  because  of the complexity of  &lt;br/&gt;constructing smooth finite elements. Furthermore, moderately thick plates have &lt;br/&gt;other difficulties such as  boundary layer problems and shear  locking &lt;br/&gt;problems. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Meshless methods (in which smooth flexible approximation functions are used &lt;br/&gt;and complicated mesh generation is not necessary)  have several advantages &lt;br/&gt;over the conventional finite element method.  However,  these  methods have &lt;br/&gt;several major limitations including  the inefficiency in handling essential  &lt;br/&gt;boundary conditions, large matrix condition numbers, and complexity in &lt;br/&gt;constructing partitions of unity.  Most recently, the PI invented  one of the &lt;br/&gt;most  flexible  closed form partition of unity, called the Generalized Product &lt;br/&gt;Partition of Unity.  The PI proposes to introduce  Meshfree particle methods  &lt;br/&gt;by using the Generalized Product Partition of Unity,  together with new local &lt;br/&gt;approximation functions that can handle geometric boundary conditions as well  &lt;br/&gt;as force boundary conditions  arising in various plate models. Furthermore, &lt;br/&gt;the PI proposes to apply  Meshfree particle  methods  to obtain highly &lt;br/&gt;accurate  stress analysis of plates and shells for design and maintenance of &lt;br/&gt;related engineering structures. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Intellectual Merit: The proposed research will greatly improve the stress &lt;br/&gt;analysis of plates, shells,  and laminated composite plates so that design and &lt;br/&gt;maintenance  of automobiles, airplanes, ships, and all other engineering &lt;br/&gt;structures related to plates and shells  may be more effective and safer.  &lt;br/&gt;Moreover, without any difficulty, the proposed method is able to surgically &lt;br/&gt;make the approximation space  enriched with any type of singular function.  &lt;br/&gt;The proposed method is flexible and effective in dealing with singularities &lt;br/&gt;and  it can be used for accurate prediction of crack propagation. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Broader Impacts: Results from the proposed research can be used to design &lt;br/&gt;fuel efficient automobiles, safer airplanes, ships  and new materials more &lt;br/&gt;resistant to failure. The proposed research   can also be applied to improve &lt;br/&gt;maintenance of aging airliners, bridges, ships, buildings, and numerous other &lt;br/&gt;applications where structural integrity should be closely monitored. &lt;br/&gt;Ultimately,  the  proposed research  will  have  direct impacts on the public &lt;br/&gt;safety and the environment by increasing efficiency and safety of  common &lt;br/&gt;modes of transportation and structures used everyday.</AbstractNarration>
