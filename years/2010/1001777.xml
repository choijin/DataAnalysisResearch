<AbstractNarration>The principal goal of the research project is to address some of the new analytical &lt;br/&gt;questions of the theory of integrable systems which emerged from the recent developments in random matrix theory and in the related areas of exactly solvable quantum models. The problems under consideration include the  analytical description   of the Painlev\'e  - type universalities in random matrix theory and the related study of special families of Painlev\'e transcendents and generalized Painlev\'e  transcendents arising in the critical asymptotics in  random matrices, statistical mechanics  and in the  enumerative topology. The third direction of the project is concerned with the analytical investigation of  the crossover phenomena in the classical theory of Toeplitz and Hankel determinants, i.e. with the study of the Painlev\'e-type transition behavior between different non-critical asymptotic regimes exhibited by large size Toeplitz and Hankel determinants.  Each of the above mentioned directions is represented by a collection of concrete problems,  and they are proposed to be investigated within the same analytical framework,  which is the Riemann-Hilbert method.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of integrable systems is an expanding area  which plays an&lt;br/&gt;increasingly important role as one of the principal sources of new analytical and algebraic ideas for many branches of modern mathematics and theoretical physics. Simultaneously, it provides an efficient analytical tool for study of some of the fundamental  mathematical models arising in  modern nonlinear science and technology. The  new areas where the analytic techniques of integrable systems become more and more common  include random matrices, quantum field and string theories, enumerative topology,  stochastic  processes, number theory, and, most recently, entanglement in quantum  chain systems  which is expected to play prominent role in future  quantum computing  technology. The  problems considered in the proposal  have direct connections  with  the mentioned disciplines. In particular,  part of the proposal related to the  Toeplitz and Hankel determinants  is primary  motivated by the needs of the analytical theory  of quantum entanglement and by the challenges of analytical description of critical behavior in important stochastic and quantum field models. This part of the proposal is also&lt;br/&gt;essential for  testing the random matrix predictions in number theory.  Proposed study of the Painlev\'e - type universalities and the families of special Painlev\'e functions has  direct relation to enumerative topology and string theory. Success in  achievement of the proposal's goals will  have a notable impact on  research in all these areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The term ``Integrable Systems''  usually refers to mathematical objects, most often differential equations, with  special  symmetry properties  which allow to study them in a very detailed way and sometimes even to solve them  in a closed form. The class of integrable systems includes  several fundamental equations of nature, and the mathematical foundations of integrable systems go back to classical works of Liouville, Gauss, and Poincare. In our days, the theory of integrable systems has become  an expanding area  which plays an increasingly important role as one of the principal sources of new analytical and algebraic ideas for many branches of modern mathematics and theoretical physics. Simultaneously, it provides an efficient analytical tool for the study of some of the fundamental  mathematical models arising in  modern nonlinear science and technology.  The proposal was devoted to the investigation of  the analytical aspects of the theory of integrable systems related to the random matrix theory, orthogonal polynomials, and  to the theory of Toeplitz matrices and determinants. The main   results of this three year research program are the following.  (i) A new universality class for unitary matrix ensembles whose weight  has a root singularity at the edge  of the support of equilibrium measure  has been described.   (ii) Higher order analogs of the well known Tracy-Widom distribution corresponding  to the higher universality classes in the edge behavior  of the usual unitary ensembles, have been obtained.  (iii) The proof of the long-standing conjecture of Basor and Tracy concerning the asymptotics of Toeplitz determinants with a Fisher-Hartwig symbol  of general form, has been obtained   (iv) The asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz determinants, as the symbol is deformed from smooth Szeg\H{o} to singular  Fisher-Hartwig type,  has been obtained. The result generalizes the celebrated scaling theory for 2D Ising model of Wu, McCoy, Tracy and Barouch.  (v)  A detailed description of the  spectrum of large Toeplitz matrices  has been obtained  Previously known results (Bottcher et.al.)  have been generalized and some of  important  conjectures concerning the large Toeplitz matrices (Sobolev et. al.) have been proven.  (vi) The asymptotic analysis of the block Toeplitz determinants associated with the von Neumann entropy of a large class of quantum spin chains has been performed.  The research which led to the above listed results was primarily motivated by the intrinsic needs of  the modern  theory of integrable systems, notably  by the needs of  development of the novel analytic apparatus,  the so-called Riemann-Hilbert Method.  In what  follows, the broader impact of  the work  done in the project is described.   Results concerning the new universality classes in random matrix theory: These results  contribute to the development of this important new area whose probabilistic  laws govern  the statistical properties of large systems which do not  obey the standard laws  of classical probability. Such systems appear in many different scientific areas, and in applied  science and technology. In particular, such systems include heavy nuclei, polymer growth,  high-dimensional data  analysis, and  certain percolation processes.    Results concerning  the asymptotic analysis of Toeplitz determinants:  These results contribute to the study  of critical phenomena in statistical mechanics, i.e., to the study of phase transitions - an enduring, fundamental  problem in the field.  Specifically,  the proof of the Basor-Tracy conjecture has  already made it possible to justify  various  asymptotic formulae that appeared   previously in the physical literature on the basis of this conjecture. These results have also been used in condensed matter physics  in recent studies of  quantum  many-body systems  away  from  equilibrium and in testing  random matrix predictions  in number theory.  Results concerning  block Toeplitz determinants: Th...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
