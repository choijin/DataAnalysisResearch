Another important parameter for ferroelectric materials is the temperature at which the material loses its ferroelectric response. This is known as the Curie temperature and is a material specific quantity. For barium titante produced by the hydrothermal method used here, the reported Curie temperatures are in the range of 124-136&deg;C. To investigate the Curie temperature for this material, the sample was heated to different temperatures and hysteresis loop measurements were performed for each temperature step. Due to the limitations of the testing equipment we were unable to precisely determine the Curie temperature but we were...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
