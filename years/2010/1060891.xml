<AbstractNarration>SES-1060891&lt;br/&gt;Paul Mohai&lt;br/&gt;University of Michigan Ann Arbor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-1060882&lt;br/&gt;Manuel Pastor&lt;br/&gt;University of Southern California&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-1060904&lt;br/&gt;James Boyce&lt;br/&gt;Michael Ash&lt;br/&gt;University of Massachusetts-Amherst&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the past two decades there has been increasing interest in understanding the extent and causes of racial and socioeconomic inequalities in the distribution of environmental burdens. This interest has been spurred by a visible and growing environmental justice movement, by public concerns about the health and other quality of life consequences of pollution, and by increasing government attention to these issues. This study analyzes the geographic distribution of airborne industrial toxic pollution in the United States over time to address several questions: (i) Have rates of reduction in air pollution risk over time differed between low-income and predominantly minority communities and other communities? (ii) How does the interaction between income and race/ethnicity as correlates of exposure to point-source air toxics vary across regions and across industrial sectors? (iii) How does individual mobility affect racial and socioeconomic disparities in cumulative exposure: who moves, who stays, and do those who move relocate to more or less polluted localities? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study uses a unique dataset from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Risk Screening Environmental Indicators Geographic Microdata (RSEI-GM). The data offer a fine-grained picture of exposure to industrial toxic air releases identified by chemical and source facility for the entire U.S. for the years 1988-2007. The study will merge the RSEI-GM data with tract-level socioeconomic and demographic data from the 1990 and 2000 Censuses and the 2004-2009 pooled American Community Survey as well as individual-level data from the 1986-2001 Americans Changing Lives Survey. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will establish an infrastructure for the development, maintenance, and sharing of the complex RSEI-GM pollution-exposure database, spatially merging it with social, economic, demographic, and health data, and training graduate students in the management and use of the data. The project will make analytic results available in useful format to public and private decision-makers, including communities, regulators, shareholders, and other stakeholders.</AbstractNarration>

This interest has been spurred by a visible and growing environmental justice movement, by public concerns about the health and other quality of life consequences of pollution, and by increasing government attention to these issues. This study analyzed the geographic distribution of airborne industrial toxic pollution in the U.S. over time to address the question of how individual mobility affects racial and socioeconomic disparities in cumulative pollution exposure over the life course.  Nearly all quantitative environmental justice analyses have relied on census data to determine the extent that environmental hazards are distributed disproportionately by race and socioeconomic status and whether such disparities have increased or decreased over time. However, census data characterize geographic areas and not groups of people. If the demographic characteristics of a neighborhood near an environmental hazard change over time, we do not know where the "old" residents have migrated to or where the "new" residents have migrated from. Thus, we do not know whether pollution burdens increase or decrease for specific individuals or groups of people over their life course, and whether these increases and decreases are different for various groups based on race, socioeconomic and other demographic characteristics.  Longitudinal panel data provide an opportunity to characterize the environmental quality under which people live over time, to assess if these burdens increase or decrease for certain individuals and groups, and to determine whether racial and socioeconomic disparities in these burdens are linked to racial and socioeconomic disparities in future health outcomes and mortality. We used the Americans Changing Lives Study (ACL) to determine whether respondents who moved since 1986 have moved to more or less polluted environments and whether the patterns are different for groups based on race and socioeconomic status. We also determined whether pollution burdens have increased or decreased in the neighborhoods of people who have not moved and whether the patterns are different based on race and socioeconomic status. The ACL is a nationally representative panel study of the American population.  In the 1986 ACL baseline, face-to-face interviews were conducted with a stratified, multistage sample of 3617 non-institutionalized adults 25 years or older in the coterminous U.S.  ACL respondents were re-interviewed in 1989, 1994, and 2001.   Air pollution data were taken from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency?s (EPA) Risk Screening Environmental Indicators Geographic Microdata (RSEI-GM). RSEI-GM is modeled from the emissions data in EPA?s Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) and is used by EPA to compare relative risks to human health imposed by TRI facilities.  The model used to create the RSEI-GM data is a Gaussian-plume fate-and-transfer model. Taking into account factors associated with the emitted chemicals (e.g., stack height, exit-gas velocities, and prevailing wind current), this model determines the transportation rates and fate of the chemicals into areas adjacent to the facility.  Specifically, the quantities of the emitted chemicals are estimated for every one-kilometer grid cell in a 101 x 101 kilometer square area centered at the facility. Each of the chemicals is furthermore weighted by its toxicity to human health and the weighted quantities of all the chemicals are then summed to produce a total toxic concentration score for each cell. RSEI-GM data are available for the years between 1988 and 2010. Using GIS, the total toxic air concentrations from TRI facilities within 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 kilometers of the geographic point locations of ACL 1, 2, 3, and 4 respondents were determined and compared.   The principal findings of this study include the following:  Pollution burdens are generally greater for people who have moved than for people who have not moved between 1986 and 2001, Pollution burdens in the late 1980s (from waves 1 to 2) for everyone increased but decreased from the 1990s to 2001 (from waves 2 to 3 to 4), Pollution burdens for African Americans have tended to be greater than for whites No apparent pollution disparities based on income were found, Pollution burdens for African Americans who moved between waves 1 and 2 increased more greatly than for whites who moved, However, from waves 2 to 3 to 4 pollution burdens for African Americans who moved decreased more greatly than for whites who moved, The pollution burdens for African American who did not move also decreased more greatly than for whites who did not move, Although African Americans and whites were closing the gap in pollution disparities between 1986 and 2001, racial disparities still persisted in 2001 (wave 4).    The above findings suggest the following new research questions:  What has driven the decreasing air pollution gaps between African American and whites over time? To what extent are racial disparities in pollution burdens over time related to racial disparities in health outcomes and mortality over time?
