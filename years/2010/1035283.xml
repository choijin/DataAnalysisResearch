<AbstractNarration>The University of Rochester, in partnership with the Rochester City School District and the Rochester Museum and Science Center, are developing one cohort of 24 K-12 master teachers in science and/or mathematics in this high-need school district, with the long-term goal of building capacity for sustaining high quality mathematics and science teaching. Master Teaching Fellows are engaging in coursework and mentored practice focused on increasing the teachers' knowledge and skills in STEM content, pedagogy, reform-based instructional materials and assessments, professional development, and leadership. The Fellows serve as role models, professional development providers, and instructional leaders for current and prospective teachers in the district. The five-year professional development program for the Fellows focuses each year on a different dimension of their roles as master teachers, with specific emphases on examining their own teaching practices, serving as mentors to other in-service and pre-service STEM teachers, providing professional development through courses and summer institutes, serving as change agents promoting STEM education innovations in the school district, and sustaining STEM education reform. The professional development program is being carried out through graduate-level courses, mentored field experiences pertinent to each year's focus, and monthly leadership seminars. A subset of Master Teaching Fellows is also completing additional requirements necessary to obtain state certification as a school or district leader and/or completing an Ed.D. program to further prepare them to serve specific roles in the district's STEM reform plan. The final two years of the project are designed to provide a transition to post-funding so as to build long-term sustainability, by engaging Fellows in work alongside district leaders in developing and implementing STEM education reform initiatives. The program evaluation is assessing the impact of the program on the Fellows' effectiveness as STEM teachers and leaders in order to advance knowledge about what it takes to prepare master teachers who can support other in-service and pre-service teachers in implementing high-quality STEM instruction in urban schools.</AbstractNarration>

The project began with a focus on K-12 mathematics/science instruction by engaging fellows in inquiring into their own practice as STEM teachers and moving towards seeing themselves as STEM leaders (Years 1 + 2).  In Year 3, the focus was on developing as STEM leaders by influencing others through content-focused coaching (West &amp; Staub, 2003).  Year 4 focused on another aspect of leadership by supporting and scaffolding fellows? abilities to provide high quality math and science professional development.  Year 5 activities centered around fellows continuing to grow their "spheres of influence," as they engaged as "change agents" by developing and enacting the first year of a five-year plan to impact math and science instruction. Fellows were mentored throughout the life of the project by veteran educators who had leadership and reform-minded teaching experience in math and/or science.  A no-cost extension Year 6 allowed for important and ongoing support for fellows as they moved into a second year of this five-year personal leadership plan for improving math/science in the district, helping them refine their plans and to capitalize on each other?s efforts and lessons learned.  This supported the intent to build internal long term capacity for enacting high quality math and science teaching in the Rochester City School District (RCSD).     Complementing the above foci, all fellows took graduate coursework in teaching and learning, communication and urban settings, and leadership for a total of 1,388 graduate credits (an average of 77.1 credits/fellow).  A unique aspect of our project was that, through the support of this project, 5 Fellows earned Ed.D. degrees, 6 Fellows earned a Certificate of Advanced Study (CAS) in Building Level Leadership, and 1 Fellow received a Certificate in Program Evaluation all at the Warner Graduate School of Education, University of Rochester.     Over the course of the project, Fellows have impacted hundreds of teachers in RCSD through their teacher leadership.  They have engaged in coaching work to support math and science teachers in their classrooms as they worked to design and implement instruction in line with research on how people learn and to enact the CCSSM and NGSS.  They have provided dozens of high quality professional development institutes for math and science teachers in RCSD and the region. They have participated in building level leadership committees, curriculum committees, diversity/cultural committees, held grade level and department level leadership positions, and made connections with outside agencies.       Issues of equity and social justice are at the core of our work, particularly as they are related to math and science teaching and learning. One fellow presented at the University of Rochester Diversity Conference to faculty, staff and community members and also provided a professional development institute that intertwined social justice and mathematical inquiry in order to teach for social change and student empowerment.  Another fellow worked with teachers to support the construction of a makerspace in a school that serves ELL students with interrupted formal education.  The institute provided teachers with foundational opportunities to design lessons and units utilizing a makerspace for students to engage in scientific inquiry and engineering.     Particularly noteworthy is that six of the fellows are working at East High, a high needs school in the district where the University of Rochester is the Educational Partnership Organization (EPO). The EPO provides the governance and stewardship of this school in its transformation to a successful urban public school - called for due to East?s identification as a "Failing School" by NYSED. In this initiative, 3 fellows are teacher leaders who have partial release from their classroom teaching to provide high quality embedded professional learning to teachers in their content area. This professional learning builds upon the components that were the strong foundation of this MTF program.  In addition, three fellows were hired as math/science teachers at East (a rigorous hiring process conducted by the University of Rochester as the receivership organization), a testament to their work and leadership in this project which will have long-term effects and will contribute to the larger field in "turn-around school" efforts.     Lastly, by leveraging the collective experiences throughout this project, the Phase I Fellows played a foundational role in the recently funded UR?s Noyce MTF Phase II project through the recruitment phase and as "senior fellows." They continue to effect change in RCSD and beyond as they enact "lessons learned" and the knowledge and experience they gained through Noyce.
