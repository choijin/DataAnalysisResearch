<AbstractNarration>Funds are provided for an EAGER award that will constrain and investigate the age of mummified forest remains that are exposed at a site on Ellesmere Island, Canada. Initial stratigraphic correlation and palynological analyses of a paleosol sample collected during a site visit in 2009, and wood species identification, suggest that this mummified material may be Jurassic in age. Therefore, these remains may be significantly older than the Tertiary dated mummified material described at other sites in the Arctic and would be the only mummified material of this antiquity reported globally. The excellent preservation of mummified material offers investigative opportunities that are not possible with fossilized material. For example individual components, such as รก-cellulose may be extracted from mummified tree trunks to determine environmental water and relative humidity characteristics at annual resolution, while comparison of specific plant components, e.g. leaf cuticles, from mummified material and contemporary samples of the same species may be used to elucidate the paleogeography and evolution and of that species. Finally, the characterization of individual organelles in mummified plant material may be used to determine paleoenvironmental conditions such as light intensity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conditions that lead to the exquisite preservation of mummified macrofossils may also permit the preservation of other macro- and microfossils that would not be preserved in the fossil record, e.g. beetle fauna. The presence of this material also presents the opportunity to elucidate mechanisms for organic matter preservation over geological time scales. Given the hypothesized Jurassic age of the mummified deposits and the exquisite preservation of the forest material, this site presents the unique opportunity to characterize paleo-physical, botanical and environmental conditions during the Jurassic and is an exceedingly valuable field site for scientific investigation.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The climate of the high Arctic is currently too harsh to support forest ecosystems.  However, millions of years ago, during a periods when Arctic climate was warmer than it is today, the high Arctic was characterized by mixed forests and grasslands, and the plants and insects which inhabited these ecosystems are preserved in so-called "fossil forests" today.  As such, the discovery of "fossil forests" in Arctic has provided a tantalizing peek at Arctic ecosystems in geologic time.  These forests preserve material in a mummified state, as opposed to the more common "petrified" state, which permits a greater range of analyses to determine past ecosystem characteristics using techniques that would be used for forest material today.  During this project, we characterized a new fossil forest site located at &gt;80 degrees north latitude on Ellesmere Island, Canada, which is the only such site discovered in the Canadian high Arctic in the last decade.  Here, forest remains of insects, leaves, seeds, cones and wood from Pine, Spruce, Larch and Alder are preserved in a mummified state.  These remains are at least 3 million years old and originate from the Pliocene epoch.  These forest remains have been transported from their original position and buried by a low energy land slide and this quick burial likely helped to preserve the remains in their mummified current mummified state.  By examining chemical compounds in the soil that are specific to individual organisms or types of organisms (biomarkers), we were able to determine that this was a pine-dominate forest not unlike forests that currently exist in the boreal forests of Asia.
