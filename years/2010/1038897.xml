<AbstractNarration>1038897&lt;br/&gt;d'Errico&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support the development of a large volume superheated emulsion detector for fast neutrons.  The proposed instrument will have a 100% duty cycle, be insensitive to gammas, and be sensitive to the higher parts of the Watt spectrum i.e. neutrons with energies over 3 MeV.  The bubbles in this bubble chamber-like detector will be counted by optical readout annealing fairly quickly in 5 seconds at 20 atm.  Both acoustic and optical readout methods will be evaluated.  It is a novel concept to address the need for neutron detection within the context of depleted resources of He-3.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this proposal address the training of the next generation of nuclear scientists and engineers by engaging them in cutting-edge research activities. The PI plans to enhance and develop courses, which will include hands-on laboratory experiments with radiation sources. The multi-disciplinary nature of the collaboration will expose students to a broad range of experiences, which will be facilitated by co-mentoring provided by the faculty involved.</AbstractNarration>
