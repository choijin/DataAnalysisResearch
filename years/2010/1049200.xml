<AbstractNarration>Intelectual Merit. The development and application of an integrated technology-driven earth system model for community use will provide a realistic assessment of the effects of global changes on air quality, water stress, and forest carbon sequestration and nitrogen uptake during 2046-2055 relative to 2001-2010 over global, regional, and urban domains.  Results from this project has potential to help policy makers to assess current and future multiple-pollutant emission control strategies for co-benefits of climate change mitigation, air quality control, and agro-eco management.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact. The integrated earth system model will benefit the scientific community, U.S. federal and state governmental agencies, and other stakeholders and end users for both scientific research and regulatory decision analyses. Such a system has potential for far-reaching consequences for issues ranging from forecasting climate and economy change and climate change adaptation and mitigation at all scales to the promotion of global sustainable development.  The interdisciplinary nature of the research will provide a significant opportunity to train post-docs and students and broaden the pool for future scientists at the interface of energy, atmospheric chemistry, meteorology, climate, hydrology, ecology, and computer sciences.</AbstractNarration>

Our major findings are summarized below.     The introduction of new technologies has a major influence on pollutant emissions. Overall, the emissions over CONUS are reduced for most gas and PM species under future TDM/A1B and TDM/B2 scenarios, relative to the current decade.  The improved CESM/CAM5 and WRF/Chem show overall good skill in reproducing observed climate/concentrations on a decadal scale.  Downscaled WRF/Chem simulations of current decade perform better than those of CESM/CAM5, and finer scale simulations at 4- and 12-km resolution outperform those at 36-km using WRF/Chem.  Enhanced future O3 levels under RCP8.5/TDM A1B are attributed to warmer climate, higher CH4/BVOC emissions, and dis-benefit of NOx reduction in VOC-limited regime. O3 responds differently to projected changes in anthropogenic emissions in different states and regions and different seasons, indicating a need to develop state- and city-specific emission control strategies for different seasons. Climate change offsets the benefits of reduced anthropogenic emissions to O3 concentrations and exceedances.  Greater reduction in PM2.5 by RCP 4.5/8.5 than TDM B2/A1B and decreased O3 over most areas by RCP4.5 and TDM B2 indicate the benefits of carbon policy and technology changes with greater emission reductions and importance of win-win emission control strategies in mitigating air pollution and adverse climate change. Future climate change may result in a significant reduction in water yield but an increase in forest productivity. The notable divergence in ecosystem services of water supply and carbon sequestration will intensify under higher greenhouse gas emission and associated climate change in the future, posing greater challenges to managing national forests. Regional chemistry-aerosol feedbacks may largely offset the future warming and wetting trends predicted by GCMs over CONUS without considering air pollution. Consequently, the interactions of air pollution and climate change will significantly reduce water availability and also moderately decline ecosystem productivity in some regions by the middle of 21st century. The results suggest that air pollution may largely suppress water and carbon fluxes, and particularly aggravate regional climate change impact on water shortage.      Our results will help policy makers and other stakeholders to assess current and future multiple-pollutant emission control strategies for co-benefits of climate change mitigation, air quality control, and forest ecosystem management.  They provide important inputs to climate and hydrology communities and also help increase public awareness of climate change and its impacts on air pollution, water supplies, and ecosystem, as well as their interplays.  The interdisciplinary nature of this project has provided a significant training opportunity for a number of post-docs and students at the interface of energy, atmospheric sciences, hydrology, and ecology.  Our results produce 104 conference presentations and 60 published journal papers with additional 6 papers in review and 4 papers in preparation.
