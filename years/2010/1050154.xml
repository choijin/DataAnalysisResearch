<AbstractNarration>Dinosaurs present unequaled potential to combine significant science with meaningful public outreach. The Visible Dinosaur project addresses both missions by integrating the results of previous NSF-funded research by the PIs with new studies to restore the head anatomy of numerous dinosaurs in an engaging 3D virtual computer environment. The time is right for this ambitious project: anatomical studies are now so advanced that reliable inferences can be made about dinosaur noses, ears, eyes, brains, muscles, blood vessels, nerves, and skin, and, moreover, the technology is now available to analyze it all simultaneously in 3D. The Visible Dinosaur is the first effort to view all anatomical systems together in an integrated, rigorous manner within an interactive 3D virtual environment for anything other than perhaps humans. Huge amounts of 3D data will be generated, archived, and disseminated, representing a significant contribution to cyberinfrastructure. Dinosaur science will have a new benchmark, permitting a new level of scientific sophistication. The project will attract diverse scientists to lend their expertise, fostering new collaborative research networks. The Visible Dinosaur project is innovative in integrating public outreach into its core, using Web 2.0 implementations (YouTube, Facebook, blogs, etc.), mainstream media (news releases, TV/radio documentaries), and plain-language video treatments of primary research. The Visible Dinosaur will benefit society by exploiting interest in dinosaurs to talk meaningfully to a very broad audience about evolution, biology, scientific methods, and the value of science generally. From this initial project, it is hoped to build an even broader network of scientists, educators, media arts professionals, and even policymakers to realize the full potential of the Visible Dinosaur.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Dinosaurs present unequaled potential to combine significant science with meaningful public outreach. The Visible Interactive Dinosaur project (VID) was a highly successful project that, over the course of 4.5 years (2011&ndash;2015) addressed both of these missions by integrating the results of previous NSF-funded research by the PIs with new studies to restore the head anatomy of numerous dinosaurs in an engaging 3D virtual computer environment. The time was right for this ambitious project: anatomical studies are now so advanced that reliable inferences can be made about dinosaur anatomy, and, moreover, the technology is now available to analyze it all simultaneously in 3D. The Visible Interactive Dinosaur was the first effort to view all anatomical systems together in an integrated, rigorous manner within an interactive 3D virtual environment for anything other than perhaps humans. This NSF-funded project has been wildly successful in achieving its three overarching goals: (1) to set a new standard for understanding dinosaur head anatomy and function by integrating findings from previous NSF grants with new findings and innovative new technology, (2) to serve as the foundation or springboard for new research, which it has in that a number of spinoff projects have resulted, including NSF proposals (one of which was funded thus far), and (3) to use the resulting Visible Interactive Dinosaurs as a vehicle to truly have broader impacts by reaching out to a diverse public audience about science and evolution.</p> <p>The grant has been extremely productive by most academic measures, yielding about three dozen peer-reviewed articles, over 20 invited lectures (many of which were public lectures), about 100 conference presentations, 10 completed student theses/dissertations (two undergraduate, one master&rsquo;s, seven PhD&hellip;plus three more PhDs in progress who benefitted from the grant), and about 15 websites disseminating findings from the grant.</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> A fundamental goal of the VID project was to restore head anatomy in dinosaurs as completely as possible, which required not only study of dinosaur fossils, but also study of their modern relatives to better understand the soft-tissues&mdash;for example, the muscles, blood vessels, nerves, brain, eyeballs, skin&mdash;that clothe and animate the skeleton. This kind of soft-tissue reconstruction required our team to study modern-day birds, crocodilians, and lizards in minute detail, using techniques ranging from dissection, injection of blood vessels, and histological thin-slicing to microCT scanning and 3D computer visualization. We studied literally hundreds of specimens which have been accessioned into the Ohio University (OU) Vertebrate Collections (contributing to the physical infrastructure of OU, Ohio, and the USA), and we CT scanned, again, hundreds of modern-day and fossil specimens which we have made available in open-access digital data portals (contributing to the cyberinfrastructure of, again, OU, Ohio, and the nation). Although the studies of modern-day species certainly informed our studies of dinosaurs, they also were important studies on their own, resulting in about nine articles. But the dinosaur studies have been groundbreaking, shedding new light on new anatomical systems and new species (three new species were named as part of the grant research). Engineering techniques, such as Finite Element Analysis, Computational Fluid Dynamics, and Multibody Dynamics, were instrumental in revealing, for the first time, details of dinosaur blood flow, airflow, physiological heat exchange, head and neck movement, eye movements and visual fields, brain structure, and sensory capabilities.
