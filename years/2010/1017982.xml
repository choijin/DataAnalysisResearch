<AbstractNarration>The telecommunications industry is on the verge of major structural change. Historically, the industry's regulator has allocated licenses for the utilization of well-defined bands within the available spectrum. Unlike other commodities, no secondary market for the spectrum has ever developed. Technological limitations as well as legal and regulatory constraints may have contributed to this fact. Today the evidence clearly points to a situation of relative under-utilization of the spectrum. A "cognitive radio network" (CRN) is a new paradigm for wireless communications aimed at enabling a more efficient use of the spectrum. This research project focuses on two significant technical and regulatory issues which must be resolved to ensure successful deployment of cognitive radio networks.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The first issue relates to the network?s ability to manage interference in a distributed fashion without cooperation from the primary users. Here, the research tasks include the analysis, from a signal processing and algorithmic point of view, of various price-based schemes for dynamic spectrum allocation in a broad range of CRN scenarios under a variety of regulatory restrictions. The second relevant issue pertains to the design of a secondary market for the spectrum.  The research investigates the analysis of various design choices taking into account specific spectrum sharing techniques and the associated behavior of sellers (i.e. primary users/primary network service providers (NSP)) and buyers (i.e. cognitive users).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work targets new models to (i) facilitate distributed spectrum sharing and spectrum decision in a broad range of CRN, and to (ii) provide additional insights into the operation of a secondary spectrum market which could prove useful for regulatory design.</AbstractNarration>

The outcomes can be summarized as follows:  1) Interference Pricing Mechanism for Downlink Multicell Coordinated Beamforming   In this task, we considered the downlink coordinated beamforming problem in a cellular network in which the base stations (BSs) are equipped with multiple antennas and each user is equipped with a single antenna.

Numerical results show that the proposed iterative mechanism reduces significantly the exchanged information with respect to other state-of-the-art beam-forming algorithms with very little sum-rate loss.   2) Efficient Rate Allocation in Wireless Networks Under Incomplete Information  We studied the transmit rate allocation problem for a generic wireless system assuming strategic users and incomplete information at the network side. We introduced a novel auction design that allows for the simultaneous identification of prices and spectrum allocation in order to ensure efficiency. The design is iterative in nature, i.e., users engage in several auction rounds before a definitive rate allocation on the achievable rate frontier is identified. At each iteration, discriminatory prices are quoted and users are simply asked to report their desired rate given the quoted prices. We showed that the proposed auction terminates in finite time with the efficient rate allocation of users assuming users truthfully report their rate demand. Truthful demand revelation is shown to be an &epsilon;-dominant strategy, that is, the maximum benefit a user may attain by not being truthful is &epsilon; &gt; 0 and that this value can be made arbitrarily small.    3) Dynamic Incentives for Congestion Control  We considered the problem faced by a network manager whose goal is to control flow demands of a (finite) set of non-cooperative users by dynamically pricing network capacity. Users have private information regarding their utility and autonomously determine their desired flow rates. The network exhibits a congestion externality, i.e. the utility a given user derives from using a set of links in the network is decreasing in the aggregate use of these links. We introduced a new dynamic pricing scheme. We showed that the proposed dynamic pricing scheme effectively controls congestion, i.e. it ensures the efficient allocation of network capacity by self-interested users through dynamic pricing. We show this pricing scheme is robust to strategic manipulation, that is, truthful reporting of optimal flow rates by users is a dominant strategy.   4) A Dynamic Pricing Scheme for Base Station Association and Resource Allocation in Downlink OFDMA Network  We considered  a downlink OFDMA network with multiple base stations (BSs) serving a group of users. The BSs operate on non-overlapping spectrum bands in frequency division duplex (FDD) mode.

Utilizing a key submodularity property of the per- BS throughput function, we characterized the efficiency of the proposed mechanism.   5) Joint Access Point Selection and Power Allocation for Uplink Wireless Networks      We considered the joint access point (AP) selection and power allocation problem in a wireless network with multiple APs and mobile users (MUs...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
