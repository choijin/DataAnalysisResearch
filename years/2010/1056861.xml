<AbstractNarration>Technical: The research component of this CAREER award is to study disorder in thin films of organic semiconductors on metal surfaces at the nanometer scale, using scanning probe techniques. The origin of disorder at metal-organic interfaces is assessed by ultrahigh vacuum scanning tunneling microscopy combined with new quantitative approaches to tunneling spectroscopy in constant current mode that have been explicitly developed for soft materials. The research aims to determine the functional form of the distribution of transport states for prototype disordered organics as well as the spatial correlation between transport states in the plane of the interface. Multilayer films are compared with monolayer films to answer the question of whether interfacial disorder differs significantly from bulk-like disorder. The basic materials research is expected to contribute to organic semiconductor device design capabilities by revealing the major factors governing charge injection at metal-organic interfaces. The research also aims to reveal the spatial disorder in charge transport properties in thick organic semiconductor films by applying conducting atomic force microscopy.&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. The project, if successful, can have impacts on the advancement of organic semiconductors for energy related applications. The research and education activities of the project are integrated. Graduate students are trained in an interdisciplinary environment. New scanning probe experiments will be adapted for the senior level undergraduate physics labs at the North Carolina State University. The plan is to modify the existing scanning tunnel microscopy to permit ballistic electron emission spectroscopy and to use the modified instrument to measure injection barriers at metal-organic interfaces in films grown by students. In addition, computational research project will be developed to allow undergraduates to explore aspects of one-dimensional quantum mechanics relevant to scanning tunneling spectroscopy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Intellectual Merit  The realm of organic electronic materials has opened new technologies for large area, low cost displays and photovoltaics.  The tradeoff compared to traditional electronic materials is that organic device structures tend to be very strongly disordered.  In some cases, such as bulk heterojunction solar cells, the disorder is intentional.  However, in all cases, understanding the molecular scale origin and properties of the disorder is essential to explaining and improving device operation.  This mission of this project was to survey the molecular origins of disorder in organic electronic materials using advanced imaging and measurement tools like scanning tunneling microscopy and atomic force microscopy.  The goal was to see disorder at very small scales down to the single organic molecule and to assess its immediate effect on electronic properties.   The project often worked to build a birds-eye view of the random landscape in an organic material using molecule-by-molecule measurements in the same way that polls build an overall view of public opinions.  Several key origins of disorder in organic materials were found during the course of this project.  The most surprising was the fact that electrically-active disorder can be dominated by factors extrinsic to organic thin films even when the films suffer from intrinsic structural imperfections.

Broader Impacts  The project supported teaching and learning in condensed matter physics through the integration of atomic force microscopy experiments into the advanced experimental physics capstone course for physics majors at North Carolina State University.  This experiment is now a fixture in the course and evolved to include experiments on local force curves, advanced high-k dielectric films, biomolecular films , and organic semiconductor single crystal degradation.  It provides training for students on an industrially-relevant analytical tool as well as experimental design, data analysis, and scientific communication.   Several undergraduate students participated in research associated with the project, including one who was co-author on a peer-reviewed publication.  Undergraduates learned techniques of thin film growth, atomic force microscopy, and software development for custom adaptations of force microscope experiments.  Graduate students were trained in the interdisciplinary environment of the NC State Organic and Carbon Electronics Lab (ORaCEL).  The project fully-supported two Ph.D degrees and partially supported a substantial part of one other.
