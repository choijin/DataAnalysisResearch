<AbstractNarration>Technical Committee on Parallel Processing (TCPP) acts as an international forum to promote parallel processing research and education, and participates in setting up technical standards in this area. Issues related to the design, analysis and implementation of parallel systems and solutions are of interest. These include design and analysis of parallel architectures and algorithms, and application development on parallel machines. TCPP sponsors professional meetings, brings out publications, sets guidelines for educational programs and coordinates academia, funding agency, and industry activities in the above areas.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal applies for NSF support to allow 60 more US-based student travel awards to be split evenly among IPDPS-10 student authors, PhD forum presenter at IPDPS10, and the other TCPP sponsored conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes: With the NSF support, IEEE Computer Society Technical Committee on Parallel Processing (TCPP) awarded over four dozen graduate students travel support to attend and present their research papers and posters at TCPP's flagship conference International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS-10), and several other TCPP sponsored conferences. This grant particularly allowed several underrepresented women and minorities to be awarded travel support, increasing the likelihood of their participation. Each award provided support for reimbursement of actual travel, accommodations, and registration expenses. In making these awards, the TCPP gave priority to individuals who would otherwise be unable to attend and to students presenting their own published work.  Impact/benefits:   All awardees had accepted paper or poster which they presented at the respective conferences. The students supported had worked on and presented refereed papers and posters on a variety of areas which are domains of the conferences sponsored by TCPP. The research areas include parallel and distributed computing very broadly, including algorithm, architecture, software and application. The list of TCPP supported conferences is available at http://tcpp.computer.org.  There was a solid response to the 3rd PhD Forum at IPDPS. The PhD Forum was launched to provide an opportunity to graduate students to present a poster describing their proposed and/or partially completed dissertation work to a broad audience of both academic and industrial researchers and practitioners in parallel and distributed processing and related overlapping areas.   Due to NSF support, PhD forum became a regular IPDPS event, with a vigorous program each year benefitting students, researchers, and industry.   Other conferences also have initiated student research symposiums or PhD forums.   Detailed Activities:  There were a total of 38 travel support awards averaging $750 given to graduate students authors evenly split between those who either presented their research papers at the International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium (IPDPS-10) or posters on their dissertation research at the TCPP PhD forum at Atlanta in April 2010.  IPDPS is the flagship conference sponsored by TCPP, and is the premier such event in the area (see ipdps.org).  In addition to IPDPS, additional awards were given to other TCPP sponsored conferences, including DCOSS-10 in Santa Barbara (4 awards, average $1000/each), PACT-10 in Austria (2 awards, $1000/each), and HiPC-10 in India (3 awards, average $1000/each).  The remaining funds, due to some awardees getting support elsewhere, were utilized to award 10 student authors of IPDPS-11 in Alaska (average $1000/each):  The selection process involved students formally applying for the award along with endorsements of their advisers and indication of their need. The focus was to support those who otherwise would not be able to present their work. The evaluations and scoring made by program committees of IPDPS conference and workshops and that of TCPP PhD Forum were considered in making the award, in addition to ensuring diversity across ranks of students and universities.
