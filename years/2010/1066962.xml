<AbstractNarration>1066962/1067286&lt;br/&gt;Luo/Doyle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Voice production is a result of the flow-structure interaction process in the larynx during which the glottal airflow causes the vocal fold tissue to vibrate more than 100 times per second.  The objective of this research is to develop an accurate and yet efficient numerical approach to model the flow-induced vocal fold vibration and quantify the three-dimensional characteristics of the glottal flow and vocal fold dynamics.  The numerical method will be based on an immersed-boundary method for incompressible flows with complex/moving boundaries and a nonlinear finite element method capable of representing large deformations of soft materials.  Idealized geometry of the larynx will be adopted to simply the problem and to capture the key elements of the biophysics.  Several important factors including the layered tissue structure, hyperelastic tissue behavior, large tissue strains, and vocal fold impact, will be incorporated to produce a realistic model.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both the glottal flow and vocal fold vibration are highly three-dimensional, and their intriguing characteristics largely determine the unique features of an individuals voice (e.g., a soprano or tenor).  The proposed research will reveal the underlying mechanisms that lead to the significant variations in the laryngeal dynamics.  Specifically, the vortical structures in the flow, the oscillation mode of the vocal folds, and the impact stress on the vocal fold surface will be studied, and the effects of the laryngeal geometry and material properties of the tissue will be quantified.  The conclusion drawn from the research will provide a much clearer understanding of the biophysics of phonation and will generate important guidelines for the future development of more advanced models useful in the clinical treatment of voice disorders.  In addition, the flow field data produced in the numerical simulations can be used directly in the acoustic analysis of sound production in the larynx.  To enrich the education of graduate and undergraduate students, a computational course incorporating multiphysics modeling will be created, which will address the interaction of fluids, thermal, structures, and electricity.  Interactive online learning modules will be developed to reach out to K-12 students for them to learn interesting applications of fluid dynamics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Voice production is a result of the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) process in the larynx during which the air expelled from the lungs causes a pair of vocal folds to deform and undergo sustained vibration.  The unsteady glottal airflow produces a large variety of sound that is individual specific (e.g., a babyÆs cry v.s. a soprano/tenor).  A computational model that can capture the individual specific vibration characteristics of the vocal fold will find a range of applications in clinical diagnosis and treatment of voice disorders. For example, such a computational tool can be used to predict the outcome of the implant inserted in the larynx of the patients with unilateral vocal cord paralysis, or to assess the performance of the engineered vocal fold tissue.  In order to initiate the research toward such a future simulation tool, the PIs propose to develop an accurate, efficient, and flexible numerical approach that can be used for modeling a wide range of interaction between fluids (air or liquids) and soft tissues, and by applying the approach in voice production, to quantify the three-dimensional characteristics of glottal flow and vocal fold vibration.   Intellectual merits of this projects include: 1) a 3D numerical method has been developed to computationally model the FSI of biological systems that involve large deformations of soft tissues, e.g., vocal fold (see attached figure 1) and heart valves (where the leaflets of the valves interact with blood flow for normal heart functions); 2) the significant role of nonlinear tissue mechanics in the vocal fold vibration has been investigated; and 3) an individual-specific computational model has been developed based on data from a separate animal study and has been validated using experimental data (see attached figure 2).  These results will provide useful guidelines in the future for development of similar high-fidelity computational models for human phonation.   Broader impact of this project include: 1) the numerical method developed through this project can also be applied to other human organ systems such as the four valves of the heart, and its feasibility has been demonstrated; 2) this study represents a significant study toward the future patient-specific modeling of human phonation for the purpose of clinical applications; 3) several graduate and undergraduate students have received extensive training through this project, and a course on fluid dynamics and multiphysics modeling has been developed for undergraduate students to learn advanced computational modeling tools for mechanical engineering design.
