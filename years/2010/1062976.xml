<AbstractNarration>This award supports the Research Experiences for Undergraduates site at the National Optical Astronomy Observatory's Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO). The program offers six undergraduate students the opportunity to engage in publishable-quality research projects with scientists working at the forefront of astronomy and astrophysics.  Students are supported at the observatories' compound in La Serena, Chile for 10 weeks during the (austral) summer, and each student is guaranteed a minimum of two nights observing time.  Mentors are selected from the scientific staffs of CTIO, the Southern Observatory for Astronomical Research (SOAR) and the Gemini South 8-m telescope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The students are exposed to the international nature of modern astronomy, and become more globally engaged through living and working abroad and interacting with the local staff and other students.  Exposure to the life and operations of a major international observatory and the diversity of activities conducted therein is an invaluable experience for all concerned.</AbstractNarration>
