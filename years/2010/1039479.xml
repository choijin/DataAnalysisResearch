<AbstractNarration>Technical Summary:  Non-destructive and non-invasive imaging in three dimensions allows for the analysis of intact samples of a diverse nature. Several techniques are available for 3D imaging from the atomic to macroscopic scales, such as x-ray diffraction, micro and nano x-ray computed tomography, positron emission tomography, and fluorescence confocal microscopy. In some specimens, the limitations of these techniques require more advanced instrumentation to produce high-contrast, high-resolution images. Some samples do not diffract x-rays consistently, are sensitive to visible light, display dynamic behavior within the sampling time, diffract light, are non-fluorescent, or do not include heavy atom labels. Confocal Raman microscopy provides a non-invasive and non-destructive method for 3D imaging of these and other challenging samples. The new instrument will allow for collection of Raman spectra at multiple positions within a sample can be used to generate images containing an abundance of chemical information that includes time-resolved investigations of fast dynamic processes. Confocal Raman spectroscopy will be used to analyze polymers, semiconductors, solid-state materials, live cells, and nanomaterials. This instrument will be the only multi-user-accessible multi-wavelength (532, 633, and 785 nm laser sources) confocal Raman microscope on campus. The instrument has relevance in a diverse array of research at Illinois and will be housed at the Microscopy Suite of the Imaging Technology Group at the Beckman Institute for broad access across campus. The Imaging Technology group and collaborating faculty will continue to enhance science education and training through a variety of outreach projects for a diverse group of students and staff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Layman Summary:  &lt;br/&gt;Non-destructive and non-invasive imaging in three dimensions allows for the analysis of intact samples of a diverse nature. Several techniques are available for 3D imaging from the atomic to macroscopic scales but are limited in their ability to probe complex materials.  Confocal Raman microscopy provides a non-invasive and non-destructive method for 3D imaging of challenging samples and is required for the advancement of several projects, providing a platform for optical and spectroscopic analysis in materials characterization. Configured to allow for diversity in sample handling, the instrument will support a broad range of ongoing Illinois research programs in more than 18 different laboratories.  Key research areas have been identified that would greatly benefit from acquisition of this advanced instrument including self-healing systems, multi-functional polymers, electronic materials, and cells &amp; tissues.  The instrument has relevance in a diverse array of research at Illinois and will be housed at the Microscopy Suite of the Imaging Technology Group at the Beckman Institute for broad access across campus. This instrument will be the only multi-user-accessible multi-wavelength confocal Raman microscope on campus. The Imaging Technology group and collaborating faculty will continue to enhance science education and training through a variety of outreach projects for a diverse group of students and staff.</AbstractNarration>
