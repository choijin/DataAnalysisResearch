<AbstractNarration>This Targeted Infusion project entitled - Development of Courses in Renewable Energy in Support of a Renewable Energy Engineering Curriculum - seeks to  improve the quality and scope of undergraduate engineering programs at the University of the District of Columbia (UDC). The project will develop anchor courses in renewable energy for the proposed renewable energy engineering (REE) degree program.  By instituting a new BS degree program in Renewable Energy Engineering, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences will be leading the way for its students to enter the growing world of renewable energy resources. The planned degree and courses will serve the needs of students in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, as well as the newly created College of Urban Agriculture, Sustainability, and Environmental Sciences. &lt;br/&gt;The specific objectives of this project are: 1) the development and establishment of four new course modules in renewable energy engineering; 2) training of students in REE-focused technology and research; 3) acquisition and installation of new laboratory equipment to complement the new courses; and 4) the initiation of a BS degree in renewable energy engineering. Students enrolled in these courses will be better prepared to enter the 21st century engineering workforce, particularly in the emerging field of renewable energy, and will be prepared to matriculate in graduate programs.</AbstractNarration>

The fourth TIP course syllabus on Smart Grid Communications and Cybersecurity (Course code TBD) was developed in 2012, and revised in 2013.        Objective: the course will teach students the basic concepts of Smart Grid technology, focusing on the networking and communication aspects as well as the cybersecurity aspects, network architectures, protocols and privacy schemes.                    Energy Concentrations Program:      Two of the multidisciplinary Renewable Energy courses developed are currently being offered as Concentration courses internal to ME. Included in the energy concentration program are the Fuel Cell Technology course, Solar and PV System, Biomass, and an introductory course in nuclear energy.  Students with concentration in energy will be required to take between 9 -- 12 credits hours.  Students who have successfully completed the energy concentration program will have their degrees marked with "Energy Concentration".             Project Outcomes summary:      The major goals of this project were to:       develop a Renewable Energy Curriculum and create a set of Renewable Energy courses  to provide students with the skills to enter the emerging workforce in the alternative energy area  enhance and strengthen the educational offerings of the Mechanical Engineering department  provide training for engineering and non-engineering majors students in the emerging field of...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
