<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for the Institute for Broadening Participation (IBP) to establish a program called Pathways to Ocean Sciences; the proposed project will employ a set of outreach activities and complementary digital tools to network and support students and faculty involved in the National Science Foundation's ocean sciences Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites programs. Using extensive virtual and face-to-face outreach, digital communication tools, and IBP's National Student Directory, Pathways to Ocean Sciences will 1) assist REU PIs to increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) students applying to NSF ocean sciences REUs, 2) encourage networking and collaboration among REU PIs, Faculty, and Administrators, particularly in regards to strategies for promoting diversity within their REU programs, 3) facilitate networking and communication among students during and after their REU experience, 4) introduce students to new emerging fields of ocean sciences 5) track ocean sciences REU students as they progress through their educational pathway, and 6) assist REU students in bridging to graduate programs by matching students with appropriate STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) resources such as graduate school fellowships and other funding resources.</AbstractNarration>

The ultimate goal of the project was to achieve the mission of fostering diversity, broadening participation and making careers in the ocean sciences and STEM more accessible and attainable for underrepresented students.  The POS project addressed these goals through the following objectives:  Increase the number of underrepresented students finding and successfully applying to OCE REUs, via the Institute for Broadening ParticipationÆs (IBPÆs) extensive student outreach and education efforts.  Increase retention of underrepresented students in ocean sciences in particular and STEM fields in general by assisting REU participants in bridging to graduate programs in the STEM fields, via IBPÆs extensive student outreach and education efforts. Assist OCE REU PIs in their own efforts to recruit and retain underrepresented students by providing customized student lists for recruitment upon request, and by increasing access to and awareness of strategies and practices that broaden participation and increase diversity. Maintain and update the Pathways to Ocean Sciences web portal, http://www.pathwaystoscience.org/oceanscience.aspx.   The Pathways to Ocean Sciences web portal (http://www.pathwaystoscience.org/oceanscience.aspx) features over 175 funded opportunities in ocean sciences from the k-12 through postdoctoral level, updated on a regular basis.

Additionally, the project engaged over 800 students in 21 separate student-oriented professional development webinars hosted by IBP. Over the course of the project, IBPÆs National Student Directory has grown to include 60,000 individuals (70% of whom are underrepresented) and IBPÆs Partners Directory (consisting of faculty and mentors in STEM nationwide) has grown to over 14,000 individuals.
