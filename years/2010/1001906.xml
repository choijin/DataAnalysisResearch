<AbstractNarration>The Atlanta Lecture Series on Combinatorics and Graph Theory is a series of three mini-conferences hosted jointly by Emory University, the Georgia Institute of Technology and Georgia State University. As the various areas of combinatorics and graph theory have matured, many new techniques and ground-breaking results have been established. Often these break-throughs are relevant to other areas of mathematics or other disciplines. Techniques and results in combinatorics and graph theory have greatly impacted such fields as computer science, bioinformatics, transportation and communication network theory, topology, algebra and computational matrix theory to name just a few.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The areas to be covered by these conferences include, but are not limited to extremal, algebraic and probabilistic combinatorics and graph theory, as well as structural and topological graph theory. These interdisciplinary meetings will focus on the interplay of results across areas including extremal graph and hypergraph theory, random graphs, structural graph theory, topological graph theory, poset theory, probabilistic combinatorics, domination theory and graph algorithms. It is expected that the conference will also promote deeper collaborations among researchers from the surrounding region, as well as build both the knowledge base and set of potential collaborators for participating young researchers and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The  Atlanta Lecture Series on Combinatorics and Graph Theory is a series of three Mini-conferences on Combinatorics and Graph Theory to be held in Atlanta each year for a period of three academic years, 2010-2011 to 2012-2013. These conferences will be rotated among three major research universities in Atlanta: Emory University, The Georgia Institute of Technology, and Georgia State University. The meetings will be scheduled in November, February, and April, respectively. Each conference will feature one distinguished researcher who will present two one-hour lectures, as well as four one-hour lectures presented by leading researchers, primarily from the southeast region, and four 30-minute talks by junior researchers and graduate students. All meetings will start on a Saturday afternoon and end on Sunday in the early afternoon, allowing participants to travel to and from neighboring schools.  The first in this series of mini-conferences was held at Emory University on November 13-14, 2010. This conference featured two 1-hour talks by Benny Sudakov, UCLA, as well as hour talks by Rod Canfield, University of Georgia; Mark Ellingham, Vanderbilt University; Ralph Faudree, University of Memphis;  and Chris Rodger, Auburn University. These talks were supplemented by 25 minute talks by Zixia Song, University of Central Florida; and by graduate students, Amin Bahmanian, Auburn University; Robert Davis, University of Georgia; and Justin Schroeder, Vanderbilt University.  Thus, as proposed, the mini-conference featured one of the top combinatorialists in the world and four other major researchers, as well as provided an opportunity for some young faculty and graduate students to present their research. As such, we met all our goals stated in the proposal.  A full schedule and the abstracts for each talk can be found on the conference web page at:       http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~rg/AtlLS.html  The fifth in this series of mini-conferences was held at Emory University on February 25-26, 2012. This conference featured two 1-hour talks by Jacob Fox, MIT, as well as hour talks by Hal Kierstead, Arizona State University; Wayne Goddard, Clemson University; Tomasz Luczak, Adam Mickiewicz University (Poland) and Emory University; and C.Q. Zhang, University of West Virginia . These talks were supplemented by 25 minute talks by Brendan Nagle, University of South Florida; Jennifer Vandenbussche, Southern Polytechnic University; Colton Magnant, Georgia Southern University; Dan Cranston, Virginia Commonwealth University; Hua Wang; Georgia Southern University; and Andrzej Dudek; Western Michigan University. Thus, as proposed, the mini-conference featured one of the top combinatorialists in the world and four other major researchers, as well as provided an opportunity for some young faculty to present their research. As such, we met all our goals stated in the proposal.     Abstract for all talks can be found at     http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~rg/ALSV.html       Last Modified: 04/19/2012       Submitted by: Ronald J Gould]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
