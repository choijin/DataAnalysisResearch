<AbstractNarration>RAPID: Emergency Field Investigation of Oil-Beach Interaction along the Alabama and Florida Beaches Following the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ping Wang, University of South Florida&lt;br/&gt;EAR-1041868&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico occurred on April 20 2010 and continues to leak, putting this spill on track to become the worst oil spill in US history, imposing a highly anticipated anthropogenic disaster to a large area of marine and coastal environment. The oil is dispersing northward in the Gulf of Mexico, very likely heading toward the Florida and Alabama beaches, with almost a certain landfall along the some parts of the Gulf coast region. Both the small- and large-scale regional effects of the oil?s interaction with the dynamic sandy beach environment are unknown. The proposed study will investigate and quantify beach-oil interaction through intensive field data collection immediately before and after the ?landfall? of the oil. The proposed study will be accomplished through a series of intensive field data collection, focusing primarily on the sedimentological aspect. It is anticipated that regional distribution of the oil landfall will be mapped by various government environmental agencies. However, the processes associated with vertical mixing of the oil into the beach sediment may not be well documented. The Coastal Research Laboratory in the Department of Geology at the University of South Florida (USF-CRL) is well positioned to provide the crucial information on the oil-beach interaction, in addition to the effects at a regional scale.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this NSF RAPID project, we investigated the temporal and spatial distributions of physically visible oil contaminants in beach environments.  Little was known about the transport and deposition of various forms of oil contamination in an extensive and heavily populated sandy barrier-island beach environment.  We documented five different forms of oil contamination in a beach environment (see attached image entitled "forms of oil contamination").  We also documented the spatial distribution of oil contaminants, both on and beneath the surface.  Distribution of oil contaminants on the surface of a beach environment tends to follow a certain cross-shore pattern.  A beach environment can be divided into several morphology zones (see attached image entitled "morphology zones of a beach") including from landward to seaward, dune ridge, maximum high-tide runup, backbeach trough, berm, active berm crest, and foreshore.  These morphology zones are controlled by specific beach depositional and erosional processes.  Due to the absence of direct tropical storm impacts during 2010 and 2011, no significant amount of oil contamination reached the dunes.  The maximum high-tide runup and backbeach trough tend to receive relatively concentrated oil contaminants in the form of oil sheet and concentrated tar balls and tar patties (see attached image entitled "concentrated tar balls").  In the relatively energetic foreshore and berm crest areas, oil stain was the main form of surface contamination (see attached image entitled "morphology zones of a beach").  All forms of oil contamination as discussed above were also observed beneath the surface of the beach, buried at various depths within several tidal cycles, i.e., a few days (see image entitled "buried oil").  The deeply buried oil was typically found beneath the berm crest (see image entitled "deep buried oil"), or at the portion of the beach that tends to be accretionary.  Surficial and buried oil contamination occurs at the same temporal scale driven by similar beaches processes.  Particular environments will have specific oil contamination signatures; for example, buried oil is the dominant mode of oil contamination in the foreshore, while surficial oil dominates areas of maximum high-tide runup.  Between the active berm crest and maximum high-tide runup, both surficial and subsurface oil contamination are present.  Based on our field observations, just as much, if not more, oil contamination is buried as compared to the oil on the surface.  Alongshore distribution of oil-contamination intensities illustrates a general decreasing trend eastward, away from the source.  However, substantial irregularities were observed depending on the "beach fall" of patches of oil from the sea.  Understanding the above distribution patterns of oil contaminants and associated depositional processes are crucial to the cleanup efforts.  Several trips were made after the extensive cleanup efforts.  Overall, based on our limited observations at more than 20 locations along the nearly 200 km shoreline, most of the surface and subsurface visible oil contaminants appear to have been removed.  At the end of the two year study, sporadic tarballs are still being found in the swash zone.  They tend to become relatively concentrated during calm conditions along the "plunge step", a morphology feature that occur under calm conditions at the seaward limit of swash downrush.  The tarballs tend to occur with shell debirs.       Last Modified: 06/14/2012       Submitted by: Ping Wang]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
