<AbstractNarration>Parasites are common in nature and by definition cause disease or death to their hosts. As a consequence, hosts have evolved defenses to protect themselves against parasites. The use of medication is one such defense, and is well-known in humans. However, whether animals also use medication is still poorly understood. The caterpillars of monarch butterflies eat milkweed plants, and some milkweeds are toxic to monarch butterfly parasites. This project will study if monarchs can use milkweeds as a form of medication by preferentially laying their eggs on toxic milkweeds that reduce parasite growth and disease in the monarchs' offspring. The researchers will use experiments to test for the medicinal effects of different types of milkweed, including different species and flowering versus non-flowering plants. These experiments will also be used to identify the chemicals that are responsible for the milkweeds' medicinal properties. The project will further test whether monarchs from four populations in North America and Australia have evolved the ability to use milkweeds as medication. Parasite risk varies greatly between these populations, and the project will test whether parasite risk affects the type of medication behavior that monarchs have evolved. In particular, it is expected that monarchs from high-risk populations always lay their eggs on medicinal plants (a form of prophylactic medication), whereas monarchs from low-risk populations only lay their eggs on medicinal plants when infected (a form of therapeutic medication). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enhance our understanding of how animals fight disease in nature, and will emphasize the role of parasites in the evolution of animal behavior. The project will also integrate research with education. Students of all levels (high school, undergraduate and graduate) and from underrepresented groups will participate in the design, execution and presentation of this work. The researchers will also host high school teachers in the lab to develop research projects for use in their classes to strengthen their ecology and evolution curriculum. Finally, the researchers will visit monarch butterfly festivals to teach the general public about science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ All organisms, including humans, suffer attack by parasites.  Because parasites occur in all habitats, we should expect most animals to develop the ability to medicate themselves against attack.  In humans, medication behaviors often take the form of using pharmaceuticals provided by our health professionals.  But other animals use pharmaceuticals as well, exploiting drugs that occur naturally in the environment.  Around 50% of the drugs that we use come from natural products, and it should be no surprise that other animals use them too.  We have studied the ecology and evolution of medication behavior in monarch butterflies.  Monarchs suffer attack from a parasite related to the one that causes malaria in humans.  Can monarchs protect themselves from this parasite by seeking out natural pharmaceuticals?  Our experiments show that monarch butterflies use toxic steroids from their milkweed host plants as medicines against their parasites.  An infected monarch mother will lay her eggs on the most medicinal plant that she can find so that her offspring feed on medicinal leaves as they emerge from their eggs.  We have named this "trans-generational medication" because a mother is able to protect her offspring from disease.  Moreover, monarch parents will collect pharmaceuticals from their milkweed diets and pass those drugs into their eggs.  In other words, eggs contain small amounts of pharmaceuticals that help to protect offspring from parasites.  Interestingly, both mothers and fathers can pass pharmaceuticals to their offspring.  Our research will help ecologists and evolutionary biologists understand how animals can medicate themselves in nature, and how that influences their susceptibility to disease.  Moreover, our work may inform future drug discovery, including the development of drugs to combat malaria-like parasites.  As our current drugs become resistant to antibiotics, we have to find new ways of discovering pharmaceuticals in nature.  Watching anmals self-medicate may provide us with clues on where new drugs can be found.  Finally, our work suggests that we should provide our livestock and our pets with ample opportunity to self-medicate using plants in nature.
