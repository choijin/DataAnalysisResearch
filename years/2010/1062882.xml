<AbstractNarration>This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS), College of William and Mary, which has been funded by NSF since 1989. The major objectives of the program are to: 1) provide meaningful research and training opportunities for undergraduates in coastal marine science and 2) increase the participation of underrepresented groups in the ocean sciences. The PI's request support for twelve undergraduate students each year during a 10-week summer research internship for a total of 5 years. The internship program focuses on interdisciplinary coastal marine science, particularly processes operating in the local estuarine and coastal environments. Research areas available for students include marine ecology, biological and chemical oceanography, biogeochemistry, geological and physical oceanography, marine fisheries, and marine policy. Students will receive a stipend, housing and transportation costs to and from VIMS. They participate in a variety of workshops and seminars. They are mentored by VIMS faculty while conducting their independent research project, and are expected to prepare a final paper and give a final oral presentation of their results. A 2010 survey of former students indicates that this program has been highly successful in the past, with 66% of under-represented alumni and 82% of well-represented alumni pursuing careers or higher degrees in science or engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Summer Intern Program at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science (VIMS) introduces undergraduate students to the complex environmental issues facing coastal ocean and estuarine systems globally. As part of the College of William &amp; Mary, VIMS has strong faculty commitment to excellence in education. The major objectives of the intern program conducted from 2011 to 2016 were to: (1) provide meaningful research and training opportunities for undergraduates in coastal marine science and (2) increase the participation of under-represented groups in the ocean sciences. Internships were available in the areas of marine ecology, biological and chemical oceanography, biogeochemistry, geological and physical oceanography, and marine policy. Student participants were recruited from throughout the United States and included individuals from under-represented groups, women, and those from non-research colleges and universities. The research activities of enrolled interns were mostly STEM-related, contemporary, and often resulted in peer-reviewed publications. A majority of interns rated their summer research experiences highly, and career trajectories of alumni demonstrated success.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><em>The intellectual merit:</em></strong> The coastal ocean is an accessible natural laboratory, faces significant environmental pressures, and is of high socio-economic value to the nation. Through this intern program, we provided hands-on opportunities in coastal ocean science research training and STEM education for talented undergraduate students. Interns accepted into the program contributed to the advancement of scientific knowledge through independent research and participation in ongoing long-term faculty research projects, including 23 conference presentations with REU intern co-authors with published abstracts, another 5 conference presentations without published abstracts or with REU interns acknowledged, and 16 publications in peer-reviewed journals with REU intern co-authors (2011-2016). Several other publications and proposals with intern co-authors or contributors are in preparation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><em>The broader impacts: </em></strong>The success and broader impacts of the program can be seen in our record of accomplishments over previous funding cycles (including 2011-2015). NSF funds supported 218 interns for the period 1997-2015, with 37% from ethnic or racial groups that are traditionally under-represented (URMs) in marine science (African American, Hispanic or Latino, American Indian, Native Pacific Islander, Asian). This helps to ensure a more diverse community of scientists and a well-prepared workforce in the future. Our successes with students from all groups, including those that are traditionally under-represented in the sciences, also have societal benefits. These students will likely be leaders in science, academia and other professional careers in the future. The majority of REU alumni (69%) obtained degrees in Ocean Science, Geoscience, and STEM fields, or were in graduate degree programs in those fields at the time of our alumni survey. Relative to all students, the careers of alumni from under-represented groups involved a higher proportion of fields such as medicine, law, or alternative fields (Figure 1). Many of the alumni reported that they were planning to apply for graduate school admission in the near future. Some of our alumni who participated during the program&rsquo;s early years (1989-1996) have completed PhDs in marine or earth science, advanced to research or teaching positions, and are currently active members of the ocean science community. No matter what career path they have chosen, participation in our REU program has better prepared our alumni to understand the science and technology issues that increasingly permeate all aspects of our lives.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/05/2018<br>      Modified by: Rochelle&nbsp;D&nbsp;Seitz</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1062882/1062882_10134625_1522945523331_DSC_0404_ESLShipwreck--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1062882/1062882_10134625_1522945523331_DSC_0404_ESLShipwreck--rgov-800width.jpg" title="REU field trip to Eastern Shore VA"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1062882/1062882_10134625_1522945523331_DSC_0404_ESLShipwreck--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="REU field trip to Eastern Shore VA"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">REU at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science.
