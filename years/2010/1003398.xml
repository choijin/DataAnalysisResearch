<AbstractNarration>The objective of this grant is to conduct a workshop that will bring together experts to address fundamental systems engineering research issues in complex product design. These experts will include: practitioners and theorists in systems engineering; general systems theorists; researchers in engineering design; and social scientists from economics, psychology, and organization theory. This workshop will focus on the normative theory of engineering design that encompasses the aspects of organization and complexity that are essential parts of these development programs.  The goal of this workshop is to identify a research agenda to facilitate the formulation of a theoretical basis for the design of large, complex products. The deliverables for this workshop include a summary report of findings, publication of workshop recommendations in leading systems and design journals, and briefings to the sponsors and other agencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this workshop will lead to the creation of a foundational theory that is essential for progress in the disciplines of engineering design, systems engineering, and multidisciplinary optimization. A rigorous normative theory underlying the design of large complex products and systems can lead to methods of systems engineering, product management, engineering design, and design optimization that can reduce poor performance on these projects, and thereby revitalize the aerospace, automotive, and other heavy equipment industries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the winter of 2010, the Engineering Design and Innovation Program at the National Science Foundation provided a grant to the authors to conduct a workshop on the subject of Engineered Systems Design.  The purpose of the workshop was to bring together practitioners and theorists in systems engineering, general systems theorists, researchers in engineering design, and social scientists from economics, psychology and organization theory to examine, first, individual engineers executing atomic level design decisions, and determine necessary conditions for rationality in the small, then, second, look at the overall design organization and consider what would constitute a globally rational design, and what is required of the organization to make the conditions of global and local rationality become a necessary part of the environment of the individual design engineer or component design team. Today, without such a theory, our systems engineering methods, processes and tools are a very large edifice built on extraordinarily loose sand.  Adding more methods, processes and tools is unlikely to provide any benefit until the edifice can be placed on a foundation.  Specific questions that were addressed at the workshop included:  What is the theory that underpins todayÆs methods?  Is this theory sound and adequate?  What theory or theories should underpin systems engineering? What are the fundamental ingredients necessary for a systems engineering mechanism that frames detailed design tasks?  How can we evaluate such a mechanism? What phenomena must we understand (or understand better) to create systems engineering processes that can be rigorously proven to deliver good designs?  What disciplines and competencies are foundational to research in systems engineering?   The workshop participants identified research questions in six areas that need to be addressed in order to develop a consistent theoretical framework for the design and analysis of large, complex engineered systems:  1) Values, Incentives and Hierarchy  Can a design process based on value out-perform traditional processes based on requirements?  Can these processes be compared by use of multi-scale simulation?  2)  Uncertainty and Decision-Making  How does uncertainty in predictive engineering models quantitatively impact design results?  3)  Metrics  How can the elegance of a design be quantified and measured?  4)  Organizations and Teams  How does the adaptability of an engineering design organization impact the large complex systems it develops?  5)  People and Machines in Systems Engineering  What is the impact of computational tools and automation on design results for large complex systems?  6) Research in Engineering Education  What are the key attributes of a successful engineer in the design of large complex systems?  How can an aspiring engineer acquire these attributes? For a developing engineering, what are the benefits of learning from failure.  In, summary, the workshop focused on the research needed to develop  a theory of large system design that will usher in a new era of systems engineering development, which will produce the tools necessary to revitalize our nationÆs ability to execute these programs.  The ability to effectively design large, complex systems will bring us many more technological products, or higher quality, at an annual savings of many tens of billions of dollars. Additionally, this workshop also highlighted the need for a new curriculum in the practice of engineering that is based on fundamental, sound and rigorous theory of system design.  We expect that the greatest value of this undertaking will not be in the methods and tools that it generates.  Instead, the real payoff will be the methods, processes, tools, and flawed ways of thinking about system design that can be pruned from engineering practice and from the curricula of our nationsÆ engineering schools.
