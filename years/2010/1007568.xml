<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the dynamic and electrodynamic interactions between upper atmospheric regions using measurements acquired by an extensive suite of ground-based instrumentation located throughout the Caribbean.  Specifically, the research will focus on characterizing the development of neutral and electrodynamic irregularities related to sporadic, patchy layer formation in the lower (E-region) ionosphere, traveling ionospheric disturbances, and quasi-periodic irregularities associated with coupling between the ionospheric E- and F-regions.  Experimental investigation of these phenomena will utilize the incoherent scatter radar at Arecibo, Puerto Rico, in addition to active and passive optical remote sensing by Arecibo imagers and LIDAR systems.   Active experiments using the new Arecibo facility for ionospheric modification are also planned.  To supplement the Arecibo instrumentation, a set of coherent scatter radar imagers, one located on St. Croix and one to be deployed on the island of Dominica in the West Indies as part of the proposed work, will be used to locate plasma irregularities, identify their intermediate-scale structuring, and place them in the context of quantitative, ground-based measurements for the first time.   This project will result in a significant expansion of ground-based infrastructure in the Caribbean which will benefit both students and international collaborators.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has concerned theory and observation of ionospheric irregularities that occur frequently at middle latitudes. Three varieties of irregularities are seen -- patchy sporadic E layers, medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances, and convective ionospheric storms usually referred to as "spread F." We study these phenomena for the same reasons that meteorologists study terrestrial weather - because they are intrinsically interesting aspects of the natural environment that also pose hazards, in this case to national communications and IT infrastructure.  During the course of this project, we have made observations at the Arecibo Observatory of the E- and F-region ionosphere during quiet and sometimes moderately disturbed geomagnetic conditions. The observations exhibit all the aforementioned manifestations of space weather at middle latitudes -- patchy Es layers, MSTIDs, and spread F. Although the phenomena sometimes occur approximately simultaneously, clear connections between them are generally not obvious, at least at first.  Detailed analysis of the Arecibo data involving statistical inverse methods allow the inference of neutral dynamics in the MLT and the thermosphere. Neutral dynamics appears to play a key role in ionospheric instability at middle latitudes.  Significant shear flow appears to be nearly ubiquitous in the midlatitude E region.

The predicted e-folding time for the strata in question can be quite short - perhaps 1 to 2 minutes - and therefore much shorter than what is predicted by other competing instability mechanisms. Once patchy Es layers are induced, fast-growing secondary plasma instabilities can function and produce irregularities at intermediate and small scales.  In the F region, large-scale plasma irregularities in the bottomside appear to be induced by thermospheric motion with a component parallel to the geomagnetic field.
