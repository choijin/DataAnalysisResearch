<AbstractNarration>Natural history, the description and understanding of the natural world, is a basis for much of science and education.  Lack of basic natural history information limits understanding of many fundamental principles and processes of ecology and evolutionary biology and their applications to environmental problem-solving. This project will support a series of three collaborative workshops that will examine the roles of natural history in research and education, develop mechanisms to increase the availability of natural history information, and improve the interfaces of natural history with research,  education, and applied science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;      This project will result in an assessment of information gaps and priority research areas; suggested procedures to improve communication of natural history among the educational, business, agency, and non-profit practitioners and users of natural history; and a network to expand natural history information and its use.  Each workshop includes provision for greater impacts of the activities, including participation by students and post-doctoral scientists, post-conference assessment of impact of the workshop on the institutions of participants, production of podcasts to be made available through the internet, and panel discussions for the general public. The workshops will produce a broad post-workshop initiative to improve the interfaces of natural history with education, research, and environmental problem-solving.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[                  The thesis behind this project is simple: Natural history, the focused attention to the non-human world, has been in decline, and the world would be better off if this trend was reversed. In research, in education, and in society, people are spending less time in contact with natural systems and land managers often lack critical information on what plants and animals live where.  Our contention is that these changes have far reaching consequences for how humans interact with the natural world, and for our ability to predict the responses of natural communities to perturbation. Our objective in this work was the revitalization of natural history for the 21st century.     We organized four linked workshops dedicated to the re-imaging and revitalization of natural history, and we used these workshops to build community among a wide range of naturalists&mdash;research ecologists, psychologists, artists, poets, educators, and others--to catalyze and organize a wide range of initiatives and projects led by the participants (grants, papers, projects, curricula and activism), and to create the Natural Histories Project, a multi-media web-space built on interviews and photographs of the participants, where naturalists around the world can listen to and interact with conservations on the future of natural history.  To see a video trailer of the conservations, please click HERE.     Through these workshops we have expanded the conversation about the importance, loss, transformation, and opportunities for rebirth of natural history in society, education, environmental research, and environmental management. Each of the workshops was 4-5 days in length and included 25-35 participants.  Participants included college presidents and students, eminent scientists and middle school teachers, poets and painters, senior government administrators and park naturalists, and teachers in schools large and small.     There was tremendous convergence of views that a rebirth of interdisciplinary natural history is much needed in and out of the academy.  There was also great coherence in the nature of this boundary-crossing: that natural history rightfully integrates sciences with arts and humanities, and as such can serve as an educational foundation at all levels from K-12 through graduate school.  Natural history provides an essential empirical basis for ecological and conservation sciences.  Moreover, natural history can serve as a new/old synthesis, representing all facets of human psyche.  Such an approach, inherently positive, offers important leverage on many social problems and dysfunctions.    A great many projects were initiated by participants&mdash;articles in scholarly journals and magazines for the general public, collaborations between practitioners from different backgrounds, and development of many new programs that bring together people too often separated&mdash;artists and scientists, "experts" and the general public.  We are tremendously excited to continue working on these exciting new paths. For more information on the project, please visit us on the web, HERE.  This work--a collaborative project with the University of Washington--has been supported by the National Science Foundation and by the University of Washington's College of the Environment.
