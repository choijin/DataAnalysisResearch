<AbstractNarration>Existing approaches to exploit sparsity present in statistical or deterministic signal descriptors have mostly relied on linear models, and available compressive sampling (CS) implementations are analog. On the other hand, major application domains, such as signal compression and reduced-rank approximation of complex systems, entail bilinear models. In addition, the pertinent technology used in everyday life, for e.g., speech and image compression, is digital. Accordingly, the need arises for fundamental research to account for sparsity in bilinear models, as well as put CS on equal footing with digital compression modules, which rely on the `workhorses' for dimensionality reduction, namely principal component analysis (PCA) or canonical correlation analysis (CCA), and have their performance benchmarked by rate-distortion limits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims at developing algorithms, and corresponding performance limits for sparsity-cognizant dimensionality reduction, compression, and reconstruction tasks. Key to achieving these goals are optimal formulations for sparse PCA, sparse CCA, and associated quantization schemes, along with sparsity-aware rate-distortion metrics for comparison with sparse overcomplete basis expansions (SOBE). The vision is to have available tools and figures of merit to exploit the `right' form of sparsity for the `right' application domain. Optimization of sparse PCA, sparse CCA, and SOBE approaches draws from contemporary advances in sparsity-aware regression, basis pursuit, subspace tracking, and coordinate-descent solvers of minimization problems regularized with the l_1 norm of the unknowns. The research agenda leverages these tools to investigate a number of challenging directions. These include: (d1) sparsity-exploiting and power-aware compression over non-ideal links; (d2) sparsity-cognizant, adaptive compression for (non-)stationary processes with memory; (d3) sparsity-aware reconstruction of hidden sources, and reduced-rank identification of sparse systems; and (d4) comparisons between deterministic and statistical descriptors of sparsity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcome of this one-year basic research project is the development and analysis of dimensionality reduction and data compression algorithms which leverage sparsity attributes (that is parsimony of) general nonlinear models of information-bearing signals and systems.  The intellectual merit of these statistical algorithms has broad impact in applications as diverse as compression and stoarge of data files, audio, speech, image, and video transmission and storage systems (where the information must be "squeezed" as with e.g., the zip software), but also in e.g., micro-array data collected the models unveil nonlinear gene regulatory functions in computational biology. Effective exploitation of sparsity enables lower performance loss at comparable speed when compared to the sparsity-agnostic alternatives.   Specific impact includes compression standards, such as JPEG and lossy MPEG-2, and the emerging IEEE 802.15.4standard on low-power communications for wireless sensor networks, the IEEE 1451 family, as well as the open global ZigBee Alliance.  Broader impact to education has been effected through  a) preparation of notes for enhancing the content of teaching material for the graduate class on detection-estimation at the University of Minnesota (Department of ECE);  b) the completion of three Ph.D. Theses;  c) reading group meetings on advances related to the role of sparsity for the general fields of sensing and networking; and the interplay between data communication networks, power networks, and social networks; and   d) the outreach efforts through the PI's plenary talks in international scientific meetings sponsired by the IEEE Signal Processing Society.
