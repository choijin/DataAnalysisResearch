<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Catalysis Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Thomas Jones of the College of Saint Benedict, for the synthesis, characterization and evaluation of multifunctional dendritic cascade catalysts.  The goal of this work is to attach both metal and organometallic catalysts to the perimeter of G4 poly(amido amine) dendrimers, and to make subsequent kinetic and mechanistic studies in regard to catalyst optimization.  Cascade catalysts are important for the development of multi-step, one-pot reactions in organic chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the research are based on the general development of "atom economical" reactions, which are critical for the reduction of the waste stream in the chemical industry and can save time during labor intensive pharmaceutical multistep syntheses. The research by Professor Jones, in collaboration with Professor Cloninger at Montana State University, is geared to the training of undergraduate researchers in synthesis, characterization by a variety of analytical methods, and mechanistic and kinetic measurements.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project explored the application of catalysts attached to recoverable materials used to promote the synthesis of useful molecules from simple starting materials.    The work funded by this award was carried out at the College of St. Benedict | St. John's University and Montana State University by undergraduate research students.  The students were supervised by two faculty members as well as a Montana State University graduate student.    The undergraduate students carried out the preparation of bound catalyst systems using standard large molecule techniques.  Modern instrumental methods were used to characterize these new materials.  The bound catalysts were screened against known reactions to determine the effectiveness of this approach.  Currently this work in the optimization stage where students are adjusting catalyst loading and solvents to determine the best conditions to run these reactions.  Once the best conditions are determined the catalysts will be applied to multi-step reaction sequences.  The preliminary results of this work has been presented by the undergraduate students at regional scientific meetings in Minnesota and Montana as well as national American Chemical Society meetings.    The undergraduate students involved in this project have since gone on to pursue graduate degrees in chemistry at Tulane University, University of California - Davis and Emory University.
