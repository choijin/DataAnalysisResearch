<AbstractNarration>This award will support an observational program to analyze high-contrast, high spatial resolution images of young stars with circumstellar disks.  The principal goals will be to find planets directly or to look for morphological structures in the disks caused by the presence of planets.  Much of the work will be to analyze the results of an extensive coronographic survey, but there will also be new observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of the analysis will explore the processes involved in the birth, early evolution, and architecture of exoplanets located in the outer regions of both protoplanetary and debris disks.  Members of this research team also are engaged in a program which involves beginning students in research, especially students from underrepresented groups, at the University of Washington.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This NSF program supported our team's participation on the Strategic Exploration of Exoplanets and Disks with Subaru (SEEDS) project.  SEEDS used 120 nights of observing time on the 8m Subaru Telescope to survey nearby stars to directly image any wide orbit planets present and detect the circumstellar disks from which these planets formed.  Detecting these planets and disks is challenging as they emit many orders of magnitude less light than their associated central stars.  To achieve these detections, we used the HiCIAO coronagraph and AO-188 adaptive optics system on the Subaru Telescope, which helped to block out light from these central stars to reveal the presence of disks and planets surrounding them.  We found that spatially resolved imagery of so-called transitional disks exhibit a wide diversity of morphological features, including gaps and spiral arms.  We find the properties of these structures do not correlate with stellar age, mass, or stellar radiation field, indicating a non-stellar origin for these structures.  Specifically, the appearance of at least some of these disks indicates clearing by one or more Jovian-mass planets (or brown-dwarf companions).  This work supported 5 undergraduate students, 3 graduate students, and 3 postdocs, and produced 43 refereed scientific papers.
