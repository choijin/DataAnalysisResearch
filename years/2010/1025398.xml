<AbstractNarration>PI: Andrew D. Hanson (University of Florida - Gainesville)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CoPIs: Valérie de Crécy-Lagard, Donald R. McCarty, and Jesse F. Gregory (University of Florida - Gainesville), Christopher S. Henry (University of Chicago)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Senior collaborators: Andrei Osterman (Burnham Institute for Medical Research) and Svetlana Gerdes (Fellowship for Interpretation of Genomes) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rapid progress in sequencing plant genomes and genes has exposed the lack of information regarding the function of &gt;70% of the proteins encoded.  In addition, these studies have shown that many such unknowns also occur in bacteria and archaea. Comparative genomics is a powerful approach to uncover gene function, as is advanced in silico reconstruction of an organism's metabolism. In this project, both approaches will be used to improve the accuracy of functions assigned to maize metabolic genes and to predict functions for unknown genes, with special emphasis on B vitamins (folate, niacin, thiamin, pyridoxine, riboflavin, pantothenate, and biotin). The ten most promising functional predictions will be experimentally validated by combining genetic and metabolic profiling approaches in bacteria with biochemical assays of recombinant proteins and with genetic tests in maize. The expected overall outcome of this project is the implementation of a comparative genomics prediction and validation pipeline for maize gene function discovery, using B vitamin metabolism as a paradigm. Gene functions (annotations) will be publicly available via MaizeCyc (http://pathway-dev.gramene.org/gramene/maizecyc.shtml) and the SEED (http://theseed.uchicago.edu/FIG/index.cgi) databases, with metabolic reconstructions available via the Model SEED website (www.theseed.org/models/).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will implement an interdisciplinary approach to gene function discovery that is extendable to any metabolic network. In the process, it will enrich the maize genome by imposing consistency on thousands of metabolic gene annotations, and by improving the annotations of hundreds of unknown genes. Both impacts will advance future function discovery. Furthermore, by developing genome-scale in silico metabolic reconstructions, the work will initiate a systems approach to understanding maize metabolism. Integrally, the work will provide cross-disciplinary training in comparative genomics, metabolic biochemistry, and microbial genetics to students, postdoctoral associates, and faculty.  In addition the project will provide for an annual 3-day hands-on workshop at the University of Florida to train researchers at all levels to predict functions using the SEED and other comparative genomics databases, with special emphasis on training faculty from minority serving institutions.  Finally the project will develop an undergraduate bioinformatics course in which the students participate in unknown gene identification and metabolic reconstructions using comparative genomics and a graduate course module in which students develop functional predictions for unknowns in the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This collaborative project involving five groups had the following research (Intellectual Merit) aims:  1. Use bioinformatics to inventory all maize genes encoding major metabolic pathways, especially pathways that produce B vitamins (which plants require themselves and supply to humans and animals). This is needed in order to find key pathway genes that are not identified yet, and to build comprehensive (ægenome-scaleÆ) computer models of maize metabolism.  2. Compare B vitamin-related maize genes of unknown function (e.g. genes fused to known vitamin synthesis genes) to their counterparts in bacterial genomes, in order to predict their functions.  3. Test the ten most promising of these predictions using genetic and biochemical approaches.  Outcomes were as follows:  Objective 1. Plant genome-scale metabolic models have been plagued by inconsistent gene assignments (æannotationsÆ), causing many genes to be assigned to the wrong pathway reactions. Also, the models themselves have been incomplete in that B vitamins and/or their synthesis pathways are left out, and biomass compositions (i.e. what the model must produce) are unrealistically simplified. To overcome inconsistent annotations, we built PlantSEED, a metabolism-centric resource to support annotation, comparative genomics, and model construction from plant genomes. PlantSEED has four key features: (i) Annotations are highly consistent across plant genomes; (ii) Annotations are highly conservative, with strictly defined protein families preventing incorrect propagation of annotations; (iii) Reconstruction and modeling are integral parts of the annotation process, allowing identification and correction of annotation errors and omissions; and (iv) Seamless integration of PlantSEED with the prokaryotic SEED database enables ready comparison of plant and microbial genomes. These features allowed us to create functioning, compartmentalized metabolic models for maize and nine other plant genomes. PlantSEED models also have improved biomass compositions. B Vitamins and cofactors were added to the biomass. We also made an in-depth bioinformatic analysis of B vitamin pathways and their compartmentation in maize and Arabidopsis, and built the curated pathways into PlantSEED. To address the oversimplified biomass issue, we increased the set of components to a total of 79 found in all land plants; this roughly doubles previous totals.  Objectives 2 &amp; 3. Our bioinformatic inventory of B vitamin pathways in maize and other plants reveal&shy;ed six missing biosynthetic enzyme genes, at least 33 missing transporters, and ~25 genes of unknown function that are strongly associated with B vitamins. We predicted maize candidates for three missing biosynthetic genes &ndash; one in riboflavin synthesis and two in thiamin synthesis &ndash; of which two were experimentally verified. We predicted three transporters for niacin, two for thiamin diphosphate, and two for CoA, all of which were verified. From the genes of unknown function, we predicted and verified functions for three relating to thiamin, two to NAD, and two to pyridoxal phosphate, and one to the micronutrient queuosine.  Summary. This project has:  - Built genome-scale models for maize and nine other plants (the objective was maize alone)  - Constructed a major web-based resource, PlantSEED (exceeds objectives)  - Verified functions for a total of 17 maize enzymes and transporters (the objective was ten)  - Verified the functions of Arabidopsis counterparts of 14 of the 17 maize genes (exceeds objectives)     Our project had the following Broader Impact outcomes:  Comparative genomics workshops. In 2011-2014, we taught an annual three-day, hands-on comparative genomics workshop at Univ. Florida to faculty, postdoctorals, and PhD students. Most participants came from other universities. Each year, the project funded three faculty from Minority-Serving Institutions to attend &ndash; but the work&shy;shops proved so popular that ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
