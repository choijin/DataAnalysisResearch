<AbstractNarration>Reconstructing and understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of late Holocene climate variability remains a fundamental challenge in paleoclimatology, particularly with respect to coupled systems such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). Records with absolute chronologies on annual or better timescales have offered the most robust data for quantitative climate reconstructions, however such records are generally limited to terrestrial regions or the tropical oceans. This collaborative research between scientists from Iowa State University and the University of Maine uses sclerochronological analysis of the growth increments of the long-lived bivalve Arctica islandica to generate annually resolved records of temperature in the Gulf of Maine covering the last 1000 years. The PIs explore the specific relationship among the NAO mode, NAO extremes, seawater temperature, and shell growth rate and chemistry, as well as the response of the ocean-climate system in the Gulf of Maine to rapid climate changes during the last millennium. The results from this research shed light on climate change in a region that will affect large populations in the 21st century. Graduate and undergraduate students are participating in the research, and the PIs are working with a variety of regional research centers to interactive displays highlighting the research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes   Intellectual Merit:   The North Atlantic Ocean is a critical region for regional and global climate dynamics.  It has significant influence on global heat exchange and plays a large role in regulating the earthÃ†s carbon budget by acting as a major atmospheric CO2 sink.  These characteristics are in part due to the formation of deep water in the Labrador Sea and east of Greenland which drive the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), the global "ocean conveyor" that transports ocean waters around the earth (Broecker et al., 1985).  Changes in the AMOC have a large impact on global climate, including temperature distribution in the North Atlantic, and have been implicated as the cause for several large-scale abrupt climate changes in the Northern Hemisphere in the past. In addition to the AMOC, there are also several important coupled ocean-atmosphere climate oscillations in the North Atlantic that have been shown to regulate Northern Hemisphere climate on a variety of time scales, including the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO).  Recent research suggests that these North Atlantic climate modes may have changed significantly over the past millennium.  Therefore, the overall goal of this project was to develop a new record of paleoceanographic variability in the Gulf of Maine for the last several centuries, and provide further evidence for the controls on North Atlantic climate variability.   We developed an annually resolved reconstruction of seawater temperatures in the Gulf of Maine/western North Atlantic from 1695-1915. This paleoclimate record was constructed using oxygen isotopes measured in precisely dated Arctica islandica shells collected off of Seguin Island in the western Gulf of Maine. The temperature reconstruction was derived from this oxygen isotope time series using a modern isotope-salinity mixing line developed for coastal waters in the Gulf of Maine from water samples collected over the last decade. The isotopic and salinity composition of these water samples indicate that coastal surface waters consist of a mixture of Scotian Shelf Water and Maine River Water. The properties of these coastal waters are significantly influenced by seasonal changes in local river discharge.  The Gulf of Maine oxygen isotope record suggests centennial-scale oscillations in seawater temperatures and therefore in the strength and position of the major ocean current systems that influence Gulf of Maine water properties. This record indicates that recent warming seen in the Gulf of Maine is not yet outside the natural seawater temperature variability of the region and therefore cannot be unequivocally linked to anthropogenic climate change. The positive and negative correlations between the Gulf of Maine oxygen isotope record and seawater temperature records from the subpolar gyre region of the North Atlantic and the western North Atlantic, respectively, are similar in pattern to the modeled and observed influence of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) on seawater temperatures in these regions. This similarity suggests a possible association between AMOC variability and seawater temperatures in the Gulf of Maine. The association indicates that seawater temperature reconstructions from oxygen isotopes measured in A. islandica shells collected in the Gulf of Maine could provide an annually resolved, precisely dated reconstruction of AMOC variability.  Our oxygen isotope record suggests centennial-scale oscillations in AMOC variability, with increased strength of the AMOC after the Little Ice Age.  In summary, the Gulf of Maine's oceanography reflects broad-scale patterns within the North Atlantic system; hence, paleoceangraphic data developed from within the Gulf of Maine will have the ability to inform researchers about large-scale patterns and changes in key oceanographic systems including the Atlantic meridional overturning circulatio...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
