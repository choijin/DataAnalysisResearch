<AbstractNarration>About 1 in 3 (30%) species of freshwater fishes belong to a group called cypriniforms, many of which have great economic value and are captured or raised for human consumption, the pet trade, or recreation. The top five fishes used for aquaculture worldwide are cypriniforms.  Goals of the All Cypriniformes Species Inventory are to (1) accelerate the rate of discovery and description of cypriniform fishes, (2) improve the understanding of their evolutionary and ecological relationships, (3) make information on cypriniforms readily available via websites, (4) build capacity for research in other countries through student training and long-term collaborations, and (5) make available large numbers of specimens and tissues of freshwater fishes in collections of US and foreign institutions. Given the large numbers of specimens in museums to be examined and the tropical regions to be sampled, it is anticipated that 800-1,000 new species will be described.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; All Cypriniformes will greatly improve the efficiency of species recognition by developing global collaborations, training US and foreign students, and providing images and databases on project websites. Websites will provide information on species diversity, photos of fishes,guides for identification, and links to related projects. Conservation biologists and fisheries managers depend on accurate identifications and distributional information for prioritizing areas for protection and for making informed management policies. All Cypriniformes will greatly improve taxonomy and accuracy of records through expert identification and georeferencing new and existing data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is part of a 10-year effort to digitize and mobilize the scientific information associated with biological specimens held in U.S. research collections. The images and digitized data from this project will be integrated into the online national resource as outlined in the community strategic plan available at http://digbiocol.files.wordpress.com/2010/05/digistratplanfinaldraft.pdf.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The order Cypriniformes represents the largest group of freshwater fishes on planet Earth.  This group is also one of the main food/protein resource for nearly 1/3 of the world and is extremely important.  Cypriniformes are also a group used in many comparative research studies and knowledge of correct species diversity and identification is critical in these efforts.  Due to the diversity in the group and its great importance to society and science, knowledge of the diversity and relationships of species are important.  This tremendous diversity and aspects of morphological convergences have impeded researchers from working on this group to the extent that researchers have focused on other groups.  As a result, prior to this award and previous ATOL award, very little was known about the relationships of these fishes. Through awards to work on Cypriniformes and sampling hundreds of species we now have a phylogenetic framework for all other researchers to use as a backdrop for further analyses of individual groups and for the inspection of evolutionary processes. This has been a tremendous impact for thousands of scientists and persons interested in some members of the group or large groupings for research and aquaculture.  The future of phylogenetics in this large order would not be as productive had this research not been successful.  In addition, this award identified several groups, usually genera that are very problematic and need further attention by the research community.  In many groups researched we discovered that some thought to be monophyletic are not and that there is considerable diversity yet to be described in all of the groups examined.  All of the students and foreign collaborators involved in this project over the full term of the grant were trained in modern methods of taxonomy and systematics, as well as identification of fishes.  These students/collaborators will go on to train others in these areas.  For international colleagues in different countries that were interested in working with Cypriniformes, many did not know the basics of taxonomic study or identification.  Through this project the PI worked with these collaborators in training so as to build capacity in their home countries and spread the education for others to work with fishes in the future.  This project also included two edited volumes of publications from scientists working with Cyprinifomes, three international meetings, the formation of a new journal and society for SE Asia diversity, and one symposium in the final year of the project.
