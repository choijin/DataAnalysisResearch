<AbstractNarration>Subduction zones, where one lithospheric plate slides beneath another before returning to the mantle, results in melting of rock at depth and the rise of these melts to form long chains of volcanoes and subvolcanic plutons that together are called magmatic arcs.  Because these arcs and surrounding host rocks are hot and undergoing tremendous stresses due to the plate motions they become extensively deformed forming orogenic belts. The evolution of continental margin orogenic belts and their associated magmatic arcs has a non-steady state ?tempo? of subduction, orogeny, magmatism, exhumation, and erosion/redeposition. This research project examines the details of this tempo particularly during magmatic surges (periods when large volumes of magma are formed and added to the crust) and what role was played by the tectonic transport of easily melted crust to regions at depth where melt occurs in subduction zones. The goal is to test the hypothesis that during the mid-Cretaceous (105-85 Ma) high magma surge episode much of the arc in the southern Sierra Nevada and Salinian blocks was emplaced within a crustal scale convection system. Preliminary studies of pendants around 105-85 Ma plutons indicate that, during rise of magmatism, metasedimentary and effusive metavolcanic host rocks were convectively overturned and underwent rapid downward displacement and high-strain flow. The research will expand and synthesize a number of data sets (e.g., field studies, geochronology, barometry, vertical displacement, strain fields, magma fluxes) plus perform extensive forward numerical, thermomechanical modeling capable of incorporating magma ascent, viscoelasto- plastic host behavior, large strains, nonlinear rheologies, and realistic phase transitions to understand the physics of the process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Volcanic eruptions dramatically impact human society and play a huge role in both the formation of our atmosphere and in climate change. Additionally crustal deformation in orogenic belts leads to short-term events such as earthquakes and long-term events such as mountain building that also impact our society. The recognition that arc crust, at times, undergoes overturn thus incorporating crustal materials into rising magmas will dramatically change the understanding of magmatic systems, the geochemical and geochronologic analyses of these systems, and rates of crustal growth. This research will improve understanding of these systems and the GIS based databases produced on geochronology, thermobarometry, vertical displacement rates, strain and strain rates, and magma fluxes will be made available to the public. A large number of undergraduates from several institutions will be involved in the research project through the University of Southern California Team Research program</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project consisted of multi-disciplinary studies of the Sierra Nevada magmatic arc, which formed due to subduction underneath western North America and was active from 250-85 Ma. Excellent exposure in the eastern Sierra Nevada provides an ideal "natural laboratory" to study these processes and their resulting products.     The major goals of this project include:  a) Elucidate effects of tectonic and magmatic processes on episodic arc behaviors, termed æarc temposÆ.  b) Identify and constrain the magnitude and timing of vertical transfer of crustal material during the evolution of the arc system.  c) Identify potential links between this mass transfer and voluminous magmatism.  d) Add to our growing understanding of the evolution of magmatic systems and growth of continents.     The accomplishments of this project include:  a) New geologic mapping, geochronology, geochemistry, thermobarometry, and structural analyses throughout the eastern Sierra Nevada in collaboration with a network of researchers from both American and international institutions.  b) Compilation of new and existing, interdisciplinary geologic datasets, comprising several decades of work by the community, consisting of databases of the above observables that have been used to test hypotheses related to the above research goals. We are continuing to refine and improve this compilation for use in future research and plan to share it freely with the geologic community.     This work has led to several key findings:  a) Spatial, temporal, and geochemical links show that widespread plutonic and volcanic rocks were products of the same vertically connected magmatic system.  b) Geochemical signatures in arc rocks and thermobarometry indicate that significant crustal reworking occurred throughout development of the Sierran arc, particularly in the Late Cretaceous.  c) The synthesis of a broad range of interdisciplinary findings has allowed us to constrain the temporal and spatial responses to tectonic and magmatic processes operating within the arc.  d) Observed fluctuations in arc magmatism, recognized in systems throughout the world, are not directly linked to plate motions or overall tectonic style.     The broader impacts of this work include:  a) We have been able to address key questions, outlined in the project goals, on the causes and response of tectonic and magmatic processes in volcanic arcs. These arc systems, occurring along subduction zones throughout the world, are central to the formation of continental crust, create significant seismic and volcanic hazards, and often host critical economic mineral deposits.  b) The above work has resulted in the publication of 10 papers, 24 conference abstracts, and 2 maps. We are particularly pleased with the publication of a full Elements volume on arc tempos that directly resulted from this research.  c) As part of our work on public lands, particularly Yosemite National Park, we have given talks and communicated our work to both public land personnel and the public.  d) Exposure to geologic research, mentorship and interactions with researchers from many institutions, direct participation in geologic research, and presentation of research findings have provided training and professional development for individuals with a wide range of experience in the Earth Sciences. This includes early career researchers, graduate students, undergraduate Earth Science students, and undergraduate non-science students from several institutions throughout the United States.  e) The improved understanding of dynamic arc systems and numerical simulation on magma behavior can benefit the Earth Science community as a whole and other disciplines interested in mountain building and orogenesis, either in isolation or as part of Earth "systems".  f) This work has provided new opportunities to test questions resulting from our findings and spurred new avenues of inquiry on the relationship between tectonic processes and subsequent re...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
