<AbstractNarration>The objectives of this three-year REU Site program at the University of Kansas are to: 1) engage undergraduate students in stimulating, cutting-edge research projects in the interdisciplinary Feedstock to Tailpipe Initiative, focusing on biomass production and processing, chemical transformation into fuels, and engine performance and analysis; 2) provide exposure to the breadth of disciplines and teamwork needed to attack a multidisciplinary problem such as biofuel production from wastewater-fed algae; and 3) provide a unique opportunity for a diverse population of undergraduate students from across the United States to interact both academically and socially, aimed at building a more integrated network of graduating engineers. All of the undergraduate students will work under a faculty mentor, and alongside a K-12 teacher sponsored by the NSF Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in biofuels. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the research activities the students will participate in symposia, common social activities, local industry tours, and seminars. The weekly seminar topics include: 1) Safety, 2) Research Methods, 3) Literature Searching, 4) data Analysis, 5) Career Opportunities, 6) Oral Presentations, 7) Report/Paper Writing, 8) a Graduate School "primer", and 9) Ethics in Research and Engineering.  A special one-day professional development workshop will also be offered through the SELF Fellowship Program at KY to provide guidance for students on careers in research and graduate school opportunities.  At the end of the summer students will be required to a final project report along with a professional quality poster.  Posters will be presented at a poster session/reception at the end of the program which will include all other REU students and summer undergraduates at KU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the PI intends to continue his international program in Lodz, Poland because it has direct relevance to this REU Site program focused on biofuels. The undergraduate students at KU will participate through formal video conferences and discussions held 3 times during the summer between the local students and the students at Lodz, and by integrating the projects in Lodz directly into the REU Site focus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participants will be recruited nationally from a variety of disciplines including chemical, environmental and mechanical engineering, as well as from chemistry and biology.  To aid in the recruitment of underrepresented students the PI has made contacts with a number Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and participates in the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation Expos, Society of Women Engineers (SWE) and the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE).  Students who participate in this REU Site program will be encouraged to pursue graduate studies and research careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of Kansas presented an NSF sponsored REU Site during the summers of 2012-2015.  During the summer, a group of undergraduate students from other Universities (10 per year) was invited to the KU campus to work with KU faculty mentors for 10 weeks on a research project tied to our "Feedstock to Tailpipe" initiative to perform basic research on conversion of algae to fuels.  Each student was provided a ( $ 5,000) stipend and room and board, along with a travel stipend.  Students were housed on campus in dorms along with other REU and summer research undergraduates  Each student was assigned a faculty mentor and worked alongside the  existing research teams.  Students were provided with research and safety training seminars as well as a professional development workshop.  Students also received college credit for their research work.  To provide for intellectual rigor, all of the projects were part of active funded research programs.  Students generally regarded the experience favorably, indicating among other things that the experience demystified the concept of graduate research, making it apparent that it is something within their reach.  At the conclusion of the summer, each student was required to prepare and present a professional level poster in a campus wide setting.  Usually there were 80-100 other students presenting at the same event.  Faculty and administrators also attend the event.  Students are encouraged to publish results where applicable to broaden impact.  A primary benefit of the REU Program is to help encourage students into considering graduate education and careers in research.  The US has a shortage of qualified researchers in the Chemical Engineering area.  It is hoped that programs such as the REU Site will help address this problem to the benefit of our society.  In the case of our REU Site, students are also working on developing technology to help us move towards sustainable, carbon neutral energy supplies.  this is a very timely and important topic with potential benefit for society.
