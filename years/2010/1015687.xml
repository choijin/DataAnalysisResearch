<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Exploring the conservation genetics toolbox: An internship with application to noninvasive gender identification of Asiatic black bears (Ursus thibetanus)  Prepared by: Julie Betsch     As populations of humans and their domestic animals increase, so does the threat of disease transmission at the human-wildlife interface. Molecular tools can be used to shed light on the dynamics of both host and parasite at this interface, and inform management to protect sensitive wild carnivore populations from diseases affecting domestic species. The focus of my NSF summer institute research was to explore the conservation genetics toolbox and expand my international, professional network, so that I might apply this experience to global epidemiological problems in future work.   The work was performed at the Laboratory of Genomic Diversity and Conservation Biology at Peking University under the supervision of Dr. Shu-jin Luo at Peking University, Beijing, China.  This lab applies molecular tools to the study of species of conservation concern, e.g. pangolin and tiger, with diverse applications such as phylogeography, population demographics, and wildlife trade forensics.  The EAPSI-supported research examined the feasibility of using non-invasive molecular methods to characterize the gender of sampled Asiatic black bears (ABB). The ABB is a charismatic large omnivore that is native to China where it is found today with a patchy distribution in the South and Northeast.  There are a variety of threats to wild ABB populations across its range but the biggest threat to the bear in China is the market for bile used in Chinese Traditional Medicine. In this study a molecular reaction was optimized for sex identification of ABB to inform two distinct ongoing projects.  One project assesses the physiological difference between captive, rescued (bile) bears and wild bears through stress hormone analysis.  The second assesses the population status of wild ABBs in protected areas of Sichuan Province. By the conclusion of the summer internship satisfactory results were not obtained.  The work is ongoing by my colleagues at the Laboratory of Genomic Diversity and Conservation Biology.  In light of the increasing emergence of infectious diseases in humans, domestic and wild animals, a trans-boundary interdisciplinary approach is called for.  The skills and relationships that were developed during my EAPSI Summer internship equipped me to advance the application of molecular tools to finding solutions for global epidemiological problems.
