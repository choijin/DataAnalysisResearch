<AbstractNarration>The PI proposes algorithmic versions of the recent hypergraph regularity methods of Rodl, Schacht, Skokan and the PI, and of Gowers.   For graphs, Szemeredi's Regularity Lemma was made algorithmic by Alon, Duke, Lefmann, Rodl and Yuster.  For 3-uniform hypergraphs, Haxell, Rodl and the PI established an algorithmic hypergraph regularity lemma (compatible with a counting lemma).  Using this work, Poerschke, Rodl, Schacht and the PI derived algorithmic 3-uniform versions of Gowers' regularity lemma and that of Frankl and Rodl.  The PI proposes algorithmic k-uniform versions of each of these regularity lemmas.  Moreover, the PI proposes that the three concepts of regularity considered by these sets of authors are all equivalent, which plays an important role in the development of the desired algorithm.  It also plays an important role in the applications of such algorithmic regularity lemmas, since then it follows that all three regularity lemmas admit a corresponding counting lemma.  The PI then proposes work on several algorithmic hypergraph problems.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Hypergraph regularity methods have lead to important solutions to quite a few problems across the areas of extremal combinatorics, theoretical computer science, number theory and discrete geometry.  These methods have, in a strong sense, provided a general infrastructure for solving certain problems.  An algorithmic version of the hypergraph regularity method would expand that infrastructure to constructive procedures for solving algorithmic hypergraph problems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Szemeredi Regularity Lemma (c. 1975) is an important tool in combinatorics, having numerous applications within combinatorial number theory, extremal graph theory, and theoretical computer science.  Roughly speaking, the Regularity Lemma guarantees that all large graphs G = (V,E) admit a bounded partition of their edge set E, where most classes of this partition consist of `regularly distributed' edges, i.e., a typical class of this partition resembles a random (bipartite) graph of the same edge density.  One of the most important properties of a regular partition (of G) is that it allows one to estimate the number of fixed subgraphs of G of a given isomorphism type.  This result is known as the (graph) Counting Lemma, and combined applications of the Regularity Lemma and Counting Lemma have become known as the Graph Regularity Method.  The original proof of the Szemeredi Regularity Lemma was not constructive, which meant that while a regular partition was guaranteed to exist for any large graph G, one didn't know how to construct such a partition.  One of the key developments of Szemeredi's Regularity Lemma was an algorithm, due to Alon, Duke, Lefmann, Rodl, and Yuster (1994), which constructs, for any large graph G = (V,E), a regular partition of G in time polynomial in |V|.  This algorithm allows one to convert many applications which use the Szemeredi Regularity Lemma into (polynomial-time) constructive solutions.  A natural question considered by many researchers was how one could extend the Szemeredi Regularity Lemma to hypergraphs.  (If such an extension was strong enough to admit a corresponding Counting Lemma, then interesting applications to combinatorial number theory and combinatorial geometry could be obtained.)  Frankl and Rodl made the first big step in this direction with a regularity lemma for 3-uniform hypergraphs, which was then generalized by Rodl and Skokan to hypergraphs of arbitrary uniformity.  A corresponding Counting Lemma was established by Nagle, Rodl and Schacht.  Using different concepts and techniques, hypergraph Regularity and Counting Lemmas were also proven by Gowers, and subsequently, by Tao.  As a result of these works, one has a Hypergraph Regularity Method, and in the recent years, many applications of this method have been given, by many researchers.  Similarly to the Szemeredi Regularity Lemma, the original proofs of the hypergraph regularity lemma were not constructive.  (The first step in this direction was taken by Haxell, Nagle, and Rodl (c. 2005), for 3-uniform hypergraphs.)  The central goal of this NSF project was to obtain an algorithmic version of the hypergraph regularity lemma, for hypergraphs of arbitrary uniformity.  The central achievement of this NSF project was the successful conclusion to this problem.  In joint work, the PI, Rodl, and Schacht established an algorithmic hypergraph regularity lemma, which constructs, for any large (k-uniform) hypergraph H = (V, E), a regular partition of H in time polynomial in |V|.  In conjunction with earlier known counting lemmas, our work provides a Constructive Hypergraph Regularity Method, which should provide constructive solutions to many of the problems where a regularity lemma can be applied.  During this project, several corresponding applications were also obtained, which we now briefly describe.  Suppose F is a fixed k-uniform hypergraph, and H is a large (host) k-uniform hypergraph.  We would like to construct a maximum size F-packing of H, which is a largest possible collection of edge-disjoint copies of F in H.  It is known from the work of Dor and Tarsi that, already when k=2, computing the size of a largest F-packing of H is, in general, an NP-hard problem.  Extending the work of Haxell and Rodl (and subsequently, Yuster) for graphs, the PI and his PhD graduate J. Dizona proved that, when F is a linear hypergraph (whose edges pair-wise overlap in at most one point), asymptotically optimal F-packings of H can be polynomially constructed.  The PI extended this result to cover all 3-uniform hypergraphs F and H.  Both of these results rely on (early versions of) the Algorithmic Hypergraph Regularity Method.  These results suggest that, with the full conclusion of the Algorithmic Hypergraph Regularity Method at hand, it should be possible to polynomially construct asymptotically optimal F-packings of an arbitary hypergraph H, by an arbitrary fixed hypergraph F.  Current work in this direction seems to support this possibility.   In addition to the problems above, many other extremal combinatorial problems were studied in this project, by the PI, with various co-authors, including recent graduates (Khan, Dizona, Lundberg) and current students (Saez, Churchill, Theado) at the University of South Florida.  These works include various extremal problems on graphs, hypergraphs, permutations, and lattices, which resulted in a collection of submitted papers.  At the time of this writing, many of these papers have been accepted to or appeared in various journals.        Last Modified: 12/23/2016       Submitted by: Brendan T Nagle]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
