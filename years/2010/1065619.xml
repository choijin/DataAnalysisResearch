<AbstractNarration>Itelmen is a highly endangered language spoken natively by fewer than 20 individuals on the Kamchatka peninsula in Russia. The primary goal of this project is to compile multimedia (audio and video) support for a dictionary of the language. The project will record as much material as possible with the remaining speakers, supplementing small existing collections, and making annotated audio and video recordings available for posterity (both for scholars and for community members) with digital archives in both Russia and the U.S. A component of the project involves the development of software for language archiving and analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Itelmen has many rare typological features, which make these recordings of interest to linguistic scholarship, both narrowly (shedding light on the structure and history of the Chukotko-Kamchatkan language family), and broadly, to the field of linguistics as a whole (especially in the areas of morphology, phonology and typology), as well as related areas such as linguistic anthropology. The project includes training of graduate students in the US and in the field, as well as the training of a member of the Itelmen community in techniques of language documentation and revitalization.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 2010 when this project was first proposed there were roughly12 speakers of Itelmen, a language spoken on Kamchatka peninsula in the Russian Far East.  The language had been and was being studied by linguists in Russia, Japan, Germany and the U.S.  As plans developed for the compilation of a comprehensive Itelmen dictionary based on the unpublished lexicographical work of Russian linguist Alexander Pavlovich Volodin, this project sought to coordinate with those endeavors by transcription and analysis of previously collected materials and continued urgent fieldwork with Itelmen speakers.  At the same time, working with computer programmers, the aim was to create an interactive platform for audio-visual documentation that could be linked with the digital dictionary.   With the number of knowledgeable and active speakers of the language dwindling, there was an urgent need to cross-check the lexical data and to document conversational Itelmen with the remaining conversationally able speakers.  Thus, in 2012 this project invited all of the known language bearers to a gathering and workshop in Kamchatka.  Six conversational speakers and another six passive language bearers participated with interested community members and researchers in a 7-day meeting.  Researchers recorded group sessions on lexical topics, pragmatics exercises, orthography discussions, life history narratives, songs and spontaneous and prompted conversations. The activities of the workshop contributed to the lexical verification and word and phrase recordings for the audio dictionary as well as to the more general corpus of spoken Itelmen. Since the gathering in 2012, sadly, three of the speakers have passed away and two of the others have frequently been ill.  The gathering came at a critical moment in the history of the Itelmen language.   The project also contributed to the study of the Itelmen language by the production of transcripts of materials previously recorded by project team members. Chikako Ono transcribed over 40 hours out of 50 hours of previously recorded materials.  One of the goals of the project has been to use the accepted standard for long-term data storage, ELAN (Max Planck Institute).  Twelve of Ono?s transcriptions have been entered into ELAN and can be used in conjunction with the online dictionary.  One of most exciting of the accomplishments came out of the efforts by Viktor Ryzhkov (with support from our collaborating partner UConn) and Chikako Ono to transcribe recordings made on wax cylinder in 1910 by Russian ethnographer Vladimir Jochelson.  These are by far the earliest known recordings of the Itelmen language.     The aim of the project was to use the highest standards for digital storage of linguistic data including Fieldworks Language Explorer (FLEx from SIL) for lexical data and ELAN for time-coded transcriptions of audio and video recordings.  FLEx has powerful linguistic analysis tools and this project contributed to developing interoperability between the two programs.  Computer programmers Tom Myers and Alexander Nakhimovsky developed software that facilitates translation of FLEx interlinear output files into ELAN?s EAF format and vice-versa.  Transcriptions from ELAN can be entered into FLEx for analysis and then come back for viewing in ELAN with the analytic information and the time codes intact.  This development paralleled our aim to create a dictionary-corpus bridge, between our FLEx lexical data and ELAN transcriptions and associated recordings. The interoperability allows users to look up words while viewing video or audio recordings and to see audio recordings that contain a particular word while browsing the dictionary.   Myers developed the program MannX to enable viewing of ELAN transcriptions in html format using a standard browser. All of this developed software is open source and available to all for use in linguistic research and research dissemination, and, by the same token available for further development by others.   In December of 2017 Myers and web designer Ilya Lobov helped to develop a website to present in testing format for the Itelmen community.  The dictionary/corpus website was loaded onto an offline wifi-server for use in the Community Center (Dom kul?tury) in the village, where internet service is marginal.  Through this testing we hope to better understand the community?s needs for the website to create the completed version under the auspices of the comprehensive dictionary project.   Fieldwork recordings, including those transcribed for this project, those recorded at the 2012 gathering, and those gathered in the course of fieldwork conducted under this grant have been turned over to the Alaska Native Language Archive for preservation and access by scholars and interested individuals.   Seven graduate students received training and support under this grant and the resources of the grant contributed to the completion of two doctoral theses in anthropology.   In sum, this project performed urgent research on, and documentation of a unique and highly endangered language, established an archive of materials at the Alaska Native Language Archive and created a usable, open source solution for community access to a wealth of audio-visual linguistic materials.
