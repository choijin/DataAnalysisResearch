<AbstractNarration>Objective&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to demonstrate a working prototype of a nano-optical conveyor belt for transport of ~100 nm nanoparticles over millimeter distances.  Engineered metallic nanostructures support intense near fields that can trap truly nanoscopic objects such as viruses and single molecules.  Numerical calculations indicate that a chain of alternating size C-shaped apertures, irradiated in turn by three wavelengths, can peristaltically transport nanoparticles along its length using substantially less power than is required for conventional optical trapping.  Work will be guided by electromagnetic, diffusion and fluidic simulations.  Relative merits of candidate nanostructures will be determined through numerical and laboratory experiments with nanospheres.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The competing effects of Brownian motion, refractive momentum transfer and radiation pressure, convection currents and thermophoresis have not been studied in conjunction with asymmetrical plasmonic structures as will be required for this work.  This work opens new theoretical and experimental territory in optics and supports a new generation of massively parallel biomolecule research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The nano optical conveyor belt is an enabling technology for macromolecular manipulation and lab-on-a-chip devices.  A device which can identify single molecules must have a mechanism for drawing in and holding the molecule, and as such this work is a "glue technology" for fundamental biomolecular research.  Compact pathogen detection systems enabled by such nano-manipulation tools are increasingly important for homeland security.  This project will incorporate high school and undergraduate research assistants, and be integrated into our remote laboratory framework to reach students worldwide.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objectives of the research were fourfold:  1. To design, build and test a nano optical conveyor belt (NOCB)  2. To model the NOCB for system optimization  3. To dissiminate the results of the research  4. To educate graduate and undergraduate students in nano technology  A NOCB enbles nano-sized particles to be trapped by nano optical tweezers and to be transported along a path (like a conveyor belt for macro sized objects). Although particles have been trapped by optical tweezers for several decades, no demonstration of trapping and transporting nano particles has been reported to the best of our knowledge.  The first innovation we needed to make was to develop a nanosized optical tweezer that is capable of trapping nano particles.  Previous approaches include nano apertures and nano antennas, but these approaches don't allow transport of nano particles.  In order to accomplish nano particle transport we had to develop a novel way to hand-off particles from one nano trap to another under optical or electronic control without physical movement of the trap, as is done in macro-sized optical tweezers.  We solved these challenges by developing a novel sculptured C-aperture.  We invented C-apertures in 2000 in our laboratory, but we needed to make significant innovations to use these for the NOCB. Traditional C-apertures are cut out of a gold layer deposited on top of a glass or other substrate. Such apertures, however, tend to trap particles through local high electric fields at the endges of the C-aperture, and won't allow particle hand-off needed for particle transport. The sculptured C-aperture, in contrast is smooth on the top surface facing the channel in which the particles are moving and from wich they need to be trapped.   Secondly, we needed to develop a method of trapping, and subsequently releasing them to the nearest neighbor for transport.  This was accomplished by modeling the particle trapping and transport through the use of solutions to Maxwell's equations.  These solutions enabled us to use polarization rotation as the underlying mechanism for particle trapping followed by particle handoff.
