<AbstractNarration>Professor Cl√°udio N. Verani at the Wayne State University is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program of the Division of Chemistry to conduct research on the use of metal-containing amphiphiles for redox-active supramolecular thin films. This interdisciplinary program seeks to merge redox-driven switching in transition-metal coordination complexes with molecular organization at surfaces, and focuses on three aims: (i) the development of redox-active amphiphiles and hydrophobes based on five-coordinate M(III)-complexes with electroactive ligands, (ii) the design of redox-active amphiphiles of discoid topology based on modular multimetallic cores, and (iii) the development of novel approaches to assemble extended modular Langmuir films at the air-water interface. These aims require a comprehensive and multidisciplinary knowledge in synthetic methodologies, electrochemical, spectroscopic, computational, isothermal compression, and microscopy methods.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is an effort to translate information learned from small transition metal complexes into useful systems that foster the development of new materials and devices. The educational component is based on a socio-cognitive approach and uses unifying topics such as soaps and simpler experiments to reach out for graduate students, middle school students, as well as kindergartners of the Detroit School System. In addition, this research provides multidisciplinary research training for undergraduates and graduate students in inorganic and materials chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

The Verani Group works on the development of molecular materials that may find applications in the fabrication of electronic components. This field is known as molecular electronics and requires a multidisciplinary approach that involves coordination and redox chemistry, and surface and interface phenomena. We are working on molecules that will be incorporated in devices for current rectification, an asymmetric flow of electricity similar to that observed in vacuum tubes and solid-state diodes.
