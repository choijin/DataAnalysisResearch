<AbstractNarration>The Nebraska Math Scholars Program provides scholarships to financially disadvantaged undergraduate students who major in mathematics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL).  The program attracts and retains talented students by encouraging them to be part of a network of students who are excited about college and about mathematics.  Nebraska Math Scholars participate in an active Math Club, an undergraduate seminar series, regular casual group meetings with faculty and graduate students, and enhanced advising.  Math Scholars attend special workshops and recitation sections where they work in groups on problems designed to strengthen the skills and understanding of concepts necessary for success in their pre-calculus and calculus courses. During their undergraduate careers, the Math Scholars are encouraged to engage in supervised research projects with faculty mentors. In addition, the Nebraska Math Scholars Program includes a bridge program for underprepared graduate students.  The S-STEM Bridge to Graduate School program permits meritorious students to take an extra senior year of mathematics before beginning graduate studies.  The Nebraska Math Scholars Program is increasing the percentage of disadvantaged and/or underrepresented students who succeed academically in STEM fields while expanding the pipeline of students applying to graduate school.</AbstractNarration>

The amount of the scholarship was determined by their FAFSA-determined need, minus other scholarships, with a maximum of $10,000 per year.  We advertised the scholarship widely.  We also considered any incoming student who declares a mathematics major to have applied for the scholarship.

Throughout the program we had an average of about 4 activities a month for the Scholars during the academic year. About half of these are Math Club academic events, which are open to all University of Nebraska (UNL) students, and half of them were social events organized by the graduate mentors for the Scholars.  A typical social meeting started at 6 pm and continued for between one and a half and three hours, in the Math Department Lounge.

In the first year we had lunch meetings, but it was hard to get students to attend these; the evening pizza meetings were much better attended, and more comfortable for the scholars.   The NMS program worked with the Math Club, which is an umbrella organization for mathematics-related activities organized for UNL undergraduates.  The Math Club and NMS sponsor frequent talks and panels for undergraduate math majors.  The NMS program co-sponsored the Annual Pi Mu Epsilon Lectures, which often focused on interdisciplinary uses of mathematics. Every year we had one or two "career perspectives" lectures featuring former UNL alumni who went into industry after receiving their undergraduate degree and have had very successful careers.   Each Scholar was assigned a faculty mentor when they start their scholarship, in addition to the advisor assigned to all mathematics majors.  If the student already had a working relationship with a faculty member, that faculty member was that student's advisor.  In most cases we try to match the student's interests with those of an advisor.  Typical discussions covered which courses to take the next semester, the academic plan for their entire college career, and their post-college plans.
