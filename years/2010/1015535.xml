My host, Dr. Xuedong Yan, led the research efforts at the University of TennesseeÆs Southeastern Transportation Center for several years before coming to Beijing. Therefore, I have worked with Dr. Yan for several years.

It was concluded that noticeable driver performance variables differed in the first test section of the second run and virtually no difference was calculated in the performance at test section four. Therefore, we can conclude that drivers reach a stable performance state between 11 and 16 minutes of overall exposure with gradually increasing complexity of driving maneuvers. It is advised that the exposure during the warm-up period be divided into two or more short test sessions. This will allow researchers to inquire of the subjectÆs comfort level at separate stages during the acclimation. For subjects who can ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
