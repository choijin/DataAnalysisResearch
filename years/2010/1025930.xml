<AbstractNarration>Lichens are highly successful and stable mutualistic associations between fungi and either or both green algae and cyanobacteria. Although the cosmopolitan genus Peltigera is one of the earliest described lichens, due to its great abundance in nature and prominent morphological features, its morphological variation has been puzzling taxonomists since its discovery. This diverse genus of approximately 90 species is ecologically important in part because its cyanobacterial partner fixes atmospheric nitrogen. Despite the obligate nature of the lichen symbiosis, nearly all revisionary studies of lichens have been restricted to the fungus. Here, for the first time, the two main symbiotic partners will be characterized genetically. This will be the first worldwide phylogenetic study of Peltigera. It will provide a framework for detailed taxonomic revisions of three species complexes, which will lead to the description of at least ten new species in North America alone, and will drastically improve the highly inconsistent delimitation of existing species. This study will also demonstrate the role cyanobacteria can play in shaping evolutionary histories of fungi and vice versa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the training of one postdoctoral researcher and one undergraduate student each year, two high school students will be introduced to conducting research on symbiotic systems. The resulting keys for the identification of Peltigera species will improve the quality of research in the fields of ecology, conservation biology and fungal systematics. This revisionary work will bring together all leading experts working on Peltigera by forming a strong international network.</AbstractNarration>

Despite the obligate nature of this symbiosis, nearly all revisionary studies of lichens have been restricted to the fungus.   This project was a worldwide phylogenetic revision of the cyanolichen genus Peltigera and its cyanobacterial partner Nostoc, for which we have systematically sequenced the DNA of both co-living partners.  We have discovered a surprisingly high number of new Peltigera species (more than 50 so far, for a new grand total of at least 140 species).  Species that were known as common and widespread turned out to be composed of multiple species with more restricted distributions. This study also unveiled for the first time patterns of symbiotic association and specificity at a worldwide scale for an entire genus.

We also found that the color of the Nostoc in the lichen thallus can be used to determine the Nostoc phylogroup, and in combination with geographical and phenotypic information, can serve as a diagnostic feature to identify Peltigera lichens more accurately.  This project supported the training of three (two females, one male) postdoctoral research associates (two with funding from European countries, Switzerland and Belgium), two (males) Ph.D. students (with funding from Belgium and Canada), one Master student (male), one undergraduate student from Colombia (male), and three (females) undergraduate students at Duke University.
