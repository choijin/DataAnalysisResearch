<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to grow gallium nitride (GaN) single crystals that are large enough to yield commercially-viable non-polar GaN substrates for optoelectronic devices. The feasibility of the crystal growth processes was demonstrated in Phase I.  This Phase II project will focus on the reproducibility and scalability of the crystal growth and back-end processing methods. It is anticipated that the resulting per-unit price reduction will accelerate the adoption of GaN substrates by ultra-high brightness light emitting diode (LED) manufacturers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impacts of this project will be the potential to provide large-area non-polar GaN substrates for applications in advanced GaN-based light emitters such as laser diodes and ultra-high brightness LEDs.  GaN-based LEDs present exciting long-term prospects for solid-state lighting, via the replacement of inefficient and/or toxic conventional light sources such as light bulbs and fluorescent lamps.  However, the LEDs must be sufficiently low cost and demonstrate high luminous output power to justify the replacement of existing conventional lamps. GaN-based LEDs fabricated on non-polar GaN substrates that will be developed in this project has the potential to meet the most demanding lighting requirements, whereas conventional polar GaN-based LEDs ultimately cannot.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During its NSF Phase II SBIR program, Inlustra Technologies made significant progress in developing scalable vapor-phase bulk crystal growth of GaN.  GaN boules of more than 10 mm thickness were cross-cut into semi-polar and non-polar GaN wafers that were used for device validation in the form of blue and green LEDs.  Thick semi-polar GaN films, unlike their non-polar a-plane or m-plane counterparts, exhibited dislocation reduction with thickness, such that Inlustra observed a dislocation density roughly two orders of magnitude lower than that seen in non-polar a-plane GaN crystals of the same thickness.  Inlustra adopted bulk crystal growth gas flow conditions which were more economical than previously used, and enabled growth run durations in excess of 48 hours (with potential for further improvement). Late in the program, Inlustra achieved an increase in boule thickness to the point where sizeable cross-cut non-polar and semi-polar GaN wafers could be effectively prepared.  Lapping and polishing of these wafers was accomplished with no residual scratch damage, and re-growth resulted in no additional defect generation.  Inlustra also pursued the development of a specialized X-ray diffraction technique to estimate stacking fault density in bulk GaN-derived wafers.  Prior to the end of the Phase II program, Inlustra ceased operations.  Physical assets were liquidated, and intellectual property is will likely be licensed to other commercial entities which can further the GaN technology Inlustra developed.
