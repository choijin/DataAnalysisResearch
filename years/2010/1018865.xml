<AbstractNarration>The continuous evolution of the Web has made itself the primary&lt;br/&gt;knowledge source for many people. It has become an information&lt;br/&gt;repository full of entities (material or virtual) and descriptions&lt;br/&gt;of their properties and relationships. In discovering and exploring&lt;br/&gt;the entities that fascinate them, the users are in need of&lt;br/&gt;structured querying facilities, coupled with text retrieval&lt;br/&gt;capabilities, that explicitly deal with the entities, their&lt;br/&gt;properties, and relationships.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the PIs investigate a novel declarative query&lt;br/&gt;mechanism, entity-relationship queries (ERQ), for users to discover&lt;br/&gt;and explore the rich structured and entity-centric information on&lt;br/&gt;the Web. The research objective is to produce general methods for&lt;br/&gt;efficient processing and optimization of entity-relationship&lt;br/&gt;queries and automatic ranking of query results, and to&lt;br/&gt;systematically develop a query engine for such queries. The&lt;br/&gt;methodology is to exploit the evidence of the co-occurrence of&lt;br/&gt;entities and keyword constraints, through the integration of DB and&lt;br/&gt;IR methods. A systematic approach will be taken to produce automatic&lt;br/&gt;ranking function formulation method, efficient entity-centric index&lt;br/&gt;and index selection methods, and top-k query processing algorithms.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research results will have broader impacts on the higher&lt;br/&gt;education system, high-tech industries, the scientific community,&lt;br/&gt;and the general public. The educational goal of the project is to&lt;br/&gt;be achieved by integrating research and educational efforts through&lt;br/&gt;these activities: broadening database curriculum; involving&lt;br/&gt;under-represented students and undergraduates in research;&lt;br/&gt;outreach; and publicly releasing the online demo, software,&lt;br/&gt;datasets, publications, and course materials.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information see the project web page:&lt;br/&gt;URL: http://idir.uta.edu/erq</AbstractNarration>
