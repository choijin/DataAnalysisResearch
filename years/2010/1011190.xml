<AbstractNarration>With support from the National Science Foundation, the American Indian Language Policy Research and Teacher Training Center , situated at the University of New Mexico's College of Education , will sponsor the International  Indigenous  Language Policy Research Conference.  This conference will assemble researchers, practitioners and educators from Indigenous communities of the Americas who are concerned with the preservation of Indigenous language amidst rapidly expanding global influence.   The central goal is to deliver and share information about best practices and strategic planning in language preservation efforts and discuss contemporary research about the impact of policy issues on indigenous language survival. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on previous conference information, there are about 150 participants anticipated, from both the United States and Latin America, who are involved in language policy issues at various levels.  The conference is staged to spark an international dialogue about policy issues that will foster a better understanding of the unique challenges facing Indigenous communities with respect to their languages.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Two International Indigenous Language Policy Research Conferences were held on the University of New Mexico campus in 2010 and 2011. These two-day events brought together scholars, Indigenous language practitioners and language advocates representing diverse language communities from across the Americas.  The purpose was to facilitate an international dialogue about policy issues in order to foster a better understanding of the unique issues challenging Indigenous communities in the maintenance and survival of their respective languages, and to explore the commonalities that help build collaborative support and advocacy of language revitalization and maintenance efforts.  A key outcome of the two convenings was to introduce Indigenous scholars and colleagues to the work of the American Indian Language Policy Research and Teacher Training Center and raise an awareness about the different impacts on language resulting from policies in the field of education; current documentation activities in Indigenous languages; new media technologies being developed by Indigenous communities for teaching language; and the work of community-based researchers in language and early childhood. For example, a collective research group from Mexcio addressed the critical nature of learning culture and language through observation and participation in Indigenous-heritage communities represented by several different presenters. Other presenters shared examples about the role of Indigenous literature in language survival and the use of information technologies in teaching language. Graduate students engaged in their own doctoral research also presented "works in progress" ranging across a number of topics including the role of Indigenous elders in language acquisition, community empowerment through language revitalization initiatives, and the role of American and Mexican imperialism on the diminishmnet of a southwest Indigenous language.  These and other topics provided a lively venue of dialogue and participation among all conference participants.  As a result, participants had the opportunity to listen to and engage in dialogue with presenters who shared their current research across a broad spectrum of topics, Indigenous language practitioners, work as well as language research "works in progress" from Indigenous doctoral students. The success of the 2010 conference also helped set the stage for an additional international conference held in May, 2011 with a more focused spotlight on early childhood education and the implications for Indigenous language transmission and language survival.  In summary, the overall impact of the 2010 and 2011 International Indigenous Language Policy Research Conferences was to create a venue for cross-participant gathering of scholars (indigenous and non-indigenous), indigenous leaders, language practitioners and indigenous language scholars. Language policy issues, are  key aspects of language re-generation and maintenance work that often take place primarily within academic and institutional silos, but without the participation of Indigenous communities.  This conference tried to address this imbalance by raising an awareness among all groups about key challenges in the preservation of Indigenous languages, and provide a venue for examining current language revitalization efforts from a variety of Indigenous perspectives.
