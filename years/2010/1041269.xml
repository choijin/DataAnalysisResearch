<AbstractNarration>This award to the University of California - Berkeley (UC Berkeley) is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5).  UC Berkeley will establish a URM program to engage under-represented minority students in intensive mentoring and research experience and prepare them for graduate studies in the biological sciences.  This URM program will engage 4-5 undergraduates for a period of 12-18 months in projects that examine the effects of environmental stressors on amphibian growth, development, and immune function. Several environmental factors including pond drying, overcrowding, temperature extremes, invasive species, and agricultural runoff can negatively impact amphibians without causing death directly. These environmental stressors are capable of altering stress hormone levels (corticosterone) and sex steroid hormone levels (androgens and estrogens), leading to impaired growth, development, reproduction, and immune function. These studies are critical in understanding the complex interactions between factors that contribute to global amphibian declines. Students will utilize an integrative approach that combines field studies with controlled laboratory examinations of cause-effect relationships and explorations of underlying mechanisms. A series of laboratory rotations and internships, where participating students will work in selected laboratories, will broaden the already integrative and cross-disciplinary nature of this approach. Students from under-represented ethnic groups will be recruited, with a focus on Native Americans, Native Pacific Islanders, and Mexican Americans from agricultural communities. Talented students who are in greatest need of the research and mentoring experience will be selected, in order to retain such students in science and prepare them for graduate study. In addition to research, students will participate in seminars and workshops to further enhance their knowledge in the field and develop their communication and leadership skills. More information is available by contacting the URM Program Director, Dr. Tyrone Hayes (tyrone@berkeley.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The original plan of the URM was to fund a cohort of students from their freshman year at UCB until their senior year to participate in laboratory research. The cohort would have included (by the end of the five-year funding period), two freshman, two sophomores, two juniors, two seniors, and two students who would have graduated by the end of the funding period. The 'cohort-concept' is important for maintaining the peer-mentoring that is an important part of the undergraduates' experience in my laboratory, where students learn how to mentor while they are being mentored. Because my URM was funded for only two years with ARRA funds, however, I had to act quickly and adapt my program.<br /><br />The URM supported four students directly. Two of the students were finishing students (seniors) and two were incoming freshmen. Three of the four were under-represented minorities (one African American, one Mexican American, and one Filipina-American). The fourth student was Indian American and a fifth student (Mexican American) had her research supported by the grant, but earned other scholarships so her stipend was not supported. All but one of the students was female. All but one was recruited from my freshman course. No high school students were recruited.<br /><br />The younger students are continuing to work in the laboratory funded by an NSF supplement from our REU grant. The senior students are completing studies this summer, taking the GRE and applying to graduate school. All five of the students will earn co-authorships on paper in preparation this summer. <br /><br />One other positive aspect of having the URM and serving as co-PI on our REU grant, is that the URM students served as hosts and mentors to the REU students who worked in my laboratory.
