<AbstractNarration>The Southern California Number Theory Day is a one-day conference of number theory lectures, bringing together mathematicians from southern California and beyond.  The lectures are research talks at the cutting edge of the field, given by international experts.  The conferences will serve as a way to disseminate the latest research, and encourage interactions and collaborations among number theorists, leading to new ideas and interesting and useful research results in this important field of mathematics.  The conferences will give graduate students and postdocs the opportunity to interact with senior mathematicians from other institutions in academia, government, or industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number theory is a central field of mathematics, that goes back to ancient times.  Modern day number theory builds on centuries of work in mathematics, to solve not only modern day problems but also difficult problems that remained unsolved for hundreds of years.  Number theory underpins the security of electronic commerce, and provides security for defense communications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The funding supported five Southern California Number Theory Day conferences from 2011 until 2015, including one mini-conference and three full one-day conference at the University of California at Irvine, and one two day conference that took place at Cal State University, Fullerton as a Special Session of an American Mathematical Society sectional meeting in order to allow for an expanded program.  The conferences bring together mathematicians from southern California and beyond.  The intent is to encourage interactions and collaborations among number theorists, leading to new ideas and interesting and useful research results in this important field of mathematics.  The lectures are research talks given by international experts.  The conferences bring together a critical mass of number theorists, in a way that each southern California institution individually cannot do with its own seminars.  The conferences also serve as a way to disseminate the latest research.  The conferences give the participants the opportunity to interact with scholars from other institutions, and the conferences give graduate students and postdoctoral scholars the opportunity to interact with senior mathematicians from other institutions in academia, government, and industry.  Efforts are made by the organizers to include speakers from under-represented groups and to encourage participants from under-represented groups to take part in the conferences.
