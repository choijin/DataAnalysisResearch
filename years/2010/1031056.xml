<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Collaborative Research award is to develop capabilities for machining structural biological composites such as bone and nacre with minimal surface damage. These biological composites exhibit many levels of hierarchical structures from macroscopic to microscopic length scales, and novel structural mechanical properties. The research approach will utilize novel diagnostic instruments for studying deformation/fracture in biological composites and high-resolution optical techniques for analysis of deformation in machining. Modeling structured around finite element analysis and moving heat source theory will be used to predict the thermomechanical state of the composite surfaces created by cutting. Model predictions will be compared with the experimental observations. By integrating these results, recommendations will be developed for improved cutting procedures that will minimize surface damage in this class of structural bio-materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the broader impact of the results will be new cutting methodologies for the bio-inspired structural materials of the future, and improved procedures for surgery that minimize damage to bone and tissue. The results will be of value also in understanding deformation and cutting of complex bio-inspired (structural) materials of the future and soft matter, and for continued development of diagnostic instrumentation for biological composites. Complementing the research is an education and training program that includes development of a bone cutting test-bed for practitioners and interns, student internships, seminar series webcast, and a modest focus on fostering entrepreneurship in graduate study.</AbstractNarration>
