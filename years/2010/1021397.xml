<AbstractNarration>A new generation of technology potentially allows researchers to uncover the genetic basis of specific traits in natural populations. This knowledge can be applied to understand in detail how populations evolve and respond genetically to environmental changes. This project will study a dramatic example of a specific trait, black coat color in dogs, which has been transferred to gray wolves (the ancestor of domestic dogs) uniquely in North America. This is the first example of a genetic mutation that appeared under domestication and has been widely successful in nature. The project will apply novel molecular and analytical techniques to integrate detailed molecular data with detailed data on coat color variation and ecology to understand how and why this mutation has been so successful in nature. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this study will provide a detailed genetic understanding of the evolutionary forces responsible for causing the black mutation to sweep through North American wolf populations. These results support development of more general models of how selection acts on traits important to organismal survival and performance and are useful in predicting how populations can respond genetically to environmental change. The project will provide interdisciplinary and quantitative training for students and post-doctoral scientists, novel tools and models with broad applications, and information to the public through collaboration with museum programs and development of an interactive website.</AbstractNarration>
