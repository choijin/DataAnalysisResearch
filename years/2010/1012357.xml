<AbstractNarration>In this collaborative project, supported by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor David N. Beratan of Duke University and Professor Igor V. Rubtsov of Tulane University will develop methods to control electron transfer reactions. They will accomplish this goal by developing approaches to manipulate the strength of electronic communication within and between molecules; these electronic interactions influence the rates of electron transfer. The Beratan group will employ quantum and statistical mechanical theories to design, analyze and interpret inelastic electron-transfer kinetics in structures with bridge-localized vibrational modes. The goal is to develop interpretive and predictive descriptions of intramolecular inelastic electron tunneling in a variety of molecules containing an electron donor, a bridge, and an electron acceptor. The Rubtsov group at Tulane will develop ultrafast laser and multi-dimensional infrared spectroscopic methods to examine analogies between the double slit electron transmission experiment and the molecular electron-transfer problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will have a broad impact in developing intuition that may lead to applications in optical communication and solar energy harvesting. &lt;br/&gt;Professors Beratan and Rubtsov are promoting science education by providing summer research opportunities to economically disadvantaged and historically underrepresented groups. A new course cluster for first-year students is under development to examine the fundamental philosophical foundations of science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Here are summarized the project outcomes at both Duke University and Tulane University as a result of this collaborative project.  Intellectual Merit  In the last grant period, BeratanÆs group developed: (1) intensive collaborations with Prof. RubtsovÆs group, leading to a schemes for using infra-red (IR) methods to define and manipulate the extent of charge transfer in rhenium(Re)-containing complexes, (2) a theory of IR-perturbed ET in the presence of constant IR illumination, (3) strategies for manipulating the optical and electronic properties of highly delocalized systems, (4) a new approach for visualizing and cataloging non-covalent interactions in molecules, (5) strategies for inducing "current transfer" via chiral systems.  RubtsovÆs group developed:  (1) intensive collaborations with BeratanÆs group, leading to new schemes to design transition metal complexes with variable extents of charge separation;  (2) the group showed that charge transfer in Re(I) complexes occurs via weak coordination bonds and can be modulated by direct vibrational excitation of bpy modes of the complex. A simple model was developed that explains the findings; (3) several instrumental improvements were made that enhanced the experimental capabilities and sensitivity, including upgrades to the three-pulse apparatus (new array detector, larger range of delays, tunable OPA excitation), the triggered 2DIR apparatus (updated with OPA excitation), and incorporation of low-temperature measurements (down to liquid nitrogen);  (4) temperature dependence of vibrational energy transport was also studied.  Numerous graduate students and senior researchers were supported by this project.  One of the supported students received an MS degree and is now a staff member at Dimensional Fund Advisors.  A second student has passed his preliminary examination and is leading calculations on non-equilibrium molecular dynamics and 2DIR signatures of electron transfer, in collaboration with the principal investigator. Numerous graduate and undergraduate students were supported at Tulane University.  One of these students accepted a postdoctoral appointment at Emory University and is now teaching at Southern Polytechnic State U., GA.  A second student from Tulane is now a postdoc at U. of Houston.  Other students are leading the multi-pulse experiments. One of the undergraduate researchers was awarded an NSF graduate scholarship and has started graduate school at Stanford. Two of the Tulane students belong to underrepresented groups.    Broader Impact  During this grant period, Beratan taught an introductory graduate course on electron transfer theory, he team taught early graduate courses on nanoscience across multiple universities using WebEx software and modern computer technology, he developed a modern biophysical chemistry course (taught in 2013 and 2014), and he developed a course on quantum dynamics that is creating Wolfram CDF (Mathematica) notebook demonstrations, for "real time" quantum dynamics computations.  Students from Tulane participated in the WebEx nanoscience courses in 2013 and 2014.  Rubtsov developed a graduate course on modern spectroscopy and taught it in Spring of 2014. Every year, Prof. Rubtsov offers a laboratory unit on 2D IR spectroscopy for undergraduates.    The work supported by this award and the sister project at Tulane University led to 13 publications.  The findings of our team were recently highlighted in the March 2015 issue of Physics Today (Citation: Physics Today 68 (3), 10 (2015); doi: 10.1063/PT.3.2706).
