<AbstractNarration>Project Summary &lt;br/&gt;The hurricane genesis process is known to depend on the degree of vertical instability needed to support deep convection and on mid-level moistening, which modulates convective activity. However, the time variation of moistening is poorly known due to the lack of high temporal and spatial observations during the genesis process. Global Positioning System (GPS) Radio Occultation (RO) provides area-averaged profiles of refractivity (which depends on moisture and temperature) with very high vertical resolutions that are complementary to dropsondes (pointwise, high vertical resolution) and satellite retrievals (high horizontal but poor vertical resolution). GPS RO is insensitive to heavy precipitation, clouds, and winds.  Since the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC) became operational, space borne GPS RO data have shown a positive impact on global numerical weather prediction models in the mid to upper troposphere range.  However, the use of the data at lower levels has lagged for several reasons: 1) complications due to strong horizontal variations in moisture 2) difficulties in signal tracking and 3) sparse observations within the window of interest for mesoscale systems. This has led to minimal impact in tropical cyclone genesis and forecasting, and minimal impact below mid-troposphere in general. Airborne RO can play a major role in advancing understanding of the hurricane genesis process, because dense targeted measurements are simpler to make with an airborne system than with the existing space borne constellation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will take advantage of a unique opportunity to collect data during the Pre-Depression Investigation of Cloud Systems of the Tropics (PREDICT) campaign in August 2010, which will allow them to test their progress in data assimilation for the case of tropical cyclone genesis.  The data assimilation results should be of great interest to PREDICT investigators because they will provide better initial conditions for high-resolution models for testing new hypotheses concerning the evolution of tropical disturbances into hurricanes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project will promote the use of airborne radio occultation to an expanded research community and serve as a feasibility test for hurricane hunter surveillance missions, potentially resulting in a direct societal benefit from improved operational forecasts. This research activity will educate graduate students and promote the advancement of postdoctoral researchers within an international collaborative structure between Taiwan and US universities. It will strengthen research programs led by four female investigators, who will serve as role models for their students as well as other young female scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main intellectual merit of this project is to determine how useful a new type of observations is to improve model predictions of tropical cyclones and in what aspects.  We also propose the idea of having GPS signals recorded on commercial aircraft, and use that information to further improve severe weather forecast over continents.  Broader impacts include giving national weather centers a potential way to improve forecast of severe weather, such as where the hurricane will move to and when and where it will intensify; where heavy rainfall will occur; and suggest new ways to measure the atmosphere.  Weather forecasting has been clearly improved during the past decade.  This is because more theoretical knowledge on the natural phenomena has been learned; more advanced physics parameterizations have been developed; better computing resources have become available to produce forecasts at a higher resolution with more sophisticated physics; and more observations have become available to improve weather prediction.  In this project, we explored the impact of a new type of observation, airborne GPS radio occultation (RO) measurements, on severe weather forecasts.  Airborne GPS RO data is complementary to many other types of observations.  It is profile observations, which give information on a high density of vertical levels of the atmosphere that is lacking from surface stations.  It is airborne, and thus can have a higher density of observations over a particular area of interest, while space-borne GPS RO measurements have a lower density of measurements but cover a larger area.  GPS data is not contaminated by the EarthÆs surface, severe weather or clouds, which is an advantage over most satellite and ground-based measurements because it can measure the center of a storm without the data being affected.  Such airborne RO measurements over hurricanes were obtained for the first time during a field campaign in 2010, and they measured the genesis and development of tropical cyclones.  A major outcome of this study is the assessment of these new observations and the development of new tools to use these observations in numerical weather prediction.  We used Hurricane Karl in 2010 as a case study.  Our study shows that the airborne RO observations can improve the prediction of KarlÆs intensity and trajectory.  As of now, the airborne GPS RO observations can be further improved to ensure the robustness of its quality.  Currently, airborne GPS RO data is obtained only from research aircraft flying into a weather phenomenon of interest.  In the future, once the positive impact of the data on weather forecasts is proven, GPS receivers can be placed on commercial aircraft to regularly collect a significant amount of RO data for use in weather forecasts, which was another important study of this project.  We show that the use of RO observations hypothetically received by commercial aircraft would have improved the prediction of the heavy rainfall event that caused flash flooding in Colorado in September 2013.
