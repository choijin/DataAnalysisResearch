<AbstractNarration>This four-year Full Research and Development project develops and assesses the effectiveness of integrating three computation-based technologies into curricular modules: agent-based modeling (ABM), real-world sensing, and collaborative classroom networks. The team brings together researchers from Northwestern, Vanderbilt and Stanford universities in collaboration with a commercial partner, Inquire Learning. The STEM disciplines addressed are life sciences and physical sciences at middle and high school levels, specifically Evolution, Population Biology/Ecology, Kinetic Molecular Theory, and Electromagnetism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project proceeds in two phases: The first phase is a design experiment for the iterative creation of ABM-only and enhanced-ABM modules field tested with fourteen teachers drawn from seven schools.  In the second phase, an experiment is conducted that aims at providing quantitative data to help characterize the different effects of various components of the intervention and to prepare the way for future efficacy and scaling research.  Between 40 and 80 teachers participate in the experiment and are assigned to immediate or lagged treatments.  The four topic areas were selected because they are scientifically important; they are difficult for students, provoking significant misconceptions; they are amenable to a complex-systems and modeling approach; and prior work has prepared the PIs to develop high-quality curricular materials on these topics.  The evaluation is led by a member of the advisory board which is constituted to provide guidance on the project evaluation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The products are research findings on the achievement, engagement and attitudes of students as a result of the deep use of computational modeling technologies in science.  In addition, four fully developed classroom-ready modules with teacher support materials are deployed and disseminated through a broad network of educational communities.</AbstractNarration>

Emergent Systems Sandboxes&mdash;modeling environments that enable learners to prototype complex systems by visually composing such systems out of objects with predefined behaviors Case studies&mdash;grounding inferences from modeling activities in investigations of real-world cases   ModelSim activities utilize NetLogo (Wilensky, 1999); the curriculum was delivered using the WISE environment (Linn, Clark, &amp; Slotta, 2003). Each unit comes with teacher guides and supporting materials.     Progression from design studies to successful scaling up  A primary goal of the project was to scale the units. This was particularly ambitious due to the technological infrastructure required to make the complementary modalities listed above seamlessly accessible to students. Over the course of the project, we focused on designing units and technologies for scale, establishing relationships with schools and teachers, and investigating factors that made for successful scaling.   In design studies in 2012-13, we implemented our units in 28 classrooms with 13 teachers (10 Chicagoland, 2 Nashville-TN, 1 Dayton-OH), across 9 schools in 3 cities. Feedback and data collected here were used to refine the units and prepare them for scaled implementations.   In 2013-14, 34 teachers (32 Chicago-land, 1 Nashville-TN, and 1 Dayton-OH) used our units in 89 classrooms including more than 2000 students. On average there were 22.8 students in each class.     ModelSim units supporting significant student learning   Pre- and post-tests for each unit included a variety of nationally normed items. We obtained first-order descriptive evidence about the programÆs efficacy by considering the improvement of ModelSim students on these nationally-normed items relative to the national sample used in validating these items.   Students in both ModelSim biology units showed statistically significant growth (13.6 percentage points in Evolution (p=0.007); 7.2 percentage points in Population Biology (p=0.034)). This growth is particularly notable as ModelSim biology students began their units with a higher degree of baseline knowledge than the AAAS sample population (The average Evolution pre-test score was 47.8%, vs. 41.2% in the AAAS comparison sample; and in Population Biology 56.4%, vs. 43.1 in the AAAS sample), giving ModelSim students less room for growth.

Because the study is not a randomized controlled trial (RCT), these analyses do not support robust claims about causality or effectiveness of the ModelSim units at scale; nevertheless they do offer suggestive evidence that ModelSim has high potential to support significant learning in settings with low levels of researcher support.  These data may be seen to urge a follow-on study organized more formally as an RCT.
