<AbstractNarration>Phenotypic heterogeneity (aka phenotypic or phase variation) occurs when a subset of organisms in a population regulate a reversible switch that allows them to express alternate sets of cellular components. Myxococcus xanthus is a soil-dwelling, antibiotic-producing, bacterium whose dramatic social activities, including swarm expansion and development, have yielded a wealth of information about cell-cell interactions, signaling and multicellular cooperative behavior. These social processes are linked intimately with the ability of M. xanthus cells to undergo phase variation, which produces two inter-convertible cell types, called yellow and tan, that differ greatly in their abilities to swarm, survive, and develop. Wild-type colonies exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity because they contain a mixture of yellow, swarming and tan, non-swarming variants. Remarkably, both yellow and tan variants are critical for long-term survival of the population, which demonstrates that phenotypic heterogeneity in M. xanthus evolved a fail-safe mechanism to ensure the maintenance cell type survival. This research is aimed at using molecular, genetic, and bioinformatic and computational tools to elucidate the mechanism that allows M. xanthus cells to undergo this remarkable yellow to tan switch with the long-range goal of understanding the biological interplay between the two cell types. Toward this goal, the function of genes whose expression is phase dependent will be characterized and the regulators of phase variation, including the master regulator, will be identified. Because phenotypic variation affects multiple aspects of the M. xanthus lifecycle, the results of these experiments may lead to a coherent model showing how Myxococcus xanthus coordinates its social developmental pathways. Furthermore, results obtained using M. xanthus, a representative soil organism, may paint a more comprehensive picture of the role that phenotypic variation plays in fitness of environmental organisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  Myxococcus is an ideal organism to study microbial development and differentiation. This project will support the research of several undergraduate and graduate students who will gain training not only in classical genetics and molecular biology, but also in the use of bioinformatic and computational tools, which will be necessary to address the complexity of phase variation.  As answers to specific questions regarding phase variation are revealed, a bigger picture of a potentially novel signaling system is expected to emerge that may be broadly relevant to microbial communities in nature.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Phase variation (PV) is a reversible process that microbial cells use to rapidly and dramatically change their physical and even metabolic properties. This remarkable plasticity can help the organism adapt to changing environments allowing it to, for example, escape death (pathogens and host immunity) and nutrient depletion.  In Myxococcus xanthus, phase variation yields two cell types, PV1 (yellow) and PV2 (tan), that are important for the development of myxospores, the quiescent cells needed for long term survival of the organism.    The major goals of the project were to identify significant molecular differences between the two PV cell types in M. xanthus and to reveal the mechanism underlying the switch that regulates phase variation.  Experiments were designed to identify genes regulated differentially in PV1 and PV2 cells and determine the specific roles played by these genes and their products in the phenotypes that are affected by phase variation including pigmentation, swarming, fruiting body development and sporulation (aim 1).  Additional experiments were designed to identify regulators of phase variation and components involved in PV signal transduction (aim 2).  The broader impacts of the project were to train undergraduate students to conduct independent research and present their work at a scientific meeting and to raise awareness about the role of phase variation and the significance of the PV2 (tan variant) cells during studies on growth and development of M. xanthus.   The results of this study showed that expression of genes for production of the antibiotic myxovirescin (TA), which is needed for predation, and for the production of the protective yellow pigment called DKX, which is needed for formation of myxospores, is significantly increased in PV1 cells relative to PV2 cells.  PV2 cells are tan (nonpigmented) because they do not express the dkx genes and they do not produce DKX.  However, the PV2 cells need DKX (presumably obtained from dead PV1 cells) in order to differentiate into spores when nutrients are lacking.  PV2 cells also are unable to produce TA, and do not display predatory behavior. Instead, PV2 cells specialize in producing compounds for sequestration of iron.  Limiting iron in the medium stimulates M. xanthus cells to switch from PV2 (yellow) to PV1 (tan) and addition of the antibiotic TA also stimulates the PV2 to PV1 switch.  Analysis of mutants suggests that a small RNA species plays a role in regulating the iron sequestration processes in PV2 cells.  While information about the switch from PV2 (tan) to PV1 (yellow) is still being investigated, there is evidence that the AsgB protein, known historically for its role in cell-cell signaling during development, is needed for the PV2 to PV1 switch.  Significant results are mentioned above and are summarized here:  Under normal nutrient conditions, PV1 cells, but not PV2 cells, express genes for DKX, myxovirescin and other putative secondary metabolites. PV2 cells express products needed for iron acquisition; they shut off synthesis of secondary metabolites. Addition of iron (FeCl3) stabilizes the PV1 cells indefinitely and increases antibiotic production per mg of cell protein. Removal of iron causes PV1 cells to phase vary to PV2 state but addition of iron does not stimulate the reverse reaction.  Antibiotic TA also stimulates PV1 to PV2 switch but the mechanism is unclear because a ?ta mutant is still able to phase vary and it responds to low iron concentrations.   Three Xre-HTH DNA binding proteins have been shown to regulate branches of this pathway. One of these, Xre0228, is a positive regulator of the dkx and ta pathways.  PV2 (tan) cells play a unique role in myxobiology because the persist in vegetative cultures long after the PV1 cells have died and they disproportionately contribute to the myxospore population during development. Twelve undergraduate students spent at least 1-2 years (each) working in the laboratory on this project.  The majority of these students have gone on to professional and graduate schools in STEM.          Last Modified: 08/09/2016       Submitted by: Patricia L Hartzell]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
