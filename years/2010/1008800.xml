<AbstractNarration>Dr. Bergin, along with a postodoctoral fellow and students, will use chemistry as a tool to probe the physics of star and planet formation.  Young stars are usually surrounded by disks of material that contribute mass to the stars through the process of accretion.  These disks also contain the material out of which planets are formed. The main goals of the effort are (1) to explore carbon-grain destruction in the inner regions of circumstellar disks; (2) to characterize cosmic-ray penetration in these disks; (3) to identify ways of detecting exoplanets through molecular emission; and (4) to determine the time scales for episodic accretion in young stellar objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this project will be incorporated into the curriculum at the University of Michigan, and young researchers will be trained in the science of molecular astrophysics.  This project is also interdisciplinary in nature, with aspects of chemistry, physics, astrophysics, and astrobiology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    This program seeks to understand the origin of our life-fostering world,  our solar system in general, and the vast array of other planetary systems that are now being discovered.  Planetary systems like our own are forming within a disk of gaseous material that is primarily molecular hydrogen but contains a vast array of other molecular species such as water, carbon monoxide, molecular nitrogen, numerous organics and so on.  These molecules are important as they are the carriers of the elemenal carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogren that are key to Earth's biosphere.

It is the goal of this program to characterize and understand this chemistry.  Key questions include: what are the most important processes?;  are these physical or chemical mechanisms common in all stellar systems?;  what are the dominant carriers of important elements?  In all this program resulted in gains in our understanding with key findings published in major research journals. One notable result explored the origin of water on Earth with the intriguing finding that the water molecules formed before the birth of the Sun and in a sense are older than the solar system.  The program also has the benefit of fostering the early careers of a number of postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduates.  Scientific training and literacy are key national goals.
