<AbstractNarration>Cooperation and Learning over Cognitive Networks&lt;br/&gt;Studies on herding and self-organization in economics and the social and biological sciences have observed that coordination among multiple agents leads to regular patterns of behavior and swarm intelligence, even when each group member shows limited behavioral complexity. In ant colonies, for example, individual ants cannot capture rich spatial information from their environment because of their limited sensing ability. Nevertheless, when the ants coordinate their activities within a colony, the group ends up exhibiting better sensing abilities. Using signal processing and communications techniques, the research studies how and why such manifestations of rational and organized behavior arise at the group level from local interactions among agents with limited abilities, what communication topologies enable such behavior, and what type of signal processing enables such formations.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research seeks to understand and reverse-engineer the distributed intelligence encountered in socio-economic-biological networks, by investigating relations with learning and rationality over cognitive networks. The latter are adaptive networks that avoid centralized information processing and perform in-network inference and control decisions. Cognitive networks contrast with networks that rely on centralized and parallel information fusion, which are not scalable, are hard to adapt to changing topologies, and suffer from points of vulnerability and information bottlenecks.  The research considers large scale networks of agents and studies how global (rational or irrational) patterns of behavior emerge, including herds, contagions and bubbles in economics. An understanding of how the biotic environment influences collective behavior in animal societies provides a real world guide to good cognitive networks, which can be used in turn to design engineered systems. Cognitive networks have applications in areas ranging from precision agriculture, to environmental monitoring, disaster relief management, and smart spaces.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the academic year 2016/2017, I pursued my research work with Lucia Esposito (Central Bank of Italy) on the theoretical analysis of the dynamic coordination of individuals (agents) in making decisions with strategic complementarities. In this setting, the payoff of each agent?s action increases with the number of other agents taking the same action. Examples of application include bank runs, speculative attacks against a flexible exchange rate, investment over the business cycles, switches between political regimes.  This strategic complementarity operates like a reinforcing effect in collective actions and when it is sufficiently strong, it generates multiple equilibria in which either most agents take the actions, because of the high payoff due to collective action, or do not take the action because of the opposite effect. This issue has been analyzed in a large number of studies.     The contribution of our work is the combination of the imperfect information by the agents and the possibility of delaying the action (the dynamic aspect). For example, in a setting where an investment?s payoff increases with aggregate economic activity (through the investment by others), agents have only imperfect information on the number of other agents who are able to make an investment. In a dynamic setting, agents can delay their decision. The delay is costly---the agent foregoes a payoff before a decision is made---but it provides the benefit of getting more information on the behavior of others at the end of each period, agents can observe how many agents have invested and infer from this observation whether the aggregate investment will eventually be sufficiently large for a positive payoff of their investment.      A critical parameter is the length of time of the periods in which actions are taken and observations are made. We show that under a wide set of conditions, short periods (which facilitate quick reactions from individuals? observations to actions) have a negative impact on social welfare in the sense that they prevent the realization of a "high" equilibrium in which the payoff of each agent is positive because they all invest.  Such a "good" equilibrium does not take place because the amount of information increases with the number of investing agents. A high level of investment generates a high incentive to delay and wait for more information and is self-defeating.
