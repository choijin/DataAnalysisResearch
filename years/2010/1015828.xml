<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;29 June 2010&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1015828&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  University of Delaware&lt;br/&gt;PI:   W. Byam&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI:  [None]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests four Shipboard Scientific Support items for the University of Delaware for use aboard the R/V HUGH R. SHARP; namely up-grades to the CTD handing system, a new 70hp outboard for the vessel?s work boat, design for a new (aft) side load handling system, and noise treatments for the active anti-roll fins.   All items will either enhance safety or provide greatly improved support capabilities to science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact and Intellectual Merit:  The PI addressed the Broader Impact and Intellectual Merit of the proposed equipment specifically for the R/V HUGH R. SHARP.  The research projects supported have been individually peer-reviewed for scientific merit.  During operations, these vessels routinely expose graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography.  Specifically, College of Marine and Earth Studies participates in a large number of outreach programs including open house events (Coast Day), participation the MATE program, and educational cruises.  The College also hosts the UNOLS East Coast Van Pool.  The R/V HUGH R. SHARP is scheduled to support 77 NSF-funded days in CY 2010.</AbstractNarration>
