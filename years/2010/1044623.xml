<AbstractNarration>Although many benefits of authentic undergraduate research done by individuals have been described in the STEM literature, few efforts have extended undergraduate research in classes throughout the curriculum (from introductory to capstone classes) by using undergraduate research groups. This study is using hydrogeomorphic field areas on and near the PIs' campus as a backdrop to implement experience-appropriate, authentic research throughout the geology curriculum and is measuring the impacts of these research experiences on student learning. The fundamental question that the study is testing through quantitative and qualitative methods is whether learning gains associated with these group research experiences are similar to the research gains of individual undergraduate research projects that are widely reported in the literature. The PIs are also examining the experiential learning of student research fellows that serve as apprentices and help run the research station.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students enrolled in introductory classes through a capstone senior research seminar are addressing experience-appropriate, authentic, science problems that build on the research strength of faculty. These classes are fully integrating the PIs research and teaching functions. Hydrogeomorphic research topics are regionally and scientifically relevant problems related to water quality, landslides, groundwater and surface-water interaction, erosion due to land development and landscape evolution. Students in classes are addressing these issues in both natural and developed settings through experiments, monitoring, mapping and measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project is to understand and evaluate geology student learning gains as a function of group research based learning throughout the geology curriculum, and the results are helping the STEM community to better understand how learning gains vary at different geology class levels. The broader impact of this study is determining whether group research and individual research have similar learning gains. Insights gained from the current study of how to implement undergraduate group research is facilitating its extension to a larger population of students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Our NSF TUES grant had three goals: (1) to create a model for course-based, group, undergraduate research, (2) to determine student-perceived benefits of group undergraduate research, and (3) to create a successful model for Research Fellows.   Research Fellows are students who worked running the research watershed and helped with instruction and mentoring in our courses.  We first developed a model for implementing undergraduate research experiences within the context of a class.  Our model has groups of students participating in an entire research project, from creating a research question through communicating results.  Course design varied depending on the class level and goals, and we provided instruction on best research practices on issues like writing research questions, analyzing data, and making oral presentations. During the grant, we collected data from students about the benefits of this teaching approach.  We also developed a model for Research Fellows and explored how the course-based research model might be implemented differently at different levels of the curriculum.  In order to provide on-going, diverse research opportunities for students, the grant also helped with the development of a research watershed, the Western Carolina Hydrological Research Station (WCHRS; wchrs.wcu.edu), which was the focus of student projects. Intellectual Merit The development of the in-class group research model itself has significant intellectual merit.  Student feedback helped guide model development. During program assessment, students in focus groups told us that they valued the hands on learning parts of the projects, group collaboration, and the ability to do real (authentic) research projects.  These three emphases should be considered for anyone implementing any research-based learning approach in a classroom.  Over time, we developed a series of materials that allow this approach to be more seamlessly implemented in a classroom as well as foster sustainability for this pedagogical approach.    Student feedback indicated these projects can be implemented at different levels, but the learning benefits will be different based on the student population and the project design.  Students completed surveys, ranking gains they obtained through the research-based learning projects.  More experienced majors generally rated the experiences higher than general education students.  Further, general education students valued broader skills like collaboration and patience, while students in the major and allied fields put a greater emphasis on feeling part of the scientific community.  The development of a Research Fellows program also has merit, as it is different from other faculty-student mentorship models in that students are not working on a single research task.  Students learn by operating a watershed over time, by collecting, organizing and analyzing data, by using their knowledge and creativity to find solutions to problems, and by teaching other students about research.  Research Fellows have reported a variety of gains, especially high lighting their growth in field skills and leadership. Broader Impacts: The President?s Council of Advisor?s on Science and Technology, among others, recommend an undergraduate research or inquiry experience for students in the first two years of college.  Thus, providing greater access to research and inquiry-based activities would have broad educational impacts.  One way to achieve that is to implement a model of group, in-class undergraduate research like the one developed with our grant. In-class group research has allowed us to over 300 research experiences to students in fourteen classes over the past 4 years and 1 semester&mdash;this includes over 100 students from general education classes.  40 students have completed conference presentations due to research generated by the project, extending their learning beyond the semester. Unlike in the individual thesis experience, for which research students are selected (commonly from a highly selective list of accomplished students), the group undergraduate research model extends access to these opportunities to all students who enroll in our classes, providing access to a more diverse group of students.  In our case, this list includes students throughout the University who take these classes as a freshman seminar or science general education requirement.
