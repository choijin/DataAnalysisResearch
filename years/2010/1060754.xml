<AbstractNarration>This research is designed to answer basic questions about how magmatic systems operate and how magmas change composition. The work is societally relevant in terms of advancing our understanding of geologic hazards associated explosive volcanic eruptions. It involves making a comprehensive set of laboratory experiments and geochemical analyses on previously collected ocean bottom volcanic rocks to understand the mechanism by which these magmas evolve in the magma chamber from low to high silica in content. Newly developed isotopic techniques will be used to test the novel hypothesis that high silica magmas form through magma based diffusional transport processes related to sustained temperature gradients across the magma lens at the top of the magma chamber. This hypothesis runs counter to the more traditionally invoked mechanism of assimilation fractional crystallization as the primary process causing the compositional differentiation of magmas. Broader impacts of the work include integration of training and research which involves a graduate student, a postdoctoral researcher, undergraduates, and middle school students. Results of the work will be incorporated into university courses in petrology, geochemistry and numerical modeling.</AbstractNarration>

Specifically, we analyzed isotope ratios in 3 suites of erupted volcanice rocks from oceanic spreading centers that became very silicic in composition (and hence more explosive). We also analyzed  a suite of unusual rocks called plagiogranites from the the Troodos ophiolite in Cyprus. The goal was to  test the idea that a temperature gradient might play a role in how magmas change compositions.     We found systematic changes in isotope ratio with magma composition, which is an entirely new finding and is consistent with our hypothesis that temperature gradients play a role in magma changes.  This is potentially very important for Earth science as it may provide a mechanism for how the Earth can form silicic magmas (which end up forming continental crust) in a setting like an oceanic spreading center where only mafic magmas produced in the mantle enter the system.     The project contributed to broader impacts through training of a masters level geology student as well as a post doctoral researcher.  Undergraduate students also participated in the project. Finally, the PI as well as the masters student participated in elementary school science days, promoting ocean sciences in the k-12 classrooom.
