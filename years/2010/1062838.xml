<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Central Arkansas. Each year, ten undergraduate students will work on projects that integrate fundamental research in computer science with applications in health information technology (HIT), aimed at improving the overall quality, safety and efficiency of the health care delivery system. The interdisciplinary nature of this REU program offers opportunities to the participating students to perceive the importance of computer science and continue their education in this field. A series of training seminars will equip them with knowledge specific to the various research projects as well as general skills required in graduate school. The research environment offers them the opportunity to interact with computer scientists, medical physicists and industry personnel. Broader impacts result from the fact that this project provides opportunities for a diverse pool of undergraduate students, primarily from the south-central region, to gain research experience in both fundamental computer science and HIT areas, which would otherwise be unavailable to them. Overall, this REU site has the potential to produce new computer science graduate students and faculty members and to advance discovery and understanding while promoting learning at the K-12, undergraduate and graduate levels.</AbstractNarration>

Evaluations of the previous REU Site indicate that the site played a critical role in extending the objectives of the NSF REU program and meeting the unique needs of the demographics of the South Central region.   The REU Site has produced several notable outcomes, some of which we outline here:  -          The REU Site fosters, encourages, and assists the REU participants in disseminating and participating in a wide range of stages.

Several other publications are in the pipeline  -          Among the participants who have completed their BS degree, ~55% are currently pursuing graduate studies. Mr. Cody Hudson, participant of the REUÆ11 Site currently holds a research position at University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS). He is the first CS graduate from UCA to be hired by UAMS and it could not have been possible if not for this REU site   -          The PI was one of the moderators/panelists for the Undergraduate Research Experiences at CCSC Mid-South 2013 Conference and discussed lessons learned from the previous REU Site that describes how to provide successful research experiences for undergraduates.  -          REU participants have participated in several K-12 outreach activities by presenting their research and their perspectives of CS careers including CS4HS workshop (26 K-12 teachers), IT Academy (~50 high school students), MSIT (~16 high school students), Science Nights (~100 middle school students).  Some key demographics of our applicants and participants are below:  -       In total, 25 of the participants (83%) had limited research opportunities i.e, they were from non-PhD granting institutions.  -       There were a total of 135 applications, among which 78 applications (about 58%) were from the South Central region, consisting of six EPSCoR states.  -       About 17% of all the applicants indicated that they were not aware of any other NSF REU Site. Over 70% of applicants from the South Central region were not aware of any other NSF REU Site. About half of all the applicants did not apply to any other REU Site. By directing the applicants to the NSF REU website, we are expanding the awareness of the NSF REU program to a broad range of audiences.  -       Only 14% of applicants had a family member involved in research. Only 45 applicants (~33%) knew adults (other than faculty at their college/university) who are involved in research. This REU Site provided an invaluable research opportunity to students who otherwise might not have gained significant exposure to research and the research environment. Further, 8 participants (~22%) were the first person in their families to attend college.  -       Among the 30 participants, 20 students (~67%) were either females or belonged to a minority group. Specifically, ten were female, six were African Americans, four were Hispanic/Latino...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
