<AbstractNarration>The Center for Energy Efficient Systems will focus on optimizing energy utilization in electronic systems. SUNY at Binghamton, the University of Illinois, the University of Texas at Arlington and Georgia Tech are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with SUNY at Binghamton as the lead institution &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed center will focus on the development of systematic methodologies for operating electronic systems, including data centers, as dynamic self sensing and regulating systems that are predictive and verified in real time. Algorithms will be developed to control cooling resources and to assist expert system schedulers to schedule and/or migrate workload to achieve optimal energy consumption. Thermal management resources will also be allocated dynamically in response to system needs. Problem-oriented research related to Thermal Management and Protocols, Software Systems, Control Systems, and Implementation, will be addressed during the Center's first five year program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed center will enable a significant reduction in energy consumption in electronic systems, including data centers, thereby potentially reducing electrical power consumption across the nation. This will, in turn, reduce the nations consumption of carbon-based fuels and related emissions. The center will attract a diverse group of students at the undergraduate and graduate levels, by providing industrially-relevant training required by graduates entering the workforce. The center intends to leverage existing programming on its campuses to engage K-12 students in conversation on energy conservation, and is committed to attracting talented and motivated students from all groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The eventual goal of this project was to improve the efficiency of a growing segment of electricity consumption: the data center or server farm.  With the explosion of the Internet, and the increase in digital traffic, server farms are growing at a very rapid pace.  These warehouses of computational capacity are what are often termed "the cloud" in current popular language.  With the insatiable appetite for information transmission and manipulation, these farms and data centers comprise the fastest growing segment of electricity consumption in the world today.  Therefore, anything that can be done to slow that growth will have large societal impacts.  Our planning grant took a view over an extended period as to how to pull together industry and academia and form a cooperative center with the goal of minimizing energy consumption in data centers.  The planning phase involved several virtual meetings as well as one large face to face meeting to pull together a tight core team with a clear vision.  The team consisted of 5 universities with the input from several key industry partners.  We developed road maps for creating an energy management strategy spanning electrons to grid-scale power systems.  We collaborated with industry to leverage infrastructure development as well as hardware designs, computational models, and decision making supervisory algorithms.  The result of this planning workshop was a clear path forward to reduce the growth of energy consumption within data centers.  This was then targeted as a full proposal to NSF for the formation of the I/UCRC in Energy-Efficient Electronic Systems (E3S) led by The State University of New York at Binghamton.
