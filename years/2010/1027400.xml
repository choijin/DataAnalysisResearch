<AbstractNarration>This project establishes a Scholarship for Service (SFS) program at Pace University (Pace) over a four-year period. The program provides full scholarships for two years to undergraduate students interested in studying information assurance.  Scholarship recipients are required to enter the federal workforce upon graduation.  To increase diversity, the program is recruiting potential scholarship candidates from students currently enrolled at Pace as well as from Pace's academic partners, particularly those attending minority institutions.  This SFS program educates students to become information assurance professionals with interdisciplinary backgrounds as they are required to take courses in both information assurance and in a second discipline such as accounting or criminal justice. The graduates are therefore able to conduct tasks in areas such as computer security risk analysis, information technology auditing, cyber crime investigation and computer forensics. The program also supports educational activities to promote awareness among the general student body of the information assurance discipline and related careers in the federal government. These activities include paper competitions, research seminars, and industry outreach and collaboration.  The overall impact of this program is to extend information assurance education to students with broader backgrounds and to produce a corps of information assurance professionals for the federal workforce.</AbstractNarration>

The award (NSF 1027400) was extended for two years from its original end date to allow scholars supported by the program to complete their degrees. A renewal award (NSF 1503760) was granted in 2015 to continue the SFS program at Pace.</p> <p>The objectives of this project were to produce cybersecurity professionals to enter the government workforce upon graduation, to educate students in securing the critical national infrastructure through interdisciplinary education, and to provide scholarship opportunities to underrepresented student groups. Through this award, Pace recruited ten scholars into the SFS program. All ten scholars completed either a Bachelor&rsquo;s degree or a Master&rsquo;s degree in Information Technology, Information Systems or Computer Science, with a focus in cybersecurity.</p> <p>Pace&rsquo;s SFS program focused on interdisciplinary education enhanced by extra-curricular activities. Students majoring in different academic programs were able to focus on cybersecurity and to specialize in areas such as Information Technology (IT) regulatory compliance, IT auditing, and digital forensics investigations for the U.S. government. In addition, Pace&rsquo;s program required scholars to participate in various extra-curricular activities to enhance their knowledge and skills outside the classroom. Such activities may include being a part of the Pace Cyber Team, conducting a research project with faculty and fellow students, and attending cybersecurity conferences. These activities strengthened the students&rsquo; hands-on cybersecurity skills and developed their communication skills.</p> <p>In addition to SFS scholars, the project has had a broader impact on Pace university and the government. The academic programs and extra-curricular activities supported by the project created an academic infrastructure for cybersecurity education.

Of the ten graduates, two are women, one is Hispanic, and one is African-American.&nbsp; This diversity in our student body has enriched the SFS experience for all scholars. Furthermore, our outreach activities to high schools and community colleges have established a pipeline to attract talent to study cybersecurity.
