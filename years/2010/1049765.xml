<AbstractNarration>Botnets are typically used to stage denial of service (DDoS) attacks against commercial sites. DDoS attacks can disable critical infrastructure across the globe. Few effective countermeasures exist. A proposed set of experiments will quantify factors responsible for DDoS vulnerability and will verify solutions for neutralizing those attacks.  In addition, repressive nations use network monitoring to identify and prosecute their opponents. Timing vulnerabilities in anonymity systems put dissidents in repressive regimes in potential danger. Flaws in anonymity systems will be quantified and a new approach to safeguarding privacy will be confirmed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GENI network infrastructure enables security research that has not been possible before due to potential disruption to production networks. This project will carry out a number of security and privacy experiments that include:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;-WiMAX DDoS analysis with analysis of variance finding vulnerable control parameter settings;&lt;br/&gt;-Privacy/Anonymity side-channel Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) will be inferred to break anonymity systems;&lt;br/&gt;-DDoS traffic measurement to map attack severity vs. network topology;&lt;br/&gt;-Side-channel vulnerability removal protocol tested at scale; and &lt;br/&gt;-DDoS countermeasure testing to neutralize DDoS attacks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has the ability to change the landscape in regards to network security and privacy. Graduate students will have abundant opportunities to carry out experiments on a network infrastructure that allows them to fully explore these research challenges at scale.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Progress:    Completed  a MasterÆs thesis on æReverse Engineering: WiMAX and IEEE  802.16e". The thesis documents the process used during the GENI  WiMAX research, summarizing results and important information.     Investigated  the R6+ protocol running between the ASN-GW and BS by completing  traffic captures.    Analyzed  kernel log files for various settings of WiMAX debug parameter  levels. Found some receive traffic that may contain the system  parameters.     Investigated  four techniques for setting the system parameters of WiMAX  separately and independently from the BS.      Performed  more than 150 DDoS attacks on our experiment setup and collected  observations to test DDoS detection approaches using operational  background traffic and real DDoS attacks.    I  have completed testing a cusum and 2 wavelet based DDoS  detection approaches. I have also completed the analysis of the  collected test data and am working on the final revisions of the  paper presents our results.     I  have completed collecting data to test entropy based DDoS detection  approaches. We have completed the code for analyzing the  observations and performing spoofing attacks to convince entropy  based detection approaches.    Preliminary  study for DDoS mitigation approach has been completed. I have  started the implementation of the mitigation system.        Publications:    I.  Ozcelik and Yu Fu and R.
