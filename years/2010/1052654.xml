<AbstractNarration>The project objective is to elucidate how in the choroid plexus zinc, an essential mineral protects against modulation of choline transport by oxidative stress that is induced by the contaminant heavy metal, cadmium.  Neurons in the brain are responsive and vulnerable to changes in nutrient availability.  Choline is a vital nutrient, necessary for synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and cell membranes of neuronal cells; however, in high concentrations choline can inhibit neuron activity.  The choroid plexus, which forms the barrier between cerebrospinal fluid and blood, transports choline and thus regulates choline availability in the brain.  Stressors such hyperthermia or environmental contaminants may markedly alter choline transport by choroid plexus.  Radiotracer, biochemical, molecular biological, immunochemical and fluorescence microscopy techniques will be used to characterize cellular and molecular mechanisms by which zinc protects the choroid plexus against oxidative stress induced by cadmium and stress modulation of choline transport.  Heavy metals in the environment threaten animal and human populations.  Because at low doses, cadmium and other heavy metals accumulate in choroid plexus, this work will increase the understanding of how heavy metals modulate choline transport by choroid plexus and in turn alter choline availability in the brain.  This work also will elucidate how zinc status may influence the basic biology and physiology of the choroid plexus.  Roughly 20% of the U.S. and world populations are zinc deficient.  This work will elucidate how zinc status influences the susceptibility of choroid plexus to oxidative stress and stress induced modulation of choline transport and thus help to maintain choline availability in the brain.  Educational objectives include increasing retention of Hispanic, Afro-American, and first-generation university students in the biological sciences.  Undergraduate student research activities will encourage pursuit of graduate degrees in biology or related sciences and thus, increase diversity in science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The choroid plexus forms the barrier between blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that is continuous with the fluid surrounding the neurons of the brain.  This tissue also transports nutrients, drugs and metabolites into and out of CSF, thereby regulating chemically mediated responses of central neurons.  Physiological or pathological changes in transport function would be of significant consequence to brain function.  The choroid plexus also sequesters heavy metals, such as cadmium, thereby protecting the brain from these known neurotoxins.  These same metals can induce oxidative stress, leading to cellular injury and possible modulation of transport of nutrients and other bioactive compounds.  Although metals are accumulated in the choroid plexus of aquatic and terrestrial mammalian and non-mammalian vertebrates, how metals might affect its basic biology and modulate specific transport processes is not fully understood.  As the choroid plexus protects the brain by sequestering heavy metals, how does it protect itself?  In this project, primary cultures of rat choroid plexus cells were used to investigate effects of low-dose exposure to the heavy metal cadmium on the transport of choline, the precursor to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.  At a dose that was not cytotoxic, cadmium induced oxidative stress and subsequently stimulated choline transport out of the CSF compartment.  Potential implications for the intact animal would be a decrease in CSF and brain concentrations of choline, a nutrient critical to brain development and learning/memory processing.  However, there was marked induction of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70), hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) and metallothionein (MT), cytoprotective proteins that minimize cell injury.  In addition, synthesis of the predominant intracellular antioxidant glutathione (GSH) was up-regulated due to increased gene expression of the rate-limiting enzyme in GSH synthesis.  When that response was blocked, there was an even greater increase in choline transport and expression of cytoprotective proteins.  Thus, increases in GSH also served to minimize cell injury.  Could stress modulation in choline transport be prevented altogether?  Possibly.  When choroid plexus cells were supplemented with zinc, a nutrient mineral normally present in the intact choroid plexus, cadmium still induced oxidative stress but choline transport did not change.  Furthermore, cytoprotective proteins were still up-regulated, but to a lesser extent; this indicatesd zinc minimized molecular and cellular damage elicited by cadmium.  Importantly, zinc did not interfere with up-regulation of GSH synthesis; this would ensure adequate supply of the critical antioxidant.  Zinc cytoprotection was independent of GSH, but due in part to elevated baseline expression of MT prior to cadmium exposure.  Intellectual Merit.  These studies demonstrate a fundamental change in choroid plexus biology, i.e., altered redox potential, may modulate the capacity of this brain barrier to transport the nutrient choline and possibly other organic solutes into or out of CSF.  This work implies exposure of choroid plexus to low doses of cadmium, a contaminant metal in shellfish and tobacco, can induce oxidative stress and increase removal of choline from CSF.  However, these findings help construct a working model that explains how the choroid plexus can sequester heavy metals to protect the brain, but minimize the effects of these agents on its own biology.  Induction of cytoprotective proteins, Hsp70, HO-1 and MT, but also GSH synthesis minimize cellular injury and dysfunction due to oxidative stress induced by heavy metals.  Moreover, the model incorporates the efficacy of the nutrient mineral zinc, normally present in choroid plexus.  Zinc does not prevent onset of oxidative stress, but further minimizes subsequent development of cellular and molecular injury and may altogether minimize modulation of choline transport from the CSF compartment e...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
