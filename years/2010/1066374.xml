<AbstractNarration>A continuation of the measurement of the proton electric and magnetic form factor ratio, GEp/GMp, to at least 12 GeV squared  four-momentum transfer squared, will become possible after the JLab upgrade to twice the present electron beam energy. Likewise, measurements of the two form factors of the neutron, GEn and GMn to much larger four momentum squared will become possible. Three approved nucleon form factor experiments are the prime justification for the construction of a new setup in Hall A at JLab, the Super Bigbite Spectrometer (SBS), to be funded by DOE. The SBS will be a large acceptance device, which will be used in different configurations; for the GEp/GMp experiment it will consist of a large dipole, followed by a set of gas electron multiplier chambers (GEM) to define the track of the recoil proton. A new double polarimeter will be built, consisting of two polyethylene analyzer blocks, each followed by a set of GEMs. The new GEp/GMp experiment will also require the use of a reconfigured BigCal lead glass calorimeter (as was used recently in the GEp(III) experiment), to detect the electron; a double plane of GEM detectors, to be built and assembled in part at William and Mary, will be added to improve the BigCal position resolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigating the detailed structure of proton and neutron is one of several major goals towards unraveling the structure of matter; both particles are the most numerous in the visible universe. The proton has a size and a structure. It is not just a dimensionless point in space, but also it has evanescent components called sea-quarks, which are always created in pairs (quark-antiquark). Quarks interact with each other via the exchange of gluons, which are the carriers of the strong force. At JLab protons and neutrons are probed by the scattering of electrons. For a modest shock the electron is only aware of the overall size and shape of the proton. As the strength of the shock increases, the region of internal space probed becomes smaller. Ultimately, if one keeps increasing the strength of the shock, the electron starts to see the individual quarks, and that is the interest of this kind of investigation.  With a new postdoctoral fellow, we will be able to contribute to the many tasks required to build a new experimental setup which will play an important role in future investigations of the structure of the proton. Such a position offers a recent physics PhD holder the occasion to get in-depth, hands-on experience in all phases of research activity, and take responsibility: a prerequisite for entering a teaching and/or research position at a University, a National research Lab or industry.</AbstractNarration>

The structure of the nucleon is currently of great interest; the nucleons are the basic constituents of the atomic nuclei forming all of the visible matter in our universe.

The parameter characterizing the hardness of the collision is called, Q2. An important point is that as the energy transfer (or Q2) is increased, the wave length associated with the incoming electron decreases; to "see" the quarks in a proton this wave length has to be significantly smaller than the size of the proton, ~10-15 m. The continuous electron beam accelerator facility or CEBAF at Jefferson Lab in Virginia (JLab) is unique for providing highest quality beams of at energies large enough to "see" the quarks. Electrons and nucleons carry a "spin", in the same general sense that a childÆs top can be made to "spin" if thrown appropriately on a hard wood table. The spin of the top will eventually vanish because of friction; that of elementary particles is permanent. Producing a beam of electrons with the spin of all, or most electrons aligned in one direction generates a "polarized" beam of electrons.

The proton form factors obtained in the three JLab experiments, when compared with the form factors obtained from the scattering probability data, revealed very significantly different results. The correctness of the new results is not in doubt, having been submitted to several reproducibility test. This finding has deep consequences for our understanding of the structure of the proton, in particular the contribution from each type of quarks to the form factors, the contribution from bound pairs of identical quarks and more; the results can also be compared, and do supplement the proton structure information obtained from other, different types of reactions which are being investigated in other experiments wo...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
