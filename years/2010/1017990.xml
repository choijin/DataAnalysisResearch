<AbstractNarration>Due to the complexity and cost associated with managing data, many organizations are looking towards outsourcing their data management services. In recent years especially, Cloud Computing has gained significant interest. Although data outsourcing holds great promise, it raises a number of security and privacy concerns. In particular, since the clients have little or no direct control over the software and hardware that is running at the servers, there is a reluctance to blindly trust the server. A server may sacrifice the quality of service for a client either intentionally or inadvertently. In addition, there is a concern about the fidelity of the service. Databases have precise semantics of operation which must be preserved by the outsourced database. There is a critical need to develop authentication mechanisms that allow a database to be operated (for querying and updates) at an outsourcing site while providing guarantees to the data owner regarding transactional consistency of the database.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to make significant advances in the authentication of dynamic outsourced databases. The project will develop solutions that enable a data owner and authorized clients to ensure that the outsourced database represents exactly the state that corresponds to valid transactions that have been executed by the owner or clients. Comprehensive and efficient solutions that minimize the burden on the data owner, and the overhead on the outsourcing site for proving correct execution will be developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For further information, see the project website http://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/sunil/AuthenticDB</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Databases are often subjected to untrusted environments either due to hackers or insiders maliciously altering the data or results, or increasingly, when the database is hosted in an outsourced environment such as in the cloud. This project has developed a novel solution for ensuring the integrity and authenticity of dynamic data stored at an untrusted server. The solution enables a data owner to be assured that the data reflects correctly only the changes made by authorized users. Moreover, it enables the owner to determine exactly what changes have been applied, and  under whose authorization for any past update to the data.  This is achieved without requiring the owner to approve each update, specialized secure hardware, or modification to the server database code. We have demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed solution through prototype implementations on top of the popular Oracle and PostgreSQL database systems.  In addition to providing these provable guarantees for data owners, the solutions also provide proofs of innocence and indemnity for honest service providers, shielding them from untrue claims of misconduct; and provable, secure provenance of all updates to the data without requiring any trust of the database server.  Our solutions also provide mechanisms for hiding the data from the database server, and ensuring that the untrusted server faithfully follows access control restrictions for dynamic data -- without requiring trust of the database server itself.  A US patent has also been granted on the key outcomes of this project.  Collectively, the solutions developed under this award have the potential to increase trust for data, especially when it is outsourced and maintained on a cloud server. Thus, these solutions have the potential to increase the acceptability of clould computing among users that are concerend about the integrity and privacy of their sensitive data -- a problem that has limited the adoption of cloud computing for concerned adopters.
