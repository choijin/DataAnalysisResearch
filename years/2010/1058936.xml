<AbstractNarration>In this RUI project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Craig M. Anderson of Bard College will investigate the effect that ligand architecture has on the selectivity of carbon-hydrogen bond activation by platinum centers.  He will examine selective carbon-hydrogen activation as a function of the ligand as a strategy for increasing control of desired products and improving processes as C-H activation has practical significance in commercial applications such as catalysis.  Specifically, he plans to synthesize a variety of naphthyl and phenanthryl functionalized imine ligands in order to facilitate and/or drive the regioselectivity of C-H bonds mediated by platinum(II) centers.  The newly formed cyclometalated platinum complexes will be characterized and studied for their reactivity.  Ligands will be designed so that variables such as the ring size of the platinacycle formed, the bond hybridization of the C-H bond being activated, and aromaticity of the ring formed can be examined in detail.  The resultant cyclometalated products will be studied in order to examine the factors affecting reductive elimination to produce C-C coupling as well as for their reactivity with various substrates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important component of this work is that it will involve undergraduate student researchers at all levels.  This includes the multi-step synthesis of ligands and complexes, the characterization of intermediates and products by IR, UV/Vis, emission spectroscopy, NMR, and XRD (X-ray diffraction) where possible, and the use of computational techniques to determine the kinetically and thermodynamically favored products in order to correlate theory with experimental results.  The proposed research plans to establish a greater set of selectivity guidelines (especially in cases where several variables compete simultaneously), offer promise for the development of more selective catalytic processes, and contribute to the understanding of the intimate mechanisms of these processes.  The activation of carbon-hydrogen bonds by metal complexes is important in the functionalization of available feedstocks into more useful products and materials, and is germane in the area of synthesis, for example, in carbon-carbon bond coupling.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Many new complexes were synthesized and reactions studied in two general areas.  First, fundamental organometallics reactions that are active in many catalytic cycles, such as oxidative addition and reductive elimination were studied.  Catalytic cycles involve many reactions that occur in many industrial processes and are used to synthesize compound that are of use to society.  Good catalysts allow for milder or greener conditions to be employed in order to synthesize desired products.  Hence an understanding of the reactions and mechanisms that govern these systems is extremely important in order to improve them.  We have explored selective C-H activation and C-C coupling reactions, specifically those with platinum complexes.  C-H activation is of interest in order to functionalize otherwise inert bonds and C-C couplings are examples of carbon-carbon bond formation used in the synthesis of specialty chemicals.  Several manuscripts and presentations have been written and published documenting this work and disseminating it to the research community.  Second, we have been exploring the synthesis and reactivity of potential cancer therapeutics containing more than one active metal center.  The motivation is that each metal center will bring its unique reactivity to the proposed potential drug making a more active compound.  We have studied several complexesÃ† reactions with possible sites of interaction in the body including DNA, RNA, and proteins.  Again, manuscripts and presentations have been written that have disseminated this work to the scientific community.   Finally, many students have been trained in the field of scientific research and these students have acquired skills and many laboratory techniques.  This has allowed our students to work in industry and/or attend graduate schools to further their education and training.  This is important as it advances the goal keeping the next generation of scientists prepared and trained in the art of scientific research.
