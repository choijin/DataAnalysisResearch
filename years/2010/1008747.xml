<AbstractNarration>The investigators seek to explore the extent to which the quantity and quality of student participation in course discussion boards (a.k.a. online asynchronous discussions (OAD)) is associated with retention in or dropping out from undergraduate computer science and industrial engineering majors.   This study represents a planning and pilot study using data from discussion board enhanced STEM courses at the University of Southern California.   The ultimate goal of the investigators' intended future research will be to produce knowledge usable in making more effective use of this learning technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methods include computational analysis of the discussion text, a survey questionnaire, and information gathered from the registrar's office.  Machine learning/natural process learning techniques will be used to process the data. The investigators will use generalized linear modeling and Multivariate Analysis of Covariance techniques in their analysis. Additionally, the investigators seek to determine differences in participation by demographic characteristics and language/technical backgrounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discussion boards are now commonplace in undergraduate STEM learning environments, yet a solid base of research on their use and on user behaviors does not exist.  This research is intended to begin to fill that gap.  And, given many instructional reforms depend upon them, it is vital that we understand these factors better in order to improve instruction and learning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Outcomes Report for Award #1008747 (Pedagogical Evaluation) Overview  The goal of the Pedagogical Evaluation project (PedEval) was to explore the extent to which the quantity and quality of student participation in online discussion boards is associated with student learning and retention in undergraduate computer science and industrial systems engineering courses at the University of Southern California. PedEval was an 18-month exploratory study with the long-term research goal of identifying best practices and computational analyses to make more effective use of this learning technology. Intellectual Merit  The research endeavored to answer some of the following questions: "What role do discussion and online interaction play in student learning and retention?", "How can instructors and educational researchers measure learning by discussion?", "How do differences in rhetoric and affect influence communication?" and "What are æbest practicesÆ for promoting learning by discussion?".  Network infrastructure was developed to obtain data from Blackboard (USC), Moodle (local) and Piazza (commercial). Novel assessment measures were developed to study linguistic features and dialogue roles; computational methods were developed to model dialogue states and state transitions; and machine learning was applied to identify discussion context, sentiment and programming content. A survey to study affective variables including STEM efficacy, leadership and engagement was administered and a new survey was developed to study help-seeking behaviors and student motivation to participate in online discussions.  The work resulted in nine peer-reviewed conference papers, which were published at venues such as AAAI, ASEE, CSCL, ITS and K-CAP, and two prepared papers. Findings include:  Forum communication and engagement positively impacted student engineering efficacy and course achievement.  STEM leadership was positively related to online interaction with classmates. Discussion initiation strongly correlated with self-reported expected course grade and response frequency was positively correlated with higher grades. Students chose to participate in their class discussion forums based on personal motivators and de-motivators, satisfaction with responses, and preferences for help seeking.  Sharing a space socially was shown to have a larger positive influence on student forum participation than the helpfulness of the discussion while choosing alternative help seeking venues and sharing information among team members were shown to negatively impact participation. There was a positive correlation between project grades and a) the number of answers provided to others, b) the degree of positive emotion expressed and c) how early students exchanged information on project forums before the deadline. There was a positive correlation between a) thread length and where frustration was located in the thread and b) question and answer length while there was no correlation between a) the degree of frustration and peer response times or b) either time to deadline or question length and the first response times, frustration or not. Significant disparities were found between the assumptions of researchers and the needs of the instructor when visually communicating assessments of online participation. For automatically capturing programming content, Conditional Random Fields generated the best results (86.90% F1-Score) with an improvement of over 5% in the F1-Score of Na&iuml;ve Bayes, and a high precision of 93.95%. Overall reciprocity rate (turn-taking) was not statistically correlated to the grade, however, high performing students had larger reciprocity rates and helped their peers more actively.   Computational methods developed for this project worked well when applied to new domains, namely a) classifying video lecture contents, where performance was comparable to directly using manual transcripts and b) correlating Next Generation Science Standards' Science...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
