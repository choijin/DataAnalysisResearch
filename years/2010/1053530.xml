<AbstractNarration>Passage of the EarthScope Transportable Array across the Mississippi Embayment is providing an opportunity to investigate lithospheric structure associated with active deformation and an ancient, intracratonic rift.  The Mississippi Embayment is a first-order geological structure of the North American continent with a long and complex geological history affected by at least two periods of continental breakup.  The reason for geologically recent basin subsidence is enigmatic since subsidence began about 100 million years ago and is not linked to a major tectonic episode.  In addition, the active New Madrid seismic zone (NMSZ) is located in the upper crust within the northern Mississippi Embayment.  Lithospheric seismic velocity heterogeneity and anisotropy are likely indicators of the dynamic processes associated with basin subsidence and earthquake genesis in the region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The seismic experiment incorporates stations of EarthScope's Transportable Array and a higher density FlexArray deployment to provide an overall framework of lithospheric velocity and anisotropy structure to depths exceeding the upper mantle transition zone.  Detailed variations in deep structure perpendicular and parallel to the embayment axis are imaged using three dense lines of FlexArray stations that extend within and outside of the Mississippi Embayment.  Major issues that are addressed include 1) the primary differences in lithospheric structure between the embayment and the surrounding region, 2) the nature of early Cambrian rifting and relationship to pre-existing structure, 3) the dynamic processes responsible for basin subsidence, and 4) the relationship of the NMSZ to large scale lithospheric structure. This is accomplished through joint interpretation of seismic velocity tomography, potential fields, transfer/receiver functions, and depth-dependent anisotropy images generated using traditional and new geophysical techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the past 10 years there has been considerable controversy on whether the New Madrid Seismic Zone (NMSZ) is truly an active seismic zone or whether its history of large magnitude (M&gt;7) earthquakes is over.  One group of scientists has insisted that the seismic zone is dead and will not have another large earthquake.  Their evidence is based on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data that show very little strain accumulation over the short amount of time that GNSS stations have been installed in the region.  Even so, others have used the same data to show a signal that is caused by continuing slip on faults at depth.  That the New Madrid seismic zone has been the locus of large earthquakes over the past 5000 years is not controversial due to the geological evidence from dating numerous liquefaction features (sand blows) in the earthquake zone.   The NMSZ exists far from the edges of the North American plate.  Large earthquakes occur at the edges of the plate, such as in California and Washington/Oregon because plate edges rub against other plate edges that fail in large earthquakes.  Part of the argument for modern seismic quiescence in the NMSZ is that there were no other geophysical features in this region that could indicate driving mechanisms for causing the earthquakes like those seen at the edge of the plate.  The Northern Embayment Lithosphere Experiment (NELE) allowed us to collect data at stations within and surrounding the NMSZ from large earthquakes occurring all over the globe.  These data were used to produce an image of the upper 250 km of the earth similar to a medical "cat scan" uncovering a highly anomalous region of hot material that rises under the seismic zone.  The scientific implication is that there is now an identifiable reason why the NMSZ is located where it is.  This hot material is weaker than the surrounding parts of Earth?s mantle that causes stress to concentrate in the crust of the seismic zone resulting in large earthquakes.  This exciting result is the focus of ongoing work.  Data collected by NELE are a valuable legacy that will be used by scientists in many future research programs.  The data will be freely available at the Incorporated Research Institutions in Seismology Data Management Center in August 2017.  Results from this project have been published and are in the process of being published in the scientific literature, have been presented at many annual meetings of professional societies and have formed the basis of two PhD theses at the University of Memphis and one MS thesis at Southern Methodist University.  The field work portion of the project was a success of graduate education and work force development in that over 23 graduate student volunteers at the University of Memphis sited, installed, and gathered data from over 80 seismometer sites occupied in 8 states surrounding the NMSZ.  The clearest impact on society is the implication for earthquake hazards surrounding the New Madrid Seismic Zone.  Results from NELE now can be used to understand the origin and cause of large earthquakes within the NMSZ.  This is a major step in understanding the hazard and will ultimately benefit the reduction of risk for society.
