<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coastal zone hypoxia (oxygen depletion) has both natural and, increasingly, anthropogenic dimensions that can lead to host of changes to the biogeochemical processes taking place on continental shelves. Continental shelf regions are well known to be important transition zones between terrestrial sources and the deep ocean. The objectives of this collaborative study are to determine the efflux rates of iron from coastal zone and continental shelf sediments to overlying water columns during the development of seasonal anoxia cycles. The underlying hypothesis being tested at selected study sites in the Gulf of Mexico, and on previously sampled materials from Peru and Namibia continental margins, is that the redox gradients occurring in these shelf sediments will deliver both increasing flux rates and with characteristically isotopically lighter Fe signatures as anoxia develops. If the extent of anoxia transitions to a sulfidic sediment regime, the benthic iron flux may decrease in a negative feedback loop due to solubility constraints, but with even lighter isotopic Fe escaping to the water column.  A better understanding of the diagenetically delivered flux of iron, an essential micronutrient for phytoplankton growth, from sediments is sought to account for the global balance of ocean productivity under changing oceanic conditions. The ability of Fe-isotopic systematics to trace coastal benthic iron sources is a potentially transformative outcome of this research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will also strengthen the international collaboration between US, and German researchers, and provide an opportunity to develop these ideas with methodologies  such as benthic chambers for bottom water sampling, as well as sediment pore fluids and core incubations, and water column isotopic studies.  A range of educational and outreach activities will also be carried out.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Like a dark cloud that hovers near a mountain crest, the zone of low oxygen-containing water (hypoxic water) is also an ominous sight. Like the mountain cloud, it is not clear if the area of hypoxic water is expanding, getting darker or moving; whether the cloud  actually touches the mountainside or only appears to.  Our work in the Gulf of Mexico is linked to this analogy as the size, location and movement of hypoxic waters has great impact on life in the Gulf.  All animals need oxygen to breath, hypoxic water contains so little oxygen that many animals are forced to flee or perish.  The size, location and expansion/contraction of this water is poorly understood.  Our work has succeeded in making measurements in the sediment (mud) around the Mississippi Delta to determine how the ædark cloudÆ is connected to and how it impacts ælifeÆ in the mud.  Our findings demonstrate the importance of chemical reactions occurring in the mud as feedbacks to hypoxia growth, but also as evidence that, in some cases, the æcloudÆ does not adversely impact the mud.   The cruise on which we conducted measurements and collected samples took place in the summer of 2011.  Primarily, we were deploying benthic chambers on the sea floor to establish chemical fluxes across the sediment-water interface.  We made these measurements 10 times at 9 different sites, one fairly close to the BP/Deep Horizon oil rig incident. Oxygen flux is a measure of how much respiration (bacterial and macrofaunal) is occurring in sediments, rates ranged from 4-12 mmolOxygen/m2day. This value helps constrain how much of the hypoxic water loses oxygen when it comes in contact with the mud (as when the cloud touches the mountain).  These rates are not extraordinary, in fact, they are somewhat low compared to shelf sediments off Oregon, N. California and S. California.  The sediments also contribute N as ammonium (0.8-5 mmolN/m2d) and phosphate (0.1-1 mmolP/m2d) to the overlying water.  These nutrients æleakingÆ out of the mud help drive algal productivity which contributes to water column hypoxia. Hence, these sediments act as positive feedback reinforcement of hypoxic conditons.       Last Modified: 03/27/2015       Submitted by: William M Berelson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
