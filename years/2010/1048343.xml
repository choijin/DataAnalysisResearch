<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes a high-resolution paleoenvironmental study of pollen, spore, fresh-water algae, and dinoflagellate cyst assemblages to investigate the palynological record of sudden warming events in the Antarctic as recorded by the ANDRILL SMS drill core and terrestrial sections. These data will be used to derive causal mechanisms for these rapid climate events. Terrestrial samples will be obtained at various altitudes in the Dry Valleys region. The pollen and spores will provide data on atmospheric conditions, while the algae will provide data on sea-surface conditions. These data will help identify the triggers for sudden climatic shifts. If they are caused by changes in oceanic currents, a signal will be visible in the dinocyst assemblages first as currents influence their distribution. Conversely, if these shifts are triggered by atmospheric factors, then the shifts will first affect plants and be visible in the pollen record.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes a suite of activities to bring field-based climate change research to a broader audience. The PI will advise a diverse group of students and educators. The palynological data collected as part of this research will be utilized, in part, to develop new lectures on Antarctic palynology and these new lectures will be made available via a collaboration with the LSU HHMI program. In addition, the PI will direct three Louisiana middle-school teachers as they pursue a Masters of Natural Science for science educators. These teachers will help the PI develop a professional development program for science teachers. Community-based activities will be organized to raise science awareness and alert students and the public of opportunities in science.</AbstractNarration>

The most direct way to  reconstruct the evolution of the Antarctic vegetation through time is to  analyze Antarctic sediments for their palynological content (the spores  and pollen preserved in the sediment). Experts in Antarctic palynology  have been analyzing various Antarctic palynological records for the past  three decades. Recent international drilling initiatives in coastal  regions of the Antarctic (e.g., SHALDRIL<sup>2</sup>, IODP<sup>3</sup> ANDRILL<sup>4</sup>, WISSARD<sup>5</sup>)  and smaller-scale Antarctic field expeditions in the Dry Valleys or in  the Antarctic Peninsula have given us access to previously un-sampled  Antarctic sediments. These sampling initiatives have allowed the  palynological community to make some major advances in the understanding  of the evolution of Antarctic vegetation.&nbsp; Thanks to a NSF CAREER award<sup>6</sup>,  our group was selected to study about 700 of these recently-acquired  sediment samples, covering 9 regions of Antarctica, and geological time  frames ranging from the Paleocene to today. The palynological findings  from these diverse records were published as the cover stories of two  high-profile journals; Nature<sup>7</sup> and PNAS<sup>8</sup>, and in thirteen other journals<sup>9-21</sup>.  The pollen and spore microfossils recovered from these various sites  provide the best archive of the type of vegetative cover that once was  present on land. We are now starting to have a very good understanding  of the timing of the evolution of the vegetation that span from warm  tropical forests to a low-diversity <em>Nothofagus </em>(southern  beech)-dominated vegetation with some podocarp conifers similar to  Valdivian-type forest found today in Chile and Argentina; followed by a  tundra-type environment with dominant herbaceous plants and mosses,  leading to the disappearance of vegetation as the ice sheet advanced and  fully covered the Antarctic continent.</p> <p>In addition to acquiring lists of plant species that populated  Antarctica over geological times and thus better understanding the  climate evolution on land, these studies also gave us important  indication about the timing of the extinction of the tundra in  Antarctica. Indeed, the absence of spores and pollen from all younger  sediment analyzed allow us to date the last evidence of vegetative  cover.&nbsp; This date is estimated at 12.8 Ma for the Antarctic Peninsula<sup>8</sup>, and 13.85 Ma in the Dry Valleys<sup>22</sup>.&nbsp;  In both cases, the last phase of vegetation that characterized the area  prior to the disappearance of fossil trace of vegetation is composed of  bryophytes.&nbsp; It would thus be expected that the first phase of  re-colonization of vegetation by Antarctic plants would be done by  bryophytes as well, and this is indeed what is occurring today in the  Antarctic Peninsula<sup>1</sup>.&nbsp; The modern greening of Antarctica is  also occurring in the Peninsula region, which is the region of the  Antarctic that we believe was the last region to be covered by  vegetation in the Middle Miocene.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The current greening of Antarctica: should we be alarmed? The answer from a geological perspective.  In the June 2017 issue of Current Biology1, Amesbury et  al. reported on the widespread biological response (e.g., a rapid  increased spreading of moss cover) on the Antarctic Peninsula as a  result of ongoing rapid warming.  This sudden greening of the Antarctic coast is a concerning fact in  itself, but to grasp the full magnitude of this news, you have to look  into the vegetation history of the Antarctic. The most direct way to  reconstruct the evolution of the Antarctic vegetation through time is to  analyze Antarctic sediments for their palynological content (the spores  and pollen preserved in the sediment). Experts in Antarctic palynology  have been analyzing various Antarctic palynological records for the past  three decades. Recent international drilling initiatives in coastal  regions of the Antarctic (e.g., SHALDRIL2, IODP3 ANDRILL4, WISSARD5)  and smaller-scale Antarctic field expeditions in the Dry Valleys or in  the Antarctic Peninsula have given us access to previously un-sampled  Antarctic sediments. These sampling initiatives have allowed the  palynological community to make some major advances in the understanding  of the evolution of Antarctic vegetation.  Thanks to a NSF CAREER award6,  our group was selected to study about 700 of these recently-acquired  sediment samples, covering 9 regions of Antarctica, and geological time  frames ranging from the Paleocene to today. The palynological findings  from these diverse records were published as the cover stories of two  high-profile journals; Nature7 and PNAS8, and in thirteen other journals9-21.  The pollen and spore microfossils recovered from these various sites  provide the best archive of the type of vegetative cover that once was  present on land. We are now starting to have a very good understanding  of the timing of the evolution of the vegetation that span from warm  tropical forests to a low-diversity Nothofagus (southern  beech)-dominated vegetation with some podocarp conifers similar to  Valdivian-type forest found today in Chile and Argentina; followed by a  tundra-type environment with dominant herbaceous plants and mosses,  leading to the disappearance of vegetation as the ice sheet advanced and  fully covered the Antarctic continent.  In addition to acquiring lists of plant species that populated  Antarctica over geological times and thus better understanding the  climate evolution on land, these studies also gave us important  indication about the timing of the extinction of the tundra in  Antarctica. Indeed, the absence of spores and pollen from all younger  sediment analyzed allow us to date the last evidence of vegetative  cover.  This date is estimated at 12.8 Ma for the Antarctic Peninsula8, and 13.85 Ma in the Dry Valleys22.   In both cases, the last phase of vegetation that characterized the area  prior to the disappearance of fossil trace of vegetation is composed of  bryophytes.  It would thus be expected that the first phase of  re-colonization of vegetation by Antarctic plants would be done by  bryophytes as well, and this is indeed what is occurring today in the  Antarctic Peninsula1.  The modern greening of Antarctica is  also occurring in the Peninsula region, which is the region of the  Antarctic that we believe was the last region to be covered by  vegetation in the Middle Miocene. This region is located at the lowest  latitude and thus benefit from the ?warmest? Antarctic climate.  The timing of the disappearance of the Antarctic vegetation coincides with a time in the Miocene when atmospheric CO2 concentration likely dropped below 500 ppm7,23.  In the Oligocene and most of the Miocene, atmospheric CO2 concentrations most likely fluctuated between 400 and 700 ppm.  Under  these conditions, some areas of Antarctic were not covered by ice sheets  and some limited beech and podocarp forests still existed, and were  slowly replaced by tundra and moss covered plain as the CO2 concentration dropped and climate cooled.  What does this mean for our future? From the various palynological  studies done in Antarctica, we can establish that a ~500 ppm  concentration in atmospheric CO2 is a very important  threshold for ice-sheet retreat, and for vegetation to be allowed to  recolonize larger area of the Antarctic coastal regions. This past year,  CO2 rose to 408.02 ppm24, and it has been rising at a rate of ~2 ppm per year for the past 10 years, from values measured at about 320 ppm24 in 1960.  If this rate continues, we will be back at levels at which we  were during the Mid Miocene, at a time where palynological evidence  indicate the presence of important vegetative cover in Antarctica, in  other words, a time when ice sheet had melted sufficiently to allow  vegetation to recolonize various regions and sea-level was much higher  as a consequence. So, should the current greening of Antarctic alarm us, and considering the fact that this current greening is unprecedented since 12.8 million years, I would say absolutely.
