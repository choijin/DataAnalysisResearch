<AbstractNarration>The objective of this faculty early career development (CAREER) award is to conduct research on the estimation and control of distributed parameter processes employing mobile radiant actuators. The project targets energy-efficient radiative drying and curing processes for large scale manufacturing lines. The approach is to i) identify reduced models that resolve the processes into the main energy transmission and state evolution phases in search of a unified analytical framework, ii) seek effective state estimation schemes that overcome the challenges associated with the lack of suitable non-contact sensing for key process states, iii) develop closed-loop control strategies that coordinate the flux levels and the trajectory of the radiant actuators while optimizing energy use and productivity without sacrificing product quality, and, iv) conduct experimental verifications using a prototype radiative drying/curing system along with analysis of processed and in-process samples via FTIR, AFM and other tomography techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will potentially play a transformative role in reducing total energy use and CO2 emissions from manufacturing lines. Addressing the fundamental problem of controlling moving radiant sources will also impact other processes (e.g. robotic welding and spray forming) and applications in pollution mitigation and medical radiotherapy. Furthermore, despite the numerous applications, the control of distributed parameter systems is rarely covered in the controls education curriculum at many institutions. This project will help advance education in the topic through a new course on distributed parameter control and interactive laboratory demonstrations. Planned education and outreach efforts themed around ?control for energy efficiency? include: interfacing with undergraduate research opportunity sites and Clemson?s Creative Inquiry program to involve undergraduates, including minorities and women, in the research; holding and taking part in summer science teacher workshops and ?success camps?; and, disseminating research results. The project will also leverage existing collaborations for technology transfer of promising findings to the automotive and aerospace industries.</AbstractNarration>
