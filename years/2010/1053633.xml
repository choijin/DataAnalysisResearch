<AbstractNarration>CBET- 0845917&lt;br/&gt;Y. Zhu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vehicular emitted ultrafine particles (UFP) of diameter &lt; 0.1 ìm have unique semi-volatile properties and fractal-like morphology that make existing aerosol dynamic models derived from non-volatile spherical particles of limited use in assessing their environmental and public health impacts. This CAREER proposal is to fill the knowledge gap by investigating transport and transformation of UFPs from vehicle tailpipes to incabin microenvironments in terms of mechanistic laboratory experiments, analytical and computational fluid dynamic (CFD) modeling, and field studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major research tasks are: (1) experimentally characterize fundamental mechanisms affecting UFP dynamics. The PI will generate near-monodisperse UFPs with volatility and morphology similar to vehicular emitted UFPs and apply these realistic test particles instead of traditional nonvolatile spherical particles to study fundamental mechanisms governing UFP transport and transformation from vehicle tailpipes to in-cabin; (2) develop novel in-cabin UFP models to predict UFP behavior traveling from vehicle tailpipes to in-cabin, integrating laboratory results simulating realistic driving conditions; and (3) field-calibrate and validate the models through measurements in onroad vehicles and school buses from local public schools.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal will use school buses for many field studies, with students directly assisting in the measurements. The investigator will also assist in developing 10th grade lectures on environmental quality. The international field studies will promote international contacts in Mexico, China, Finland, and Iran. Also, the investigator is to make a strong effort to involve underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For this CAREER award, the PI's group has been focused on studying the fundamental mechanisms that govern ultrafine particlesÆ fate from vehicle tailpipe into vehicle cabin where human exposure occurs. Intellectual merit: We have published the first successful in-cabin ultrafine particle dynamic model in the literature and a series of mechanism studies revealing important parameters affecting ultrafine particle transport and transformation between point of emissions and point of exposures. We found ultrafine particle deposition rates inside vehicles are about 3 to 20 times greater than those reported in previous indoor studies. This is probably due to the larger surface area to volume ratio and higher in-cabin air velocities inside vehicles. Modern vehicles are commonly equipped with cabin air filters that can reduce in-cabin ultrafine particle concentrations, but a large range of filtration efficiency was observed for different commercial cabin air filters.  The overall passenger protection against ultrafine particles is limited to 40-60% under outdoor air mode.  We also found ultrafine particles from traffic emissions have unique morphology and carrying a higher percentage of charges than background aerosols. Guided by this new knowledge, we have identified effective mitigation measures that can be incorporated to lower commuterÆs exposure to ultrafine particles by more than 90%.  Broader Impacts: These research efforts were integrated with the PIÆs education activities that focus on training both undergraduate and graduate women and underrepresented students in the field of environmental science and engineering as well as involving PK-12 teachers and students in research activities. The PI has graduated one female doctoral student and mentored three minority female undergraduate students.  By using school buses as living classrooms for field work, we have successfully introduced the concept and science of air pollution, vehicular emissions, particle dynamics, and exposure assessment to more than 200 PK-12 students.  Based on these efforts, we have published another series of papers focusing on childrenÆs exposure to ultrafine particles in and around school buses.
