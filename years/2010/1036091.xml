<AbstractNarration>The project at Lincoln University in Missouri entitled: A Model for Achieving Success in STEM (AMASS): Positive Feedback Interactions between Minority and Nontraditional Students and STEM Faculty, links faculty development efforts with activities that increase retention and integrated training for nontraditional, minority and underrepresented students who are not currently targeted in undergraduate STEM disciplines.  The unique needs of this student population are linked with the challenges they represent for STEM faculty.  Lincoln University believes that its approach is unique, that outcomes are sustainable, and that the model will be transportable. &lt;br/&gt;AMASS has four goals:  1) recruitment of nontraditional students with STEM interest and potential for success who may not fit the profile of high achieving academic ability as demonstrated by standard quantitative measures; 2) STEM faculty, faced with increasing challenges of a heterogeneous student population in gatekeeper courses, will use a lesson-study model to identify and bridge conceptual gaps that hinder comprehension and understanding of core science and math principles;  3) peer mentoring programs that strengthen STEM competencies of mentors and mentees, including secondary science education majors, will be established; and 4) cross-curricular programs in math, chemistry, physics and biology will emphasize quantitative reasoning, critical thinking skills and communication skills in introductory courses. &lt;br/&gt;Experiences that include independent research, professional service and internships to build professional expertise and establish support networks form the core of the junior and senior years. Participation in the AMASS program will prepare students to integrate their STEM education experience and utilize those integrative skills in the STEM workforce. Experiential learning in STEM disciplines will increase the critical thinking skills and quantitative reasoning ability of project participants whether they are graduates, STEM educators or professionals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The AMASS project at Lincoln University created opportunities for underrepresented individuals to have a positive experience entering higher education and promoted their success.  During the grant period the number of STEM majors as a proportion of total enrollment and the proportion of STEM majors who are ethnic minorities has grown.  This program supported scholars as teachers, provided scholars with faculty mentors, increased career preparation activities and provided research opportunities.  Faculty believe AMASS will have a lasting impact because it has made students' STEM activities more visible to the broader campus, resulted in students entering the STEM workforce who serve as ambassadors to Lincoln, and spawned additional projects that build on concepts and practices developed through AMASS.  This program successfully provided opportunities for nontraditional STEM students that supported their academic and professional success.  Lasting impacts include stronger mentoring networks combined with targeted academic and career development programs.  Both faculty and students benefited from this cultural shift resulting from focused and purposeful engagement in improving academic success and supporting students in STEM careers.  The culture of collaboration and professional development surrounding the AMASS project has led to improved faculty capacity to pursue other grants to support nontraditional STEM students.  The challenges of recruiting and retaining nontraditional students in STEM are persistent, but Lincoln faculty are better positioned to address these issues because of the AMASS project.
