<AbstractNarration>The Palmetto Number Theory Series (PANTS) is a series of three number theory meetings per year managed jointly by Clemson University and the University of South Carolina, the flagship research institutions in South Carolina, the Palmetto state.  Meetings are planned for December 2010 at the University of South Carolina, February 2011 at the Clemson University, and September 2010 at a third Southeastern school.  In recent years, there have been important development in number theory and conference will help to disseminate new developments and new results, as well as to train graduate students and junior researchers in the region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An important goal of these meetings is to provide the number theory community in the Southeast region to keep up to date recent research results and development in number theory.  The primary research topics are in analytic number theory, arithmetic geometry, and automorphic and modular forms.  PANTS meetings bring prominent researchers in number theory to the southeastern region to keep graduate students and junior faculty into research areas of emerging interests. The frequency and regularity of the meetings promotes collaboration and strengthens working relationships between participants.  Another objective of PANTS meetings is to involve number theorists at all career stages and types of institutions at minimal cost. PANTS speakers include graduate students, junior faculty, and senior faculty. PANTS participants come not only from South Carolina, but from schools in neighboring states. They come from Ph.D. granting institutions, institutions whose highest degree awarded is a master's degree, and from institutions granting only baccalaureate degrees. The organizers will also continue to try to attract a demographically diverse participant base, including women and other underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Palmetto Number Theory Series (PANTS) is a series of three number theory meetings per year managed jointly by Clemson University and the University of South Carolina, the flagship research institutions in South Carolina, the Palmetto state.  Together with funds from NSA, this NSF grant funded the following meetings:  PANTS XIII, September 25 and 26, 2010 at University of North Carolina at  Greensboro,  PANTS XIV, December 4 and 5, 2010 at University of South Carolina,  PANTS XV, February 19 and 20, 2011 at Clemson University.  This grant also partially funded PANTS XVI, September 10 and 11, 2011 at Emory University.     The mathematical content of these meetings covers all areas of number theory, reflecting the broad interests of its regular participants.  Each meeting featured 10 - 15 20-minute contributed talks, primarily from Southeastern participants.  PANTS XIV featured four plenary speakers, while the other meetings had two each.  All meetings had a 45-minute invited graduate student speaker, and all plenary and invited talks were given by mathematicians from outside the Southeast.  The meetings successfully met their primary goal: to provide the number theory community in the Southeast an opportunity to hear about recent research in number theory, pure and applied.  PANTS also met its objective of involving number theorists in research at all career stages and types of institutions at minimal cost.  The meetings were particularly beneficial and inspirational to graduate students, who comprised roughly half of the total number of participants.
