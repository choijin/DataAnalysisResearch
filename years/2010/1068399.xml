<AbstractNarration>This project pursues five major objectives: 1) Increasing the number of STEM students graduating with associate degrees; 2) Increasing the number of STEM students transferring to baccalaureate institutions; 3) Increasing the diversity of STEM majors, graduates and transfers; 4) Increasing the number of STEM majors progressing successfully through gatekeeper STEM sequences; and 5) Decreasing the average time to associates degrees. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the faculty members in every STEM department revise their curricula to increase active learning and engagement of students.  They also participate in RISE student support services.  Existing student services are being enhanced to create a core of services specifically in support of STEM majors.  A second tier of more expansive services called "STEP It Up!" is being phased in and tested to determine the impacts on student success.  The RISE project is also evaluating its program through a rigorous research design. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project collaborates externally with local high schools and their parent advisory committee to improve academic preparation for STEM students, to recruit women and underrepresented minority students and to increase STEM career awareness. Internally the project works with the existing on-campus Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA) program to recruit and retain underrepresented students in STEM.  Dissemination of the experimentally validated successes and lessons learned provides broader impact to the education community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The past decade has seen simultaneous increases in postsecondary tuition, diversity in the U.S. population and demand for a STEM-educated workforce.  Community colleges (CCs) are an underutilized source of first generation and underrepresented students in STEM fields.  Approximately 50% of students who enter STEM fields start at a community college (CC).  However, only a fraction of the federal funding is awarded to CC STEM projects and few studies of STEM undergraduates include CC students. More research is needed on CC STEM students. There is strong evidence that too few STEM-interested students persist to degree attainment and too often under-represented and under-resourced CC students fail to persist in a STEM degree pathway.

RiSE events increase STEM student identity, RiSE visibility, administrative buy-in and faculty validation and include STEM student awards, STEM "Kickoffs" for each quarter, a Haunted STEM lab &amp; STEM "magic" show.   We posed two overarching questions of our seven-year RiSE project: (1) What impact has RiSE had on STEM student persistence, success (GPA) and sense of community?

Furthermore, RiSE has prompted faculty from across STEM disciplines to change teaching approaches to include more research-based methods and become more engaged in the STEM community.
