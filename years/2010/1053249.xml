<AbstractNarration>This Doctoral Dissertation Enhancement Project award will provide support for a University of Denver PhD graduate student in computer engineering to spend several months working at ETH in Zurich, Switzerland.   While at Denver, the student has developed a novel polymer electronic device.  The collaboration with ETH will allow the student to develop novel, low-cost processing techniques for these devices based on micro- and inkjet fabrication methods.  This project leverages the research projects currently underway in the NSF supported I/UCRC Safety, Security and Rescue Research Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has significant broader impacts.  The PhD student will have the opportunity to work in a leading European laboratory equipped with state-of-the-art equipment.  The collaboration with international scientists and students will expose the student to new ways of conducting science and lead to an international network of future potential collaborators.  The project linkage to a I/URCRC will also benefit the members of the center consortium.</AbstractNarration>
