<AbstractNarration>Proposal #: 10-40254&lt;br/&gt;PI(s):  Chen, Hui&lt;br/&gt;  Damevski, Kostadin; Mullins, Christopher; Rafie, Ahmad R.; Wang, Ju&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Virginia State University&lt;br/&gt;Title:   MRI/Acq.: Acq. of  Sensing and Computing Equipment for Smart High-Tunnel Greenhouses&lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;This project from an MSI, principally undergraduate university, acquiring actuating devices, server computers, visualization workstations, etc., to form a Cyber-Physical System (CPS) that converts high-tunnel greenhouses into a ?smart? greenhouse system, aims to detect variations in the environmental conditions (e.g., moisture and temperature) and enable fine-grained control. Enabling the investigation of determining how recent advances in sensing, networking, and computing research can benefit agriculture practice (specifically, high-tunnel greenhouses), the work provides a window to expose practical problems that arise from setting up and operating the smart greenhouse system. Aiming to produce affordable and reliable CPS that can support automation in high-tunnel greenhouses the project looks into:&lt;br/&gt;- Water management in high-tunnel greenhouses,&lt;br/&gt;- Random scheduling for sensor networks,&lt;br/&gt;- Localization of sensor nodes that leverages radio tomographic images,&lt;br/&gt;- Fault-tolerant agriculture CPS, and&lt;br/&gt;- High programmer productivity environments for heterogeneous CPS.&lt;br/&gt;The project might lead to broader acceptance and use of the systems.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The research instrument should foster collaboration among computer science and agricultural faculty, providing a field laboratory where students can conduct meaningful research-oriented experiments and thus increase the involvement of minority and women students in science, engineering, computer science, and mathematics. The research should contribute to affordable and robust systems and application in precision agriculture, and lead to sustainable agricultural practices and higher crop yields, indeed, a strong benefit for society at large. Moreover, undergraduate and graduate research and instruction and training should see improvement with the incorporation of more sophisticated real-world motivating examples and experiments.</AbstractNarration>
