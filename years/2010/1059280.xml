<AbstractNarration>A workshop titled "Pervasive Computing and Smart Environments with Applications" is being proposed, to be held in the Fall of 2010. The goals of the workshop are to foster the continued emergence of smart environment design; to define challenging and beneficial applications of pervasive computing and smart environment; and to identify key research areas in pervasive computing and smart environment design that will support and challenge this growing field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will consist of four long and approximately thirty short invited talks, three panel / discussion sessions, and two breakout sessions.  Invited talks will provide perspectives on the field from funding agencies, from industry, and from leading academic research labs. Attendees will use the breakout sessions to discuss issues and brainstorm ideas related to embedded devices, new networking and middleware paradigms, interfaces and modes of interactions, and application of technology to smart grids, social networking, health care, and beyond. An outcome of the workshop will be a set of steps to recommend that NSF take to nurture the maturing and transformation of this field. Following the meeting a report will be prepared that summarizes the workshop and details the recommendations. This report will be provided to NSF and posted on the NSF web site.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The field of pervasive computing and smart environments is at an interesting and critical point in its development.  On the one hand, the field has matured to the point where tangible, beneficial prototype testbeds such as smart homes, body area networks, health monitoring systems, and social networking media are becoming fairly commonplace.  These visible successes are built on mature underlying technology that performs device communication, information routing, sensor fusion, activity recognition, and user preference learning.  On the other hand, however, these systems have been designed and tested on small to medium-scale applications with limited dissemination of the tools, results, and datasets.  The goal of this NSF sponsored workshop was to discuss the challenges for scaling our future pervasive applications, algorithms, models, data and systems. The problem of scaling pervasive systems is multi-disciplinary in nature, including challenges in HCI, machine learning, data mining, mobile systems, wireless and sensor networks, smart environments, security and privacy, signal processing, control theory, information theory, game theory, optimization techniques, psychology and social networking.  The workshop program included four keynote talks by Gaetano Borriello (University of Washington), Andy Hopper (Cambridge University), David Culler (University of California at Berkeley) and Shwetak Patel (University of Washington); NSF perspective by Keith Marzullo (Division Director of CNS Division, NSF); a number of panels and breakout sessions related to scaling ubicomp; and a plenary discussion on 20 years after Mark Weiser's ubicomp vision moderated by Mahadev Satyanarayanan (Carnegie Mellon University) and Roy Want (Intel). Participants completed survey responses reflecting their vision of the field.  Insights from all of these talks, survey responses, and discussions are found in the workshop project report.  Some of the key recommendations to NSF raised at the workshop are listed here:  Inter-disciplinary      research for behavior modeling.  Create,      share and maintain large scale data sets.  Develop pervasive infrastructure testbeds.  Work to develop strong cross-directorate collaboration between CISE &amp; SBE. Explicitly support cross-disciplinary, integrative proposals.  NSF should encourage proposers to develop cross-cutting curricula. Support the board goals of Phone 2020.  Develop new tools and methodology for determining ground truth at scale in the wild.  Develop new models and techniques to influence social behavior.  Gather and analyzed continuous data which capture the dynamics of evolving patterns of interaction in social networks.  Support of interdisciplinary pervasive computing HCI projects.  Recognize the type of funding that is needed to perform this work.  Study and develop highly efficient micro-scale energy harvesting systems. Support cross cutting program in vehicular/intelligent transportation issues.  Scaling of smart health technology.  Develop open extensible platforms and testbeds for smart health.  Access to health datasets.  Access of data from utility companies.  Organize exchange program or workshop between academics and engineers working in utilities.   Forster collaborative relationships between multiple mature theoretical areas that provide the basis for PeCS theory.  Promote research focused on theoretical foundation.     In addition to the grand challenges and recommendations listed above, many attendees emphasized that NSF needs to support the creation of testbeds and datasets, particularly if they support the validatio nof what cannot be currently done or evaluated. They suggest that investigators be strongly encouraged to not design systems from scratch but to build upon current or prior tools, datasets, testbeds, and results. Finally, attendees feel that NSF should fund disruptive technologies, those that look ahead to upcoming trends, changing paradigms, and how pervasive computin...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
