<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;1038031&lt;br/&gt;Halimeda Kilbourne, University of Maryland Center for Environmental Sciences &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Planning Collaborative Research on Climate Variability in the Western Equatorial Atlantic over Recent Centuries&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This planning visit evaluates the feasibility of establishing a long-term research effort to explore climate variability of the tropical Atlantic over the recent past. Currently paleoclimate reconstruction of the region is limited and relies largely on terrestrial records such as tree rings. This project explores the use of new coral species as a paleoclimate archive to gauge ocean climate variables such as upwelling rates and tropical sea surface temperature. Linking these findings to other climate records in the region will provide greater resolution of the recent climate of the tropical ocean, allowing more accurate prediction of the effects of climate change. The project is centered on collaboration between Dr. H. Kilbourne (University of Maryland Center for Environmental Sciences)and Dr. Ruy Kikuchi (Federal University of Brazil, Salvador) and combines site visits, discussion and demonstrations of laboratories and facilities related to the project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This visit will lay the foundation for a new research collaboration between US and Brazilian scientists with complementary expertise in climate reconstruction. The PI is a new investigator, and a post doctoral fellow will accompany her on this trip. Moreover, the PI has extensive mentoring experience and the research program that evolves from this visit is likely to create substantial graduate student involvement.  Lectures, lab visits and displays that result from this work and will find a likely outlet through public venues such as the Chesapeake Biological Laboratory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was intended to facilitate the beginning of an international collaboration between scientists in Brazil and the US. The Principle Investigator and her Ph.D. student from the University of Maryland spent a week visiting scientists and students at the Federal University of Bahia, in Salvador, Brazil.  We spent the week sharing our current research, current research facilities, and discussing future research.  Our joint research is aimed at developing new  information about Earth's recent climate history (last few centuries) in order to answer research questions about the primary controls on climate variability over decades to centuries. Specifically we are focused on understanding the sensitivity of the tropical Atlantic Ocean to climate forcing and understanding the causes of multi-year drought and wet conditions in tropics. This information can eventually help improve our projections of climate change both regionally and globally.  The meeting was successfully completed, producing a Memorandum of Understanding describing an actionable research plan and producing a grant proposal to a private granting agency to fund initial field work.  The Brazilian and US scientists involved remain in close communication about this research project and have developed an expanded network of colleagues with whom to share and discuss progress in our field.  We now have dates for field work in 2012 and we are currently working on some proof-of-concept data for publication in the near future.       Last Modified: 12/28/2011       Submitted by: K.
