<AbstractNarration>The Integrating Engineering and Literacy (IEL) project is developing and testing curriculum materials and a professional development model designed to explore the potential for introducing engineering concepts in grades 3 - 5 through design challenges based on stories in popular children's literature.  The project research and development team at Tufts University is working with pre-service teachers to design and test the curriculum modules for students and the teacher professional development model.  Then the program is tested and refined in work with 100 in-service teachers and their students in a diverse set of Massachusetts schools. The research team hypothesizes that professional development for elementary teachers using an interdisciplinary method for combining literature with engineering design challenges will increase the implementation of engineering in 3-5 classrooms and have positive impacts on students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The driving questions behind this proposed research are: (1) How do teachers' engineering (and STEM) content knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge, and perceptions or attitudes toward engineering influence their classroom teaching of engineering through literacy? (2) Do teachers create their own personal conceptions of the engineering design process, and what do these conceptions look like? (3) What engineering/reading thinking skills are students developing by participating in engineering activities integrated into their reading and writing work? The curriculum materials and teacher professional development model are being produced by a design research strategy that uses cycles of develop/test/refine work.  The effects of the program are being evaluated by a variety of measures of student and teacher learning and practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will contribute materials and research findings to the ultimate goal of understanding how to provide elementary school students with meaningful opportunities to learn engineering and develop valuable problem solving and thinking skills.</AbstractNarration>

The project, developed at Tufts Center for Engineering Education and Outreach, has shown a new model for engineering integration where the disciplines are truly dependent on each other and students successfully navigate between the two in a rich context. The Novel Engineering approach positions texts (novels, short stories, picture books) as the source for engineering design challenges that leverages the characters, setting, and thematic story elements. Characters become the clients and the setting provides design constraints. Materials used for design tasks in Novel Engineering are flexible, usually using recycled and craft materials, so that materials are available to all schools in an effort make Novel Engineering dissemination equitable. The project created a scalable professional development model that prepares classroom teachers to use the approach with their own curriculum and supports them in using progressive pedagogical techniques that address classroom goals, allowing Novel Engineering to be used in a wide variety of districts and settings.
