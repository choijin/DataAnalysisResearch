<AbstractNarration>From a contemporary perspective it is easy to underestimate the importance of salt in the history of mankind. Today, salt is cheap and available everywhere. This, however, stands in sharp contrast with past conditions. Although salt is an essential element in the human diet, it was not readily available for everyone in prehistoric and historic times and salt was remarkably expensive ("white gold"). Although the Caribbean environment is extremely suited for the natural production of salt and historic accounts confirm the high quality of salt from this region (George Washington demanded Turks Island salt to pickle meat for his troops), salt as an exchange commodity has been neglected in archaeological studies in the Caribbean region. This research examines the role of salt and the economic activities related to this resource at the pre-Columbian archaeological site MC-6 on Middle Caicos. New methods will be employed to overcome the relative invisibility of salt in the archaeological record. Dr. William Keegan, Curator of Caribbean Archaeology at the Florida Museum of Natural History, and Joost Morsink, a graduate student at the University of Florida, explore the importance of salt as an exchange commodity in the prehistoric Caribbean archipelago. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; MC-6 is a unique archaeological site in the Caribbean. Previous research conducted at MC-6 determined that its size and structural layout are incomparable to any other site in the region. The physical location of the site, in proximity to the salt-producing Armstrong Pond and an abundance of marine resources, indicates that the site's status was related to specific available resources. However, the direct relation between the settlement, architectural features and the availability of salt in the salt pond has not been tested. This research focuses on two areas. First, coring and sampling in the salt pond will provide detailed information on the historical developments of the pond and will determine if salt was available at the time people were living in MC-6. Second, excavations in the settlement will inform on the economic activities people were practicing within the settlement. Soil samples are used to determine whether people were transporting materials from the salt pond to the site and if specific structural features at MC-6 were utilized as storage facilities of salt and salted fish.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This research is significant because it explores economic activities related to salt, a topic that has received little attention in previous research. Moreover, this project will test the potential of new methods, such as coring and sampling of salt ponds and soil samples from within the habitation site to investigate the importance of this resource in prehistoric times. This project involves multiple institutions and national agencies; The Florida Museum of Natural History; the Department of Anthropology at the University of Florida; the Department of Environmental and Coastal Resources; the National Environmental Centre; The Turks &amp; Caicos National Trust; and The Turks &amp; Caicos National Museum; all of whom have offered their enthusiastic support. Finally, as a continuation of previous field projects at MC-6, a presentation will be given to the local school on Middle Caicos to raise awareness and knowledge about the prehistoric past on the island.</AbstractNarration>
