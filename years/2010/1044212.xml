<AbstractNarration>A set of collection curation tools that allow NSDL Pathways to more easily manage resources is being developed following a study of current curation practices.  This study provides the background necessary to undertake the modification and integration of existing algorithms in order to improve collection management.  Two facets of the project are the goal of finding similar or replacement resources for those that disappear, and the use of semantic analysis to help determine if a resource has been repurposed or otherwise changed over time.  The former is useful to collection managers enabling them to bring new and relevant items into their collections, while the latter aids in maintaining the usefulness of the collection.  The tools are expected to lower the costs of maintaining links to the resources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Collections that contain web-based resources identified by URLs are common.  The resources can change in many ways, both intentional and unintentional, without the collection manager knowing of the change. Identifying and addressing such change requires significant manpower.   This project developed knowledge and techniques to help in the management of such collections.  It studied how change had undermined existing collections, including those provided by professional organizations.  It developed techniques to classify change into categories ranging from not dangerous (e.g. spelling corrections, updated information) to extremely dangerous (e.g. web site takeover by questionable entity).  Additionally, the project developed interfaces that present the automated analysis of distributed collections in order to focus the limited time/attention of collection managers to those most problematic resources in their collections while leaving collection managers in control of deciding what changes are and are not damaging to their collections.  Particular novel contributions of the project include a web-page segmentation method combining image analysis techniques from vision with content markup analysis from web parsers. This approach showed improved success in identifying the main content of web resources in a wide vareity of web page layouts -- effectively filtering out the headers, footers, navigation bars, and advertisements which can cause problems to algorithms for detecting change in resources.  A second novel contribution was the improvement of techniques for identifying and classifying "soft 404" errors.  A soft 404 error occurs when a web page is no longer available and, instead of providing the http 404 error code, the web server generates a "nice" page trying to explain that the content is no longer available and where the reader might want to look. The problem for collection management software is that these responses are coded as correct resources in the http response so only by analyzing the textual and other content of the response can the fact that the content is not longer available be discovered. This project extended the state of the art in both techniques to detect soft 404 responses and developed a taxonomy of such responses and classifiers to automatically map particular web server responses into these unique classes.  For example, some soft 404 responses point to the new location of a moved website, which is valuable information for collection managers, while others point to generic "page not found" messages or even to unrelated web sites.  A third contribution of this project was the development of improved techniques for locating potential replacements for missing resources in collections.  When a web resource is no longer available, it is sometimes desirable to identify a new web resource containing similar content. The techniques developed in this project used lexical signatures and performed better than traditional content similarity measures.  Finally, this project began the development of a web service combining the above capabilities with an easy-to-use interface for creating and managing distributed collections. Novel aspects included the definition of distributed collections based on an variety of common formats, such as lists of URLs, and the visualization of the distributed collection as a hierarchic entitity enabling rapid assessment of the health of the collection as a whole and rapid access to the problematic resources in the collection.
