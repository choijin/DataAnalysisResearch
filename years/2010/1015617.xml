<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[             Funding from NSF provided travel and training at a Chinese  University to gain research experience, learn about research policies, and the language and culture of this foreign country.  The present research proposal focuses on molecular aspects of plant development that has the potential to establish mechanisms for improving development, fitness and biomass production.              Early embryonic development in Arabidopsis plants involves the establishment of a radial patterning axis, superimposed on an apical-basal axis serving as a framework for further pattern elaboration. For example, to reach the first stage of differentiated embryo development the cells initially forming a globular mass have to divide such that inner, middle and outer layers of specialized tissue arise. To date, the mechanisms by which radial patterning occurs in differentiating cells of the embryo or mature organs are not well understood, but the available experimental data suggests cell-cell signaling is required for proper patterning. Similar to other species, Arabidopsis plants contain a huge number of receptor like kinases (RLKs), special proteins embedded in the plasma membrane. Owing to their structure, spanning the membrane and exposing functional domains on the outside, as well as inside the cell they are likely to function in signal relays.  Their representation in the plant genome at more than 2.5% of total protein encoding genes suggests that RLKs signaling is important in all aspects of development, including radial patterning.              Recent research performed in our laboratory using reverse genetics in Arabidopsis showed that two closely related RLKs named RPK1 (RECEPTOR PROTEIN KINASE1). and TOAD2 (TOADSTOOL2) are redundantly required for embryonic pattern formation.
