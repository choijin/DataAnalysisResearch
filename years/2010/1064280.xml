<AbstractNarration>The nuclear equation of state will be studied via the use of isotopic and meson observables.  One experiment has been approved at the Radioactive Ion Beam Factory in Japan to study isospin diffusion in high-energy heavy ion collisions.  This experiment will make use of pure beams of high energy heavy ions spanning a wide asymmetry.  Isotopic production will be used to more precisely gauge the nuclear symmetry energy at energies above normal nuclear saturation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, recent data acquired in measurements at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory will be used to constrain the nucleon effective masses in nuclear matter.  These results are extremely important in constraining the model dependence of transport theories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Future measurements will concentrate on nucleon correlation functions in heavy ion collisions and on pion production as an observable of the symmetry energy at supra-saturation densities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will employ undergraduate students in order to prepare them for careers in nuclear physics.  The PI has a strong record of undergraduate student training, having sent two out of three undergraduate students to graduate school during the past project period (and is planning to send two out of two to graduate school in the next year).  In addition to student training, the project will solve several technical issues in detector technology, data acquisition, and high-speed electronics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ New Theories in Nucleosynthesis  A new theoretical program has developed in theoretical nuclear astrophysics under the supervision of Western Michigan University.  This program is in close collaboration with scientists at the University of Notre Dame,the National Astronomical Observatory in Japan, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. While this program is primarilysupported by a separate NSF grant, some support from the current grant has been used to explore the equation-of-state dependence of collapsing proto-neutron stars and the ensuing nucleosynthesis.   The initial project began with the study dynamic effects of black-hole collapse on escaping ejecta in core collapse supernova explosions.  This initial model postulated that light element enrichment in some of the oldest stars in the galaxy may be due to a single event in which the nucleosynthesis is truncated.  This truncation was thought to be due to the dynamic collapse of material in the supernova onto the surface of the neutron star.  This will result in anenrichment of lighter elements relative to the heavier elements.  Observational evidence of this has been shown.  The occurrence in old, low metallicity stars is consistent with prompt black hole collapse in massive stars for single-site r-process enriched stars, which would occur early in our galactic evolution.  Outreach Programs  Western Michigan University has been involved in several outreach programs, particularly those involving local elementary schools.  These programs have involved tours for local schools as well as in-school visits to present physics as a possible career choice as well as toinstill enthusiasm in science.  The WMU accelerator facility provides a highly educational venue for students to interact with faculty, ask questions, and gain an appreciation and excitement ofphysics.  During the 2011-2012 academic year, students from local elementaryschools have participated in visits organized by the PI.  This follows two prior years of visits, which has proven to be highly successful and has fostered aclose relationship with the local school system.  In addition to visits from local schools, the PI and students have put together a package of demonstrations to bring to local elementary schools to perform andeducate students at the elementary level.  These demonstrations include presentationsof energy, radiation, mechanics, electricity, gravity, and even quantum mechanics.  This suite of demonstrations was first presented to the local Oakland Academy fifth and sixth grade class during the 2011-2012 school year, and has been immensely successful.  We hope to continue this outreach in the future.        Last Modified: 10/19/2012       Submitted by: Michael A Famiano]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
