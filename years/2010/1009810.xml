<AbstractNarration>In this project, Dr. Hebb and her collaborators will conduct a three-part study of the fundamental properties of low-mass stars.  In the last decade, it has become apparent to the stellar community that theoretical models of the masses and radii of unevolved low-mass stars differ significantly from observations.  In this study, Dr. Hebb will determine the chemical abundances of certain stars where the masses, radii, and temperatures are accurately known, explore the effect of magnetically-induced activity on the determinations of luminosity and radius, and obtain critical data on very young systems to test models of the phases leading up to full hydrogen fusion. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is expected to have a broad scientific impact because fundamental stellar data can be used in a variety of applications, including the determination of exoplanet masses and the characterization of the star formation process.  The research team will also continue their work with students at Vanderbilt and at Fisk College.</AbstractNarration>
