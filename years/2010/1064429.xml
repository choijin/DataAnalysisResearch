<AbstractNarration>Many applications in science and engineering encounter the problem of&lt;br/&gt;identifying and processing topologically interesting features in the&lt;br/&gt;digital representation of a geometry or data. Such features often need&lt;br/&gt;to be optimal with respect to some metric (measurement). It is&lt;br/&gt;recognized that homology groups from algebraic topology play an&lt;br/&gt;essential role in these computations. Although the study of structural&lt;br/&gt;properties of the homology groups has a rich history in mathematics,&lt;br/&gt;their computations in combination with geometry are not that well&lt;br/&gt;studied. The principal investigators (PIs) propose to study these&lt;br/&gt;fundamental questions thoroughly, along with their connections to&lt;br/&gt;practical problems from science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: Efficient solutions of the optimality questions in&lt;br/&gt;homology computations require both mathematical and algorithmic&lt;br/&gt;developments. The PIs bring aboard these required expertise. Apart&lt;br/&gt;from the synergistic effect of the proposed study on mathematics and&lt;br/&gt;theoretical computer science, the close ties with various applications&lt;br/&gt;in science and engineering will play a synergistic role between&lt;br/&gt;computational fields such as computer graphics, computer vision,&lt;br/&gt;sensor networks, computer aided design, and scientific fields such as&lt;br/&gt;biology, physics, chemistry, and others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optimization of aspects of homology groups provides&lt;br/&gt;important insights in many scientific and engineering applications&lt;br/&gt;ranging from tunnels in protein molecules to voids in large&lt;br/&gt;machines. Solutions of such problems can aid in the manufacturing of&lt;br/&gt;better machines, designing of new drugs, and rapid modeling of&lt;br/&gt;customized objects. The educational impact of this project is in a&lt;br/&gt;large synergy between mathematics and computer science motivated by&lt;br/&gt;real applications. Course notes, internet distributions, and software&lt;br/&gt;systems developed through the project will enable the scientific&lt;br/&gt;community to study challenging problems in geometry, topology, and&lt;br/&gt;algorithms. Graduate students supported by the project will develop&lt;br/&gt;skills in mathematics and theoretical computer science and also in&lt;br/&gt;writing robust, efficient, and user-friendly software.</AbstractNarration>
