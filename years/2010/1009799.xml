<AbstractNarration>The aim of this project is to investigate the Epoch of Reionization (EOR) in the history of the universe via simulations of cosmological radiative transfer and N-body/gas dynamics.  This will address frontier problems in the theory of reionization and its feedback on galaxy formation in the Cold DarkMatter model, in order to predict observable signatures.   These will include predictions for the redshifted 21-cm background from the cosmic "Dark Ages" and the EOR, an area of great current observational interest.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students, and participation of individuals from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In less than a billion years after the Big Bang, the first galaxies flooded the universe with enough ultraviolet starlight to ionize every atom in the intergalactic gas and heat it to 10,000 degrees.  This transformation of the universe from a dark and featureless continuum of cold, neutral gas and dark matter, before any galaxies had formed, into a cosmic web of brilliant galaxies and dark matter, immersed in a hot, ionized atomic gas, is called the epoch of reionization (EoR).  As the observational frontier of cosmology pushes outward in distance and backwards in time to begin to probe this epoch, this project made essential progress in the theory of how reionization happened, by what sources, and how it impacted the formation of new galaxies, while predicting observational signatures of these processes.  This involved development of the most sophisticated and detailed large-scale simulations to date of the EoR.  It required simulating illustrative volumes in the universe which are large enough to be representative.  A fair sample of the average history of reionization and its evolving patchiness requires simulating a volume which today is at least 100 Mpc (300 million light-years) across, as it was more than 13 billion years ago, when the first galaxies formed and their ionizing radiation was transported outward across the intergalactic gas.  Three approaches were taken to solve this problem: one was optimized for mapping the patchiness of reionization in relation to the large-scale structure of the universe; another was optimized to find the back-reaction of reionization on individual galaxies and their star-forming power, to account for the global effect of this feedback on reionization, itself; and the last approach zoomed-in with much finer detail, on structures even smaller than these galaxies, dense enough to shield their interiors from ionizing radiation and slow the progress of reionization but small enough to be photoevaporated and destroyed by it.     The first approach involved a two-step calculation.  First, galaxy and large-scale structure formation was simulated by a gravitational N-body method developed by team members, called CubeP3M.  These CubeP3M simulations pushed the envelope of the largest volumes with the highest resolving power ever undertaken for this epoch of cosmology, extending up to 600 Mpc and 165 billion N-body particles.  Second, ionizing radiation emitted by each galaxy and its effect on intergalactic gas were tracked by a ray-tracing, radiative transfer method the team developed, called C2-Ray. This code mapped the simulated volume with a cubic lattice of up to 130 million cells and transported the radiation across it from the millions of galaxies found by the N-body simulation.  A new analytical method was also developed to add the contribution from galaxies too small for the N-body simulation to resolve.

In the second approach, a milestone was achieved, of the first fully-coupled radiation-hydrodynamics simulation of the reionization of the Local Universe, using the team's new RAMSES-CUDATON hybrid CPU-GPU code on the world's largest and fastest supercomputer, Titan, with thousands of GPU accelerators, at Oak Ridge (see Image). This ground-breaking simulation was large enough in volume to simulate global reionization (91 Mpc), while massive enough in the number of resolution elements --4096-cubed N-body particles and 4096-cubed cells --- to resolve for...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
