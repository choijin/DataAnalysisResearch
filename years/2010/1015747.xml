<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Title: Effect of Surface Roughness on Copper Oxide Nanohardness  PI: Rodrigo Cooper  Dept of Mechanical Engineering  Texas A&amp;M University  College Station, TX 77840        Fabrication of microelectronic devices, such as micro-processors and other integrated circuit (IC) devices, is a process of many unknowns and perfected mostly through experience rather than scientific calculations. Up to now, fabrication techniques require constant verification of each process to ensure that the tight control parameters are met. This increases fabrication time and cost of each device.   Fabrication of IC devices requires making a æditchÆ in a silicon wafer, coating the entire wafer with copper, and then polishing the copper, essentially removing small amounts of this coated metal until only the copper in the æditchÆ remains. The remaining copper creates the electrical pathways required for the device. There are many studies performed to improve and increase the rate at which the copper is removed. Much like sanding a piece of wood, faster material removal &ndash; either by using a coarser sand paper or rubbing fine sandpaper faster in one direction &ndash; will result in a rougher surface finish. With metals, the surface roughness changes the energy of the surface and can cause different oxides to develop.   The research performed by Rodrigo Cooper at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China attempted to address the issues of monitoring what oxides are developed on the surface of copper with different surface finishes. The aim of the research was to distinguish if and how the oxide properties where changed with different finishes and identify which finish gave a faster removal. Smoother copper surfaces were found to have the hardest oxide making it the most difficult to remove, while the rougher surface produced an oxide softer and easier to remove by polishing.   This knowledge can help scientists determine ways to fine tune and have better predictions as to how the copper will be removed and potentially saving time between processes. Better predictions mean less verification between each process and faster and cheaper productions of IC devices. Further studies are required to determine the best way to remove the softer oxide without damaging the copper that is needed inside the æditchesÆ for the electrical pathways. These studies will eventually migrate into actual production lines for microelectronics allowing better control, faster output, and higher quality devices.
