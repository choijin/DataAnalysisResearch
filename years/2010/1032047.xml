<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks funding for the Center for Safety, Security, and Rescue Research studies conducted by the University of Minnesota (lead) and its research partner at the University of Denver. Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 10-507. The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal is about further developing ongoing robot design activities for safety and security. The presented research focus is in the area of underwater robot design, and it describes activities regarding the waterproofing, buoyancy control, camera stabilization and sensor fusion strategies. The proposed work builds on the strong previous track record, and the team is strong. Unlike most existing approaches, the proposed effort should provide miniature size robots with high mobility. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal presents a set of robotic systems (including an amphibious, tumbling robot) and algorithms that capitalize on earlier pertinent work at the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center for Safety, Security, and Rescue Research. The proposal also offers innovative stabilization algorithms and hardware for the sensor suite in order to improve the quality of data provided to the first responder. In addition, innovative sensor fusion schemes for underwater navigation are proposed. The broader impacts of the proposed work range from a planned inclusion of undergraduates into the research plan to the possibility that life-saving commercial devices could eventually result from the work described. The connection of this work with the NSF Safety, Security, and Rescue Research Center will ensure that the proposed technologies will be exposed to first responders at the proposed field trials.</AbstractNarration>
