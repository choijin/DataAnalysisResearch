<AbstractNarration>This is a small workshop proposal to bring together Yup'ik scientists and educators with their Saami colleagues in Norway for a 3 day workshop to explore mathematics in a cultural context. The workshop will examine Yup'ik and Saami mathematical systems through their connections to practice, epistemology, and cosmology. The PI, Dr. Jerry Lipka, has been working with Yup'ik elders and teachers for several years exploring the cognitive processes behind everyday tasks or problems such as: making a pattern for clothing, a process that not only involves geometry and mathematics but encompasses Yup'ik cosmology and cultural epistemology. The purpose of the workshop is to work together with Saami people to explore the possibility of an Arctic "indigenous" cognitive process that can be understood through mathematical principles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will take place at the Sami University College in Kautokeino, Norway. There is an expected 10-15 participants, including scholars from Taiwan, Australia, Canada and New Zealand at their own expense. In addition to the workshop the participants will be attending the World Indigenous Nations Higher Education Consortium meetings August 24th-26th.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A long-term collaboration between Lipka (Principal Investigator) and Dora Andrew-Ihrke and Evelyn Yanez YupÆik colleagues and former teachers and bilingual coordinators in Alaska resulted in identifying underlying mathematical processed embedded in YupÆik everyday activities. The identified processes are: symmetry/splitting, body proportional measuring, and geometrical verification. These mathematical processes are powerful because they appear to generate an alternative and integrated approach to the teaching and learning of rational number reasoning, measuring, geometry, and early algebraic thinking. To understand if another indigenous group used similar mathematical processes in their everyday activities we held a workshop/conference with Sami and YupÆik elders and educators.

Beyond the major activity of presenting traditional ways in which Sami and YupÆik seamstresses made everyday artifacts like boots and clothing there was additional observation of a Sami seamstress making clothing; DVDÆs of the process of constructing boots and clothing were recorded and analyzed.  The findings from this project emanate both from the workshop and the analysis of DVDs Interesting and importantly, each group started their project from uneven material. In fact, a major finding from this preliminary work is that both groups used the same underlying mathematics.

The geometrical verification of folding and checking for congruence was also a "proof" that the two sides were equidistant and of equal area from the center point and center line. More concretely, one action performed on material in the construction of a boot or hat resulted in showing how multiple math strands are connected. For example, folding material symmetrically in half and half again and...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
