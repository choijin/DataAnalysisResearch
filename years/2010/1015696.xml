Recently it has been suggested that medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) may play an important role in fear circuitry; clinical studies have shown that abnormal activity in mPFC is associated with the prevalence of some anxiety disorders. Recent animal studies have suggested that  mPFC acts as the main inhibitory signal controlling fear "extinction". Based on evidence from my own lab, however, I proposed an alternative: mPFC works as a short term "working-memory" for fear. This novel fear model asserts that activity in mPFC may directly modulate activity in regions of dorsal and ventral PAG, causing a variety of defensive behaviors that are specific to the current level of threat (in this project, rats freeze during low threat but flee in response to more immediate threat).  To test the proposed fear circuitry model, bilateral recording electrodes were implanted into brain areas of the rat that are believed to mediate fear (i.e., mPFC and PAG).

Intellectual Merit. These findings provide insight into the neural circuitry regulating both normal and pathological fear states. Gaining an understanding about the contribution of brain areas not normally implicated in the "standard" fear model may change the way in which fear circuitry is currently conceptualized. These findings may lead to the revision of a widely accepted, yet possibly incorrect model system, which may eventually enable the development of new treatment approaches fo...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
