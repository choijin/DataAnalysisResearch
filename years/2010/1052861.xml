<AbstractNarration>Howard University's (HU) project entitled: Global Education, Awareness and Research Undergraduate Program (GEAR UP), is committed to establishing and sustaining student and faculty scholarly engagement throughout the world. The global education of this generation of engineering students is essential to meet the engineering challenges and make the world a more technologically advanced, connected and sustainable place to live. The Institute for International Education estimates that only 4.7% of engineering graduates have had a study abroad experience. For African American engineering graduates that number is even smaller.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the challenge of preparing African American engineering students for global engagement and leadership. HU will create sustainable international research partnerships that will provide undergraduate research opportunities abroad and student exposure to engineering research in an international setting. The two overarching goals for this project are to 1) create sustainable international research partnerships that will provide undergraduate research opportunities abroad and student exposure to engineering research in an international setting to enhance the preparedness of engineering students to be globally engaged leaders upon graduation and 2) to contribute to the body of knowledge on strategically preparing underrepresented minorities for global engagement through scholarly publications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enhance the preparation of HU engineering graduates to be globally engaged leaders and will serve as a model for other institutions.</AbstractNarration>

The project involved travel to an international destination where teams of American students worked on research projects with teams of students from other countries. As a result, minority students were able to take advantage of the opportunity to interact with a select group of STEM students from some of the best technical universities around the world; experience close advising and mentoring by faculty from both their home institution and an international partner; and enhance their career preparation for global engagement.  During the academic year, American faculty worked with their international collaborators to clearly define the research project, coordinate the summer research experience for the team of students, establish a "give back" to the international institution (e.g. invited lecture, short course), and develop proposal ideas that will provide continual support for the global research activity.  The Global Education, Awareness and Research Undergraduate Program allowed us to study students who were conducting STEM research in an environment very different from the one they experience in the United States.
