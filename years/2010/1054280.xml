<AbstractNarration>This CAREER awardee at Utah State University is investigating the learning that can take place when elementary school students are directly involved in the collection, sense-making, and analysis of real, personally-meaningful data sets.  The project responds to increasing attention to data collection and analysis in elementary grades and aims to make important contributions to the knowledge base on effective approaches to these topics. The hypotheses of this work are that by organizing elementary statistics instruction around the study of physical activities, students will have greater personal engagement in data analysis processes and that students will also develop more robust understandings of statistical ideas.  Students and teachers from fifth grade classrooms at the Edith Bowen Laboratory School at Utah State University and from several elementary schools from the Cashe County School District, a rural district in northern Utah, are participating in the project.  This work is co-funded by the EPSCoR program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Statistics topics include measures of center and variation.  Students use pedometers, heart rate monitors, other probeware, and the TinkerPlots software.  The research team investigates the influence of personal ownership and relationships to data on students' understanding of learning of elementary statistics concepts and their ability to analyze data. The research involves multi-year clinical interviews and video-recorded classroom design experiments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research results are expected to be published in appropriate journals and are expected to be presented at professional meetings. Lesson plans and student instructional materials related to physical activity, measures of center, and data distributions are made available for use in elementary schools.</AbstractNarration>
