<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project between Evergreen State College and  is creating, validating, and disseminating a science process and reasoning skills test (SPARST) to assess students' acquisition of such skills as experimental design, data analysis, graphing, and scientific writing. SPARST is being designed to help biology faculty:  a) gauge the skill level of incoming students, b) revise undergraduate curricula to better address the teaching of skills along with content, c) create a national network for sharing skill-teaching practices and resources, and d) improve the general science literacy of both science majors and non-majors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  Since there are few tests of this type available within the biological sciences, SPARST will help inform faculty of their effectiveness at helping students develop these skills and will help students become  better prepared to enter graduate school or careers in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  SPARST is being tested at several institutions and revised iteratively in order to create a valid and reliable test for distribution. The test will be free and available on-line as multiple choice and short-answer questions. It is designed to be graded online; responses to short answer questions will be compiled for ease of grading and faculty will be provided with a validated grading rubric. Faculty who implement SPARST will be provided with a free, descriptive diagnostic of their students' abilities that will indicate how well each student performed on the subset of scaled questions in each science process skill area and how the faculty's class compares to similar biology classes at an anonymous subset of similar institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education efforts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Science process and reasoning skills of graphing, data analysis, experimental design, and scientific writing are crucial components of undergraduate life science curricula. These skills provide the conceptual framework that allows students to develop a deeper understanding of science and students who learn these skills early in their undergraduate education perform better in college science courses (Dirks and Cunningham, 2006). Furthermore, faculty view undergraduate acquisition of science process and reasoning skills as critical to their development as young scientists. Thus, there is a need to better assess how and when students learn these skills. Without an appropriate tool to assess our teaching of skills, we can only assume that students somehow acquire these skills in their education, which tends to focus primarily on content.  Over the course of our grant, we have developed SPARST &ndash; a reliable, valid, and comprehensive test &ndash; to assess studentsÆ understanding and mastery of science process skills. We have used the individual tests with a large number of students from wide academic and geographic backgrounds to determine each testÆs validity and reliability.     SPARST is a free on-line assessment tool and consists of four different 20 question tests; one each to assess graphing, data analysis, experimental design and scientific communication.   SPARST: Science and Process Reasoning Skills Test is designed to help faculty  better      gauge the skill level of entering undergraduate science students assess studentsÆ acquisition of science      process and reasoning skills as they move through the curriculum revise      undergraduate curricula to better address effective teaching of skills      along with content improve      the general science literacy of both science majors and non-majors monitor the effectiveness of their efforts to      teach these skills   Using SPARST as a regular assessment throughout the undergraduate curriculum will afford instructors the feedback to change course structures as well as better align the various courses in a curriculum to provide the students with the practice they need to move toward expertise in these areas.  With strong science process and reasoning skills, students will be better prepared to enter graduate school or careers in science.  Previous work  (Dirks and Cunningham 2006) has also shown that gaining science process skills also provides lower preforming students with the conceptual basis they need to succeed in their classes. Given that a disproportionate number of these students are from underserved populations or first generation students, their increased retention in biology courses could also contribute positively to increasing the diversity of the future science workplace.
