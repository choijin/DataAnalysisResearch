<AbstractNarration>Commercial cellular networks have recently experienced a dramatic increase in demand for data services. Satisfying this demand will require substantial (order-of-magnitude) increases in the spectral efficiency that can be achieved by such networks.  This will require much more extensive information exchange and cooperation among nodes in the network than in current systems.  This research investigates possible approaches for cooperation among nodes in a cellular network based on practical methods for feedback and information exchange.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main theme of this research is on techniques for exchanging and exploiting limited state information about channels, interference, and quality of service in a wireless network.  The focus is on two scenarios: feedback for point-to-point fading links, and information exchange between two cooperative base stations.  The first scenario is meant to address limits imposed by fading for mobiles well within a cell, whereas the second scenario addresses limits imposed by interference at a cell boundary.  One of the goals is to gain fundamental understanding into the trade-off between channel state feedback and receiver state feedback for fading channels.  For the two-cell scenario, cooperative resource allocation and cooperative coding and decoding strategies are investigated.  The emphasis is on understanding the benefits of cooperation as a function of the amount of information exchanged, and on associated resource allocation across time, frequency, and space. The investigators also study the combination of cooperative coding/decoding with adaptive techniques for precoder optimization, which do not rely on the explicit exchange of channel measurements.</AbstractNarration>
