<AbstractNarration>This project combines thin film synthesis, analysis, and modeling expertise from three universities to explore the possibility of achieving quantum efficiency greater than one in unbiased semiconducting heterostructures and nanostructured thin films.  The approach, called heterojunction-assisted impact ionization, combines a narrow band gap host material with wide band gap absorbers in the form of thin films, nanorods, or nanoparticles.  Carriers generated by higher energy photons in the wide-gap material drift into the narrow-gap material where they decay through impact ionization to produce additional carriers.  The project explores promising combinations of semiconducting materials with appropriate band alignment and growth characteristics to promote impact ionization while minimizing other recombination pathways.  Success in this endeavor will lead to improved solar cell efficiency using environmentally benign materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the grand scientific challenges of the 21st century is the development of a technology that can convert sunlight to electricity on a large scale at reasonable cost.  The efficiency of most solar cells is limited by unit quantum efficiency of light absorption, that is, each photon of light produces at most one electron of charge. This is particularly problematic for shorter wavelength light, which corresponds to higher energy photons, since a large fraction of an absorbed photon's energy is converted into waste heat.  This project aims to design and optimize nanostructured semiconducting materials that preferentially channel this excess energy into additional charge generation rather than waste heat. The approach can be readily adapted to materials used in existing photovoltaic devices and also suggests entirely new classes of environmentally benign materials for application in solar energy conversion.  Through the training of students, the project will help foster the next generation of scientists and engineers, well-prepared to address problems relevant to society.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Harvesting energy from the sun using solar cells is generally inefficient because beacuse sunlight is composed of many wavelengths, or more precisley, sunlight delivers of quanta of energy called photons carrying a broad range of energy.  By contrast, the semiconductor materials used in solar cell to absorb those photons have a fixed 'threshold' energy.  Photons with energy below that threshold are not absorbed at all, while those with higher energy are absorbed but lose their excess energy to heat, not to increasing the voltage or electrical current.  Several approaches have been proposed to overcome this inefficiency, and some are actually deployed in commercial solar cells.  The purpose of this project was to achieve proof-of-principle for a new such approach.   We aimed to design composite films composed of materials with different threshold energies that would take some of the excess energy produced by high energy photons and convert it into additional electrical current.  The concept relied on a process called impact ionization, which is borrowed from technologies used to detect and amplify light, but such detectors require input of external energy to work.  Near the end of the project, we successfully demonstrated that impact ionization occur without adding any external energy using zinc sulfide films having a large band gap coupled to a silicon substrate with a smaller band gap.  We did not have time to opimize the process completely, but in principle this combination of materials would impove the solar cell effficiency by about 10%.  The possible improvement from other combinations, for example zinc selenide on a silicon substrate, would be higher.  All such combinations will require careful opimization, but generally would not add much expense to the final product.
