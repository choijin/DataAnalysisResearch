<AbstractNarration>Fayetteville State University seeks to develop the comprehensive Integrated STEM Academic Success (ISAS) project.  In agreement with the institution's strategic priorities, ISAS seeks to increase retention and graduation rates of STEM undergraduates,and prepare leaders who can compete successfully in the global economy and demonstrate 21st century global competencies.  The goals and objectives of the ISAS project are to: (a) increase the number of students receiving degrees in STEM disciplines by improving retention and graduation rates; (b) increase the student enrollment in STEM disciplines; and (c) improve the quality of faculty in STEM disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;ISAS program activities provide opportunities to advance knowledge and understanding relative to effective and innovative approaches to support recruitment and retention for undergraduate students in the STEM disciplines as well as placement for recent graduates in STEM enterprises. The use of and the evaluation of intrusive academic advisement and mentoring models, undergraduate research, learning communities, comprehensive tracking, accelerated courses, faculty development, summer bridge programs and research mentoring will establish a clear relationship between education and research. Successful implementation of the ISAS program activities holds the potential for addressing and resolving the issues of enrollment, retention, persistence and graduation in STEM academic programs. ISAS will equip graduates with skills necessary to enter a competitive and global STEM workforce or graduate school.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The HBCU-UP, Integrated STEM Academic Success Program was awarded to Fayetteville State University in 2010 with three goals in mind:  (1) Increase the number of students receiving degrees in STEM disciplines by improving retention and graduation rates, (2) Increase student enrollment in STEM disciplines, and (3) Increase the quality of STEM faculty at Fayetteville State University.  These lofty goals were set to be accomplished within a 4-5 year time period.  With the support of the Principal Investigator, Provost Jon Young, Co-Principal Investigator, Dr. Daniel Okunbor and dedicated faculty and staff, these goals have been reached.  Several strategies and tasks have been utilized to decrease the attrition rates and to increase the number of degrees conferred in STEM disciplines. intrusive advising, research mentoring, social networking, peer tutoring, collaborative learning, seminar series, degree completion tracking and research mentoring have been utilized at FSU through a community of STEM faculty, staff and students peers. As a result of these strategies, in Biological Sciences, Mathematics and Computer Science, the attrition rates were close to projected rates, although the actual decrease to 15% for each STEM department was not realized.  Higher attrition rates in some disciplines were caused by  withdrawal of students from the STEM disciplines due to reasons other than academics. A significant number of our students are nontraditional and students who serve in the military. These students tend to be highly mobile because of the nature of their affiliations. Although, it has been a big challenge for each STEM department to reduce the attrition rates to 15%, data from the past five years shows some improvements in the attrition rate each year.   The number of STEM degrees conferred was achieved successfully with a dramatic increase of 63%.  The academic support services, such as research mentoring, peer tutoring and many other academic support resources put in place, benefitted the students academically.   To increase the student enrollment in STEM disciplines (Goal 2), several strategies and tasks were included in the plan of action. These strategies were Accelerated Mathematics Courses, STEM Learning Communities,  Summer Bridge for Incoming Freshmen, SAT Prep-Academy and Pre-College Summer Research Internship.  Overall, these activities from STEM enrichment programs yielded favorable outcomes in recruiting the students.  During five year period, the total number of students served was two hundred sixty (260) in the SAT Academy and Science &amp; Math Achievement Test, and ninety-six (96) students participated in the summer research internship..  To improve the quality of faculty in STEM disciplines (Goal 3), several strategies and tasks such as Mini Research Grants for STEM Faculty, Faculty Focus Group and Professional Development Workshops were utilized.  A total of thirty-seven (37) faculty received support through mini grants, while one hundred thirty-nine (139) faculty received professional development to improve pedagogy, research, professional conferences and advisement.  As a result of the research conducted with mini grant support and professional development, over three hundred (300) publications in professional journals and conference proceedings were contributed by faculty during the five year award period. This is a significant achievement in the total number of research and scholarly publications which averaged 20 per year at the onset of the program.  In conclusion, all parties including Project Investigator (Dr. Jon M. Young) and Co-Project Investigator (Dr. Daniel Okunbor) of the project as well as faculty participants and their department chairs and staff worked very collegially to promote the Integrated STEM Academic Success (ISAS) program at Fayetteville State University and accomplish stated goals in the original proposal. This would not have been possible without the administrative support of the Dean of College of Arts and Sciences during the 5 year period, Dr. David Barlow.
