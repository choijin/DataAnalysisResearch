<AbstractNarration>Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) is a widely used set of scientific programs for data analysis and visualization with an extraordinary broad user base within the scientific community. The broader impacts of this software are extraordinary. GMT remains a foundation in the marine and solid Earth sciences, and other infrastructure software depends on it. Over many years the PIs have made both evolutionary and revolutionary changes to the GMT code base, resulting in 13 releases of the GMT 4 series between 2005 and February 2010 and a radically new and modularized GMT 5 platform. This award includes funding to stabilize, maintain, improve and extend GMT 5, including interoperability with Geographic Information Systems (GIS), interoperability with Google Earth and other improvements.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has delivered GMT 5 - the latest version of the Generic Mapping Tools, a set of Open Source tools for scientific data analysis and visualization (gmt.soest.hawaii.edu).  GMT is used across numerous disciplines and has been downloaded &gt;100,000 times from all over the world.  About 15% of downloads are from the US, the key constituents of any US-supported research.  However, the international community greatly supports the project by providing extensive testing, leading to bug reports and feature requests.  Apart from the PI, GMT is entirely dependent on volunteer developers and currently 3 of the 5 main developers are international collaborators.  Version 5 has added numerous new tools and capabilities to GMT, including better interoperability with other software and better platform independency of installation, now using the cross-platform cmake development process.  GMT support data such as GSHHG (the Global Self-consistent Hierarchical High-resolution Geography data) and DCW-GMT (Digital Charts of the World for GMT) have seen continued improvements, and our website now provides users direct access to interactive documentation (including video podcasts), bug reporting tools, user forums, access to the software, and complete descriptions of installation procedures. A key aspect of GMT 5 is that it is essentially just one large API (application programming interface - i.e., a set of library routines) that are called upon by a small driver program (called gmt).  This change has allowed us to develop (so far) two external programs that use this library.  One is gmt for MATLAB/Octave and the other is gmt for Julia (another high-level dynamic programming language for numerical and scientific use).  These new tools allow users working in these two computational environments complete access to all GMT modules, thus broadening the use of the GMT infrastructure beyond the command line.
