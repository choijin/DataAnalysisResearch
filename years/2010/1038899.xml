<AbstractNarration>Oregon State University (OSU), the University of Oregon (UO), and Portland State University (PSU) are collaborating on a comprehensive, highly integrated examination of hydrological, ecological, and socio-economic factors in the Willamette River Basin.  The team is applying  Envision, a theoretical framework developed at OSU, to evaluate how climate change, population growth, and economic growth will alter the availability and the use of water in the Willamette River Basin. Envision provides a computing environment in which state-of-the-art hydrological, ecological, and socio-economic models can interact synergistically. Envision also contains a multi-agent-based modeling component that enables it to represent the impact of human decision-making on landscape change. The team is addressing the following objectives:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) Identify and quantify the linkages and feedbacks among hydrologic, ecological, and socioeconomic dimensions of the water system.&lt;br/&gt;(2) Determine where and when climate change and human activities will create water scarcities.&lt;br/&gt;(3) Evaluate a broad range of strategies that could enable this region to prevent, mitigate, or adapt to water scarcities.&lt;br/&gt;(4) Create a transferable method of predicting where climate change will create water scarcities in other regions and where those scarcities would exert the strongest impact on human society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team is collaborating with public officials, resource managers, and other stakeholders with strong interest in protecting ecosystems and water resources. Commissioners from the thirteen counties that make up the Willamette River Basin, as well as representatives of the Governor's Office, the Oregon Water Resources Department, the Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, are involved to help to understand their needs and perspectives, to identify scenarios, and to interpret results. Working with these public officials, the team will help them translate the results of the research into planning and decision making processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team is preparing to disseminate Envision through some UNESCO HELP basins. In the outyears, the team will work with the UNESCO-IHE Institute for Water Education, to transfer Envision to researchers in UNESCO HELP basins, possibly including the Blue Nile in Ethiopia and the Olifants River in South Africa.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Intellectual Merit This project is evaluating how climate change, population growth, and economic growth will alter the availability and the use of water in the Willamette River Basin (WRB) on a decadal to centennial timescale. It is addressing three main questions: Where are climate change and human activity most likely to create conditions of water scarcity? Where is water scarcity most likely to exert the greatest impact on ecosystems and communities? What strategies would allow communities to prevent, mitigate, or adapt to scarcity most successfully? To address these questions, we have set five overarching goals: Model the system. Study the Willamette water system via a comprehensive, highly integrated examination of hydrological, ecological, and socioeconomic factors. Explain interactions. Identify and quantify the linkages and feedbacks among hydrologic, ecological, and socioeconomic dimensions of the water system. Identify vulnerabilities. Determine where and when climate change and human activities will create water scarcities. Compare alternatives. Evaluate a range of strategies that could enable this region to prevent, mitigate, or adapt to water scarcities. Simplify. Create a transferable method of predicting where climate change and human activities will create water scarcities in other regions and where those scarcities would exert the strongest impact on society. We are achieving these goals with the aid of Envision, an integrative tool for assessing alternative futures scenarios. Envision couples state of the art hydrological, ecological, and socioeconomic models within a framework that allows for policy analysis and comparison of different management strategies.   Broader Impacts As part of an "adaptive" co-learning approach, the team is developing a "Learning and Action Network" (LAN) of researchers, students, K12 educators, water resources practitioners, elected and appointed decision makers. Thegoals for the LAN are to: Inform model development and enhance advancement in science by incorporating the expertise and perspectives of water managers, stakeholders and decision makers in all project stages, Provide workshops and develop materials that will inform water management and planning decisions in the Willamette Basin, Provide learning opportunities for K12 teachers and students, university students and postdocs, particularly those from underrepresented groups, through courses, workshops, research experiences and the development of educational materials on water resources.   * What was accomplished under these goals (you must provide information for at least one of the 4 categories below)? Research during the projectÆs fifth year focused on: 1) completing development and calibration of Willamette Water Envision, our model of the Willamette water system and its key biophysical and socioeconomic components  2) running and analyzing a Reference Case scenario and 17 single variable alternative scenarios identified by the research team, and 3) developing and analyzing two multivariable alternative scenarios. These scenarios were developed with input from a Technical Advisory Group (TAG), a group of 25 regional stakeholders we convened to represent different water use and geographic sectors within the basin.
