<AbstractNarration>1049628&lt;br/&gt;DeVincent Wolf&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support for a workshop/symposium is proposed. This workshop, co-financed by the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) and the International Center for Environmental Implications of Nanotechnology (iCEINT) will engage material scientists, chemists, toxicologists, ecotoxicologists, environmental engineers and scientists, meteorologists, regulators, and other stakeholders of nanotechnology in a meaningful exchange of ideas regarding the sustainable development of nanomaterials and nanotechnology. Specifically, they propose a multi-day symposium at the 2010 Materials Research Society (MRS) Fall Meeting to provide a forum for exchange of ideas between young and established faculty from materials science and chemistry that are developing novel nanomaterials and the scientists addressing environmental issues and toxicological concerns with those materials. A key objective of this workshop is continuing dialogue toward formulating the framework for sustainable development of nanotechnology including concepts of green chemistry and policy. The workshop will also help to transfer techniques and approaches across fields and establish contacts among the next generation of researchers that will stimulate collaboration in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will cover several topics relevant to sustainable nanotechnology:&lt;br/&gt;1) Measuring nanomaterials and interfaces in biologically relevant conditions,&lt;br/&gt;2) Detection and quantification of nanomaterials in complex matrices,&lt;br/&gt;3) Predictive tools for assessing the nanoEHS risk of new nanomaterials,&lt;br/&gt;4) Biological model systems for nanomaterial EHS evaluation,&lt;br/&gt;5) Green(er) nanomaterials synthesis and manufacturing methods/LCA,&lt;br/&gt;6) Nanomedicine  lessons in engineered nanomaterial toxicity and safety, and&lt;br/&gt;7) Nanomaterials for environmental remediation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Award No. CBET-1049628  Materials Research Society  Symposium RR: Interdisciplinary Approaches to Safe Nanotechnologies  2010 MRS Fall Meeting, Boston MA during 11/28 &ndash; 12/3/10  Symposium Organizers   Corinne Chaneac, College de France, CNRS Stacey Harper, Oregon State University Gregory V. Lowry, Carnegie Mellon University Robert I. MacCuspie, NIST   Objective  As engineered nanomaterials provide a new range of material properties compared to their bulk counterparts, new environmental, health, and safety (EHS) risks must be addressed.  This provides new challenges and opportunities for materials scientists, ranging from developing new materials for environmental remediation to evaluating the safety of nanotherapeutics for cancer treatment.  The nanoEHS evaluation of nanomaterials should begin early in the research cycle by the pairing of nanomaterials scientists with biologists and toxicologists to achieve maximum scientific impact.   This symposium brought together the materials, environmental engineering, and toxicology communities to address these challenges with an interdisciplinary approach.  Invited Speakers  Ken Dawson, University College Dublin, Ireland Saber Hussain, Air Force Research Laboratory James Hutchinson, University of Oregon Asa Jamting, National Measurement Institute, Australia Jean-Pierre Jolivet, College de France, Paris, France Debra Kaiser, NIST Al Kennedy, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Jeff Morris, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Steven J. Oldenburg, nanoComposix Anil Patri, NCL: Nanotechnology Characterization Laboratory Vince Castranova, National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health James A. Smith, University of Virginia Robert Tanguay, Oregon State University Mark Wiesner, Duke University   Summary  With the aim of contributing to the sustainable development of nanomaterials and nanotechnology, the diverse scientific communities (materials scientists, chemists, toxicologists, eco-toxicologists, environmental engineers and scientists, metrologists, regulators, and other stakeholders of nanotechnology) are mobilized to establish the environmental, health, and safety (EHS) risks of the use of such materials and to define novel nanomaterials that will have as little impact on human health and the natural environment as possible.  One of the challenges of this research is to propose biological models to obtain reliable answers for the understanding of involved mechanisms.  R.L. Tanguay presented an approach that utilizes a dynamic in vivo zebrafish embryonic assay.  Results show the great potential of TanguayÆs strategy to deliver rapid, relevant, and efficient responses on nanoparticle impact on biological systems.  Besides the deployment of the EHS risk analysis tools, an important part of the work in this area is to identify the relevant systems of nanoparticles to be studied in accordance with the recommendations of national and internal governances and OCDE.  Silver nanoparticles largely used for their anti-microbial properties are particularly attractive since that lethal median concentration is closed to those of ionic silver according to a presentation given by A. Kennedy.       Last Modified: 07/22/2011       Submitted by: Sandra Devincent Wolf]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
