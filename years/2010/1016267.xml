<AbstractNarration>The investigators develop and apply efficient boundary integral methods for the motion of interfaces in 3D flow.  The methods address a significant difficulty in the numerical computation of fluid interfaces with surface tension or elastic forces in 3D flow. Such forces introduce high order (i.e., high derivative) terms into the evolution equations, which lead to severe stability constraints or `stiffness' for explicit time-integration methods.  Furthermore, the high order terms appear in nonlinear and nonlocal operators, making the efficient application of stable implicit methods difficult.&lt;br/&gt;The investigators' method relies on using the first and second fundamental coefficients of the surface as dynamical variables, and employs a special parameterization of the interface combined with an  analysis of the governing equations at small scales. This enables the efficient application of implicit time-integration methods for 3D flow. The investigators implement the method in canonical interface problems for inviscid fluids, including the Kelvin-Helmholtz, Rayleigh-Taylor, and water wave problems, and study the dynamics of inextensible elastic sheets in inviscid flow and vesicles in 3D viscous flow. Most importantly, they develop a version of the numerical method which uses domain decomposition or overlapping coordinate patches to describe the interface. This has the added benefit of providing a framework for the implementation of  spectrally accurate and spatially adaptive methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moving boundary problems occur in many diverse areas in, for example, fluid dynamics, materials science, and biology.  Specific examples include traveling ocean waves, growing cancer tumors,  beating hearts and moving cells and organisms. The investigators develop accurate and efficient `boundary integral'&lt;br/&gt;numerical methods for the simulation of moving boundaries in applications.&lt;br/&gt;Boundary integral methods are among the most accurate numerical methods for the simulation of moving interfaces, but are often inefficient when the interface is acted on by surface tension or elastic forces.  The development of  fast and accurate boundary integral methods for 3D interfacial flow with surface tension or elastic forces will be of great benefit in understanding existing applications and developing technology further.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, the investigator, David Ambrose, and Michael Siegel, investigated how to make efficient, accurate computations of 3D fluid motion problems in which surface tension is significant at a moving boundary.  Together with Svetlana Tlupova, they developed such an algorithm and provided examples of its application.  Ambrose, Siegel, and Yang Liu provided a mathematical proof of the convergence of a related version of this algorithm; this is the first convergence proof for a boundary integral method for 3D flow with surface tension.  Providing such a proof gives insight into the design of future numerical algorithms, and gives clues as to how to stabilize such methods in practice.  (Yang Liu was a postdoctoral researcher supported by this grant.)  Together with Jerry Bona and David Nicholls, Ambrose investigated an algorithm for the simulation of waves in water, known as the Craig-Sulem method.  The Craig-Sulem method starts from the Euler equations for fluid motion, but then makes an approximation to these, and then simulates the approximate equations.  Bona, Nicholls, and Ambrose have provided a mixture of proof and computational evidence that the approximate Craig-Sulem equations do not have certain good properties enjoyed by the full Euler equations; in particular, they have argued that the approximate model equations do not have well-posed initial value problems.  This indicates that the Craig-Sulem approximation method should be a subject for further research, and the method should be used cautiously.  Ambrose and Siegel are continuing research on this topic, and are working towards a complete proof of this ill-posedness property of the approximate model equations.  A graduate student, Shunlian Liu, has been supported in the course of this project.  She has completed a proof that in certain other physical cases, related to having an elastic sheet at the boundary of a fluid, the Craig-Sulem models do have well-posed initial value problems.  This is relevant for mathematical models of ice layers over the ocean.  Ambrose and Siegel have given a proof that the full equations of motion (based on the Euler equations) for such a hydroelastic wave have a well-posed initial value problem as well.
