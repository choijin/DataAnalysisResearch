<AbstractNarration>An award has been made to the University of Massachusetts Boston to organize a workshop for NSF BIO Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site Directors. The workshop is scheduled for March 18-20, 2010 in Arlington, VA. The goals of the workshop are to (1) address the challenges and opportunities presented by a common assessment tool; (2) share best practices in developing, implementing, and assessing Ethics/Responsible Conduct of Research training; (3) share ideas for improving individual program implementation; and (4) discuss best practices in student recruitment, development, and tracking, and mentor training. The goals will be accomplished through presentations and panel discussions by experts, through opportunities for discussion and networking among participants, through a poster session, and through a final report to be submitted to NSF summarizing the workshop findings. An existing website (http://www.bioreu.org) will be used to register participants, solicit poster abstracts, collect information from participants that will inform the development of a final agenda, and to identify individuals who volunteer to become facilitators, reporters and scribes for the breakout sessions. Over 150 participants are expected, and a Leadership Committee has been formed to assist in the planning. The PI, Robyn Hannigan, may be contacted at Robyn.Hannigan@umb.edu.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program supports the active research participation by undergraduate students in any of the areas of research funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF).  This project focused on developing and implementing resources to support principal investigator's who lead REU sites in the Biological Sciences.  Given that BIO REU programs, nationally, provide meaningful hands-on research and training to our future scientific leaders the 2010 BIOLOGY REU Workshop enabled community input into the development of new infrastructure to enable (1) assessment of student learning gains, (2) training in scientific ethics, and (3) travel support for students to present their research at scientific meetings.  We also developed and implemented a website (http://www.bioreu.org) that serves as a clearinghouse for REU PIs and students with opportunities and information for all users.  All of the activities associated with this award were aligned with the goals of enhancing communication and best practices through networking.   In addition to the workshop, website development, and development of new programs in assessment, scientific ethics, and travel scholarships for students the BIO REU Leadership Council (a nominated committee representing the breadth of BIO REU sites) participated in a number of student recruitment activities including the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science, the American Indian Science and Engineering Society, and Winds of Change.  A final report of the 2010 workshop is available at http://bioreu.org/downloads/Workshop_report_final.pdf.       Last Modified: 02/13/2012       Submitted by: Robyn E Hannigan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
