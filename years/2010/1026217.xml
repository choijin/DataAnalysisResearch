<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project will establish a commercial water disinfection system based on the use of light emitting diodes that would be appropriate for use in residential settings.  The Phase II effort will redesign the system so that the removal efficiency may be enhanced and the packaging of the system will be more versatile.  An enhancement of the efficiency would be accomplished by minimizing the optical loss.  The repackaging would be accomplished by changing the external casing for the device from stainless steel to plastic material and also encapsulating the light emitting diodes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of the project is the development of commercially viable and environmentally safe technology for UV water disinfection.  The primary market segment addressed through the work that will be performed under this Phase II effort is the microbial disinfection of water for point-of-use and point-of-entry applications in household systems, appliances, and remote and rural areas. Incorporation of innovative UV light emitting diode (LED) lamps in water purification modules will enable cost effective and environmentally friendly technology for water purification designed for a variety of water supplies including residential, remote, and emergency relief.</AbstractNarration>
