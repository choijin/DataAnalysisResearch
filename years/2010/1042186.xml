<AbstractNarration>OISE 10-42186&lt;br/&gt;Lakshmi Reddi&lt;br/&gt;University of Central Florida&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an international workshop on a paradigm-shift subject area to determine what can be learned from nature and transfer the new knowledge to technological innovations and transformative engineering applications.  The invited pool of experts will address energy conservation of indoor environments in a unique way - exploiting the recent advances in the behavior of plant and skin tissues on the one hand and stabilized earth construction and sensors on the other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop contributes to sustainable practices of engineering construction by developing a formal basis for using natural materials (earth-based and plant-based) in engineering construction.  It also directly addresses the issue of energy, which remains one of the key socio-economic and political challenges of our times, by attempting to understand energy-efficiency in the naturally-evolved biological systems and adopt that knowledge in engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop fulfills the program objectives of bringing together leading international (US, United Kingdom, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, India, Colombia and Venezuela) experts to combine complementary efforts and capabilities in areas of strong mutual interest.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This workshop was organized to identify research challenges and opportunities specifically focused on thermoregulatory analogies between plant systems, skin (human and animal), and soils.

The specific workshop objectives were: 1) to provide a common forum for science and engineering experts (from biology, plant, sciences, and mechanical/structural/geotechnical engineers) to outline state-of-the-art advances in thermoregulatory behavior of plants, skin, and soils; 2) to map the overlapping areas of the methods (parameterization, modeling, experimental techniques) and tools (sensors, etc.) used in these diverse research fields to study the thermoregulatory behavior; 3) to outline challenges involved in using soils (with or without plant fiber reinforcement) as thermoregulatory systems equivalent to plants and skin; 4) to identity research priorities and opportunities involved in exploiting the analogies in the thermoregulatory behaviors of plants, skin, and soils, such as innovative construction methods using stabilized soils; and 5) to develop a plan for educating graduates on this interdisciplinary research theme. The workshop included debates by two breakout groups of experts, one from the biological sciences (biology, neuroscience, and biomimetics) and the other from engineering fields (structural and geotechnical engineering, thermodynamics, architecture,and sensors).
