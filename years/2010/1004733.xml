<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, the principle investigator (PI) explored features of solutions of partial differential equations (PDE) with gradient constraints. In particular, he established smoothness properties of solutions of equations arising in stochastic control theory, where the underlying control processes have sample paths that are singular. The PI anticipates this work will allow control theorists to better study a wider class of models as the design of optimal controls in stochastic singular control depends on regularity properties of solutions.     The PI also studied a related eigenvalue problem, which appears in singular control problems involving the long time average behavior of random processes.  He discovered various qualitative properties of solutions of the eigenvalue problem and deduced two "minmax" formulae for the eigenvalue.  This research was instrumental to the PIÃ†s analysis of the small transaction cost, large risk aversion limit of a European option on several assets.     In Joint work, the PI also performed a study of infinity ground states, which are solutions of a PDE involving the infinity Laplacian and a gradient constraint. The PI showed that infinity ground states are not, in general, unique up to a multiplicative constant as previously thought.  In future work, he hopes to understand exactly which geometries admit a unique ground state.     The PI additionally examined PDE arising in the study of viscoelastic flows.  In joint work, he extended the well-known Beale-Kato-Majda condition to perfect viscoelastic fluids. The PI also established an analog of the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg partial regularity theorem to the viscoelastic Navier-Stokes equation with a damping mechanism.   This model is of interest as it was introduced in an approach to verify the global existence of weak solutions in the upper-convected Maxwell model for viscoelastic flows.
