<AbstractNarration>The fundamental goal of this project is to create and implement effective models to increase retention of academically talented, economically disadvantaged students known to be at-risk for non-completion of science technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors. The specific goal is to increase the numbers of predominately Kentucky, Southern Indiana and/or Northern Tennessee first-generation, women, and minority high school students as freshmen and community college transfer students through financial and academic support, enrichment opportunities, and facilitation in student career placement. Three cohorts of four-year students (18 total) and three cohorts of community college transfer students (21total) are being provided $6000 scholarships per year. The college has committed to providing scholarships to cohort students who maintain eligibility that allows them to complete their degrees after funding ends. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The college has collaborations with high schools and community colleges which are being used to recruit high school and transfer students into STEM programs. Retention of students is being improved through a program designed to provide students with a variety of academic, social, and career oriented programs. The comprehensive support program is relying on existing student support services and community partnerships to connect students to mentors (both faculty and alumni), peers, and professionals. Existing programs include freshman orientation, faculty advisement, undergraduate research, internships, practical experiences (i.e. pre-service teaching opportunities), work-study, grade monitoring, social and cultural activities, supplemental instruction, peer tutoring, and career counseling and placement services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project advances knowledge in STEM disciplines by enabling members of underrepresented and financially needy groups to achieve their educational goals. The comprehensive support program offers a rich learning environment that prepares students to enter the workforce or enter post-baccalaureate programs. Utilization of living-learning communities as well as faculty, peer and professional mentors is creating a supportive environment for scholars ensuring their academic success, retention, and timely graduation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: This program is broadening participation in STEM fields by providing support for first-generation college, women and underrepresented students. This program benefits society by increasing diversity in student population at the college, creating a strong and diverse workforce, and improving the regional level of educational attainment. In addition, students serve as role models in their home communities. Local employers are benefitting from a larger and more qualified applicant pool.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Kentucky Wesleyan College&rsquo;s NSF S-STEM program was designed to increase the number of academically talented, financially needy, first-generation, women and underrepresented STEM graduates. The fundamental goal was to create and implement effective models to increase retention of known at-risk groups for non-completion of STEM majors. The specific goals were to increase the numbers of STEM graduates within a population of predominately Kentucky, Southern Indiana and/or Northern Tennessee first-generation, women and minority high school students with demographics that otherwise would matriculate into community colleges.&nbsp; This program provided them and their community college transfer student counterparts with financial and academic support, enrichment opportunities, and facilitation in student career placement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Students were recruited into Kentucky Wesleyan&rsquo;s degree programs in biology, chemistry, physics, zoology, pre-engineering, mathematics (including middle and elementary schools math specialists), and STEM secondary education degree programs. &nbsp;Retention and graduation rates of at-risk freshmen and transfer students in STEM programs were increased by providing a suite of academic and social support programs based on our existing student support services as well as community partnerships that connected students to faculty and alumni mentors, peers and professionals. &nbsp;Kentucky Wesleyan&rsquo;s programming included freshman orientation, faculty advisement, a STEM transfer student seminar, grade monitoring, supplemental instruction, peer tutoring, and a variety of social and cultural activities designed to enrich the student experience and connect students to the STEM community and college.&nbsp; Professional development workshops, and pre-career hands-on experiences such as undergraduate research, internships, pre-service teaching opportunities, and /or work study jobs helped prepare students for STEM careers and graduate and professional programs in STEM fields.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Over the length of the grant a total of 50 students were accepted into the Kentucky Wesleyan&rsquo;s NSF S-STEM program, 29 of 50 (58%) have received a degree, completed the pre-engineering program, or remain at Kentucky Wesleyan in good standing working toward STEM degrees.&nbsp; Taking all majors, including non-STEM, into consideration, 43 of 50 (86%) have received a degree, completed the pre-engineering program, or remain in good standing working toward degrees at either Kentucky Wesleyan (33 of 50) or another institution (10 of 50).&nbsp; National statistics show that 60% of students that start in STEM majors do not finish in STEM and 80% of students classified as underrepresented students do not remain in STEM majors. &nbsp;&nbsp;Our results to date, indicate our S-STEM program success is better than the national average with 58% of the S-STEM Scholars completing or moving toward completion of STEM degrees.&nbsp; &nbsp;For our student population, women and first-generation students are our underrepresented groups.&nbsp; National statistics indicate the first-generation graduation rate is about 24-27%.&nbsp; Our S-STEM Scholar&rsquo;s first-generation graduation rate is 57% and is on track to equal 74% when the five first-generation students currently enrolled and making satisfactory academic progress toward their degrees graduate next year.&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, the national graduation rate for women is 65%.&nbsp; Our S-STEM Scholar&rsquo;s women&rsquo;s completion rate is 61% and is on track to equal 79% when the seven remaining female students who are enrolled and making satisfactory academic progress toward their degrees graduate next year.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Overall, Kentucky Wesleyan&rsquo;s NSF S-STEM program had 50% (25) of the funded students complete STEM degrees, 10% complete non-STEM degrees, 10% are maintaining satisfactory academic progress toward STEM degrees, 6% are maintaining satisfactory academic progress toward non-STEM degrees, 10% are maintaining satisfactory progress toward degrees major unknown, and 14% left college without obtaining a degree.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We recognize and applaud the achievements made by this group of students who overcame great adversity to achieve success.&nbsp; For example, the students who struggled academically, yet succeeded in STEM fields, the older than average single parent transfer students who were successful and now have STEM careers, the students who balanced work, school and family responsibilities and yet found time to complete a STEM research project or an internship, and the student whose family provided emotional support but had little financial capability.&nbsp; This student received their GED at 19 before entering the local community college.&nbsp; After receiving an Associate&rsquo;s degree the student transferred to Kentucky Wesleyan where the NSF S-STEM Scholarship greatly contributed to the attainment of a four-year degree.&nbsp; This student had an impressive work ethic and worked on campus as a lab assistant and off-campus as an intern at a local park.&nbsp; Immediately after graduation in May 2016 this graduate began working full-time at a position in their desired career area, and has now been accepted into a graduate program. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Students that would have become lost in a large university found a niche at Kentucky Wesleyan College.&nbsp; The nurturing and mentoring they received allowed them to succeed against some daunting barriers.&nbsp; These successful graduates diversify the workforce, improve the regional level of educational attainment, and serve as role models in their home communities. &nbsp;Likewise, local employers have benefited from a larger more qualified applicant pool.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/23/2017<br>      Modified by: Paula&nbsp;Dehn</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1059655/1059655_10104565_1503505318837_IMG_0266--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1059655/1059655_10104565_1503505318837_IMG_0266--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Presenting Research Results at the Kentucky Academy of Sciences"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1059655/1059655_10104565_1503505318837_IMG_0266--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Presenting Research Results at the Kentucky Academy of Sciences"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Two S-STEM Scholars are among the four students who presented their undergraduate research projects at the Kentucky Academy of Science</div> <div class="imageCredit">Evelyn Hiatt</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Paula&nbsp;Dehn</div> <div class="imageTitle">Presenting Research Results at the Kentucky Academy of Sciences</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1059655/1059655_10104565_1503505476176_IMG_0062--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1059655/1059655_10104565_1503505476176_IMG_0062--rgov-800width.jpg" title="STEM Faculty Student Lunch"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1059655/1059655_10104565_1503505476176_IMG_0062--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="STEM Faculty Student Lunch"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Creating a sense of Community within the STEM fields.
