<AbstractNarration>The effect of forest-based market opportunities on forest users is a central issue in conservation and development initiatives. Although economic theories presume that biological conservation can be achieved by demonstrating economic importance of natural resources, it remains debatable whether or not forest-based markets actually produce these results. On the other hand, studies show that forest products can contribute to livelihood stability by providing a source of insurance, security and income diversity. Viewing forest products as an accessible resource to local people, development initiatives often encourage community members to take advantage of forest-based market opportunities by learning new entrepreneurial skills. These initiatives may overlook, however, the complexity of human-environment relationships and the heterogeneity of knowledge, livelihood assets, and willingness to engage in forest products that exists among different social groups. Depending on their context and set of risks and opportunities, people can react differently towards taking advantage of available resources and market opportunities. This research explores how market opportunities affect livelihood strategies, decision making, and knowledge among traditional users, recently trained users, and non-users of buriti (Mauritia flexuosa) leaves in Maranh√£o state of Brazil. The intention is to use data collected through interviews to test hypotheses on the roles that individuals fill within the market, decision-making patterns for participating in markets, and knowledge transformation that occurs as livelihood strategies change. Results will include a typology of livelihood strategies, ethnographic decision models, and cognitive knowledge maps.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Although availability and management of natural resources is a global concern, many management decisions occur on the local level and social heterogeneity can greatly impact how these decisions are made. This study contributes to understanding the extent to which theories on human-environmental interactions, livelihood strategies, decision making and knowledge generation can be applied to emerging local markets and stratified forest user groups. As this study explores how development initiatives change user group profiles and affect local markets, research conclusions can add to community development theories and lead to more effective policies for improving livelihoods while maintaining forest resources. Among the study community, results can lead to more informed decision making regarding their forest-based livelihood strategies.</AbstractNarration>
