<AbstractNarration>Recent technological advances have enabled digital applications to move away from purely desktop and office settings to gain greater relevance in our everyday lives and spaces: homes, classrooms, public and cultural places, scientific laboratories and beyond. This has given rise to an increasing number of creative practices and research areas that seek to overcome the long-standing separation between the physical and digital worlds. The ACM Conference on Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction (TEI) serves as a gathering place for the interdisciplinary community of researchers, practitioners and theorists who work in this emerging field.  This award is in support of the second annual TEI 2011 GSC, to be held at the TEI 2011 conference in Madeira, Portugal in 2011. The TEI 2011 GSC serves to hone the research and design skills of a new generation of scientists, engineers, and designers who will shape the technological and socio-cultural landscape of the future as computing integrates more and more tightly into physical objects and spaces. The consortium program aims to increase participation in the tangible, embedded and embodied interaction academic community by providing mentorship for young scientists, researchers, and designers in this field, and by giving them the opportunity to meet and engage with more senior TEI researchers at the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on the success of the 2010 GSC the 2011 GSC will help to promote national and international collaborations that happen at the intersection of diverse fields and creative practices, from science and engineering, to social and cultural studies, to arts and design.  The TEI 2011 GSC will bring together students from a range of fields, including industrial design, arts, digital media, human-computer interaction and computer science, and opened their perspectives to each other's different practices and methods. The aim of the GSC is to encourage students to take a broad perspective on creativity and research that bridges the physical and digital worlds in the growing field of tangible embedded and embodied interfaces.  During the TEI 2011 GSC, students will be invited to present their work, and will have the opportunity to receive constructive criticism from diverse viewpoints by a panel of faculty mentors. In addition to this, they will also present their work in posters at the main conference, and their short papers will be included in the conference Proceedings and in the ACM Digital Library.</AbstractNarration>
