<AbstractNarration>This project provides a broad-based investigation into the presidential role in the federal grants process.  The project examines not only the effects of presidential influence, but the ways in which it occurs.  To do so, the investigator examines presidential influence, using original databases of federal grants from 1996-2008.  The first part of the project seeks to answer the question "Where do grants go?"  The relationship between the competitiveness of elections and the distribution of federal funds is exameined.  This analysis evaluates whether states that are competitivie in presidential elections-swing states-receive more grants.  The second part of the project examines whether swing states receive more federal funds druing distinct time periods, specifically as presidential elections draw near.  This section seeks to provide a more complete understanding of presidential influence in the context of elections.  Third, because some federal agencies are more open to political influence, the investigator examines how agency design and the number of political appointees within agencies affects the manner in which grants are allocated.  Finally, the investigator conducts interviews where responses from bureaucrats, interest group lobbyists and state officials are used to evaluate the mechanisms of executive branch influence in the grants process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the results will significantly advance our understanding of federalism, presidential elections, presidential control of the bureaucracy, and the influences and political pressures in the federal grant process.  This research provides a more complete understanding of the intersection of politics and policy in a manner that exposes its impact on the lives of every American.  Becasue individuals, companies, schools, hospitals, state agencies, and thousands of research facilities count on federal grants to provide services and information and advance knowledge, this study seeks to offer insight into a system that broadly affects society on a daily basis.  Through a comprehensinve analysis of the federal grants process and the external influences and pressures that influence public policy, this project will increase knowledge in the fields of political science and public administration.</AbstractNarration>
