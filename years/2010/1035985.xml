<AbstractNarration>This workshop is bringing together a selected group of experts and practitioners from the engineering, geosciences, and earth sciences communities.  The workshop participants are discussing and developing consensus about whether and how data-driven modeling and visualization approaches can best be used to improve hydrology education. Specifically, workshop participants are 1) identifying specific needs for cross-cutting data, modeling, and visualization digital resources that are valuable to the broader hydrology education community, 2) developing a strategy about how to bridge the gap between data-driven applications needed in upper division courses and those required in more general courses, 3) identifying key design criteria for a community cyberinfrastructure by which instructors can discover, download, publish, interconnect, modify, review, and collaboratively develop curriculum materials for data-driven cyberlearning related to hydrology, and 4) identifying the best ways to engage the larger community in the effective use of data-driven curricular materials and achieve broad dissemination, adoption, and use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is producing a report that serves as a starting point to build a larger community wide effort to harness the available research and teaching resources for developing and using geoinformatics modules in hydrology education. In addition, the report also identifies the shortcomings of existing resources, and identifies opportunities for future research and development activities to improve hydrology education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this grant was to bring a selected group of experts and practitioners from the hydrology, geosciences and earth sciences communities to develop an understanding of whether and how data-driven modeling and visualization approaches can best be used to improve hydrology education. This objective was accomplished by organizing two workshops. The first workshop, held in 2010, had the following objectives: (i) Identify specific needs for cross-cutting data, modeling, and visualization digital resources that would be valuable for the broader geosciences education community at the upper and lower division undergraduate hydrology education; (ii) Strategize on how to bridge the gap between data-driven applications in major-focus-area upper division undergraduate education and those in other levels of education (emphasizing lower division undergraduate and community college applications); (iii) specifying key design criteria for a community cyberinfrastructure by which instructors can discover, download, publish, interconnect, modify, review, and collaboratively develop curriculum materials for data-driven cyberlearning in the geosciences; and (iv) Identifying the best ways to train the teaching community on the effective use of data-driven curriculum materials, to achieve broad impact and dissemination of this approach. Based on the pre-workshop survey, and group discussions during the workshop, key findings include the following:  A community-based curriculum material development effort will be a worthwhile use of the communityÆs time and energy, if it is implemented such that incentives and cost/benefit balances motivate individual faculty members to actively participate (we need critical mass). Bridging the gap from lower-division undergraduate hydrology (usually qualitative hydrology) to upper-division undergraduate hydrology (which needs to be quantitative) is a key challenge. Any new cyberinfrastructures must connect with geosciences, engineering, and hydrology education infrastructures and communities that already exist, because some excellent work is already being done.  A focus on teaching hydrology concepts and modeling skills must be maintained, and a tendency to create "black box" methods avoided. Data visualization features are particularly desirable. Public domain data and toolsets are strongly preferred. Curriculum material cyberinfrastructures must be carefully implemented to maintain rigorous contribution quality and interoperability standards; this will be particularly essential if modules from different authors are to be combined in sequences to teach hydrology concepts. Module publication and search functionality is essential, but a more streamlined and accessible method of accessing context-specific and local hydrology data is also important, as is built-in assessment and feedback functionality for modules. Workshops and tutorials are the preferred methods of training for the new system. Integration with CUAHSI-HIS, HubZero, MOCHA, SERC, and NSDL systems is strongly supported as a best practice.   Since the conclusion of the first workshop, few education related projects were launched, through funding from NSF, to develop data-driven and place-based instruction material for hydrology. These projects tried to address some of the findings from the first workshop so a second workshop was held in April 2015 to develop plans to disseminate information related to educational projects in hydrology, and engage the broader community for the utilization of the newly available educational tools. The key outcome from the second workshop included a proposal to the Consortium of Universities for Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences, Inc (CUAHSI) to  organize a webinar series and virtual poster session on the topic of data-driven hydrology education. The webinar and virtual poster session will be held in September 2015. More details can be found at https://www.cuahsi.org/virtual-workshop-on-data-driven-hydrology-ed...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
