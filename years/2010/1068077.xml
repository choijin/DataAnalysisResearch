<AbstractNarration>The University of Buffalo-SUNY (UB) is planning to join the Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) entitled "Center for e-Design and Realization of Engineered Products and Systems (e-Design)" which currently is a multi- university center comprised of Virginia Tech (lead institution), the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, the University of Central Florida, and Carnegie Mellon University. The mission and vision of the existing e-Design Center is to research and develop methods tools that support the realization of a new design paradigm that can be used to develop new engineered products and systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;UB requests funding for becoming a site of the NSF Center for e-Design under the leadership of Professor Kemper E. Lewis. The NSF multi-university IUCRC for e-Design addresses the science and engineering challenges that limit the evolution of a new product/system design approaches that are essential for efficient, rapid and reliable design and manufacture in a highly competitive global environment. The University of Buffalo Site brings emphasis in product visualization and simulation, immersive environments, decision networks, information technology to support design decision making, and motion simulation to the existing center. The research efforts at UB will support the e-Design center's long term goal of establishing a new paradigm where products/systems are conceived and produced in a cyber-enabled domain with the full participation of all key stake-holders including designers, manufacturers, engineers, OEMs and consumers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A multi-disciplinary team including eight academic departments is engaged. The research will have broader impact through a strong cohort of industry partners, including medical, foods and infrastructure companies. The research thrusts identified will produce tools useful to a wide range of industries. The proposed effort at UB will contribute to the successful development and preparation of graduate and undergraduate students. Students associated with the Center will receive career development opportunities, attendance of and presentations at interdisciplinary conferences and workshops, as well as training in the ethical conduct of research. The addition of UB also contributes to the diversity of the Center, with 38% of participating faculty being women. The PI and other UB faculty will continue to recruit underrepresented students, including partnering with a number of university programs aimed at providing research opportunities for these students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The discrete mechanical products industry, a key driver for the U.S. economy, generates more than $1 trillion in domestic revenues each year.  Product development has become an enormously complicated process as discrete product manufacturers are under pressure from customers (and the market) to move away from the traditional make-to-stock production model to a build-to-demand model. These market pressures are impacting three key elements of competitiveness: time to market, cost, and quality.  Time to market requires engineering processes (and business processes) to be highly optimized with efficient collaborations among people and seamless data and information flow between engineering tools.  Cost pressures drive manufacturers to seek to subdivide and distribute engineering and manufacturing activities throughout the world to minimize costs, while high quality products dictate that the design process be multi-disciplinary with inputs from manufacturing, distributors, customers, suppliers, maintenance providers, recyclers, etc.  The result is ?globalization? in which the engineering, manufacturing, selling, servicing, and recycling of high technology products are distributed across the world.  To meet this growing challenge, U.S. industry needs more innovative product design and realization paradigms which will significantly reduce a product?s cost, shorten its time to market, and take advantage of a growing global environment.  Since 70% of a product?s acquisition costs are committed at the design stage, novel design processes and technologies are critical for quickly delivering cost effective, high quality products.  By taking advantage of the confluence of several key factors, the Center for e-Design has developed a number of next generation design and realization paradigms.  The Internet, sensors, high-speed data networks, increased computational power, and the evolution of engineering design and analysis tools, have set the stage for a fundamentally new e-Design process where engineers can efficiently work collaboratively together from anywhere in the world.
