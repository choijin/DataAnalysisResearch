<AbstractNarration>The goal of this proposed national thematic Center for Ocean Science Education Excellence-Technology and Engineering for Knowledge (COSEE-TEK) is to innovate and adapt approaches to improve the quality, availability, and impact of ocean science education by linking ocean science, technology, and engineering to catalyze learning and communication of STEM topics for teachers, students, scientists, and the public. To achieve this goal we propose the following objectives: 1) provide effective activities that enhance knowledge, pedagogical insights, community connections and experiences for the research community in formal and/or informal education environments to strengthen broader impacts; 2) develop innovative resources to improve the quality, availability, and impact of ocean science and technology in education efforts; and 3) foster communications and collaborations amongst the ocean science, technology, education and public outreach communities. Each of these objectives will be met through a series of innovations and activities that continually seek to link ocean science and technology with education and outreach. We will showcase ocean technologies with emerging information and communications technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in its important focus on the tools and technologies that are critical to ocean science. From the earliest research vessels to SCUBA and occupied submersibles to remote sensing and sampling to observing systems, ocean technologies and engineering have been essential to the advancement of ocean science. The Center will seek to develop innovative teaching resources derived from ocean science and the exciting new technologies being applied and developed to address a host of socially relevant topics. Furthermore, this project will catalyze learning and communication opportunities for researchers, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) educators, both formal and informal, students and the public. The Center will also evaluate the effectiveness of a number of approaches (Technology Teams, lectures, Technology Institutes) and media (webinars, online encyclopedia of technology) to deliver and disseminate science and technology content. The intellectual merit is based on the technology and engineering that enables ocean science and integrating these with education, outreach and workforce development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical and engineering information being conveyed through COSEE-TEK activities and materials will be presented in a way that is easy to understand for any layperson, from students' parents, to the visitors at an Aquarium, to the senior citizen attending a public lecture. A diverse network of partners will be utilized to affect broader impacts of COSEE-TEK's work. Many of the activities of this proposed COSEE will use information and communications technology, allowing for global participation and access to resources. We will partner with the American School for the Deaf to address the needs of underrepresented deaf and hard of hearing and efforts will be made include educators from the deaf community and ensure that educational materials can be readily used by deaf persons. We will forge additional partnerships with the National Association of Black Scuba Divers, the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation. We will engage ocean industries in our Technology Teams and work with the Connecticut Center for Advanced Technology to integrate the needs and opportunities for ocean technology in the development of STEM workforce. An undergraduate course module on the history of ocean technology will be developed and made available online for other colleges, universities and educational facilities to use. The audience will include people entering the work force, as well as their mentors, who will gain valuable knowledge to help prepare them not only for careers in ocean science, but in computer science, the shipping and transportation industry, electronics, acoustics, data management and transfer, data telemetry (satellites, radio waves, microwaves), and more.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Center for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence &ndash; Technology and Engineering for Knowledge was one of fourteen COSEEÆs established by the National Science Foundation on a competitive basis.   The overarching goal of all COSEEÆs was to foster stronger linkages between ocean scientists and educators working in both formal and informal settings.  COSEEÆs either served a region of the country or addressed a specific theme on a larger scale.  The fundamental intellectual merit contribution of COSEE-TEK was that it utilized ocean technologies and their pivotal role in enabling discoveries and advancement of knowledge about the ocean as the means to connect scientists and educators.  COSEE-TEK supported a number of activities, summarized below, that allowed teachers, students and the public to directly experience ocean science through the lens of technology.  Among COSEE-TEKÆs formal education activities were week-long professional development institutes for middle and high school teachers that introduced them to a range of ocean technologies including ocean observing systems, ocean optics and gliders.  Teachers worked with UConn faculty and graduate students as part of a Technology Team and learned how ocean technologies addressed the challenges of studying the ocean.  At the same time the faculty learned about the challenges facing teachers as they teach Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) in todayÆs classrooms.  This professional development was expanded to include community college faculty on the east coast and COSEE-TEK worked with COSEE-Pacific Partnerships and COSEE-NOW to conduct a week-long ocean technology training workshop at the Oregon Institute for Marine Biology for community college faculty from around the country. Another accomplishment was to provide similar technology-based learning opportunities for teachers and students at the American School for the Deaf in West Hartford, CT to broaden their participation in STEM.  COSEE-TEK also collaborated with the five universities that comprise the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Northeast Alliance (Northeastern University, University of Connecticut, University of Massachusetts, University of Rhode Island and Worcester Polytechnic Institution) to expose underrepresented undergraduate students to ocean science and technologies.  Through the Ocean Science and Technology Challenge (OSTC) LSAMP students worked closely with a COSEE-TEK mentor to design, build and field test ocean technologies, learn about careers in ocean science and engineering and develop 21st Century skills including problem solving, teamwork, communication and leadership.  Pre/post evaluation of the OSTC indicated that it had positive impacts on the underrepresented undergraduate studentsÆ consideration of ocean science or engineering as potential career options.  This desirable societal outcome was in part responsible for the LSAMP Northeast Alliance to incorporate the OSTC as one of its core programs for students in its recent continuation proposal to NSF to sustain this effective approach to broadening participation in STEM.  One of COSEE-TEKÆs most significant broader impacts promoted ocean science and technology to the general public by working with its informal science education partner the Mystic Aquarium/Sea Research Foundation to host an annual Ocean Science and Technology Day (OSTD).  The OSTD featured UConn faculty, technicians and graduate students displaying numerous ocean technologies that they use to address major issues facing the ocean.  Many of these exhibits were hands-on or interactive, engaging both adults and youth, during busy summer days at the Aquarium when attendance was  2500-3000 visitors.  COSEE-TEK also modified or developed several low cost, build it yourself ocean technologies that teachers and students could build and use in the classroom or at a nearby coastal area.
