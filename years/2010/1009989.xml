<AbstractNarration>The Principal Investigator and collaborators will carry out an observational program to obtain very high resolution imaging of main belt, near-Earth, and Trojan asteroids, using adaptive optics (AO) systems on 8- and 10-meter telescopes. The objectives of this program are to (1) search for binary asteroids and obtain orbits for newly discovered and known binaries; and to (2) obtain sizes, shapes, albedos, and rotation poles (spin axis directions) for roughly 25 large main-belt asteroids through repeated imaging that resolves the objects themselves. They will also coordinate and carry out observations of stellar occultation events, and use software that they have developed to simultaneously fit the imaging, occultation, and available light-curve data. By pushing the current limits of adaptive optics, this work will contribute to improvement of AO technology. The investigators will also endeavor to include non-professional astronomers in their occultation observations, and will conduct outreach activities including public presentations and preparation of exhibit materials for the Onizuka Science Center in Kona, Hawaii.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of our program was to acquire images of asteroids with astounding clarity using some of the world's largest telescopes.  The use of large telescopes (larger mirror sizes) benefits us in two ways: 1) the larger the mirror, the sharper are the pictures that we can  acquire, and 2) the larger the mirror, the more light can be gathered from any particular source and this means we can look at fainter objects than with a smaller mirror.  The goals of our program were 1) to search for moons around asteroids, and 2) with the sharp images, we can determine the size and shape of the asteroids themselves.  We use a relatively new technology on these large telescopes called "adaptive optics" or AO.   This technique effectively detects the distortion in an image caused by the Earth's atmosphere, and then tries to restore the image to what it would look like without the atmosphere.  It does this by using the equivalent of a "fun house" mirror to remove these distortions.  The result is an image that is as sharp as some space-based telescopes, but without the  high cost of a space telescope.  We can also make use of larger mirrors than can be placed in space, giving yet sharper images, as described above.`  Why do we want to study asteorids?  First, asteroids represent relatively primitive bodies that have been unaltered, for the most part, by processes that affect major planets, such as weather or volcanic or tectonic processes.  That means that they may still retain hints of the early solar system and contain information about how our solar system formed.  The main process that affects asteroids is collisions among asteroids.  Collisions between asteroids and the surfaces of planets or the Moon have also occurred over the billions of years since the birth of the solar system.   We see evidence of this process in the craters left on the surface of Earth's moon. Most, but not all, such craters on Earth have been erased by weather and geological processes.    Thus, we know that collisions have played a critical role not only in the evolution of asteroids, but also in the histories of the planets, including Earth.  And collisions are still important when we consider the hazards that impacts by asteroids may still pose to life on Earth.   How can searching for asteroid moons help us understand asteroids and collisions?  Partly due to our program, we know that asteroid moons can exist and that they can take many forms and are around many types of asteroids.  Many of these moons were formed by collisions.   Collisions can be modeled by computer programs and may be studied on small scales in laboratories. But nothing of the scale of asteroids (some hundreds of miles across) can be esimulated in any lab.  So these moons give us a giant real-life laboratory to study collisions by asteroids, how they may affect Earth, and how dangerous they may be to Earth.  How can determining size and shape of an asteroid help us understand asteroids and collisions?  Asteroids that have been hit by other asteroids may retain markings (giant craters) that are remnants of the impacts such as those on the Moon.  Unlike the Moon, however, the asteroids are small enough, that these impacts can actually change the shape of the asteroid, showing large gouges or facets.  We can detect these and try to understand the history of impacts.     To help us understand the internal composition of asteroids, we need to know both the mass ("weight" or heft) of an asteroid, and its volume (how much space does it take up).  The mass can be determined if it has a moon or from a close flyby of a spacecraft. The volume can only be determined by high quality images, such as those in our program.  The term "density" is used to tell how an object weighs for its size.  For example, iron is very dense, while rock is less dense, ice is less dense still, and styrofoam would be yet lower density.  Thus, the density (mass divided by volume) gives a clue as to the composition of the a...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
