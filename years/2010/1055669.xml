<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this EArly-Concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is to engage novel interdisciplinary perspectives as it aims to study radio propagation and performance coupled with characterization of absorption losses through representative soil mediums to facilitate reliable estimation of permissible underground network structures using currently available chip transceivers.  The extension of wireless sensor networks to underground applications has the potential to be highly transformative as it addresses numerous pressing societal challenges, such as condition monitoring of buried infrastructure, improved mine safety, precision agriculture, and covert border protection.   While field studies of limited scope have demonstrated the feasibility of underground data communications using terrestrial sensor motes, practical solutions such as power amplification, mesh networking, and galvanic energy harvesting have yet to be investigated.  &lt;br/&gt;This research investigates absorption loss estimates derived from dielectric measurements specific to sub-1GHz chip transceivers used predominantly in wireless sensor networks.  The research aims to provide uncertainty bounds for simplified path loss estimates and to propose empirical corrections based on experimental observations to facilitate reliable design of underground wireless sensor network topologies and network protocols.  In addition to soil parameters, radio transmission factors including carrier frequency, modulation format, transmission power, and data rate are examined for influence on underground signal propagation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outcomes of this project could yield a powerful and low-cost solution to monitoring a variety of geo-structural phenomena thereby improving spatial density of subsurface sampling and minimizing intrusiveness.  Improved classification of dielectric absorption through soil-water mediums may contribute to improvement of advanced impedance-based, non-nuclear methods for soil density determination as well as aid in RF-based subsurface imaging techniques.  The successful execution of this project would facilitate the use of UWSNs to address national concerns associated with monitoring and maintenance of buried infrastructure.  The project also develops a broader awareness of multi-disciplinary science and technology in education and research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This EArly Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project supported the development of underground wireless sensor networks through experimental investigations conducted under controlled laboratory conditions as well as in representative in-situ field soils.  The integrity of buried infrastructure, such as energy pipelines and municipal water and wastewater systems, is increasingly a concern as the aged condition of these large-scale critical resources presents challenges to management and resilience.  Research undertaken in this project will aid in the planning and extension of wireless structural health monitoring systems, which have been transformative to long-term condition assessment and asset management of aboveground infrastructure such as bridges and towers, to underground applications.   Research activities and accomplishments included the development of a large-scale laboratory testbed for underground wireless sensor network applications where a matrix of over 300 characterization tests have been conducted to date.  In developing this testbed, the researchers successfully leveraged low-cost commercial off-the-shelf chip transceiver technology to build a platform demonstrating potential to address pressing infrastructure needs with near-term feasibility.  Additionally, this low-cost technology was integrated with soil characterization sensors and a spectrum analyzer in an automated supervisory system to facilitate characterization of variable soil parameters and radio signal propagation measures.  Statistical models were constructed from both laboratory and field measurements obtain by the underground wireless sensor networks to quantify the effects of radio carrier frequency, digital modulation format, transmission data rate, node-to-node transmission distance, and burial depth on the communication channel.  These models will aid in the design of underground wireless sensor networks for buried infrastructure monitoring applications and provide an empirical basis for energy-aware power management and routing protocols for such systems.  Current and future work is aimed at developing empirical relationships and processing techniques to leverage the effects of soil-specific parameters, such as moisture content and density, on radio propagation measurements for advanced underground sensing.   A long-term vision is to deliver decentralized sensor networks capable of mapping or tomographically imaging important phenomena for structural safety and stability, such as cavities and voids, stress distributions, and changes in such measures over time.
