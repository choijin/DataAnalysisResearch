<AbstractNarration>Research shows that learning that occurs outside the classroom can be a critical STEM career catalyst. In fact, 75 percent of science category Nobel Prize winners indicate that their passion for science was first sparked in non-school, independent learning environments. The NSDL Backpack provides tools and services that increase the numbers of learners using high-quality, relevant NSDL content in science competitions. The potential impact is significant since nationally, science competitions engage more than 9 million K-12 students every year. The NSDL Backpack prototype demonstrates how a learner-centered service, using web-based tools and resources, and partnering with a national science competition, can increase utilization of the NSDL.  Using a website and tools designed by a learner focus group, the Backpack is making NSDL assets, selected and aligned to the challenges by the Destination ImagiNation (DI) curriculum mangers and Backpack staff, available directly to participants in the DI science challenge. The Backpack pathway is contributing to the intellectual understanding of how students use technology to learn outside of formal, teacher-directed settings. By increasing the number of learners using NSDL content (only 23% of NSDL searchers in a recent survey were students) and by studying their needs directly, the NSDL Backpack is informing and fostering developments at other NSDL pathways and other NSF research projects, as well as broader research into how self-directed learners learn.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research shows that learning outside the classroom can be a critical STEM career catalyst. In fact, 75 percent of science category Nobel Prize winners indicate that their passion for science was first sparked in non-school, independent learning environments such as science competitions and afterschool STEM programs.  The NSDL Backpack prototype tests a learner-oriented website that allows students to search for content in the National Science Digital Library (NSDL).  Currently, most NSDL services (pathways) focus on serving teachers as the primary user-community for NSDL content. This is a critical gap and, properly addressed, can significantly increase the numbers of learners attracted to, engaged with and sharing STEM content both in formal classroom-based and informal, independent learning settings. Development and implementation of the Backpack prototype enabled researchers to test the potential for a student-oriented and driven web service to increase interest in and use of NSDL resources.  Primary findings: Instead of competing for teacher time and low expectations, the Backpack compliments student interest for independence.  Students feel they are more twice as prepared to work independently of teachers than teachers perceive them to be.  It is likely students are more prepared than teachers believe &ndash; and it is certain they are likely to pursue independent activities.  Students placed a high value on vetted resources such as those found in the NSDL.  For teachers and students, the deeper the alignment with learning needs (or school curriculum and assignments) - the greater the perceived value of the content and the lower the resistance to use.   Resource search models that enable content to be correlated at very granular levels e.g. for individual assignments and return reputable resources will have lower barriers to use and adoption than those that return content uncorrelated to specific user needs and that are not validated in terms of quality.
