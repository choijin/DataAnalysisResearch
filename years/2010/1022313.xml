<AbstractNarration>The speech humans produce every day in casual conversation is incredibly varied, with sounds and whole syllables changed or missing. American English listeners notice nothing unusual when hearing such "reduced speech" in context; however, second-language speakers and even listeners from other English-speaking countries often find American English reduced speech difficult to understand. The current research centers on how speakers and listeners use reduced, spontaneous speech across languages and dialects, and on how such speech may hinder or even facilitate communication among speakers of different backgrounds. The project will test speakers of Dutch, Spanish, Japanese, and three dialects of English to determine 1) to what extent reduction is language-specific and part of the grammar rather than random or physically-determined variability, 2) whether the sound patterns of the native language influence phonetic variability at the level of spontaneous speech in the second language, 3) how strongly dialect affects understanding of reduced speech, and 4) how degree of proficiency, years of experience, strength of ethnic/national identity, etc. affect production and understanding of reduction. The overarching theoretical question is, what is part of the learned grammar and what is low-level variability. Furthermore, the project will provide data on theoretical questions about exemplar models of speech perception, mutual effects between speakers' first and second languages, and articulatory planning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through globalization, immigration, and telecommunications, humans in the modern world often interact across language backgrounds. Native English speakers interact with non-native speakers and speakers of different English dialects interact with each other. The current project addresses how humans handle the variability of conversational speech in communicative situations. Detailed knowledge of natural, reduced speech, gained through this project, will impact speech technology and how humans interact with computers by voice, benefiting speech synthesis and automatic recognition of spontaneous speech. Because the project includes extensive investigation of English proficiency and language background for the experiment participants, it will also shed light on what factors make it easier or harder for non-native listeners to understand conversational speech in their second language. This project forms a synergistic international collaborative group to answer these questions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The basic means for humans to convey information is through speech.  When people talk in casual speech, as in spontaneous conversations, they usually do not pronounce all of the sounds of a word.  For example, one speaker we recorded who said "Tuesday night when we were chillin' in the spa" pronounced "chillin' in the" as something like "choonnuhn."  This portion by itself sounds unintelligible, but in context, one clearly hears the intended words.  This sort of pronunciation is called "reduced speech."  Reduction can also affect a single sound: one might say a sequence like "at a" or "it if" with little or nothing left of the "t" sound.  This project investigated how speakers of several languages pronounce sounds in their casual conversational speech as compared to their careful speech.  Furthermore, the research team investigated how speakers whose native language is not English pronounce sounds in conversation in both English (second language) and their native language.  The project also tested how native and non-native listeners of English and speakers of various English dialects understand reduced pronunciations.  In the context of globalization, people all over the world who do not speak English natively or who speak other dialects of English (British English, New Zealand English, Indian English, etc.) hear American English through television.  Americans travel abroad or interact with immigrants to the U.S. in English.  Because of immigration and globalization, nearly everyone interacts across language boundaries.  One finding of our research is that even when speaking carefully, speakers typically reduce some of their consonants.  "Capitalist" might be pronounced more like "capillist."  Therefore, listeners are regularly faced with the problem of perceiving reduced speech.  Past research has focused almost entirely on careful speech, but the majority of the speech that humans hear during a day is casual speech.   The experiments included speakers of eight language groups:  Arizona English, Canadian English, New Zealand English, native Japanese speakers and native Dutch speakers learning English as a second language, Spanish-English bilingual speakers who grew up bilingual in the U.S., native Spanish speakers who immigrated to the U.S. as adults, and native Spanish speakers living in Mexico learning English as a second language.  Canadian English provides a test case of a dialect rather similar to American English, while New Zealand provides a quite different dialect.   The results of the experiments show that speakers of all language groups analyzed so far (some are still under analysis), in both English and other languages, reduce consonants more in spontaneous conversation than in carefully pronounced speech.  They show though that all groups reduce their consonants even in careful speech more often than expected:  even when people read words one at a time clearly, not all consonants of a word are fully present.  We also found that all groups analyzed thus far find it more difficult to understand reduced pronunciations than clear pronunciations, even though the reduced pronunciations are more common in daily life speech.  Further, the results show that speakers of other dialects of English (Canadian and New Zealand) are quite good at understanding even reduced American English speech, despite the dialect difference.  Non-native listeners did find it more difficult to understand American English reduced speech, particularly if they were less proficient in English.  The results also show several effects of the native language on how learners of English pronounce conversational speech.  For example, Spanish-English early bilinguals (who were raised bilingual) appear to slightly overshoot how much reduction monolingual English speakers produce, pronouncing their English consonants with even more reduction.  They pronounce some of their Spanish consonants in a slightly more extreme way than Spanish speakers who grew up sp...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
