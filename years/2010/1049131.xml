<AbstractNarration>The intellectual merits of this work involve clarification of the unique dynamics near oceanic boundaries and quantification of their effects on essential oceanic processes like boundary stress, mesoscale dissipation and diapycnal mixing followed by adiabatic isopycnal dispersion. The primary unsolved dynamical problem of physical oceanography involves the 'dissipative' closure of western boundary currents, which is the primary focus of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem of Topographic Control of the Gulf Stream with particular application to its separation is being addressed. This project is built on the hypothesis that boundaries exert fundamental controls on the ocean circulation in general and the Gulf Stream in particular. These processes are poorly represented or absent from current climate models. The main focus of the proposed research is on sub-inertial excitation of inertia-gravity waves and activation of the sub-mesoscale by boundary processes, with a view towards their potential vorticity and lateral stress implications. The driving hypothesis is that these processes dominate Gulf Stream separation and downstream development. This is a critical aspect of ocean circulation that all current models struggle with, regardless of resolution. The result is the introduction of strong biases in the model North Atlantic that is likely to affect climate projection on the decadal time scale. Observations also suggest an important role for topography in promoting mixing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: Preparing for climate change is the most pressing problem currently facing society. This project is addressing a significant shortcoming of the oceanic component of coupled climate models. The mesoscale and boundary currents are the dominant kinematic features of the ocean and are controlled in all existing models by  parameterizations. This project is designed to build into these parameterizations physically based models of boundary interactions, thereby enhancing the fidelity of climate prediction and eliminating a major bias found in current ocean circulation models. Since the new parameterizations will be implemented in the Community Climate System Model, they will be widely available to the general climate community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Climate models predict what the future world will be given global change.  Importantly, they include interactions between the ocean and the atmosphere.  The most important way these two media interact is through the exchange of heat, and in this exchange the ocean is the 800 lb gorilla.  The Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic, from the viewpoint of the atmosphere, is a river of hot water that warms the atmosphere at its bottom.  It is essential to have ocean models that put the Gulf Stream at the correct location, but models to date have often failed to do this, with catastrophic consequences for their climatic predictions. An example of the error in sea surface temperature in the North Atlantic from one ocean model appears in Fig. 1, and shows anomalously hot water offshore of New England and cold waters out in the middle of the ocean. These are symptomatic of a numerical Gulf Stream that separates from the coast far north of Cape Hatteras, which is where it separates in the real ocean. The temperature errors are several degrees in Centigrade, and as such are the largest temperature errors in the model.  Inaccurate atmospheric heating ensues, with important effects on, for example, the atmospheric jet stream path.       Our project was designed to study why the Gulf Stream separates where it does, with the hope of putting the proper physics into the ocean side of coupled climate models so that this error is avoided.  What we have found is that Gulf Stream separation is controlled by a particular feature of the 500-1000m ocean bottom located south of Cape Haterras.  In that location, the continental shelf goes from a relatively gentle slope at the northern border of Florida to a very steep cliff just south of Cape Hatteras.  Numerical experiments where we have modified this feature of the topography exhibit greatly different Gulf Stream paths.  Examples are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 where we compare the path of the Gulf Stream in a model with the correct topography (in which the Gulf Stream separates in agreement with observations) to one where this steepening has been removed. In the latter case, the Gulf Stream hugs the coast well beyond Cape Haterras and moves into the deep ocean much too far to the North.      Existing coupled climate models have traditionally lacked this steepening due to practical restrictions on how detailed they can be.  We have hopes that this can be somewhat remedied by rewriting how such models interact with the ocean bottom.         Last Modified: 09/02/2015       Submitted by: William K Dewar]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
