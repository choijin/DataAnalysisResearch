<AbstractNarration>This project is engaged in improving the long-term retention and graduation rates of the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) majors through the deployment of three educational improvements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. A new STEM-oriented First Year Experience (FYE) to immediately immerse incoming students into methods of scientific inquiry while developing a personal connection to the institution and community. STEM-FYE is designed to fit within the framework of existing general education core courses, immerse students in learning communities that focus on quantitative skills, biological principles, and the process of science, within the overarching topical curricular theme of environmental sustainability.  &lt;br/&gt;2. A coherent and expanded structure for recruitment and support designed to increase the diversity of STEM majors.  Academic advising of potential STEM majors has been improved and there has been a deliberate integration of mentoring, research, and service-learning opportunities that are available through a variety of campus programs.&lt;br/&gt;3. Building on MESA (Mathematics Engineering Science Achievement) - a 40-year old program supported by the state of California and private industry to improve the achievement of minorities in STEM. This is being accomplished by bringing MESA's best practices to the larger population of STEM majors, including creation of new academic workshop courses for gateway classes in Chemistry and Physics, additional peer and professional mentoring for STEM-student learning communities, and additional undergraduate research opportunities for under-represented students in the physical sciences and technical fields.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Progress towards the bachelor's degree in STEM is being tracked at the individual student level. External evaluators from WestEd are assessing project success in achieving the learning outcomes defined for the STEM-FYE course and the academic workshops, as well as meeting benchmarks for improving the retention and graduation rate of STEM students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The task of increasing the nation?s talent pool in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields is paramount to maintaining America's position in the global economy. In 2012, the President?s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology called for an additional one million STEM graduates over the next decade to supplement the number of STEM professionals currently in the workforce or in progress towards a degree. Since STEM disciplines represent just over a third of all bachelor?s degrees awarded in the U.S., many efforts have been focused on attracting students to these areas of study, as well as retaining students already declared as STEM majors.  With the support of the National Science Foundation's STEM Talent Expansion Program (STEP), Sonoma State University's S3: STEPping Up STEM at SSU (NSF Award 1068445) project in the School of Science and Technology focused on improving the long-term retention and graduation rates of STEM majors by providing them with an inquiry-based educational experience based on the multi-disciplinary theme of sustainability, improving STEM student support services, and providing additional opportunities for mentored research.  Research tells us that undergraduates are more likely to seek a STEM degree if they developed an early interest in science, performed well on college entrance exams, and/or felt engaged and challenged in their high school coursework, yet the talent pool of STEM professionals also may be impacted at the postsecondary level through curricular innovation and institutional policies aimed at increasing recruitment and retention. Some of these efforts have demonstrated clear associations with a student?s decision to pursue a STEM major, including additional exposure to science coursework in her first year of college? recognition of the relevance of STEM to her life and community? her perception of competence in skills related to scientific inquiry? experience of success in the process of learning science? and a vision of attainable career prospects in the field.  At Sonoma State University, one of the 23 campuses in the California State University system, faculty in the School of Science and Technology, along with colleagues in Student Affairs, developed and are now offering an interdisciplinary STEM First Year Experience (STEM-FYE) program investigating environmental sustainability with the goal of increasing STEM graduates. Faculty from biology, chemistry, computer science, geology, physics, philosophy and mathematics developed the curriculum that has continued to evolve with feedback from all stakeholders including students, internal and external advisory boards, and external evaluators from WestEd.   The STEM-FYE course, A Watershed Year, engages first year students in examining issues pertaining to the local Russian River watershed &ndash; a place-based emphasis linking students to our campus, region and many campus and community partners. The yearlong course assists students in developing critical skills of scientific inquiry and creating a concept of STEM identify. The course fits into existing general education core curriculum and meets graduation requirements in quantitative reasoning, biological principles with laboratory experience, and critical thinking.
