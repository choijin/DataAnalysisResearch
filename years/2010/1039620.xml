<AbstractNarration>The University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras is awarded a grant to support participation in an "Ideas Lab" workshop focused on innovations in biological imaging and visualization.  Modern biological research is increasingly enabled and empowered by enhanced imaging technologies.  Very high-resolution microscopy systems to continental-scale imaging platforms combined with high-throughput data streams produce an enormous challenge for research involving image-based data.  The outcomes of this workshop are aimed at addressing and improving our ability to analyze, interpret, compare, and represent biological image data for dissemination or meta-analysis.  A range of interdisciplinary scientists will be invited to participate. Participants will be selected on the basis of preliminary proposals describing their interests, experience, and expectations that attend the formation of collaborative research teams at the Ideas Lab.  The interdisciplinary, collaborative, and immersive workshop is expected to result in the formulation of project ideas that address challenges of using image-based data in biological research.  After the Ideas Lab, selected project ideas will be invited to submit full proposals to the National Science Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Substantial efforts are directed towards the constitution of a participant group with diversified interests, expertise, affiliations, and demographics to ensure the greatest potential for identifying appropriate image processing challenges and creative project prospective for solving the challenges. The utility to a broader community of researchers has transformative potential to increase the rate of data analysis, synthesis, and dissemination that make image based data broadly useful.  Positive impacts on research are coupled to societal benefit of enhanced and accelerated research programs.  In addition, the opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral training during the conduct of the projects identified at the Ideas Lab workshop will help to foster the generation of a broadly trained cadre of interdisciplinary scientists able to apply their expertise across multiple fields of inquiry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  14.00      Eduardo Rosa-Molinar (University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras),  Principal Investigator (PI) and Lead Mentor of the Travel Grant to Support Participation of "Ideas Laboratory" (hereafter "Ideas Lab") Workshop Activity, worked with  four additional mentors and a consulting firm to offer the "Ideas Lab," a workshop  based on the Creative Problem Solving (CPS) concept. Intellectual merit:  The intellectual merit of the Ideas Laboratory (hereafter Ideas Lab) is that it assisted in identifying image processing challenges and in developing creative team approaches to addressing those challenges by bringing together individuals with diverse interests, expertise, affiliations, and demographics. The interdisciplinary, collaborative, and immersive workshop aided in the formulation of research project ideas to address challenges that limit the utility of image-based data in biological research. Broader impact:   The development of a collaborative interdisciplinary framework that enables scientists of diverse disciplines and backgrounds to communicate effectively and to work together will impact a broader community of researchers by increasing the rate of data analysis, expanding the use of comparisons among  different image datasets, and making image-based datasets more broadly useful and understandable, and, thereby, benefiting society by enhancing and accelerating research programs.  In addition, the opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral training during the conduct of the projects identified at the IBIV Ideas Lab workshop have assisted in fostering a broadly trained cadre of interdisciplinary scientists ready to apply their expertise across multiple fields of inquiry.  The success of this facet of the project became obvious at a meeting hosted by and integrated into the Histochemical SocietyÆs 63rd annual meeting held March 21-23, 2012 at the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole, MA.
