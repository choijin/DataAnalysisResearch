Broader Impacts. This research provided new insights about the dynamical behavior of medically relevant biochemical reaction networks.  Also, the investigator took leadership roles in conferences and seminars related to the award.  Additionally, the investigator served as a mentor as part of the Women and Mathematics Mentoring Program of Durham County, directed an undergraduate student research project as part of the Duke Program for Research for Undergraduates in the math department, and gave five lectures in the University of Chicago REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates).
