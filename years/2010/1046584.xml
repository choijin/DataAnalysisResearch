<AbstractNarration>Representation theory covers fast range of research in mathematics, and has close relationships with geometry, number theory, topology, combinatorics as well as mathematical physics. In order to survey current research and bring in new blood into the field, the International Conference series on Representation Theory was initiated in 1998 in Shanghai by a group of mathematicians from China and the US, since then American mathematicians have actively participated in each of the ICRT.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for American mathematicians to attend the 5th International Conference of Representation Theory&lt;br/&gt;(ICRT) during August 9--14, 2010, in Xian, China where specialists from Asia, Europe and United States will gather chart future research directions.&lt;br/&gt;Xian, China has been&lt;br/&gt;the cross point of cultural exchanges for more than 2000 years.&lt;br/&gt;The current award contributes to new scientific exchanges between mathematicians from three continents and also promotes deeper mathematical research in representation theory.&lt;br/&gt;The conference offers a great opportunity for young researchers to follow the current stage of active research in representation theory.</AbstractNarration>
