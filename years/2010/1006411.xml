<AbstractNarration>Technical: This project aims to (i) develop new, controllable, and scalable methods of growing monolayer graphene films on metal single-crystal substrates, involving self-limited growth of graphene films by the catalytic decomposition of hydrocarbon molecules at the surfaces of metals with low carbon solubility at the growth temperature, (ii) develop a fundamental understanding of the growth mechanisms, (iii) explore the effects of substrate geometry on graphene growth, (iv) develop methods for their transfer to other substrates such as SiO2/silicon, (v) investigate the thermal, optical, and electrical transport properties of the large-area graphene films, and (vi) thoroughly characterize the geometric and electronic structure of these films.&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with high technological relevance. It is envisioned that large-area graphene films be used in a host of important applications such as for transparent electrically conductive films, for chemical and biological sensing, for nanoscale electronic devices, in micro- and nano-electromechanical systems, and as heat diffusers for thermal management. The project includes a significant program in education and outreach, including research training for undergraduate students and high school teachers, additions to course materials in classes taught by Professors Ruoff and Ventrice, and curriculum development. There is a further strong education component in the intensive training and development of graduate students in a multidisciplinary environment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Graphene, which is a single atomic layer of graphite, has several unique properties that could possibly be exploited for the development of devices and sensors with an enhanced performance over ones based on conventional bulk semiconductor materials.   For instance, the mobility of the electrons in graphene has been measured to be greater than 2 x 105 cm2/V&middot;s, whereas the mobility of electrons in silicon is less than 1.4 x 103 cm2/V&middot;s.  Therefore, graphene-based electronic devices have the potential of operating as speeds more than a thousand times faster than those based on conventional semiconductors.  Another interesting property of graphene is that it has a very high transmittance for visible light.  This property could be used to develop flexible transparent conducting layers for applications such as solar cells and touch screen displays.   One of the limiting factors for developing graphene-based devices and sensors is that it has proven to be very difficult to produce single layer graphene films with large lateral dimensions that are also single crystalline.  The presence of grain boundaries in graphene will cause scattering of the carriers (electrons and holes).  One of the most popular methods of producing industrial scale quantities of graphene is by the catalytic decomposition of hydrocarbon molecules on Cu foil substrates.  Although this technique is shown to produce graphene films that are a single atomic layer thick over more than 95% of the foil, the films typically have a very large number of rotationally misaligned grains.  The primary goal of this research project was to obtain a fundamental understanding of the catalytic processes by which hydrocarbon molecules decompose and crystallize into graphene on Cu and Cu alloy substrates.  Ultimately, the objective  was to use the information obtained from the study of the graphene growth process to develop techniques for producing single-crystal graphene films with large lateral dimensions.  Intellectual Merits:  Several major contributions were made in understanding the mechanisms by which hydrocarbon molecules dissociate to deposit carbon atoms on the surfaces of Cu substrates, which subsequently crystallize to form graphene films.  In particular, it was discovered that under conditions where the sublimation of Cu atoms can be suppressed, single-domain epitaxial films of graphene can be grown on the Cu(111) surface.  In other words, a process for synthesizing single crystal graphene films over a large lateral area with a low defect density has been found.   Broader Impact:  By showing that single domain epitaxial films of graphene can be grown on Cu(111) substrates, it is now possible to grow nearly defect free graphene films.  This will allow the development of a new class of devices and sensors, such as high-speed analog devices for communications applications, digital processors for computers, and high efficiency solar cells.  The educational component of this research project has resulted in the training of students in the emerging field of nanoscience.  Over the four years of this grant, five graduate students, five undergraduate students, and six high school students have made significant contributions to this research project.  This has resulted in two Ph.D. dissertations and one M.S. thesis directly supported by this grant.  In addition, two other graduate students are in the final stages of the Ph.D. research that was initiated during the active period of this grant.
