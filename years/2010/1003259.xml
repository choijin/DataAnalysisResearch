<AbstractNarration>The Tech-Explorer catapult project delivers to students in secondary school a mathematics curriculum integrated with an innovative project-based laboratory experience. Students use power and hand tools to make and assemble parts into a small catapult during class time. Upon completion, students compete with their catapults.  The project incorporates "just in time" mathematics coupled with a hands-on experience similar to what a manufacturing or repair technician might do on the job. To strengthen student learning outcomes, the project 1) creates two instructional modules to teach mathematics concepts integrated into making a catapult; 2) connects the modules to California education content standards; 3) tests the modules at six high schools and evaluates learning outcomes; and 4) delivers an in-service summer institute for teachers on project-based learning. Tech-Explorer advances understanding regarding the effectiveness of integrating academic concepts with hands-on projects as a means to increase motivation for learning. Additionally, the project provides students with an experience by which they can gauge their interest and aptitude in STEM education and careers. Project outcomes and curricula are disseminated to secondary and post secondary educators through the in-service summer institute. A searchable Internet database of applied academic lesson plans furthers project-based learning research and implementation, as well as widely disseminates outcomes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     TECH-EXPLORER: ENGAGING STUDENTS IN STEM EDUCATION AND TECHNICIAN CAREERS PROJECT OUTCOMES  In 2010, Sierra College won a $150,000 National Science Foundation (NSF) Advanced Technological Education grant (DUE 1003259) to infuse algebra into the Tech-Explorer learning experience where students transform industrial materials into a functioning catapult using a mill, lathe, drills, and other common industrial tools.  The project emphasized attracting girls and women to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) careers and made a special effort to bring Tech-Explorer to a variety of schools and socio economic levels:  urban, suburban, rural, alternative, court ordered, as well as Sierra College Mechatronics classes.   During the project, a total of 306 students over 11 events experienced the math-infused catapult-building project; and a total of 32 faculty members participated in three workshops. Through the Tech-Explorer catapult events, students experienced how a technician, engineer, or product designer uses math on the job.  Faculty members participating in the workshops learned how to teach using project-based learning with a theme: mathematics is fun, useful, and has to be practiced.  Learning objectives were that students will:  Experience what it is like to be a technician in a manufacturing or repair environment; Practice applying decimals, fractions, and reading a scale; Experience the concept of a parabolic curve, and the equation, as it relates to a catapult ball height, velocity, and distance;  Know how a parabolic curve applies to everyday products; Understand that an object launched into the air (with no other forces besides gravity and air resistance) will follow a parabolic path on its way back down to the ground;   Know a parabolic path is dependent on the angle at which the object is launched;  Know there are formulas that can be used to find things such as maximum distance, optimal angle, and maximum height; and Generate a parabolic equation from data gathered through hands-on experiments.   As the project team integrated a parabolic equation lesson (associated with a launched ballÆs trajectory) into the Tech-Explorer catapult fabrication unit, it was clear that many students were not prepared to understand this equation due to a lack of understanding of the Seven Essentials of mathematics (measurement, fractions, ratios/proportions, probability, decimals, percent, and geometric reasoning). Consequently, the project team experienced, first hand, what the National Mathematics Advisory Panel stated in their 2008 report &ndash; the lack of understanding of fractions is pervasive and an obstacle to further mathematics progress. As a result, a pivotal decision was made to add a refresher exercise on fractions, decimals, and reading scales before a catapult fabrication event.  It was at this point that the project took on the challenge to measurably improve student understanding of the Seven Essentials through engaging project-based learning strategies.  Major Findings   The lack of understanding of fractions and other critical algebra foundations is an obstacle to comprehending a parabolic equation and must be addressed. Students will engage in mathematics when they see there is a use for it.  A master teacher is a key component of delivering new education concepts. Preparing teachers with hands-on math-related projects is a significant opportunity to change how math is taught. Math concepts must be practiced over the course of a semester. Checking work must be emphasized to reflect industry quality control practices.   Teachers involved with this project were enthusiastic about the engaging hands-on lessons; the opportunity for students to use a variety of tools and materials as they applied math; and the exposure to technical career pathways.  The broader impact of the Tech-Explorer project is threefold: 1) project outcomes were designed to be transferable to diverse educational settings; 2) th...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
