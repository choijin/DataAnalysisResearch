<AbstractNarration>This project evaluates the impacts of war on presidential power and public policymaking.  It takes as its starting point Clinton Rossiter's "axiom of political science," to which scholars ranging from Edward Corwin to John Yoo have assented, that "great emergencies in the life of a constitutional state bring an increase in executive power and prestige, always at least temporarily, more often than not permanently." To investigate the theoretical and empirical underpinnings of this "axiom," this project examines whether during periods of war (in particular, World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War, Gulf War, and the post-9.11 wars in Afghanistan and Iraq) Congress is more likely to enact, and the courts are more likely to approve, elements of the president's domestic and foreign policy agendas.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The primary objective of this project is to examine the overall impact of war on the president's capacity to advance his policy agenda at home.  Along the way, though, it will consider a host of ancillary questions: Do all wars influence presidential power equally?  Do wars have comparable effects on presidents' domestic and foreign policy agendas?  When the nation transitions from war to peace, is presidential power restored to its pre-war state?  Or, instead, do advances made during war persist long after the war's end?  Who within Congress and the judiciary is especially likely to vote differently during war than during peace?  And who is more likely to cling to their pre-war voting habits?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most previous research on this topic consists of case studies, often richly detailed, on particular wartime actions that presidents have taken. Few efforts, however, have been made to systematically gauge the willingness of either Congress or the courts to support presidents as the nation moves into and out of war. This project therefore creates (and in some cases extends) four datasets. Two of these datasets focus on the courts, considering challenges at every level of the federal judiciary to presidential initiatives taken during peace and war. Two more datasets focus on Congress, tracking members' roll call voting behavior and budgetary outlays in times of war and peace.  Crucially, each of these datasets reveals a different dimension of the policymaking process.  Collectively, then, they constitute the most systematic and thorough evaluation of wartime presidential power that has ever been conducted. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project creates datasets that address scholars' longstanding interests in lawmaking and inter-branch relations. Though the project focuses on the relevance of war, both the datasets and tests that it develops can easily be adapted in order to scrutinize the influence of any number of factors-public opinion, the economy, different political alignments, etc.-on judicial and legislative responses to executive requests and initiatives specifically, and the policymaking process more generally. All of these data will be made publicly available.</AbstractNarration>
