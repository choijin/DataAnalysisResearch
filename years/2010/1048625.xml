<AbstractNarration>1048625&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Jin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to develop novel thermoelectric materials for use in prototype thermoelectric modules to promote the cost-effective conversion of waste heat in vehicle exhaust systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This proposal addresses four elements that are critical for successful implementation of thermoelectric devices for waste heat recovery from vehicle exhaust. These include development of new thermoelectric materials, system-level modeling, heat sink development, and reduction of thermal and electric resistances at material-material interfaces. The thermoelectric materials of interest are silicides, in which the lattice thermal conductivity of both the p- and n-type material will be reduced through nanostructuring, hence increasing the efficacy with which the material will perform in waste heat recovery scenarios. Once developed, the new material will be incorporated into thermoelectric modules, and the modules will be installed on a 6.7 liter diesel engine to measure system performance under realistic operating conditions. A system-level model will be developed and utilized to identify opportunities to further increase and optimize the overall design. Material properties will be measured at the PIs institutions as well as at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The successful development and implementation of new thermoelectric materials and module designs will improve fuel economy and reduce emissions. Graduate students will be involved in the research. Video course modules specific to thermoelectric waste heat recovery will be developed and disseminated via the Internet for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students. Outreach to a broad segment of the local population will be conducted.</AbstractNarration>

With the use of new approaches such as nano- or complex structures to suppress the lattice thermal conductivity and resonant doping to enhance the power factor, the peak figure of merit (ZT) value of some of these bulk materials has been improved from the long-held record of unity to the current state of the art that is about 1.5.

The objective of our NSF/DOE collaborative project is to achieve high-performance TE devices based on low-cost metal silcicide materials that are abundant on earth, and yet hold promise for achieving a ZT value comparable to or higher than the state-of-the-art over the higher temperature range between 300 K and 800 K relevant for vehicle waste heat recovery.  Based on our fundamental research results that suggest the lattice thermal conductivity of p-type higher manganese silicides (HMS, MnSi1.75) nanowires can be suppressed from the already low single-crystal bulk values by a factor of 2-3 to the amorphous limit in bulk materials without considerable reduction in the power factor, we have developed several strategies to synthesize bulk nanoscale or nanostructured HMS materials to enable their high performance and large-scale TE applications: 1) We have successfully developed a vapor phase conversion method to synthesize HMS nanowires starting from electrochemically etched silicon nanowires; 2) we have further developed an even larger scale synthesis of HMS nanomaterials using the reduction of manganese oxide and silicon oxide  nanomaterials in molten salts; 3) we have also discovered Cu3Si as a minor phase that may be generated as a suitable nanocomposite with HMS when the molten silicide mixtures are quenched, and we have prepared a series of HMS-Cu3Si nanocomposites and measured their thermoelectric performances in collaboration with Prof. Li ShiÆs group at U. of Texas-Austin; 4) finally, we have synthesized phase pure HMS single crystals using chemical vapor transport and found that HMS samples that were made from spark plasma sintered undoped grounded powers of these HMS single crystals display high thermoelectric performance.
