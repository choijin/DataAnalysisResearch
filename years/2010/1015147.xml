<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There exist many naturally occurring and engineered peptides that bind to and disrupt cell membranes resulting in the cellÆs contents leaking out and/or the peptides actually entering the cell.  These peptides are termed "membrane active peptides" because they specifically target the lipid bilayer, the major component and foundation of the cell membrane.  As researchers begin to explore the possibility of engineering peptides that can elicit a specific biological response, membrane active peptides are generating an increasing amount of attention as potential antimicrobials and/or drug delivery vehicles.        My research is focused on the use of lipid bilayers constructed on flat substrates as a model of a cell membrane for the purpose of characterizing membrane active peptide structure and function.  I sought to use a complementary technique that would provide structural details, such as pore diameter and protein conformation, as well as visualization of protein function.  Under the guidance of graduate student Luo Dan and Dr. Yinlin Sha of the Peking University Department of Biophysics, I am grateful to have learned the intricacies of using atomic force microscopy (AFM) for imaging peptide interactions with lipid bilayers in an fluid environment in real time.  AFM was able to determine local bilayer thicknesses in the presence of peptides, allowing us to correlate membrane peptide activity and structural events in the bilayer.  Amylin, a membrane active peptide suspected to play a role in ParkinsonÆs and other diseases, was observed to disrupt and eventually dissolve the lipid bilayer.        Because a mechanistic understanding is still lacking, it is not currently possible to predict how a peptide will interact with a lipid bilayer.  Similarly, it is difficult to engineer a membrane active peptide for a particular biotechnological application.  The work done this summer goes towards finding a convenient means of accurately identifying the manner by which certain peptides interact with cell membranes such that they can ultimately be engineered for therapeutic purposes.
