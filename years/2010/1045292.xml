<AbstractNarration>This  RTG project involves the members of topology and geometry group at UCSB, with PIs Daryl Cooper, Xianzhe Dai, Darren Long, Marty Scharlemann, Guofang Wei, and Dave Morrison (senior personnel), and with additional training and internship opportunity provided by Microsoft Station Q headed by Mike Freedman, including Matt Hastings, Kevin Walker and Zhenghan Wang.  The project aims to offer an enriched training experience in geometry and topology at the post-doctoral and graduate student levels in Santa Barbara.  The program will fund three graduate students and two post-doctoral fellows as well as three undergraduate students  throughout most of the academic year.  In addition, the PIs will put in place an enriched curriculum which includes a program of minicourses as well as the opportunity for this group to participate in a summer REU in topics in geometry and topology which will be open to undergraduates across the country.  The group has made great efforts over the years with its emphasis upon advising and mentoring to build a supportive, intellectually stimulating environment for graduate students and post-docs; they hope to use the  RTG program to improve the program still further.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the RTG funds the PIs will be able to offer an enriched academic  more broadly based research and teaching experience at both the graduate and post-doctoral levels.  It will be used for new PhDs to establish themselves as reseachers and educators and for graduate students to broaden their education in geometry and topology through a research program augmented by establishing new mini-courses and internship opportunities.  Talented and motivated undergraduates will be recruited to the program through the REU program, with special emphasis directed towards enhancing the group's already excellent record with women, as well as drawing on students from a culturally diverse area, namely Southern California.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This RTG project offered an enriched training experience in geometry and topology at the post-doctoral and graduate student levels in Santa Barbara. Below we list the some of the highlights of our RTG program.  Postdoctoral Training   Two RTG postdocs were hired and successfully completed their training through faculty mentoring, collaboration in designing and implementing the mini-course program, collaboration in graduate student mentoring, supervising undergraduate research etc. Both are now tenure track assistant professors, at Syracuse University and Florida State University respectively.  Our mini-course program provides excellent training and professional development for our RTG postdoctoral researchers and graduate students in general. This new activity involves undergraduates, graduate students, postdocs and faculty members in a stimulating environment to explore major and current research topics. It offers a unique forum for learning, communicating, interacting, and mentoring and builds a supportive, intellectually stimulating environment for undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs.   Graduate Student Training   A total of 13 graduate students were supported by RTG funds. Among them 4 were funded with longer term supports while others were shorter term RTG fellows. Among the longer term fellows one is now graduated and is a postdoc at a research university; one decided to transfer to Yale; the other two are finishing their PhD next year.  As mentioned above, graduate training in RTG are carried out with an enriched curriculum which includes a program of mini-courses, RTG seminars, graduate student seminar/colloquium. In addition, six distinguished lecture series as well as two conferences were organized.   Undergraduate Research   Even though our emphasis is on the postdoc and graduate training, the program still have an undergraduate research component, in cooperation with REU and College of Creative Study at UCSB.  A total of 7 undergraduate students were supported by RTG. At least 5 have gone on to graduate programs and 2 of them are finishing their PhD next year.   The Mini-course Program   A total of six mini-courses were created, designed and implemented via the collaboration with our RTG postdocs and the six PI/CoPI's (and senior personnel). The topics were chosen according to the timeliness and relevance to the current major research trends which also reflected the interests of RTG postdocs and the collaborating faculty. They were broadly attended by our graduate students as well as advanced undergraduate students and is an essential part of our RTG program.     In addition travel support were provided for more students and postdocs attending conferences and having visitors. In the last few years the number of graduate students and postdocs in topology and geometry  has doubled.           Last Modified: 12/02/2018       Submitted by: Xianzhe Dai]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
