<AbstractNarration>The goals of this Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) in Engineering program at Temple University entitled "NUE: A Sustainable Urban Environment Advanced by Engineers Empowered with Nanotechnology", under the direction of Dr. Svetlana Neretina, are two-fold: 1) the broad inclusion of a nanotechnology component within the engineering curiculum and 2)to provide undergraduate engineering students with a hands-on experience directed towards the use of nanotechnogies in advancing a sustainable urban environment. Nanotechnology modules will be added to a minimum of eight courses, exposing every student in the Temple University College of Engineering to nanotechnolgy.  A course entitled "Nanotechnology: The Path to a Sustainable Urban Environment" will also become the College's first course dedicated to nanotechnology.  Students will gain hands-on experience through research internships, Senior Design Projects and five laboratory teaching modules in the areas of water purification, transportation and renewable energy.</AbstractNarration>
