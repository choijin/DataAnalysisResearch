<AbstractNarration>The focus of this STEP project is on retention.  PRIMES - Partnership for Retention Improvement in Mathematics, Engineering, and Science - is a multi-college collaboration at the university that is intended to unite faculty from the College of Arts &amp; Sciences, the Speed School of Engineering (Speed), and the College of Education and Human Development in tackling identified hurdles that contribute to poor retention (and thus low graduation rates) in undergraduate STEM programs. There are two primary components (or strands). The first strand focuses on the transformation of teaching and learning in STEM courses. STEM tutoring in the freshman year is one of the hallmarks of activities in this strand. It directly impacts novice STEM undergraduates in science-track introductory courses, and indirectly impacts the more senior STEM students as well as STEM faculty through activities that make use of Undergraduate Teaching Assistants (UTAs) and faculty who train the UTAs as well as interact more with students. The second strand targets improved retention by implementing University-wide and discipline-specific community building activities that foster STEM students' sense of identification with STEM departments. Ultimately, the goal is to increase the number of Bachelor's degrees awarded in biology, chemistry, geosciences, mathematics and physics in the College of Arts &amp; Sciences by 25% by 2016 and to increase the number of Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Engineering awarded in the Speed School by 25% by 2016.</AbstractNarration>

Research on the UTA strand explored impacts on novice STEM students having UTAs, the faculty utilizing PRIMES UTAs, and on the UTAs themselves.  Impacts on student achievement, retention, and science identity have been disseminated in peer-reviewed journals, STEM disciplinary and educational conferences, and served as the research focus of a PhD dissertation in Science Education.     Impacts on STEM students in UTA-led courses varied more dramatically than did those for the UTAs themselves. Impact data are methodologically strongest for the Chemistry Dept. that is most familiar with UTAs and thus ready to use them effectively from the very beginning of the project.

STEM Identity &ndash;students were substantially more likely (Cohen?s d effect size = 0.54) to self-identify as a "STEM person" if supported in a UTA-led course vs. GTA-led. This includes developing stronger rapport with UTAs vs. GTAs (Cohen?s d effect size = 0.38) as part of that identity-building (Philipp, Tretter, &amp; Rich). There was a statistically significant UTA dosage effect. Students that were enrolled in UTA-led recitations scored higher on a combined section final exam.   Impacts on STEM faculty having UTAs indicated an increased awareness of incorporating best practices in their own teaching. Qualitative feedback from focus group interviews included statements like:  "Being involved with this process has encouraged me to innovate in my classroom and share ideas with colleagues. No more chalk and talk&hellip;" "I use questioning techniques, metacognition, and different exercises in class, especially with difficult concepts."   "I?m more aware of metacognition and how to promote metacognition."     Impacts on UTAs include:  Cognitive benefits (1) stronger metacognitive approaches to their own learning spontaneously reported by 61/99 UTAs; (2) deepening of their foundational STEM content knowledge due to their teaching of that material spontaneously reported by 50/99 UTAs (Philipp, Tretter, &amp; Rich).  Pedagogical/Communication benefits &ndash; dramatically strengthening the ability of UTAs to communicate ideas and concepts to others. This includes 60/99 reporting substantial improvement across content-specific domains using a variety of pedagogical strategies explored during their UTA course. It also includes 50/99 highlighting more generalized communication skills such as public speaking in front of groups of people (Philipp, Tretter, &amp; Rich). Affective benefits &ndash; reporting a much stronger sense of identity and connection to their department and the faculty in their department (Philipp, Tretter, &amp; Rich).   Over the course of the project, the University?s STEM enrollment underwent an expansion and the availability of our PRIMES UTAs have enabled the University to meet enrollment pressures in introductory level labs and lectures. This benefit, combined with the demonstrated benefits to our STEM students, has convinced the University Provost and Dean of the College of Arts &amp; Sciences to institutionalize the PRIMES UTA program in key STEM departments with funding for a Director, Assistant, and approximately 95 UTA stipends each year.  NSF-STEP has enabled the University of Louisville to develop and refine a STEM student-centered retention strategy that can be replicated by other institutions working to improve STEM student teaching and learning.
