<AbstractNarration>Central Washington University (CWU) and five community colleges (Edmonds Community College, Highline Community College, Green River Community College, Wenatchee Valley College, and Yakima Valley Community College) are implementing a Phase I NSF Noyce Scholarship Program for the purpose of recruiting  and educating STEM majors and STEM professionals to become science and mathematics teachers. Over five years, 44 SMART Scholars are being prepared to teach, and 70 freshman or sophomore SMART interns are participating in research or academic service learning experiences to interest them in teaching. High priority is placed on recruiting students that reflect the student populations found at the 16 high needs partnering school districts, and partnering community colleges who, as teachers, will provide good role models for the students at these schools. After graduating, Scholars are mentored by both a STEM educational college faculty member and a teacher mentor through the SMART Scholar Induction Program.</AbstractNarration>
