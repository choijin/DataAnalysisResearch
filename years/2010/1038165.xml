<AbstractNarration>The objective of this EFRI-SEED project is to develop a set of new switchable dyes and polymers as the basis for electrochromic windows (ECWs) and energy-harvesting (EH) ECWs which substantially reduce cooling/heating loads and increase human comfort.  An secondary objective is to develop a partner methodology for moving towards the design of zero-energy buildings that transfers this new technology into educational programs for both the academic and building design communities. The project will develop EH-ECW technology by combining the merits of electrochromic window and dye-sensitized solar cell technologies for dimming control and to generate power to operate not only the ECWs but also other electrical systems.  The researchers will study the fundamentals of sensor/controller systems for optimal use of the EH-ECWs in a given room, and the consideration of environmental life cycle impact into EH-ECW technology development and dissemination.  The integration of EH-ECW systems into an autonomous building system is the basis for a new concept called "locally harvesting and locally used." The material systems studied promise substantial improvements over existing systems and will parallel component development with the use of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA).  The LCA will form an overall framework to bring together the research and expertise of an interdisciplinary team including technology development and educational integration. The researchers will develop models to forecast environmental impacts for scaled fabrication sequences, performance for a variety of building types with the proposed ECW/EH-ECW systems and locations, and demolition systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will investigate the use of EH-ECWs to generate a substantial portion of the energy used by buildings, thus reducing the impacts of central energy generation, and to increase visual comfort and building envelope performance resulting in healthier, more productive indoor environments, as well as to smooth the transfer of the above integrated technology to residential and commercial building design and the construction industry, targeting the $20B window market. This team plans to interact with the existing NSF centers, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, UW laboratories, a local architectural group and window company, the Seattle Science Center, and the University of Ulster (UU) as a foreign collaborator.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FY 2010 EFRI-SEED Topic that supports this project was sponsored by the US National Science Foundation (NSF) Directorates for Engineering (ENG), Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS) and Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE), and Computer &amp; Information Science and Engineering in collaboration with the US Department of Energy (DOE) and the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</AbstractNarration>

Commercial buildings in the United States use 18% of the total energy consumption each year. Among them, 26% was spent on the air-conditioning. Windows make up approximately 13% of wall area in new residences, 50% in large office buildings.  By allowing solar beam in during winter and blocking it during summer, we can control the throughout of radiant energy, and reduce the significant amount of electricity consumed by heating and air conditioning.  This can be realized by using one promising technology based on electrochromic window (ECW) and  energy-harvesting electrochromic  window (EH-ECW), a combination of ECW and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Windows are a key building component in a residential and office housing, which has multifunctionality; (1) see-through it outside objectives, (2) blocking or inviting outside air, manual control of room temperature, (3) blocking strong sun lights with and without curtains, (4) blocking outside cold air in winter mode. As to (4), the heat transfer through the window area provides the largest heat loss as compared with other area made of thicker building wall materials which are often thermally insulator. The conventional design of the temperature control inside windows in a house, is use of curtains in blocking outside lights and preventing from the flow of heat from inside as well as air conditioning.       House windows also receive large amount of solar energy per day. It would be advantageous if the window area is used for harvesting such solar energy. However, the current solar cells attached on the windows exhibit dark color permanently. Then, the see-through function of windows is lost due to dark, non-transparent status of the current solar cells.  In today energy conscientious society, it would make sense for us to design a new window system which can perform the original functions of windows discussed above and new energy harvesting capability.     In this NSF-EFRI project , we have designed a set of new ECWs where the transmittance of the window can be changed from dark color (either blue or green) and to transparent stage, thus, controlling the solar heat gain coefficient. We also designed a new EH-ECW  where three key components are used; (i) organic polymeric dye, (ii) the electrolyte made of Cobalt couple, and ECW color changeable polymer (PProDOT-Me2).  The key performance data of the EH-ECW are, solar power conversion efficiency of 4.5% and the change of transmittance of 34%.  Ideal placement of the above ECW and EH-ECW may be that the top most windows are based on the EH-ECW, and the bottom most windows are made of ECW so that the bright sun lights coming through the top windows can be blocked by tinted color of the EH-ECW, while functioning as solar cells (i.e., DSSC), and we can see through the outside landscape through the ECW located at bottom. Then a building with such ECWs and EH-ECWs will become truly zero-energy building.          Last Modified: 04/20/2016       Submitted by: Minoru Taya]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
