<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: Luminescent solar concentrators collect and concentrate sunlight for use in solar power generation. By replacing a large area of expensive photovoltaic cells with an inexpensive polymer concentrator, luminescent solar concentrators offer the potential for a major reduction in the cost of solar electricity. Compared to other concentrator technologies, such as mirror- and lens-based systems, luminescent solar concentrators have higher theoretical concentration factors, can collect both diffuse and specular sunlight without the need for solar tracking, and deliver bandgap-matched photons to the photovoltaic cells. The goal of this project is to study new concepts for high efficiency luminescent solar concentrators, deepening our understanding of fundamental optical processes in new classes of materials and devices. The project investigates a class of fluorescent materials based on photopolymerizable reactive mesogens incorporating orientationally ordered photoluminescent dyes and antenna waveguides for capturing sunlight; studies transport waveguide based on guided-wave plasmon-polariton modes; integrates these two waveguide structures into a tandem waveguide luminescent solar concentrator architecture; and develops mathematical models for investigating, understanding, and predicting the light trapping and transport properties of individual components and integrated tandem waveguide luminescent solar concentrators.&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: Research and development of highly concentrating, high efficiency luminescent solar concentrators could lead to advances in solar energy technology. West Washington University is a predominately undergraduate institution with a strong emphasis on research. Extensive participation of undergraduate researchers is an integral part of this project. The research will involve a total of 15-20 undergraduates over the project period, as well as 3-4 Masters-level graduate students, in a multidisciplinary environment.&lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by the Divisions of Materials Research, Chemistry, and Mathematical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Optical concentration can lower the cost of solar energy and increase its potential for more widespread deployment by reducing the needed area of photovoltaics.  Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) are emissive dye-containing plastic or glass waveguides used to spectrally and spatially concentrate sunlight by trapping light in a planar waveguide, where it travels to the edges for conversion (see Figure).  LSCs require no solar tracking, exhibit omnidirectional acceptance producing comparable performance under diffuse and specular illumination, and offer the potential for higher energy concentration ratios than designs based on mirrors or lenses. Though promising in theory, in practice the performance levels achieved by actual LSCs have not been high enough for practical applications.  This research investigated new concepts for improving LSC efficiency through a combination of new organic and inorganic dyes, new waveguide designs, and new models and theories.  Significant advances were made in all three areas, including: (1) introduction of a new family of dyes for LSCs that have the potential to out-perform any other known class of LSC dye; (2) proof-of-principle demonstration of a new waveguide design in which electromagnetic energy propagates as oscillating electrons in very thin metal layers; (3) the development of more accurate and more comprehensive optical models, useful for predicting and understanding LSC performance.  In addition to these scientific advances, over two dozen students participated in the research, most of whom were undergraduates.  These students received strong training in solar energy, materials science, mathematical modeling, and the process of scientific discovery.  They also learned how to collaborate and communicate with colleagues in a highly interdisciplinary environment involving materials and synthetic chemistry, physics, and mathematics.
