<AbstractNarration>This project is part of a long-range vision designed to have an impact on students and teachers from elementary through graduate school. The primary goal of the project is to improve learning by all students who take undergraduate physics. Related goals are to enhance the teaching effectiveness of graduate students and faculty, to strengthen the ability of K-12 teachers to teach physics and physical science, and to support graduate students, post-docs, and faculty engaged in physics education research at the University of Washington (UW) and elsewhere. The project is conducted by the Physics Education Group (PEG) in the UW Physics Department. The group consists of three Professors, a Research Assistant Professor, Post-doctoral Research Associates, a resident high school science teacher, graduate students, visiting faculty, and a small administrative staff.  Each year the group works with a large number of faculty at many institutions and serves as a center for physics education research and curriculum development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The PEG is working toward the project's primary goal by: (A) expanding the range of instructional materials to include a greater variety of research-based and research-validated options for transforming instruction; (B) conducting research on student understanding of physics to guide the design of instructional materials and to ensure they are effective in a wide range of instructional environments; (C) developing a comprehensive set of online and print resources to help instructors implement the materials effectively; and (D) establishing a multi-tiered program for supporting dissemination of the instructional resources and sustaining instructional transformation in physics courses and departments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project builds on the prior accomplishments of the PEG in research and the production and dissemination of two research-based curricula: Tutorials in Introductory Physics (Prentice Hall) and Physics by Inquiry (Wiley). The current project involves increasing the impact of the Tutorials by extending the research base on learning and teaching, expanding and refining existing tutorials, and developing ancillary materials that give instructors flexibility in incorporating research-validated strategies into all components of their courses (e.g., lectures, labs, and homework). A significant new emphasis is on providing a coherent, accessible set of online and print resources for instructors (e.g., an online instructor's guide and tools for assessing student achievement), as well as on establishing mechanisms for providing ongoing support (e.g., through workshops and a Users' Group). The results of this project also have important implications for the development of Physics by Inquiry, which is for the preparation and professional development of K-12 teachers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the group is developing material that addresses the need for research-based interactive engagement at the upper level in physics.  These materials are being developed in quantum mechanics, electricity and magnetism, special relativity, and thermodynamics, and they provide students who have used interactive engagement materials in the introductory courses continuity and breadth in the upper-level courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: The instructional materials being produced strengthen the learning of physics by undergraduates in introductory physics courses for science and engineering majors and in lower and upper division courses for physics majors. However, the project is embedded in a larger overall effort that helps ensure an even broader impact. In the process of developing and assessing curriculum, the group works with faculty at a wide range of institutions that serve a wide spectrum of student populations, thus promoting improved learning by all students. The project has a direct effect on future faculty (e.g., graduate teaching assistants), who gain experience with an instructional approach that engages students in active learning. In addition to contributing to the research base, the project helps build the capacity for discipline-based education research through the professional development of graduate students, post-docs, and visitors to the group, and the group provides national leadership in physics education research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project?s main goal was to improve student learning in college and university physics courses through a coordinated program of research, curriculum development and professional development for current and future physics faculty.  We worked toward this vision by increasing the access of faculty to research-based and research-validated materials and lowering the barriers to adoption.    Research in this project focused on identifying student difficulties with a broad range of topics in introductory physics, including conservation principles, electric fields and potentials, the propagation of pulses and waves, and topics from modern physics such as special relativity.  The primary population was undergraduate student in introductory calculus-based physics, but precollege inservice and pre-service teachers were included as well as students in upper division physics courses.  Relevant to this latter group, we also conducted research on student understanding of topics in electricity and magnetism, and quantum mechanics, which are typically taught in the junior year.  Research findings were presented in 21 articles in peer-reviewed journals, 16 articles in peer-reviewed conference proceedings, 4 other publications (in non-peer-reviewed proceedings or books).  Results were also reported in more than 140 invited or contributed presentations at regional, national or international conferences, or in college and university physics departments.   Curriculum development efforts resulted in a 2nd Edition of Tutorials in Introductory Physics, a set of instructional materials intended to supplement instruction in large-enrollment introductory college and university physics courses.  The 2nd Edition contains 60 tutorials, 10 more than the 1st Edition.  New topics include: Conservation of energy; Conservation of angular momentum; Simple harmonic motion; Multiple-battery circuits; A microscopic model for an ideal gas; Heat engines &amp; the second law of thermodynamics; Wave-particle duality; Probability in classical and quantum mechanics; Events &amp; reference frames; Measurement in special relativity; Simultaneity; Electric &amp; magnetic fields in multiple frames of reference.  Significant revisions were also made to an additional 15 tutorials. Progress was also made in adapting sections of the 2nd Edition Tutorials in Introductory Physics for use with textbooks that take a "conservation laws first" approach, such as Principles and Practice of Physics by Mazur (Pearson, 1st Ed. 2015).  A website with resources was created to support faculty adopting the tutorials at other institutions.  The tutorials are intended for use in small sections in which instructors, typically graduate or undergraduate teaching assistants can circulate, asking additional questions of students as they work in small groups.  However, many institutions do not have the resources to ensure that large-enrollment courses have smaller recitation or quiz sections.  Therefore, we have been working on adapting certain tutorials for use in large lecture halls in conjunction with personal response polling systems.  We have made progress in understanding the conditions that are necessary for successful use in these environments.  We also produced preliminary versions of Tutorials in Physics: Quantum Mechanics and Tutorials in Physics: Electricity and Magnetism that are intended to supplement instruction in standard junior-level courses for physics majors.  The results of the curriculum development also include select modules from Physics by Inquiry, the materials our group is developing for K-12 teachers (Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.)  Professional development of current and future faculty, including future physics education researchers was the third main component of this project.  We provided direct training to five postdoctoral research associates and 17 graduate students.  An additional seven PhD students from institutions in Europe, India and China visited for one or more academic terms.  More than 200 preservice and inservice teachers and their students also benefited directly or indirectly through this program.  We also engaged 37 undergraduates in research, including four through the NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program.  More than 300 graduate students in other areas of physics participated in our Teaching Assistant Preparation Program.  Professional development was also provided through workshops for faculty at various conferences.  These workshops introduce faculty to the pedagogical approach of the Tutorials and provide essential information for adoption.
