<AbstractNarration>Recent advances in global positioning system (GPS) and satellite tracking technologies have enabled unprecedented collection of locational information for mobile objects.  Though it is possible to capture highly accurate spatial information describing the movements of people, animals, vehicles, and other types of moving objects, the theory and methods available to support analysis of such data remain limited.  Within geographic information science, the area known as "time geography" is the foundational body of knowledge for movement pattern analysis.  However, as it is currently theorized and understood, traditional time geography suffers from one critical shortcoming: it is based on a discrete representation of space that does not permit the mapping and quantification of an object's movement distribution with uncertainty.  While traditional time geography is adept at describing the spatial extent of an object's possible movement over a period of time, it does not reveal the likelihood of where the object was located within this boundary.  This is an important question in many substantive domains, particularly in wildlife ecology, where quantifying and mapping the space-use characteristics, or home ranges, of animals is a key management task.  Building on recent work in spatial statistics and time geography, this project develops probabilistic measures of time geography that can be used to analyze tracking data.  In particular, several time-geographic density estimators will be developed in order to generate continuous probability density functions from tracking data.  Formulation of these methods will proceed along several tracks that include examining appropriate sampling schemes, tracking intervals, distance-weighting functions, velocity parameter specifications, moving object inactivity, and positional uncertainty.  To support the development of these new methods, the investigators will collect a rich set of high-frequency baseline data from tagged Muscovy ducks (Cairina moschata) in the State of Florida.  This data will also be used as a basis for evaluating new and existing methods of animal home range estimation.  Lastly, the project will adapt the developed probabilistic time geographic methods for use in network space. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will advance basic knowledge in geographic information science regarding how the movement patterns of mobile objects can best be analyzed.  Several new spatial statistical techniques will be produced.  A baseline dataset describing animal movements will be collected and shared with the other researchers.  Although the project applications primarily are ecological in nature, developed methods will be relevant to a number of fields, as spatially-referenced moving object data are increasingly used in other areas such as crime, transportation, and homeland security.  In addition to the research outcomes being incorporated into the PI's course offerings, the project will directly support at least two graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Recent advances in global positioning system (GPS) and satellite tracking technologies have enabled unprecedented collection of locational information for mobile objects such as people, animals, vehicles, ships, and aircraft.  Likewise, recent efforts in geographic information systems (GIS) and science (GIScience) have contributed numerous strategies for managing, querying, visualizing, and analyzing the large tracking databases that are emerging in practice.  From the perspective of space-time analysis, time geography offers a rigorous mathematical framework for quantifying the mobility and interaction of moving objects from tracking data. The intellectual merit of this project stems from advancing space-time analysis by developing and testing new methods of time geography that are related to probability theory.  The methods developed in this project offer a new perspective of space-time analysis for tracking data.  Traditional time geography allows an analyst to identify all of the possible locations a mobile object could have visited, given a set of tracking data and some basic information about its movement capabilities.  Probabilistic time geography, advanced in this project, allows the analyst to assign probabilities or probability densities to those possible locations.  This allows the analyst to better quantify and understand an object's movement patterns.  Specific methods developed in this project build on time-geographic density estimation (TGDE) and include voxel-based space-time prisms (P-STPs), TGDE-based individual accessibility, and other approaches.  An original toolbox compatible with popular GIS software was developed to apply some of these methods.  TGDE generates a probability density surface for a set of tracking data, highlighting areas where the object was likely to have spent the most time.  This project developed several versions of TGDE that are applicable to a wide range of data types.  In this project, the key focus was on the problem of animal home range estimation with TGDE, where the goal is to delineate the physical area occupied by an individual animal from tracking data.  Home range estimation is a vital form of analysis for ecologists, and the results of tests performed in this study show the method outperforms existing methods.  As we found TGDE techniques to be widely applicable, we used them to study movements of people, such as sex offenders, as well as to explore eye-tracking data.  Additionally, this project developed a network-based formulation of TGDE to enable the analysis of vehicle tracking data on road networks which was shown to be applicable toanalysing travel survey, carshare, and taxi data.  This project also extended network-based TGDE to measure people's accessibility to opportunity locations where goods and services may be obtained, such as food and health care.  P-STPs use tracking data to map the probability of an individual's spatial location at any time.  This project developed a three-dimensional computational approach for generating P-STPs.  P-STPs were used to study the movements of Muscovy ducks and probabilistically measure their daily habitat use patterns.  P-STPs were also extended to measure space-time interactions among animals by overlapping their prisms.  Specifically, a set of probability equations were developed to quantify the probabilities of individual animals interacting in space and time.  A case study of zebras was used for the analysis.  Additionally, P-STPs were used to measure wildlife-roadway interactions.    Beyond methodological developments, this project contributed original data and knowledge about a little studied, invasive species, the Muscovy duck.  Virtually no published literature can be found on the species outside its native range, even though it has been widely introduced across the world. This project documented the species' home ranges, movements, habitat use patterns, behaviours, and abundance.    This project has the potential to...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
