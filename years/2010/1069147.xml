<AbstractNarration>1069258 Rutgers University; Dimitris Metaxas &lt;br/&gt;1069147 Arie Kaufman; SUNY at Stony Brook &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Dynamic Data Analysis (CDDA) will focus on conducting innovative research and applications based on the collaborative efforts between the two universities and member companies in the emerging field of dynamic data analysis. The end result will be novel science, algorithms and applications that transform chaos into knowledge. Rutgers University (RU) and SUNY at Stony Brook are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with RU as the lead institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center will investigate algorithms and potential solutions to analyze and visualize massive, complex, multidimensional and multi-scale dynamic data. The algorithm design will be tested, validated and improved based on the close collaboration and research between the two participating universities and industry. The participating universities have research and education programs whose strengths cover the technical scope of the center. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research projects will be useful to industry and homeland security, and the proposed Center will transform traditional research in computer science. Analysis and visualization of large-scale dynamic data will also become a new area of research for many graduate students. CDDA plans to have students spend time with the industrial affiliates in the form of summer internships and during the academic year so they can improve their skills. The participating universities also plan to leverage existing outreach programs at their institutions, and programs sponsored by the NSF, to encourage the participation of under-represented groups in the research..</AbstractNarration>

University of Virginia will hold a planning workshop on April 4-5, 2016. We continue to increase CDDA?s national visibility by participating in the NSF Northeast Big Data InnovationHubs Program. Significant Results: During the past year we have been working actively with our members, The collaboration with CA focuses on cloud computing, enterprise data management, network analytics and information security. We workedwith a new CDDA member, Mobileware, in developing mobile applications for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The joint effort with Northrop Grumman is centered on large scale network analysis and anomaly detection.

Key outcomes or other achievements: Key outcomes of Stony Brook CDDA site during the past year include:    Increased membership fees from 150K to 208K (an 39% growth year over year)? Exceeded the I/UCRC membership requirements (# of full members and the total amount)? Held two workshops and IAB meetings with strong turnout and LIFE forms filled out and feedbackdiscussed? Developed and distributed quarterly newsletters to IAB members and other companies which may have an interest to join the CDDA? and Building momentum to expand the CDDA with two university partners, namely, University of Virginia and University of Carolina, Charlotte, submitting planning grant applications to join the center; In addition to research support from companies such as Google, Facebook, and Yahoo, CDDAresearchers have collaborated with EMC Corporation, Adobe Systems, Cold Spring HarborLaboratories, VMWare, and Vanguard.
