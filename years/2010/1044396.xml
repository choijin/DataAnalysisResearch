<AbstractNarration>In this project a team of two biologists and two organic chemists is integrating the laboratories for two of their courses, Cell Biology and Organic Chemistry II.  Students working in interdisciplinary teams plan and execute the synthesis of a compound related to a known inhibitor of the enzyme histone deacetylase.  This enzyme tends to be expressed more actively in cancer cells than in their normal counterparts, so discovery of potent inhibitors might lead to new chemotherapeutic drugs.  Once the student team has synthesized and characterized the potential inhibitor, they will test it for inhibition of growth of cultured animal cells, an indicator of cell toxicity.  Students from several teams will benefit from learning of the results of other teams in the class, and interesting findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at conferences.  The model of integrating courses in different departments through project laboratories is one that will interest faculty and students at other institutions.</AbstractNarration>

The question students are asking is whether they can design new compounds that have anti-cancer properties. Building from a known anti-cancer compound, students in the Organic Chemistry II course synthesize new, modified versions of this molecule. The Cell Biology students then test whether the compounds kill cancer cells. In this way new and more effective anti-cancer compounds can be screened.     We developed this joint project for a number of reasons. First, students often seem to compartmentalize their learning--they learn material in one course but fail to see how it connects to other courses.  The HDACi project draws explicit connections between courses in two disciplines, thus modeling how students should always attempt to make such connections.  Second, true research is multi-disciplinary and open-ended. By having a collaborative learning environment where the results in the laboratory exercises are unknown (even by the professors), students gain a more real-world scientific experience. Third, by linking these courses, students gain a more in-depth understanding of the course topics and greater understanding of the material. Fourth, we hoped the research-like experience would spark interest in research for many students. Students are often intimidated by real research and this introduction may overcome that hurdle. In addition, many students want more research opportunities but do not have the flexibility in their schedules to perform a semester of independent research. This linked research question allowed these students to have a more true research experience.     As a result of the project there has been a fundamental shift in the teaching and research experiences for six biology and chemistry faculty and over 250 students.  The positive impact of the project will continue to impact the biology and chemistry departments for years to come.  In addition, the project generated teaching materials that will be available to other faculty teaching cell biology, organic chemistry II, and biochemistry.
