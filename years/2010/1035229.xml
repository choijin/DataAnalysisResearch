<AbstractNarration>This Phase II Noyce project is continuing to enhance secondary mathematics and science teaching in the San Bernardino City Unified School District (SBCUSD. The project is building capacity by including a new component focused on supporting mentor teachers. The plan is to create a cadre of teacher leaders who are capable of not only mentoring the Scholars and newly hired math and science teachers, but who also serve as school-based leaders to support the ongoing improvement of instruction in math and science. The pool of SBCUSD mentor teachers is expanded by recruiting and preparing Noyce teachers to serve in this capacity. The project's research agenda examines mentor and mentee conceptions of mentoring to assess how these conceptions influence the practice and processes of mentoring. A second area of expansion creates a shared set of online resources for the Scholars and teacher mentors through MERLOT Noyce Voices, with Scholars taking the lead in creating online portfolios they can use for their credential process. Not only does this phase II project aim to recruit and retain 20 new mathematics and science teachers, it is also implementing a sustainability plan that regularizes core components of the teacher preparation program and creates partnerships with private sources to support sustainability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Project Overview The CSUSB Noyce Math and Science Scholars project is an integral part of a comprehensive approach to enhancing teacher preparation, designed and implemented by the CSUSB Center for Enhancement of Mathematics Education (CEME) in collaboration with the Department of Mathematics and the College of Education. The goal of the Noyce Phase II project was to refine and implement a comprehensive teacher preparation and professional development program in mathematics and science education that results in improving the quality of instruction in a sustainable way, and ultimately improves student achievement among secondary students in San Bernardino City USD (SBCUSD). Program objectives included recruiting, training, credentialing, and facilitating placement of at least 20 Noyce Scholars; retaining these scholars through their full period of required service and beyond; and implementing a sustainability plan and creating public and private funding partnerships to provide an ongoing source of support for future Scholars. Scholars typically received $10,000/year for up to 3 years (including undergraduate and/or credential program); spent over 150 hours in secondary classrooms observing and co-teaching, receiving classroom-based mentoring during this time; attended monthly Noyce professional development seminars; and received academic and professional one-on-one mentoring throughout their program. Their required service post-credential is two years of full-time teaching in a high needs school district for each year of support. The program significantly exceeded its numerical goals: 35 mathematics and science Scholars participated in Noyce Phase II, with 25 of these having graduated with their Bachelor?s degree and teaching credential during the duration of the program; these are all teaching in SBCUSD or other high needs districts and either have completed their teaching requirements or are on track to do so. Additionally, the Noyce PI (Davida Fischman) and the CEME Director (Jeremy Aikin), along with other mathematics and education faculty, have collaborated to deepen the partnership with the district and to implement ongoing programs to support future recruiting (e.g. the privately funded Early Teaching Experiences in Mathematics program) and continuous professional development seminars for Scholars and Mentor teachers (supported by SBCUSD and the CSU Math and Science Teacher Initiative, MSTI). Broader Impact CSUSB is a Hispanic Serving Institution ? 64% of its students are Hispanic (40% at time of our application) and 5% are African American (11% at time of application).  Noyce recruitment efforts targeted a diverse range of applicants, particularly students underrepresented in STEM disciplines. Among the 35 Scholars, 22 are female and 23 are Hispanic; thus contributing to developing a local teacher workforce that more closely reflects the local population. The program has promoted teaching, training and learning by providing financial incentives to academically talented mathematics and science majors to pursue a teaching career, offering academic and professional mentoring and support to increase the content knowledge and pedagogical abilities of these future teachers. This program has contributed to enhancing and expanding capacity in SBCUSD by developing site-based teacher leaders with enhanced mentoring skills and pedagogical content knowledge.  University capacity is enhanced through the creation of collaborative advising and mentoring structures involving  both STEM and education faculty.  Intellectual Merit Data on Noyce participants and a comparison group of non-Noyce teachers was collected and analyzed by the project evaluation team, Silvana McCormick and Molly Rottapel of Redwood Consulting Executive. Their analysis indicates that the Noyce program has positively impacted teacher retention and effectiveness in the classroom of Noyce Scholar graduates. District administrators state that they actively seek to employ Noyce Scholars, as they see high student engagement in these teachers? classrooms, and clear demonstration of effective evidence-based teaching practices being employed. Conclusion The evaluators? final report states that ?both annual formative evaluations and the summative evaluation of the Noyce program found extensive evidence that the program was highly successful at preparing participants to be effective secondary school teachers.? Specifically:  ?Graduates of the program reported high levels of preparedness for teaching, a finding that was also reported by district administrators. Noyce graduates reported higher levels of satisfaction with their teacher training then teachers in the comparison sample. District administrators reported that given the choice, they would be more likely to hire a Noyce graduate over another teacher applicant because they believed that Noyce graduates were better prepared for teaching then individuals who had not participated in the program. Overall, Noyce graduates? early teaching experiences were more positive then those of teachers in the comparison sample, indicating the program may better equip participants for this challenging career then traditional approaches to teacher training. Noyce graduates had significantly higher teaching efficacy on the dimension of classroom management. Noyce graduates had significantly higher job satisfaction. Noyce graduates had significantly lower levels of burnout. Noyce graduates were significantly more likely to have taken on leadership roles at their school or in their district when compared to teachers in the comparison sample.?
