<AbstractNarration>On February 27, 2010 a magnitude Mw 8.8 earthquake struck the central west coast of Chile (named by the USGS as the Magnitude 8.8 Offshore Maule, Chile Earthquake). A megathrust Mw = 8.8 event that affects natural ground and engineered facilities in coastal, plain, and mountainous areas is of great importance for the Pacific Northwest of the United States and for many similar earthquake scenarios throughout the world. Capturing details of lateral spreads and the impacts of liquefaction on well-built structures, such as port facilities, are important. Documenting how some marginal earth structures survived is important. Characterizing the performance of earth dams and tailings dams at different epicentral distances is critical. Understanding how soil/geologic conditions influenced the observed damage patterns is important. Documenting the effects of long duration ground motions in the field is critical. Tectonic deformation and secondary surface fault rupture effects may also be important.  Field reconnaissance will be focused on capturing perishable data, but the team will also perform geotechnical characterization of the soils through: (1) examination of ejecta, (2) hand-held cone penetration tests, and (3) hand-carried equipment to measure shear wave velocities (Vs).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This reconnaissance team is coordinated through the Geoengineering Extreme Events Reconnaissance (GEER) Association.  The GEER team is working closely with the reconnaissance teams coordinated by other organizations such as the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute (EERI) and the Ocean Science Tsunami Group.</AbstractNarration>
