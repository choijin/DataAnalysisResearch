<AbstractNarration>PROJECT TITLE:  Neuroendocrine Bases and Environmental Regulation of Reproduction in a Flexibly Breeding Songbird&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Pierre Deviche, Arizona State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT NUMBER:  IOS 1026620&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will combine field studies on free-ranging organisms with experiments in a controlled laboratory setting to investigate the neuroendocrine bases of vertebrate reproductive flexibility. It will use multidisciplinary approaches ranging from molecular techniques to whole animal experiments in order to determine how animals integrate external environmental cues to regulate neuroendocrine and physiological changes associated with seasonal reproduction. The research will contribute to unraveling the role of some brain peptides in the control of seasonality and how the brain expression of these peptides is influenced by specific environmental factors. The findings will be relevant to our understanding of the bases of reproductive resilience and they will enhance our comprehension of the effects of some environmental perturbations, such as those potentially associated with global climate warming, on the reproductive physiology of vertebrate populations. The experimental model for the research will be a songbird. Many birds are conspicuous and birds in general are inherently fascinating to the general public. The studies will, therefore, be used to promote basic and advanced biological concepts related to how animals may adapt to the effects of global climate warming and other anthropogenic perturbations of their natural environments. Experimental data will be made publicly available through the Ask-a-Biologist web site, a wildly popular site that promotes science education at all levels, but in particular in high schools. All aspects of the research will involve the mentoring and active participation of undergraduates and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
