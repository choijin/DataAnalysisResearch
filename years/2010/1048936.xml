<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The cellular plasma membrane is a complex, crowded mixture of lipids and proteins. The lipid environment in which proteins find themselves can influence protein function, but the interplay between lipids and proteins that regulates function remains elusive.  The working hypothesis of this project is that transient compartmentalization of proteins in membrane regions enriched in particular lipids and the resulting intermolecular interactions in biomembranes must control biological function.  However, current conventional approaches lack the resolution and the ability to manipulate single molecules or groups of molecules that are required to probe the dynamics of these interactions on living cells.  The PI and co-PI will develop and use cutting edge imaging approaches to investigate quantitatively the molecular interactions and their dynamics that occur between cholesterol-rich membrane regions and immune receptor signaling in mast cells.  Key to the cross-disciplinary experimental and analytical approach is a combination of non-invasive and quantitative fluorescence microscopy, spectroscopy and manipulation that will be applied to living mast cells and artificial (biomimetic) membranes.  The project includes experiments to investigate the dynamics of lipids and proteins in living mast cells during immune receptor signaling, using fluorescence microscopy and spectroscopy with high spatial and temporal resolution, and testing whether it is possible to nucleate membrane microdomains (regions enriched in particular lipids, including cholesterol) in artificial membranes using dynamic holographic optical trapping and fluorescence microscopy and spectroscopy.  More broadly, these results and tools will be directly applicable to other signaling pathways (e.g., other immunoreceptors, growth factor receptors and other receptors) that may be influenced by membrane microdomains.  &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The project will result in development of cutting edge discovery-based tools that should find broad applications in biophysics and cell biology.  This cross-disciplinary research program serves as an ideal platform to train the next generations of scientists at the interface of cell biology, biophysics, chemistry, bioengineering and optics.  The PI and co-PI also are active in public outreach, for example, by exhibiting  their dramatic imaging technologies at a booth at the annual County Fair.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This Award was focused on developing quantitative, high-resolution fluorescence microscopy approaches to understand how molecules interact with one another in cell signaling.  Specifically we focused on the IgE receptor, which initiates the allergic response.  We demonstrated that a fluorescent lipid analog that has partitioned into specialized membrane regions that are enriched in cholesterol can increase its fluorescence lifetime.  This in effect allows us to beat optical resolution to look at functional changes as cell signaling proceeds.  In collaboration with Prof. Nick Winograd, we developed a statistical analysis to analyze images obtained with imaging mass spectrometry, where unlabeled molecules are identified by their characteristic chemical fragmentations.  We have successfully trained graduate and undergraduate students at both Penn State University (their previous institution) and at the University of Minnesota Duluth (their current institution).  Since 2007, Sheets has trained 3 PhD (1 shared with Heikal), 2 MS (1 shared with Heikal) and has 2 current MS students (1 shared with Heikal), and she has also trained 2 (at Penn State) and 11 (at UMD) undergraduates.  Since 2007, Heikal has trained 2 PhD (1 shared with Sheets), 5 MS (1 shared with Sheets) and has 2 current MS students (1 shared with Sheets).  He also has trained 4 (at Penn State) and 15 (at UMD) undergraduates.  We developed a "Explore Science with 4-H and Penn State" booth at the 2003&ndash;2008 Crawford County Fairs, Meadville PA.
