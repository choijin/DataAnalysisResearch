<AbstractNarration>Understanding the mechanisms of assimilation of nutrients by marine microorganisms is important to marine science, especially for the micronutrient iron (Fe), which is often present in limiting concentrations in marine surface waters. Much of the Fe is ocean water is complexed to organic ligands and recent studies have examined the capabilities of marine bacteria to assimilate these different forms of Fe. One potential source of Fe is through the assimilation of heme, a Fe-containing biochemical, and it has been recently shown that marine bacteria have transport systems for heme uptake. This project is therefore aimed at examining if Fe is assimilated as heme and whether this is an important pathway for iron accumulation by marine microorganisms. The potential for heme uptake will be examined in laboratory culture studies. Genetic tools and manipulations will be used to identify the uptake mechanisms, demonstrate their activity and show whether this is an important assimilation pathway. These approaches will also be used to examine the extent of this pathway in natural marine microbial communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will integrate its activities with the NSF-funded Center for Ocean Science Education Excellence - California (COSEE CA) and with Scripps Educational Alliances to extend the research impact to K-12 public education. A Research Experiences for Teachers relationship has already been established through these interactions with teachers at University City High School in San Diego. This research will also support for a graduate student whose PhD thesis will focus on this research. The scientific broader impacts of this research relate to understanding the ocean biogeochemistry of Fe and the chemical-biological linkages, and the role of limiting nutrients on the global biogeochemistry of the ocean.</AbstractNarration>

With funding from this award we characterized a heme uptake system, a microbial iron acquisition mechanism predominantly studied in the context of human infections, in the nonpathogenic marine <em>Roseobacter </em>strain <em>Ruegeria</em> sp.TM1040. The heme uptake system was strongly upregulated when TM1040 was subjected to Fe stress, and TM1040 was able to fulfill its Fe requirements in a minimal medium by solely utilizing heme or hemoglobin. A mutant TM1040 strain in which the gene encoding the outer membrane TonB dependent transporter <em>hmuR</em> was insertionally inactivated lost the ability to grow on heme sources confirming the role of the <em>hmuR</em> gene cluster<em> </em>in heme uptake. Wild type TM1040 outcompeted the mutant strain when cocultured in Fe-deficient conditions with diatom lysate as the only provided Fe source.

Roughly half of &nbsp;153 different sequenced marine <em>Roseobacter </em>genomes contain heme uptake systems, and one strain significantly downregulated its heme uptake system during symbiotic growth with a marine diatom. We argue that many phytoplankton-associated <em>Roseobacter</em> strains likely employ heme uptake systems to scavenge Fe from hemoproteins when their algal partners lyse and die and that these systems provide them with a competitive advantage while transitioning to a new lifestyle (see figure).
