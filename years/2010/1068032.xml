<AbstractNarration>This grant will support the participation of the principal investigator (PI) and Hendrix College undergraduates in the Qweak experiment at Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) in Newport News, VA.  The goal of this experiment is to perform a high-precision measurement of the proton's weak charge using parity-violating electron scattering.  The role of the weak charge is analogous to that of the electric charge:  it determines the coupling between the bosonic force carrier and the hadron.  The weak charge can be simply expressed in terms of the electroweak mixing angle, which is a fundamental parameters of the Standard Model.  The mixing angle has been precisely determined at the Z-pole; however its value varies as a function of the momentum transferred by the exchanged boson.  Other experiments have measured the mixing angle at momentum transfer values below the Z-pole but none with the precision that will be achieved by Qweak.  The Qweak experiment has notable discovery potential due to its sensitivity to such a well-determined, fundamental Standard Model parameter; a significant deviation from the predicted value would be an indication of new physics beyond the Standard Model.  The PI and undergraduate researchers will continue development and maintenance of a software database and other analysis tools for the experiment, participate in the collection of data, and contribute to the analysis of results.  The database will store information about experimental conditions and physics results obtained throughout the course of Qweak running.  It will be the primary storehouse used during data analysis and instrumental in extracting the electroweak mixing angle at this momentum transfer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work stem primarily from the opportunities it provides to Hendrix students, many of who come from EPSCoR states such as Arkansas, to participate in cutting-edge research.  These opportunities will help the students develop crucial analytical and problem-solving skills and prepare them for further work and education in STEM-related fields.  Additionally, researchers funded by this proposal will perform K-12 outreach at their alma maters or in the local school district.  The PI has extensive experience in mentoring undergraduate students in research projects of this type having supervised eight such projects over the last seven years (six in the last three).  As a faculty member at a small liberal arts college he is well positioned to recruit strong students of all backgrounds into the sciences through their participation in this research program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The work funded under this grant supported the Qweak collaboration's measurement of the proton's weak charge which was performed at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Newport News, VA.  The proton's weak charge characterizes the strength of the proton's interaction with the weak force similar to how the proton's electric charge characterizes its interaction strength with the electric force.  The value of an important Standard Model parameter, the Weinberg or electroweak mixing angle, can be extracted from the weak charge.  (The Standard Model of particle physics is the theory that currently best describes the different subatomic particles and their interactions.)  Deviations of the measured Weinberg angle from the value predicted by the Standard Model would be an indication of new physics not explained by the current theory.  The discovery of such a deviation might help to shed light on other phenomena not yet explained by the Standard Model such as dark matter and dark energy.  Published results from a small subset of the experimental data, roughly 4% of the total, do not indicate a significant deviation from expectation but the full potential of this experiment will not be realized until the final result is extracted from all the available data.  This final result is expected to be available sometime late in 2015 or early in 2016.   The work undertaken by the principal investigator (PI) and his students aided in running the experiment, analyzing the collected data, and simulating some of the difficult-to-measure physics processes that constitute background noise in the experiment.  Prior to the start of the experiment, the Hendrix research group used freely available software (MySQL) to create a database for storing and retrieving summary results averaged over short time periods (a few minutes) of the experiment.  This database continues to play a vital role in the collaboration's analysis of the collected data as it looks for systematic effects that might bias the outcome of the experiment.  The PI and his students have continued to support and extend this database as well as analyzing the results stored therein.  One key database project that Hendrix researchers undertook was performing integrity checks to ensure that data affected by hardware errors or other systematic effects are not included in the final result.  The PI and his students were active in data collection during the experiment throughout its lengthy run time - a period of several months spread out between May 2010 and 2012.  Frequent trips were made to Jefferson Lab to "sit shifts", i.e. monitor the experimental apparatus and quality of the incoming data.  Since the conclusion of data-taking, the primary focus of the analysis effort by the Hendrix group has shifted .  Hendrix researchers have been investigating a set of background effects, collectively known as electromagnetic radiative processes, using simulation software specifically written for Qweak.  Understanding how these background processes impact the experiment is crucial to extracting a final result with the highest possible precision.  The simulation has been extended to model these effects and analysis of the simulation data is currently ongoing.   The PI is employed by a small liberal arts college, Hendrix College, located in central Arkansas.  This institution serves a student body of roughly 1500 undergraduates that draws heavily from Arkansas and surrounding states but also brings in students from across the nation and around the world.  It is renowned throughout the state and region for the strength of its science program.  Over the active period of this grant, a total of seven Hendrix undergraduates (two female) participated in lengthy (8-10 week long) summer research projects focused on this cutting-edge experiment.  Research opportunities of this kind are crucial for recruiting and training a talented STEM workforce.  These students have gone on to present the results...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
