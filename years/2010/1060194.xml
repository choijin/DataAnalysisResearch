<AbstractNarration>The proposers will investigate Alfven waves and magnetic reconnection as primary sources for the heating and acceleration of the solar wind. This research team will analyze new spectroscopic data from the "Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer" onboard the Hinode spacecraft in order to resolve the current debate as to whether Alfven waves carry sufficient energy to heat and accelerate the solar wind. The proposers note that these results will provide much needed empirical data to constrain the competing wave-driven and turbulence-driven models of the solar wind, and ultimately help to determine the true solar wind acceleration mechanism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By providing hands-on research experiences for individual teachers each summer at Columbia University's "Summer Research Program for Science Teachers," this team will help improve the commitment and scientific understanding of middle and high school science teachers from the New York City metropolitan area. This activity will have far reaching benefits, since analysis of Columbia's 21-year-old outreach program shows that the teachers who have participated go on to teach about 1,000 students each over the next ten years and also see a 10% increase in the pass rate of their students on the New York State Regents science exam. The proposers will also visit middle and high school science classes to explain their research and answer questions directly from students. Given the fact that New York City has a diverse student population with a high percentage of underrepresented groups and minorities, these education and outreach efforts constitute a high impact program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For over 75 years scientists have been wondering why the gas surrounding the Sun, known as the corona, is so much hotter than the surface of the Sun.  To use a poor analogy, this is about as surprising as a flame coming out of an ice cube.  Our analysis of observations by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) onboard the Japanese satellite Hinode have helped to answer this question.   The center of the Sun is 15 million degrees Kelvin, due to the nuclear fusion occuring there.  As one moves outwards and away from this heat source, the temperature of the Sun drops to 6000 degrees at the surface.  Then moving from the surface into the corona, the temperature jumps up to 1 million degrees.   Some researchers have proposed that magnetic waves launched from below the surface of the Sun dissipate their energy in the corona, thereby heating it to such high temperatures.  Others propose that the loops of magnetic field lines on the surface can snap, thereby releasing energy and heating the corona.   We have found clear evidence for waves in the solar corona.  Moreover we have been able to quantify the amount of energy initially in the waves and the amount which is lost to the corona.  We find that the waves not only carry more than enough enegy to heat the corona; but also that they dissipate sufficient energy to explain the coronal heating.   Based on our findings, the field has advanced to a new level and new questions are raised.  In specific, the next steps in solving the coronal heating problem will involve determining the processes by which the waves are initially launched and the mechanisms by which the waves are damped.
