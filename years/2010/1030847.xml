<AbstractNarration>It is well documented that humans influence their environment, and that conservation initiatives can have substantial impacts on local people. Less well understood how conservation initiatives affect social changes, and how these social changes in turn impact conservation goals. Doctoral student Brian Miller, under the supervision of Professor Paul Leslie in the Department of Geography at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill will conduct a study that explores the social dynamics that mediate conservation actions and outcomes by examining the individual and institutional responses to changes in access to resources.  Rivers, swamps, and highlands are key resource areas for livestock herders (pastoralists) living in arid and semi-arid ecosystems, but pastoralist access to these dry-season/drought resources is inhibited by the establishment of parks and other protected areas. Such changes in resource availability have considerable implications for pastoralists' livelihoods, which are increasingly being supplemented with, or replaced by, cultivation and wage labor in sub-Saharan Africa. Although livelihood change among pastoralists is well documented, there has been little study of its interactions with access to drought resources. This study will describe the accessibility of drought resources in the Kenya/Tanzania border region, the relationship between resource access and Maasai livelihood decisions, and the response of local resource management institutions to ongoing livelihood changes. Describing the human responses to changes in resource accessibility will illustrate the social consequences of conservation as well as the indirect ecological implications of these effects. This study will use a mixed methods approach that will entail geospatial analysis of resource distributions, household survey data analysis, and interviews with members of communities that are varying distances from a national park. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conservation efforts directly affect pastoralists' access to the resources they need to make a living. At the same time, ongoing pastoralist livelihood changes could substantially alter rangeland ecosystems, which cover a large portion of the earth's land surface.  These changes have the potential to transform landscapes in the vicinity of iconic conservation areas (e.g., Serengeti National Park), block wildlife migration corridors, and thereby affect the viability of tourism economies. This study explores the idea that the challenges facing conservationists and pastoralists are mutually dependent, and so are the solutions for resolving them. Understanding the consequences of conservation initiatives for local land use is necessary for developing management strategies that sustain ecosystem function and resource availability beyond the boundaries of protected areas. Moreover, pastoralists in some regions are gaining recognition as valuable conservation partners, and identifying patterns of resource availability is needed in order to establish access rights that prevent further land dispossession and marginalization. Finally, learning about the individual strategies and the collective resource management institutions that have allowed some people to remain in the pastoral sector will likely be instructive for livestock herders and conservationists alike.</AbstractNarration>
