<AbstractNarration>Biological rhythms in physiology and behavior, such as the sleep/wake cycle, are regulated by an internal biological clock located at the base of the brain in the hypothalamus.  This clock (located in a brain region called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN) has a well-defined structure that has many features that are conserved across mammalian species.  The ways in which the complexities of this brain region contribute to the function of organisms are not fully understood.  The SCN appears to have regions devoted to processing sensory input and generating rhythmic output.  Using a gene-expression based approach, this project aims to distinguish the functions of these subregions of the clock and how they contribute to the overall function of the organism.  It is anticipated that the results of these experiments will reveal novel information about how the structure of the biological clock relates to its function, and how different portions of the clock carry out different functions.  This project will significantly impact our current understanding of clock function, which has common mechanisms in nearly all animals.  Gene expression data will be deposited in the National Library of Medicine's Gene Expression Omnibus where it will be available to other researchers and the public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of this project was to measure gene expression in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the part of the brain which controls the bodyÃ†s daily, or circadian rhythms.  Specifically, the goal was to examine gene expression across different times of day and different parts of the nucleus, in order to identify information about the functional importance of each of these subregions.   As a result of the experiments conducted in this project, we have determined that the cells that make up the suprachiasmatic nucleus are remarkably homogenous.  Differences in expression among them are limited to a few specific genes, most commonly genes that encode for neuropeptides involved in intercellular communication between neurons.  These findings suggest that it is the connectivity between neurons, and not just the composition of the neurons themselves, that produce the circadian rhythms in behavior and physiology that are evident at the level of the whole organism.  However, differences between the parts of the suprachiasmatic nucleus as a function of time of day were very limited.  Small differences in the peaks of various rhythms may differ between one part of the SCN and another, but on the whole these differences were small and difficult to detect.  We also investigated the genomic regulation of circadian clock genes by estrogen, using bioinformatics approaches.  These studies have led to the discovery that estrogens have the potential to influence the expression of almost all clock genes, and that many of the sites of action have been conserved across different mammalian taxa.  These studies suggest that gonadal hormones may have significant influences on circadian clock function, and many of these influences may not yet have been identified.  This project also has additional impacts through the educational value it has had on student participants.  Work supported by this project led directly to two doctoral dissertation, and provided additional support for a third as well as life-changing research experiences for many undergraduates and technical personnel.  The presence of this project has also enhanced the research infrastructure at Kent State, leading to support for additional research equipment and maintenance that has, indirectly, supported a wide variety of research projects and initiatives.
