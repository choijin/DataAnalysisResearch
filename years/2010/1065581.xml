<AbstractNarration>This OISE award is granted on the basis of Program Solicitation 04-036, International Research Experiences for Students (IRES).  It will fund 12 undergraduate students over three summers to travel to China to join research projects in two world-class chemistry institutes, the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics and the Dalian University of Technology, both in Dalian, China. The research theme of this program is the study of surface chemistry related to heterogeneous catalysis, involving both molecular-dynamics simulations and engineering applications of catalysts, with emphasis on well-defined nanostructured materials. The program will be coordinated with an on-going PIRE project in this area, and undergraduate students of chemistry and chemical engineering will participate. Students will be prepared for the 10-12 week program in China by research experience in Santa Barbara and training in Chinese language and culture.  The research takes a systematic approach to the design of heterogeneous catalysts, using not only experimental testing of reactions but also theoretical simulations, an approach that promises to be more efficient and effective than earlier empirical approaches to finding suitable catalysts for chemical reactions of interest and technological value.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This international experience will broaden the students? understanding of the world, especially China, and prepare them to engage with Chinese and American colleagues productively in the future course of their careers. The PIs will make an effort to include underrepresented minorities, and the experience should encourage the participating undergraduates to appreciate research and to continue to graduate school. The applications of new catalysts and the guidelines for directed synthesis are likely to support the development of improved technologies for energy conversion and chemicals production.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes for NSF OISE-1065581:  " IRES-Undergraduate Research in China on Electron Chemistry and Catalysis at Interfaces"              The goal of the IRES-ECCI program was to provide a diverse group of undergraduates with an intense, personal experience in international collaborative research by introducing them to catalysis, photocatalysis and surface science in world-class laboratories in the US and China.  This was facilitated by having students carry out research as interns with faculty and/or graduate student mentors at the University of California Santa Barbara.  The research internship was followed by the students doing an external research visit (ERV) for a period of 6-10 weeks at different international universities, primarily in China, where they worked with faculty mentors known to the faculty at UCSB.  During the last year of this program the parameters were changed modestly to include graduate student participants as well.              During the tenure of this grant, a total of 10 undergraduate students and four graduate students participated in ERVs to international laboratories with support from the IRES-ECCI program. Of these, 9 undergraduates and 2 graduate students did ERVs at different universities in mainland China, one undergrad and one grad student did ERVs at the City University of Hong Kong, and one graduate student made a short ERV at the Barts and London School of Medicine in the UK. In addition, about six other undergraduates participated in IRES-ECCI sponsored undergraduate research at UCSB but for various reasons were unable to participate in ERVs.              The intellectual merit from these outcomes derives in part from the research done collaboratively between scientists in the US and China which was facilitated by the exchange of students between UCSB and various universities there including the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Fudan Univ., the Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, Remin Univ. of China, Wuhan Univ. and Xiamen Univ., as well as the City Univ. of Hong Kong.  In each case the hosts were very welcoming and provided opportunities both for scientific accomplishments and for learning about the culture of the local environment.  These collaborative studies led to 6 publications in refereed journals on a variety of chemical topics.  However, the more important broader impact was for this cohort of American students to have the opportunity to work in an international laboratory and to experience the differences in both professional and personal cultures.   These early career graduate and undergraduate students will eventually become valuable members of the STEM workforce, and this type of integrated training is a crucial part of their preparation to become valuable contributors to a scientific workforce that is becoming increasingly international.
