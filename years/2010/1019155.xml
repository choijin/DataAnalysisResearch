<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and junior faculty to attend the 2010 Gordon Research Conference on Magnetic Nanostructures to be held August 8 - 13, 2010.  This conference will bring together leading researchers in nanomagnetism to discuss the latest findings, interact with young scientists, and set future directions for exploration.  Along with an electrical charge, electrons have a magnetic, quantum mechanical property know as "spin."  This conference provides a forum to discuss spin-dependent and magnetic phenomena in systems at the nanoscale.  Spintronics, a potential new technology that will use an electron?s spin instead of its charge, continues to be a prominent area, but the study of magnetic nanostructures encompasses a wide variety of topics.  Along with traditional topics such as magnetic tunnel junctions, spin-polarized materials, and patterned nanomagnets, which continue to be topics of great interest, the 2010 conference will include sessions in emerging areas: spintronics in semiconductors and graphene, magnetically drive gene delivery, magnetoelectric memory, and spin batteries. The coupling between magnetism and heat is a completely new theme for this meeting. This is a unique conference because of the extended discussions and ample opportunities for interaction between leaders in the field and young scientists.</AbstractNarration>
