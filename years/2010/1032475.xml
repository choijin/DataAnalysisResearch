<AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of Dr. Scott L. Fedick, Lucia Gudiel will examine the presence and significance of root-crops for the ancient lowland Maya. While much is known about the ancient Maya's accomplishments in art, architecture, astronomy, and mathematics, the basic question of how they fed their large populations is not as well understood.  Recent paleoethnobotanical research has demonstrated that ancient Maya diet included a wide array of plant foods but due to tropical conditions, such as high humidity and deleterious soil chemistry, the recovery of plant remains is difficult thus leaving gaps in knowledge of ancient Maya subsistence. One such gap is the significance of root-crops in ancient Maya diet.  While the delicate tissue of root crops is rarely recovered from archaeological deposits, evidence of their presence has been found in the form of microscopic starch grains.  Starch grains are bodies that serve as the primary form of energy for plants.  Starch grain development and morphology are under genetic control, thus starch grains differ between plant families, genera and oftentimes species allowing the identification of starch from different plants.  Due to its ubiquity in plants, its varied morphology, its resistance to grinding, drying and sometimes carbonization, starch has become a significant means for documenting ancient plant-use and cultivation in tropical areas.  There are currently very few studies focused on recovering starch in the lowland Maya region and this study will be one of the first to study the implications of starch for documenting the presence of root-crops in the region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study focuses on starch grain analysis and data garnered from ethnographic observation, sampling of modern-day houselots, and from experimental and replicative studies.  Cultural processes, such as the location, preparation, and disposal of food, and natural processes, such temperature and moisture, alter material remains morphologically, quantitatively, spatially and relationally, thereby transforming the archaeological record.  In order to understand how to acquire evidence of root-crops in the archaeological record it is important to account for how root-crops are culturally processed, how these processes affect their starch grains, and in what conditions starch is preserved.  Observing modern-day Maya use-history of root-crops will provide an understanding of the relationship between cultural behaviors and the location, condition, and how the physical evidence of the plant (starch) might enter the archaeological record.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this study are the contribution of live specimens of wild and domesticated varieties of indigenous root-crops to botanic gardens at Mexican institutions for study, in situ conservation, and the maintenance of biodiversity.  One of the primary objectives of the Alfredo Barrera Marin Botanic Garden in Puerto Morelos, Quintana Roo is to educate the public to understand and respect traditional Maya lifeways, and the contribution of root-crop specimens and data will add to this goal.  Research results will be used to develop projects with the local Mexican university, Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan located in Merida, Yucatan and with local Maya communities that seek to document and conserve traditional Maya foodways and develop sustainability programs in local communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Although root and tuber crops are the second most important set of food crops in developing countries and are staples in many tropical areas, these crops are under-researched.  This study will yield insight into the history and modern-day practices concerning a currently under-researched, under-valued yet very important resource in tropical America.</AbstractNarration>

Observing modern-day Maya use of root-crops provided an understanding of the relationship between cultural behaviors and the location, the condition, and how physical evidence of the plant might enter the archaeological record.   Research methods represent three different approaches:   I.  Ethnographic research that included documenting current root-crop use, mapping houselots, and sampling soil from contexts where root crops were processed or discarded.       Ethnographic data was used to inform what, when, and where the remains of root-crops would enter the archaeological record. The focus of ethnographic fieldwork was to document patterns of discard of food remains and activity areas in order to ascertain the best households and areas for yielding starch evidence of root crops.  Interview questions and activities were geared towards observing where trash was deposited, how and where root-crops remains were discarded, and any particular activities that would most likely lead to evidence of root-crop evidence in the household.  Areas associated with root-crop use and discard were photographed, described, mapped and sampled.  II.  The replication of cultural behaviors affecting root-crop starch and analysis of the resulting starch granule damage.       The behaviors associated with the processing of root-crops observed during ethnographic observation were replicated in order to inform the condition in which starch may be found in archaeological contexts. A working laboratory was prepared and experimental tests were conducted involving cooking and processing of root-crops.  Various processing methods observed and recipes recorded during ethnographic fieldwork were replicated, and involving grinding, mashing, boiling, roasting, etc. Root-crops processed included manioc, malanga, arrowroot, and sweet potato.  III. Taphonomical studies to monitor preservation and determine damage to starch granule morphology caused by soil conditions.       Taphonomical studies were done to yield insight into the relationship between natural conditions and preservation of starch, how soil conditions affect starch morphology, and the possiblity of distinguishing starch damage from cultural vs. natural soil processes.  Starch was deposited into two plots in the field research area.

Analysis of starch samples is ongoing. When analysis is completed research results will build a knowledge base that will help archaeologists establish appropriate sampling strategies and efficient methods of recovering plant remains in the lowland Maya region. Data results will yield insight into methods and spatial organization of food processing and other behavioral aspects of ancient Maya subsistence. The ethnographic ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
