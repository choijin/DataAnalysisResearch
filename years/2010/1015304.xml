<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation on the R/V Roger Revelle, a 273' general purpose Global vessel; the R/V Melville, a 279' general purpose Global vessel; the R/V New Horizon, a 170', general purpose, Intermediate vessel and the R/V Sproul, a 125' general purpose Regional vessel. All four vessels are operated by Scripps Institute of Oceanography as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. One of the requests in this proposal will be funded as a group purchase through another institution and another request already exists in a fleet pool and will be devilvered to the institution. This award includes two items: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 1) IXSEA PHINS motion sensor   &lt;br/&gt; 2) Knudsen 3260 Echosounder (6 systems)  &lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers. The acquisition of the components for the sonar systemes on the Scripps vessels will allow this important functionality of bottom and sub-bottom tracking to be maintained in this hub institution on the West Coast.</AbstractNarration>
