<AbstractNarration>0934004&lt;br/&gt;Becker&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In situ bioremediation based on biological reductive dehalogenation is now an established remediation approach for sites contaminated with aqueous-phase chlorinated ethenes.  However, the EPA estimates that chlorinated ethenes are present as dense non-aqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs) at 46,000 contaminated sites in the U.S. The presence of DNAPL forms of these contaminants, which are known or suspected carcinogens, is a major obstacle to remediation efforts that has widespread implications for human and ecological health. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Importantly, abiotic dissolution of DNAPLs into groundwater is a slow process and may require several hundred years to deplete the DNAPL source of contamination. Several in situ DNAPL treatment methods use physicochemical processes to mobilize and subsequently capture and/or destroy contaminants and thus accelerate the clean-up process. These methods can be difficult and costly to implement and may preclude bioremediation of dissolved contaminants by making conditions inhospitable to microorganisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, interest has grown in the use dehalorespiring bacteria to treat DNAPLs through bioenhanced dissolution, i.e., enhanced mass removal from chlorinated ethene DNAPLs through reductive dechlorination of dissolved contaminants near the DNAPL-water interface. This approach is appealing because it does not rely on DNAPL mobilization and is compatible with the clean-up of dissolved contaminants using bioremediation. Although bioenhanced dissolution appears promising, the design of biological DNAPL source treatment measures using a "black box" approach may not promote and sustain the growth of the populations with the greatest potential to bioenhance dissolution rates. The proposed project focuses on understanding the interrelated roles that hydrodynamics and competition among different dehalorespiring populations, as well as other community members, play in determining the distribution of dehalorespiring populations in the DNAPL source zone and dissolved contaminant plume and the resulting impact on the magnitude of bioenhanced dissolution and the extent of detoxification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evaluation of the hydrodynamic and microbial controls on bioenhanced dissolution and detoxification of chlorinated ethenes will be accomplished using an integrated modeling and experimental approach that includes the following key objectives: &lt;br/&gt;(1) Mathematical modeling will be used to theoretically predict the relationships between microbial competition, hydrodynamic conditions, and bioenhancement for three model scenarios and design a micromodel system for studying DNAPL dissolution and source-zone microbial ecology at the porescale.&lt;br/&gt;(2) The micromodels will be used to independently estimate key system parameters and test model predictions for the three scenarios by experimentally evaluating the effects of microbial competition and hydrodynamics on population distribution, dissolution bioenhancement and plume detoxification. An innovative fluorescent in situ hybridization approach will be used to directly visualize and quantify population distribution in the micromodel. (4) An intermediate-scale flow cell will be used to test whether the micromodel experiments and mathematical modeling can predict bioenhancement effects in a scaled up system. (5) Mathematical modeling will be refined based on the experimental results and used to predict the effects of microbial competition and hydrodynamics on DNAPL source zone longevities for four DNAPL configurations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will advance our understanding of how hydrodynamic conditions and other factors influence the distribution and outcome of competition among dehalorespiring and other populations for growth substrates in environments containing DNAPL and dissolved contaminants. This information will transform how we interpret the biological and physical phenomena affecting contaminant behavior at the many sites containing DNAPL source zones and how we direct our remediation efforts at those sites. Most importantly, it will be used to determine the conditions under which biological source zone treatment is appropriate and design treatment systems that optimize bioenhancement of DNAPL dissolution and the realization of site clean-up goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering disciplines will be promoted through research experiences that partner community college (CC) students at a Minority Serving Institution with undergraduate students at the University of Maryland and provide training opportunities for CC faculty. The development of a short course offered through a major bioremediation conference, as well as an interactive Web-based simulation tool, will ensure results are broadly disseminated and applied and promote lifelong learning among bioremediation practitioners.</AbstractNarration>
