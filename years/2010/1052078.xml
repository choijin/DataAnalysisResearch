<AbstractNarration>Diatoms are unicellular photosynthetic plankton that contribute significantly to global carbon, nitrogen, and silicate biogeochemical cycles.  Diatoms are estimated to account for 40% of the carbon fixed in marine ecosystems and 20% of the primary productivity on Earth.  They exhibit rapid growth in response to increases in nitrogen availability, which in marine ecosystems, varies over several spatial (meters to kms) and temporal (hours to months) scales.  Thus, the productivity and ecological success of diatoms can, in part, be attributed to their ability to rapidly sense and respond to fluctuations in nitrogen source and supply. In all living cells, the regulation of gene expression is a multifaceted and dynamic process.  Cells integrate intrinsic and environmental signals into multiple regulatory pathways allowing for coordinated gene expression and cellular function.  This project uses molecular approaches to explore the hypothesis that in marine diatoms, post-transcriptional regulation of genes involved in nitrogen transport and assimilation is mediated by changes in messenger RNA stability and allows for rapid metabolic response to changes in nutrient source or supply. The increased availability of diatom genome sequences and advances in DNA transformation capabilities have stimulated biotechnological explorations using diatoms, including both nutritional and industrial applications.  The ability to engineer and regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally will aid in the development of new biotechnological tools needed to study and regulate gene expression in diatoms. The research program provides training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and a post-doctoral scholar.  The project will contribute to teacher training, and thus science education throughout the Worcester community, by working collaboratively with faculty in the Jacob Hiatt Center for Urban Education at Clark University to develop a K-16 "learning progression" exploring climate change while providing enhanced science training to pre- and in-service public school teachers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellecultual Merit  The assimilation of inorganic nitrogen (N) into organic compounds is a key process regulating the growth and productivity of photosynthetic eukaryotes. Diatoms are unicellular photoautotrophs that contribute significantly to global biogeochemical cycles.  They exhibit rapid growth in response to increases in N availability, which in marine ecosystems, varies over several spatial and temporal scales.

In all living cells, the regulation of gene expression is a multifaceted and dynamic process. Cells integrate intrinsic and environmental signals into multiple regulatory pathways allowing for coordinated gene expression and cellular function. While there has been much focus on patterns of coordinated gene transcription, there are now examples for diverse prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms of coordinated post-transcriptional regulation of mRNAs encoding functionally related proteins.  This project explored the general hypothesis that post-transcriptional regulation of genes involved in nitrogen assimilation in marine diatoms allows for rapid metabolic response in to perturbations in nutrient source or supply.       Nitrate and ammonium are two common forms of nitrogen assimilated by marine diatoms. Using Ammonium is often more favored, as less cellular energy is required to assimilate ammonium in amino acids.

In contrast to the response to ammonium, degradation rates of NR mRNA decreased during nitrogen starvation while those of Fd-NiR were unchanged. These results indicate that the coordination of post-transcriptional processes may vary in response to different environmental signals.  Furthermore, decreased rates of NR mRNA degradation, may allow these transcripts to accumulate during periods of N-limitation and allow the cells to be poised to respond rapidly to nitrate resupply.     In-vivo metabolic labelling of mRNA demonstrated that NR and Fd-NiR are transcribed during periods of N-starvation.  The combination of transcription, reduced degradation, and reduced dilution due to slower rates of cell division, may allow for the accumulation of NR transcripts to during periods of N-limitation and allow the cells to be poised to respond rapidly to nitrate resupply.   Broader Impacts  The underlying molecular mechanisms and not understood, this research elucidated molecular responses to variations in N supply and the ecologically significant interaction between nitrate and ammonium assimilation observed in marine diatoms.  The work provides a foundation for future studies examining global coordinated changes in transcription and transcript stability, which may include both RNA binding proteins as well as regulatory RNAs.  The increased availability of genomic and transformation tools has stimulated biotechnological explorations using diatoms, including both nutritional and industrial applications. The ability to engineer and regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally will aid in the development of new biotechnological tools needed to regulate gene expression in diatoms.  The research program provided training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students as well as a post-doctoral fellow.  In addition, the PI developed curricular exercises to enhance undergraduate student understanding of linkages between biogeochemical cycles and climate change, and conducted workshops for public school teachers in the Worcester Public Schools and high school students.
