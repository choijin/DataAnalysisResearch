<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on recruiting academically talented, but financially needy students into the high technology disciplines of Computer Science, Computer Information Systems, Computer Systems Engineering, Information Technology and Mathematics. The project builds on the rich scholarship infrastructure that has been created at the University of Houston-Clear Lake. This infrastructure includes faculty mentoring, peer mentoring, partnerships with the surrounding community colleges, career enrichment activities, and a strong placement program. Through the current project, this infrastructure is enhanced by an incentive-based system to encourage increased participation of faculty mentors, S-STEM scholars, community college instructors and industrial partners. The project plans to award 18 scholarships with an average of $7,300 annually for four years.</AbstractNarration>
