<AbstractNarration>The project is a combined observational and modeling study of small-vertical-scale velocity structures (SVSs) in the equatorial Pacific Ocean.  The PIs have very strong credentials, prior accomplishments , and have designed a comprehensive field experiment and numerical process studies to achieve their goals. The observations will be made using an array of moorings with profiling sensors that move on the mooring lines, and instrument deployments during two cruises to measure ocean structure, currents, and microstructure turbulence. Numerical modeling will be used to test the formation of SVSs by wind forcing, shear instability, and instabilities of internal gravity waves.  The project has strong intellectual merit in both the topic of study and the synergy between observations and modeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The robustness of climate predictions depends on the effectiveness of atmosphere and ocean models to capture the essential physics of the problem. The strong relationship between the coupled ocean/atmosphere system and ocean mixing means that mixing has to be right. For instance, the linking of thermocline mixing to wind variability through NIO propagation raises the possibility of scale?interactions producing significant feedbacks between ENSO and small?scale mixing. The work has the potential to yield transformative results on the processes that control the mixing of heat and momentum in the equatorial oceans, which is pertinent to attempts to model and predict changes in climate.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal includes the training and mentorship of a graduate student. The student will gain skills in linking observations and models which are vitally important in improving the reliability of models used in societally relevant science. Outreach activities will include: a web site publicizing the science behind the project and results, the inclusion of results in courses given by the PIs, and an invitation to a local high school teacher to participate in one or more cruises. Overall this project is a bold and comprehensive approach to studying poorly understood oceanic features with wide ranging implications for oceanography and climate.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The tropics play a prominent role in earth's time-varying climate system due to the strong coupling between the ocean and atmosphere that occurs there, and the ability of disturbances at low latitude to influence weather patterns far from the equator.  El Nino in the Pacific is arguably the most well known of these coupled air-sea modes of variability.  Air-sea interaction is intimately tied to conditions at the ocean surface, particularly sea surface temperature.  In turn, sea surface temperature is sensitive to mixing processes in the ocean that can stir up cold waters from below causing surface cooling and reduced air-sea heat exchange.  Studies to better understand ocean mixing processes in the tropics are thus motivated.      The MIXET collaborative project ("Mixing in the Equatorial Thermocline") was a combined observational and modeling study of small-vertical-scale velocity structures in the western equatorial Pacific Ocean that may play a role in ocean mixing. The field program included deployment of a 5-element moored array spanning the equator, and instrument deployments during two cruises to measure ocean currents and turbulence. Numerical modeling was used to test the hypotheses for the formation of small-vertical-scale velocity structures by wind forcing and instability of the ocean currents.  The lead scientific effort for MIXET was based at the University of Hawaii - the WHOI element (this grant) consisted of technical support of the field program.     The five moorings, each with suites of instrumentation, were constructed using equipment from the WHOI Physical Oceanography Observing Laboratory (POOL) and the Mooring Operations, Engineering, and Field Support Group (a.k.a. Rigging Shop) in combination with expendable mooring components (anchor, wire rope, shackles, etc). WHOI technicians participated on the mooring deployment and recovery cruises to conduct/direct those operations. After recovery, the WHOI group was tasked with offloading data from the moored instruments, performing basic-level processing, and providing those data to the lead investigators in Hawaii who were responsible for all of the scientific analysis.      Data return from the MIXET moored array was not as good as hoped. Most serious was the loss of the top 300 m of the mooring that was deployed at 3N (and the associated instrumentation and buoyancy sphere). Fishing activity is suspected as causing the mooring break, and probably also damage to the satellite transmitter mounted on the sphere that is designed to alert users to premature surfacing of the mooring. (No transmissions from the mooring were logged after it was deployed.) In addition, the performance of some of the instruments that were recovered was below expectations, specifically that of the McLane Moored Profilers. It is not known if mooring dynamics due to the strong equatorial undercurrent may have degraded the performance of the MMPs (a worry expressed to the MIXET lead investigator during the initial planning phase of the study).  Separate from this specific project, ideas for improving the performance of Moored Profilers in strong ocean currents have been developed and proposals to build and test a new generation of moored profiling instrument system have been submitted.
