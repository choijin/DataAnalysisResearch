<AbstractNarration>Energy for Maine (ME) is a three-year project that will develop, implement and evaluate a model to increase the STEM competencies and career aspirations of students in rural communities. The project will directly engage at least 50 teachers, 100 students and their families to increase STEM energy content knowledge and technology proficiencies by analyzing, discussing, and responding to locally-relevant energy issues through both in- and out-of-school activities. This model will be developed on Maine's islands and coastal communities by networking 17 middle and high schools through interdisciplinary professional development experiences, project-based technology integration in the classroom, and home-based enrichment activities. The goal of the project is to increase students' understanding, motivation, and self-efficacy towards STEM concepts and careers through their participation in innovative technology-infused energy inquiry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will build upon the successful model for teacher professional development that was developed by the CREST program (NSF Awards: 0525118 &amp; 0737588), as it will combine place-based education strategies, nonhierarchal learning environments, and integrated technology to stimulate inquiry-based learning. While deploying innovative new approaches to facilitate inter-generational learning, the project will integrate the analysis of real-time energy data in the classroom to motivate student engagement and meet learning standards through a local context. Students will strengthen their understanding of fundamental concepts in physics (e.g. electricity and transformation of energy) and engineering (e.g. power generation and distribution, home heating and heat transfer) as they learn how these concepts influence the efficient use of energy in their own homes and community buildings.</AbstractNarration>

The evaluation confirmed the significance of the projectÆs Summer Institute (SI) professional development model, where selected students and teachers participated in a one-week, campus-based training and activity event.  The SIÆs non-hierarchical learning model consistently yielded very favorable results in knowledge gain for both teachers and students. The specially designed curriculum resulted in significant changes in four of the five outcomes: awareness, behavior, career attitudes, and knowledge.  Student engagement in out-of-school E4ME activities often predicted gains above and beyond the classroom level.  E4ME students were significantly better at reading and interpreting graphs compared to students who experienced the project through the classroom only.     Broader Impact: As stated, participating communities saved more than $135,000 in homeowner and school building electricity costs, which equals 900,000 lbs. of carbon or 1,000,000 kWh of energy. In addition to the immediate cost benefits to homeowners, school departments and facilities managers, this tangible evidence of cost savings increased interest and engagement by the broader community in energy efficiency strategies, and motivated participation in other energy-saving initiatives of the Island Institute, such as our Weatherization Program. We researched environmental and conservation psychology to understand how to communicate environmental problems and pose energy reduction actions as achievable solutions that individuals can take to seemingly insurmountable problems, such as climate ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
