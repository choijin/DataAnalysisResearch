<AbstractNarration>NSF STS Dissertation Improvement Grant &lt;br/&gt;Manuel Castells and Jingfang Liu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;This project is a study of green Information Technology (green IT), which has emerged as a cutting-edge form of sustainable technological innovation  and one of the key social and business phenomena in the past few years.  The research will be grounded in a process view of communication and change and move to explore the values of environmental sustainability, the high tech industry's evolving orientation and struggle toward environmental sustainability, and their adoption of changes in organizational behavior surrounding various types of green IT innovation. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;The study will address the following primary research questions: What are the meanings of green IT and IT greening? Why are high-tech firms adopting green IT innovation and why can green IT be structured as a necessity or an opportunity? How are high-tech firms adopting green IT innovation and what communication processes are involved in both the discursive and practice change of IT greening and organizational change?  The project proposes a mixed method using qualitative case studies to inform a quantitative study of industry-wide green IT innovation. The case study will also be supplemented with a preliminary set of interviews with green IT experts and change agents from diverse organizations and agencies. As the main methodology, the case study will involve several comparative case studies of selected IT firms using a combined method of in-depth interviews, critical document review, and participant observation. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impact&lt;br/&gt;With empirical data from  a leading-edge technological and organizational innovation, this project will help advance academic inquiry in the fields of communication, science-technology-society, organizational change, technological innovation, and business and environment. The project also bears crucial meanings by providing valuable lessons and reality check for business and organizations at large as they consider strategies about how to move towards being environmentally sustainable as well as economically viable through green IT.</AbstractNarration>

The focus of the project is examining how motivations, meaning construction of green IT, organizational cultures, and communication of green IT influence its development as well as how the development may contribute to organizational cultural change. Some key findings are summarized here.  First, new motivations were found including "IT and energy efficiency", "employeesÆ beliefs and passion", and "a due driver of cost savings and environmental sustainability".  Among them, the pragmatic motivation &ndash; "IT and energy efficiency" is ranked as the number one driver, the two other motivations, however, were considered less important. Interestingly, the second most important motivation found is "social and environmental responsibilities", while "financial reasons" was not considered a highly important motivation. Second, green IT is often constructed as a holistic strategy covering pragmatic business, environmental, and normative dimensions, although it is still considered primarily as a pragmatic business strategy rather than a CSR strategy. Third, culture is found to play a crucial role in the development of green IT strategy. Forming a strategy as special and value-laden as green IT is requires the presence of several cultural characteristics in the organizations including participation, collaboration, and InnoPreneuriship cultures. This echoes the finding that green IT strategy requires some degree of grassroots efforts that introduce and circulate the idea and call for active involvement from passionate employees. This finding calls for the attention to the cultivation of grassroots efforts in promoting green IT as it is being developed as a mixed strategy. Meanwhile, developing a green IT strategy requires a company pursue a set of initiatives to green its internal IT infrastructure, facilities, and peopleÆs awareness and behaviors that matches its external marketing efforts. This speaks of an active attitude that organization...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
