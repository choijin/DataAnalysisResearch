<AbstractNarration>This project examines the impact of voter stereotypes on support for women candidates for governor, U.S. House, and U.S. Senate.  Previous research has clearly documented the fact that people hold clear political gender stereotypes about the abilities and personalities of women and men candidates in the United States.  Yet, we know much less about whether and how these stereotypes shape whether people will actually vote for women candidates or whether they are more likely to choose men.  Beyond this general lack of clarity, we also know relatively about whether the level (national v. statewide) and type (legislative v. executive) of office matters to levels of support for women candidates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several goals for this project: 1) to examine the impact of gendered attitudes on the fortunes of real candidates in actual elections by employing a random national sample of U.S. adults, 2) to examine the impact of these attitudes, such as political gender stereotypes, alongside other important influences on vote choice, such as political party, incumbency status, and candidate experience, 3) to determine whether people's support for women candidates is dependent, in part, on the level and type of office they seek, 4) to evaluate the attitudes and other factors by comparing races in which a woman runs against a man with those in which both candidates are men, and 4) to expand our measures of gender attitudes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project represents a significant advancement in the state of our knowledge about the opportunities for women candidates.  The range of topics addressed in this project will have appeal across several cognate disciplines, including political science, sociology, psychology, and gender studies.  Undergraduate and graduate students will gain valuable research experience by working on this project.  Finally, the project will have an impact in the world beyond academia.  As the number of women candidates increases, journalists and political commentators seek information on how to evaluate the role of gender in American politics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ When women run for elected office in the United States, there is often an assumption that people may be biased against them and will be hesitant to vote for them.  This belief stems from a long history in which women were excluded from running for and holding public office.  Societal attitudes about women's place concluded that they were not suited for the rough and tumble of the political world.  Over time, these attitudes toward women have changed, but vestiges of stereotyped thinking still remain.  Observers of the 2008 elections will recall that Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin both endured inappropriate commentary about their candidacies, discussion that focused on their looks, their parental status, and their abilities to serve in high level office.    While there is often anecdotal evidence that women candidates are seen through the lens of gender stereotypes, there is little empirical evidence of whether this is the case in a widespread or systematic way.  With this grant, I attempted to gather data that would allow me to examine how people think about women candidates and whether these women are evaluated and supported differently than are men candidates.  In doing so, I conducted a public opinion survey during the 2010 midterm elections.  Over 3100 U.S. adults responded to a questionnaire that sought their attitudes about women in political life and their reactions to the women and men candidates who ran in races in which respondents voted.  These elections included races for the U.S. House, U.S. Senate, and governor.  In all, I find that there is little evidence that women candidates are hampered by sexist or stereotyped thinking on the part of voters.  What matters most in evaluating candidates is their political party identification.  The things that cause people to vote for women candidates are the same things that determine voting for men - political party, incumbency status, campaign spending.  Women candidates in the survey won their elections at the same rates as did the men and received, on average, higher and more positive evaluations from voters.
