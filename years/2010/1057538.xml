<AbstractNarration>The proposed workshop focuses the attention of leading environmental philosophers and ethicists on the gap between contemporary ecological science and the most up-to-date understanding of ethics.  The contemporary science of ecology has made great strides in long-term understanding of wild, managed, and settled ecosystems, increasingly drawing upon recent connections with social sciences and economics.  However, as the need for environmental decision making becomes more pervasive as a result of global changes in climate, urbanization, conversion of wild ecosystems, pollution, and human migrations, the frontier that ecology might share with a rigorous understanding of ethics is undeveloped.  This Cary Conference is a pioneering interdisciplinary meeting to help leading philosophers and ethicists on the one hand, and leading ecological scientists on the other, to develop new understanding at the interface between their disciplines.  A new interdisciplinary research agenda will be produced as a result of the deliberations at this workshop.  Discussions will explore how to exploit the research agenda for ecological ethics in the context of the long-term ecological research network and other research and management platforms in the United States, as well as in the large and growing international arena of socio-ecological long-term research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Environmental decision making draws upon and is evaluated in the context of human values.  Consequently, it is a process that has ethical implications.  However, it is the scientific, social, political, and economic dimensions of environmental decision making that are most often employed in practice.  Pairing an ethical dimension with the scientific foundations of environmental decision making can clarify the nature of the process and make it more effective in situations where equity of the process and outcomes must be ensured.  The proposed workshop will explore how to incorporate the emerging understanding of ecological ethics advanced by the dialog of the workshop in educational programs at secondary, undergraduate, and graduate levels.  It will also examine the ways in which the frontier between ecology and ethics can improve the application of research results obtained from existing and planned long-term social-ecological research projects.  A wide diversity of participants including undergraduates, graduate students and beginning faculty from the U.S. and Chile will participate.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has significant Broader Impacts, as shown by recent deliberations. The Earth Summit, Rio+20, held in June 2012 in Brazil, showed again the great need for an environmental ethics to integrate the technical-scientific description of this dramatic global change with a holistic normative framework.1 This deficit of environmental ethics in Rio+20 is symptomatic of two broader phenomena: (1) This ethical discipline is still at an incipient stage of development in the academy, the public discourse, and policy.  (2) The global discourse does not adequately include the diversity of environmental disciplines and of cultures, with their ontologies, metaphysics, epistemologies, ethics and ecological worldviews, due in part to the limited interdisciplinary and intercultural dialogue among environmental scientists and philosophers.  These two deficits reflect the Intellectual Merit and the Broader Impacts of the project summarized here.  Our Cary Conference entitled "Linking Ecology and Ethics for a Changing World: Values, Philosophy, and Action," and its homonymous forthcoming book, to be published by Springer, seek to help overcome these problems.  The integration of ecology and environmental philosophy can serve both basic science and practical environmental decision-making. There are several such positive benefits.  First, philosophy can expose the epistemological assumptions and values behind important ecological approaches used in environmental problem solving.   Second, ethical analysis exposes the values involved in responding to key features of the unfolding global environmental crisis.  Better understanding of the linkages between ecological sciences and ethics is vitally important for prudent decision-making regarding both social and ecological concerns, and can guide effective transdisciplinary collaboration for addressing environmental issues under different modes of governance.   Furthermore, philosophical analyses help us understand and integrate traditional ecological knowledge into sustainable resource management practices, and promote the involvement of local communities into the critical analysis of their socio-ecological setting and into collaborative decision-making.  Because values emerge from culture, tradition, beliefs, and social adaptation of the people who inhabit, benefit from, manage or govern ecosystems within a region or landscape, the integration of multiple socio-cultural perspectives in the decision-making process will help to achieve sustainability, and to avoid inequities for disenfranchised and marginalized groups.  In summary, through its activities and publications our Cary Conference will enable a new level of integration between ecological, scientific and philosophical, theory and practice to address the current complex eco-social challenges at regional and planetary scales.  1 Eduardo Viola &amp; Antonio Carlos Lessa (eds.), "Global climate governance and transition to a low-carbon economy", Special Issue, Revista Brasileira de Politica Internacional 55 (2012):1-189.
