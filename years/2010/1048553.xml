<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities: Multi-user (CRIF:MU) program, Professor Carol Korzeniewski and colleagues Christopher Bradley, Dominick Casadonte, Michael Mayer and William Nes from Texas Tech University will acquire a cyber-enabled premium-shielded 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research training and education at all levels, especially in areas of study such as (a) development of cobalt catalysts for hydrocarbon activation/functionalization, (b) photochemical studies of metal phenanthroline-based molecular assemblies, (c) synthetic, structural and reactivity studies on zwitterionic metal silanides, siloxides and silane dendrimers, (d) development of neuropeptide mimics and enantioselective synthesis using chiral N-phosphonyl imines, (e) preparation of mechanically interlocked polymeric materials, and (f) studies to unravel sterol biosynthesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to follow the progress of chemical reactions, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solids and in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to carry out frontier chemistry related research and to train students in modern research techniques. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact on organic, materials, electronics and bioorganic chemistry research. The resources will be used not only for research activities but also for research training of undergraduate and graduate students including those from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The grant made possible the purchase of a 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer by Texas Tech University.  Spectra produced by NMR spectroscopy help researchers to elucidate detailed properties of molecules, such as their structure and identity. Since early 2012, the purchased instrument has been in regular use for both basic research and educational purposes.  The autosampling capability offered by the spectrometer has substantially improved the throughput of NMR experiments, facilitating greater experience with NMR spectroscopy in the classroom and allowing for increased frontier research.   Basic research activities advanced by the NMR spectrometer include investigations of mixed-ligand metal complexes with diimines, a class of molecules whose properties offer potential for moving forward applications of organic light emitting diodes, catalysts for water splitting and organic synthesis, agents for chemical sensing, and more.  The NMR also was utilized to further the field of imine chemistry, an area crucial for the preparation of natural products and medicinal compounds.  Other work targeted the elucidation of biochemical pathways and the properties of polymers.   The studies made possible by this grant extend to several outreach programs. During the summers, high school students are trained in chemical synthesis and NMR techniques.  The facility also partners with regional campuses in West Texas that serve primarily undergraduate students.  Having access to state-of-the-art NMR instrumentation has provided students at all levels with experience crucial for staying current with modern evolving technology and has led to several publications that include high school and undergraduate students as co-authors.
