<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to engineer a rapid and ultrasensitive microsystem that has the function of efficient preconcentration, and rapid as well as ultrasensitive detection using magnetic nanoparticles. This project utilizes an interdisciplinary approach to study the nanoparticle-enhanced preconcentration and detection, and its integration to the microfluidic device. Microreactor concept for the mixing unit will be used to predict and characterize the seperation efficiency, considering the magnetically active mixing and transport in the preconcentration unit. Magnetic nanoparticle will be used as label to amplify detection signal for miniaturizable Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) detection.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The integrated sensing microsystem has the prospect of producing low-cost, rapid, and hand-held devices for the practice of diagnostic medicine, the identification of biological weapons, the control of food safety and environmental pollutions, and basic life sciences research.  The layered architecture of integrated research and mentoring for a continuum of students from middle school to graduate students will advance awareness of bionanotechnology to middle school teachers/students through Research Experience for Teachers (RET) program. It will also provide opportunities to recruit and retain underrepresented students, with a focus on female students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There is increasing demand for low-cost hand-held detection devices that are able to perform biological detection in real-time using a small amount of sample.  Such a field-ready device with high sensitivity would find wide-spread use for the practice of diagnostic medicine, the identification of biological weapons released in urban areas, tighter control of food safety, and rapid detection of environmental pollution.  Research in microfluidics focused primarily on the study of the inherent diffusion limitation phenomena when the device scale is in the micro-domain, and to develop innovative means to overcome the limitation.   Rapid development of microanalytical devices has provided convenience and capability for disease diagnosis, drug screening, or forensic applications. However, sensitive and selective detection platform that can be integrated into portable devices is still a challenge. We developed biosensor that combines the advantage of nanotechnology and aptamer technology.  It advanced understanding and discovery through our second year program and senior projects where graduate students will be mentors. And, it also provided opportunities to recruit and retain underrepresented students (with a focus on female students). The  research has a society impact of addressing the compelling economic incentives for rapid, inexpensive and sensitive detection, for the diagnosis of disease markers, control of food safety and environmental pollutions or biohazards.
