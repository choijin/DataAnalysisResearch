<AbstractNarration>The University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMA) Teacher Fellowship/Master Teacher Fellowship (TF/MTF) Planning Grant supports the establishment of a partnership between UMA's Teacher Education and Curriculum Studies Department, the Colleges of Natural Sciences and Engineering; urban and rural high needs school districts (Springfield, Holyoke, Greenfield, Athol, Orange); and non-profit organizations in the Pioneer Valley for the purpose of developing a full Noyce Teacher Fellowship/Master Teacher Fellowship (TF/MTF) proposal.  The project responds to a critical need for outstanding middle and high school teachers of science and mathematics.  More than twenty planning meetings will be convened to develop professional development trajectories for Noyce Fellows.  Partners will: 1) examine school districts' needs for professional development; 2) implement and address the results of a School Needs Assessment; 3) plan for revision of current UMA NCATE-approved teacher education programs; 4) develop a plan for Virtual Communities of Practice (VCoP's); 5) establish plans for meaningful connections for MTF's within the initial teacher licensure programs; and 6) form linkages between teacher education and research projects in UMass STEM/CASA. Via the UMA Planning Grant, partners will also seek resources for the required 50% matching funds needed in the full proposal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This planning grant will allow the partners to work towards the integration of research-based concepts and the creation of a successful teacher education program that will address the concerns of high-needs school districts to acquire and retain effective teachers. Central goals include: 1) the development of effective communities via new technologies to address the common problem of teacher isolation and provide Fellows with long-term support; 2) integrate meaningful STEM research experiences as part of the teacher education experience; and 3) develop within a teacher education program, elements that will enable teachers to be culturally responsive to the students and the communities in which they teach.</AbstractNarration>

All partners moved towards alignment in vision for how UMass can better contribute to STEM education in schools. To better understand the challenges, weaknesses, and strengths of the school districts, we conducted a needs assessment through classroom observations and conversations. Through these mechanisms we were able to identify what was working, the challenges the teachers face, and the types of opportunities that would best address these challenges. To better understand how to build from existing University programs and extend opportunities for teacher development and leadership, we conducted a review of current UMass School of Education programs for mathematics and science teachers. Although University curriculum was not a primary focus of planning, UMass and school representatives began two-way conversations and listening that built trust for addressing mathematics and science curriculum and methods concerns. We also explored opportunities to collaborate with the College of Engineering, the College of Natural Sciences, nonprofit organizations, and industrial partners to provide rich professional development content.     Three shared visions emerged:  A commitment to the value of æreal worldÆ STEM research and community STEM experiences for teachers of mathematics and science,  A vision for replacing æone teacher, one touchÆ university outreach with æsustainable, systematic, district-wide impact on teaching and learningÆ, and A commitment to moving from long-standing working relationships between the School of Education and school districts, such as student teaching sites, to aligned partnerships based on common visions for classroom practice.   Other identified shared goals included the development of STEM content courses that integrate the use of technological tools to facilitate learning, the reduction of the isolation of classroom teachers through the development of a virtual community of practice (VCoP), and the retention of teachers. It was felt that the shared vision and goals would jointly meet the overall aim to increase student engagement and achievement via teacher understanding of subject matter for teaching, the development of culturally responsive pedagogies, and community connections.     The grant provided three graduate students in STEM Education with the opportunity to learn more about ways to use research protocols to collect classroom data and to use analysis tools to make sense of that data. These students were trained and had an opportunity to practice research techniques using the SAMPI classroom observation protocol. A total of 38 observations of mathematics and science classrooms in all four participating districts were completed by the project RAs. Based on preliminary findings, these data are in the process of being further analyzed for possible publication. The observations established UMass as a friendly research presenc...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
