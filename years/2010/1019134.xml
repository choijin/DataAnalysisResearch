<AbstractNarration>This project is intended to improve understanding of the importance and consequences of rapid industrialization in China not only for the environment of China but also for the environment of the world as a whole.  China is now the world's largest national emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2) and leads most likely also in emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx).  This research will implement studies of the processes affecting the abundance of ozone (O3) and other important chemical species in China, making extensive use of the GEOS-Chem 3-dimensional model applying the model to, among other sources of data, measurements from an observing station established in 2004 in collaboration with colleagues at Tsinghua University at Miyun, a rural site located approximately 100 km northeast of Beijing.  Essentially continuous data on O3, CO (carbon monoxide) and CO2 are available from this site since December, 2004, complemented more recently by continuous measurements of NO, NOy and SO2.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Addressing the challenge of potential present and future climate change is recognized as a globally significant objective.  The ultimate outcome will depend in large measure on development decisions made in China.  The research outlined here will feed into a larger multi-disciplinary program at Harvard conducted in collaboration with Chinese institutions and colleagues seeking to identify optimal sustainable paths for future development.  The results of this research will be integrated into the training and teaching of both undergraduate and graduate students at Harvard and will be published in a timely basis in the professional scientific literature.</AbstractNarration>

This research was conducted according to three themes, and was reported in 23 peer-reviewed papers and two PhD dissertations. Some highlights are described here.

One set of studies explored the relationship among three key thermodynamic parameters of the atmosphere&mdash;temperature, energy, and entropy&mdash;and introduced two variables that serve to quantify the thermodynamic disequilibrium of the atmosphere.

This non-equilibrium system acts as an engine, absorbing heat at higher temperatures and releasing it at lower temperatures. The process is responsible for production of wind kinetic energy at a rate of 2.46 W/m2 sustaining thus the circulation of the atmosphere against frictional dissipation. The results indicate an upward trend in kinetic energy production over the past 32 years, indicating that wind energy resources may be increasing in the current warming climate. These analyses provide an analytical framework that can be adopted for future studies addressing the ultimate wind energy potential and the possible perturbations to the atmospheric circulation that could arise as a result of large-scale exploitation of wind energy.  Additional studies under the first theme use observations from the teamÆs ground station near Beijing or from satellite-based instruments to characterize trends in concentrations of CO2, CO, O3, and aerosols in China and to use correlation analyses and other techniques to test the effects of the economic downturn and energy/environmental policies on Chinese emissions, combustion efficiency, and atmospheric concentrations (Fig 1).  Research in the second theme improved comprehensive bottom-up inventories of atmospheric emissions for China, including at the plant-by-plant level for key industries such as electric power, and applied them in analyses of trends, projections, and policy effectiveness. The studies also introduced improved uncertainty analyses into the Chinese emission inventory literature, using Monte Carlo simulations based on probability distributions for activity levels and emission factors, the latter compiled largely from the Chinese technical literature (Fig 2). The studies include the first bottom-up inventory of CO2 emissions in China, featuring the first formal statistical estimation of CO2 emission uncertainties (Fig 3).  Other studies assessed the effectiveness of current Chinese policies on emissions of SO2, NOX, CO, CO2, and primary aerosols of different size classes and chemical compositions. These studies also provided a core component of a book-length interdisciplinary assessment of the economic costs and environmental benefits of past and future emission controls in China.

This began with examination of a natural low-carbon transition occurring in the US power sector in 2008, which accounted for approximately 40 percent of total US greenhouse gas emissions. CO2 emissions from the power sector declined by 8.8 percent from 2008 to 2009. A model was developed to simulate the relative competitiveness of coal- and gas-fired power plants and was used to diagnose how the fuel mix in the U.S. power system responds over the short term to changing relative prices for coal and gas. The study found that when the cost differential for electricity generation using gas rather than coal falls below a critical value (2-3 cen...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
