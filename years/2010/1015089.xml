<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The current production of plastics poses several environmental concerns.  Most are derived from petroleum, contributing to the flux of carbon into the atmosphere.   Additionally, most do not degrade in the environment.   Some of these plastics may mechanically degrade, but mineralize at a much lower rate than they are produced; this leads to accumulation of improperly discarded plastics in the environment.  Plastics that are produced biologically and are fully biodegradable provide an alternative to avoid all these environmental disadvantages.  Polyhydroxyalkanoates are a class of polyesters that are produced by various bacteria, and can be used to replace conventional plastics in many products.  There are various classes or polyhydroxyalkanoates, and one variety, a copolymer with monomer units of various sizes has properties similar to the widely used low density polyethylene.  Production of this copolymer has had some limited success, but there exists much room for improvement.  One method for bacterial production makes use of and engineered beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (FabH) enzyme from E. coli to pull intermediates from fatty acid biosynthesis into polymer production.  Several mutations to the active site of the enzyme have been shown to alter the activity of this enzyme when tested in vitro, but the effects of these mutations on bacterial polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis were unknown.  By expressing the enzyme with these mutations in E.coli producing these plastics the effects of the mutations were tested.  One of the mutations led to a 6-fold increase in polyhydroxyalkanoate production within the E. coli cells.  This engineered enzyme will be used in future work in developing a process to bring these useful copolymers to consumers as a more environmentally friendly alternative to petroleum based plastics.  This work was carried out at Hokkaido University in Sapporo Japan with the aid of researchers there.  The findings were presented at PacifiChem 2010 in Honolulu Hawaii, and a manuscript will be submitted to a journal in the near future.
