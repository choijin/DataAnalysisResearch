<AbstractNarration>The Antarctic continent, its surrounding ocean and atmosphere are a vastly under observed region of the planet. Environmental observing systems have often historically been sited on largely subjective grounds, including logistic convenience and simple accessibility.  As environmental observing networks such as those  Antarctic Automated Weather Stations  (AAWS) are increasingly being relied upon for operational (e.g. numerical weather prediction), weather research (e.g. mesoscale meteorology, ecosystem change) and climate (e.g. ice mass balance; climate variability and change) studies, more objective considerations are needed for the economical and effective retention or expansion of limited observing assets. Emerging theory from network design offers the basis for some objective guidance in this area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gridded data from (archived) Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction Systems (AMPS) will be used by University of Washington and NCAR researchers to optimize the spatial correlation length scales for the existing AWS network via ensemble sensitivity theory.  These predictions of optimal station placement will in turn be subject to observing systems experiments (OSE) and observing system simulation experiments (OSSE), using both data denial and reconfiguration approaches. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of this research may inform the placement of the most spatially representative locations of AWS stations for both meteorology (e.g. NWP) and climate related studies. A graduate student and a post-doctoral associate will be involved in this interdisciplinary problem.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many environmental measurements are taken at locations that are chosen subjectively. These choices are often driven by specific goals of the measurements or by accessibility limits, but it is also important to inform these decisions with objective information that may, for example, increase the utility of the measurements at lower cost.  This project was aimed at testing a theory for the optimal objective siting of weather instruments with application to automated weather stations (AWSs) over Antarctica. The first part of the project involved an assessment of the performance of the existing AWS network, and the second part aimed to identify optimal locations for measuring the surface air temperature.   There are three key outcomes from this research project:  (1) We identified significant gaps in the current AWS observing network for surface air temperature, and attribute those gaps to spatial variations in station density and in the correlation length scale of temperature over Antarctica. Correlation length scales are found to be longer in summer than in winter, and longer in East Antarctica than in West Antarctica.   (2) We objectively identified the most important location for observing continent-averaged 2m air temperature, and the most important existing AWS locations for monitoring continent-average temperature (Megadunes region). Among current AWS stations, Vostok is the most important for monitoring and forecasting 2m air temperature averaged over the continent.   (3) We developed a new technique for network design theory, which generalizes from optimizing a scalar measure to an arbitrary number of measures. This may prove useful in other fields where one may wish to simultaneously optimize sensor placement across a number of locations and fields.
