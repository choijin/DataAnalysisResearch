The Travel Grants were assigned in collaboration between PI Franz Franchetti and the PACT General Chair Valentina Salapura (IBM T.J. Watson Research Center). Intellectual Merit 19 graduate students from 14 US universities were able to attend a premier conference in parallel computing. This aided exposing today's students to the concepts of parallel computing, which plays an important role in advancing the state of computing. Broader Impact The PACT travel grant directly contributes to the better understanding and better skills of the supported students. Attending a conference enables them to polish their networking and communication skills.        Last Modified: 08/08/2012       Submitted by: Franz Franchetti]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
