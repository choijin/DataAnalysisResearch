<AbstractNarration>This U.S.-Chile award will support an international workshop on Complex Analysis and Mathematical Physics to be held prior to the first-ever joint American Mathematical Society-Chilean Mathematical Society Meeting in Pucon, Chile that will take place in December, 2010.  The workshop will be organized jointly by a group of scientists at the University of Bio-Bio (UBB) in Chile, the Mathematical Institute at the University of Bergen, Norway (UiB) and at the University of South Florida (USF). This workshop will create new exciting opportunities for collaboration between these scientific communities and strengthen the Chile-US joint enterprise in Mathematics and Physics.  One of the new directions of research receiving considerable attention in South-American mathematical communities is the complex analysis and mathematical physics of two-dimensional phenomena, known as elliptic or Laplacian growth (or, Hele-Shaw flows). This elegant scientific field has recently found surprisingly many applications, which makes it interesting both for established researchers and their younger colleagues.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will provide an opportunity to develop new collaborations between mathematicians and physicists, Europeans and South and North Americans, young and experienced. In particular, the NSF funds will be used to bring a diverse group of young US researchers and graduate students into collaboration with South American colleagues. Two of the committee members are women who are visibly active, not only as researchers, but also as mentors who attract young women into mathematics. This will help to attract a significant number of women and minorities to participate in the workshop and will initiate their infusion into a larger group of scientists working in these areas.  This project is supported by the Americas Program of the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Analysis Program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The grant provided partial funding for the U.S. participation in a workshop organized jointly by a group of scientists at the University of Bio-Bio in Chile, the Mathematical Institute at the University of Bergen, Norway, and the University of South Florida, US.  The website for the conference can be found at http://org.uib.no/hcaa/CAMP.     The conference had 44 participants from Chile, Europe, and the US, which included experienced and younger mathematics and physics faculty, post-docs, and graduate students.  The major goal achieved was fostering new scientific collaborations between US and European scientists, young researchers and graduate students and their Chilean counterparts.   Several joint projects (including at least 4 research articles and one book) directly resulted from the discussions at the conference, including research which uncovered a novel link between deformations of manifolds via Ricci flow, arclength null quadrature domains, and equilibrium distributions of electrostatic multipoles.  Several graduate students from Europe, US and Chile enjoyed the unique opportunity of close collaborations with well-known and established mathematicians and physicists in a friendly and informal environment.  In particular, this budding collaboration was followed by a visit to the US from a Chilean graduate student then post-doc working in Norway.  At least six of the graduate students attending the conference have since graduated and have obtained post-doctorate positions.   Interactions between mathematicians and theoretical physicists attending the conference furthered the recent insight that methods previously used in integrable nonlinear equations could also be applied to random matrices and problems related to free fermions. Similar structures exist in random processes, and these methods effectively link several disciplines together. However, the methods and the related matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem had not so far found their way into the growing field of random processes governed by conformal invariance. The discussions and findings facilitated by this workshop helped significantly to narrow this gap.              Last Modified: 05/14/2013       Submitted by: Catherine A Beneteau]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
