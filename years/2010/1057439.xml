<AbstractNarration>The Sam Noble Museum, University of Oklahoma, will accession and protect the orphaned University of Memphis Mammal Collection, the largest collection of Tennessee mammals, by providing optimal storage conditions and strong support for its long-term preservation. The collection has important specimens, provides basic data on species diversity in Tennessee over time. The project will: provide new cabinets and shelves; curate the collection to the highest standards; improve access to specimens and data through digitization of the specimens; make data available to scientists and the public via the museum website and network portals; and increase the capacity for research and education to utilize the data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Sam Noble Museum, Oklahoma's state museum of natural history plays an important role in enhancing scientific literacy and the understanding of science and collections by society. The museum will use the data in programs, media outlets, events, and publications. The project will provide opportunities and experiences for graduate and undergraduate students and a museum intern to develop research and communication skills, learn museum methods and practices, and build capacity for life-long learning. Integration of the project with K-12 museum programs and workshops for teachers will engage the next generation of students in research.</AbstractNarration>
