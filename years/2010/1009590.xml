<AbstractNarration>In this project, Dr. Barsony and her collaborators will conduct an observational project to search for sub-stellar or planetary-mass objects in regions of star formation.  These objects, called T-dwarfs, are relatively luminous when young, and can be detected because they exhibit broad absorption features from methane in their spectra.  The research team will conduct a wide-area infrared survey to find T-dwarfs by imaging at the wavelength of the methane band and at an adjacent wavelength.  Objects that are faint in the methane band are likely to be T-dwarf stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research activity will have a broader educational impact through the involvement of undergraduate students in the research effort.  Students will be recruited at San Francisco State University and at Utah Valley State College (now Utah Valley University), and will have the opportunity to visit the other institution in the collaboration.  The detection of large numbers of T-dwarfs will help improve theories of star formation, especially in the domain between the least-massive stars and the most-massive planets.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Brown Dwarfs are star-like celestial bodies that lack the mass to produce energy as stars do: through nuclear fusion.  Planets are usually regarded as even less massive bodies that orbit stars. However, a class of Planet Mass Objects (known as "planemos" and by other names) might exist apart from any star.  Such objects could form via the process by which stars and brown dwarfs are formed, or by some other  means.  In any case, they will be more luminous, and easier todetect in the first few million years after their formation.  (Lacking a sustained source of energy, they subsequently become quite dim.)  This research program began as an attempt to find low mass planets andbrown dwarfs in young star forming regions by exploiting the fact that recently discovered low mass, cool brown dwarfs showed methane absorption features.  (Fig. 1) The atmospheres of planets and brown dwarfs with low temperatures will contain methane (CH4), which will absorb infrarred (IR) light as it does in Earth's atmosphere.  In fact methane absorption became the hallmark of a new class of substellar object: T-dwarfs.  Surprisingly, the candidates identified in our first round of observations did not yield any bona fide T dwarfs.   What we and other researchers realized is that young T dwarfs, because they are still forming, would have a different spectral signature than their older cousins.     Thus, we redesigned our observational strategy to utilize not just our own near infrared data but also mid infrared data obtained from the Spitzer Space Telescope's archive.  The additional data allow us to better determine the true nature of each of the thousands of star-like objects (sources) we detect.  The vast majority of these sources are not of interest to our goal: to determine if planets can form on their own.   Most are normal stars that happen to lie within or in front of the Star Forming Regions we investigate.    Sources could also turn out to be high mass brown dwarfs, distant giant stars or even entire galaxies, millions of light years away.    To distinguish these possibilities we use models developed by other researchers that predict the light output of planets, low- and high-mass brown dwarfs stars, and even galaxies.    We also account for the fact that light from an object in a star forming region will be dimmed by the dusty matter in the nebula.   This dimming, or extinction, depends upon the wavelength of the light, and can be predicted by comparing our observations of sources at different wavelengths.   (Fig. 2)  For each of the thousands of sources we observe, we attempt to fit the photometric data with one of several models representing different kinds of brown dwarfs, planets, stars and "black-body" thermal emitters.   Only those sources with emission consistent with a model of a giant planet or brown dwarf are retained in this analysis.   Further, we determine the amount of extinction and assess whether or not each object could be a member of the given star forming region (whose distances are known).  Using this method we were able to identify some 840 new members of the Rho Ophiuchi Star Forming Region, as shown in Fig. 3.   Many of these new members show an infrared excess, meaning that we detect more light at longer wavelenghts than would be expected from a simple star or brown dwarf.   This phenomenon is frequently seen in young stars, and is usually attributed to the presence of a disk of matter around the star, from which planets may form.  Even brown dwarfs have been detected with disks.  We have applied this  new technique to other star forming regions and found large numbers of previously unknown candidate planets and brown dwarfs.  The exact nature of such a sources can only be definitively determined through spectroscopic follow up, which is still ongoing.  This is a lengthy process because the sources in question are exceptionally faint, requiring many hours of observation on the largest telescopes on Earth under ideal con...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
