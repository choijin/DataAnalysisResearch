<AbstractNarration>Vertically aggrading large sinuous channels constitute the basic building blocks of modern submarine fans. In recent years, 3D high resolution seismic data have also revealed numerous small scale subsurface sinuous channels on continental slopes. Recent studies have contributed new insights, but have also led to strongly opposing views, specifically on the helical flow structure in sinuous channels and its effect on channel morphology. A clear picture of intra-channel and over-bank processes of submarine channels can emerge through a comprehensive approach involving carefully designed experimental and numerical modeling efforts and close collaboration with marine geologists involved in the study of seafloor morphology. The PI will pursue laboratory and numerical modeling with primary focus on the following issues: (i) geometric and inflow constraints on the flow distribution at submarine channel bends; (ii) relationships between helical flow, bed-load transport, cross sectional variability and migration tendency of submarine channels; (iii) and overbank processes including grain size distribution and lobe formation due to flow splitting at channel bends. Experiments will be conducted in a 12.2 m × 6.1 m × 1.5 m laboratory tank, and numerical simulations at both laboratory and field scales will be conducted using 3D models of density and turbidity currents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts relate to developing better landscape evolution models for submarine environments that would aid interpretation of seismic data sets by both academic and industry researchers. In addition to this the PIs outline a plan to increase minority involvement in geoscience research through funding of a program that the University of South Carolina already has in place. He also plans to hold a workshop.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Major Research Activities:   Simulation      of depositional turbidity currents with multiple grain-size classes in      sinuous unconfined rectangular and trapezoidal channels with different      channel side slope and sinuosity has been done. Laboratory-scale      modeling of saline flow to study the effect of cross-sectional shape, channel      slope, and confinement on secondary currents has been done. Field-scale      simulation has been done to study the effect of bend wave length on the      generation of bar-pool topography.   The      scale effect on turbidity currents has been studied by analyzing      non-dimensional governing equations and boundary conditions, and the      results have been confirmed by numerical simulations. Laboratory      experiments have been conducted to study colliding density currents over      an erodible bed. Laboratory      experiments are being conducted to study the reworking of bed material by      a saline flow in a sinuous channel. Turbulence      structure of fully-developed continuous turbidity currents is being      studied using the LES model.   Significant Results:     For the first time, discernible bar-pool topography has been generated from numerical simulation of turbidity currents at the field scale. If the bend wave length is sufficiently large, point bars appear near the inner bank of a channel bend, and the high velocity cores tend to be closer to the outer bank &ndash; conditions similar to those favoring growth and migration of subaerial meander bends. If the meander bend is tight, i.e. the wave length is short, the position of the point-bar and the locations of high velocity cores change creating a condition that is not favorable for the growth of channel meanders. From the scaling analysis of non-dimensional governing equations and boundary conditions, it has been shown that when densimetric Froude similarity is satisfied, the results would be scale-invariant for conservative density current under the rough turbulent condition. In case of purely depositional flows, truly scale-invariant results cannot be obtained, as the Reynolds-mediated scale effects appear in the bottom boundary condition of the flow velocity and the sediment fall velocity.

Numerical simulations confirmed the observation. From the data collected and analysis performed, a conceptual model of the characteristics of density current confluences is developed and compared with the expected characteristics of river confluences. Systematic application of well-established    Broader Impacts  The project has provided research and training opportunities to a doctoral and a masters student. Tow journal papers have been published, two are under review, and two are under preparation. Laboratory experiments and analysis of the data  have provided a first look into the hydro- and morpho-dynamic characteristics of submarine channel junctions.
