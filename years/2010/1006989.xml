<AbstractNarration>Technical: This project aims for measurement and understanding of charge transport in single molecules. The approach to achieve ohmic contact is to synthesize conductor-organic semiconducting molecule-conductor with nanoscale metallic or molecularly doped contacts self-assembled or templated by DNAs. The conducting contacts are self-aligned and make contacts with each end of the organic semiconductor molecule (OSM) with length scale ranges from 5-100 nm. Precisely fabricated, ultrasmall gaps are not needed since the overall hybrid structure will be much longer than the organic molecule of interest. Experiments on electrostatic modification of molecular electronic states via a nearby strongly coupled gate electrode are included. The methods developed are expected to lay the groundwork for developing useful molecular electronic devices and eventually integrating them into complex circuits. &lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science and macromolecular chemistry with technological relevance, and is expected to provide unique opportunities for graduate and undergraduate training in an interdisciplinary field. The proposed work will allow direct measurement of charge transport through single molecules with different chemical functionalities and length, providing critical information on whether organic molecules have sufficient performance for nanoelectronics. The PI will continue with her activities to reach out to a broad population ranging from K-12, community college, undergraduate, and graduate students as well as efforts to engage and prepare the teachers of tomorrow for new areas of science and technology. This project will expose both graduate students and undergraduates to organic chemistry, polymer chemistry, surface chemistry, materials and thin film characterization, device fabrication, and device characterization. Students will experience an interdisciplinary approach to problem solving and become equipped with a combination of technical engineering skills, basic scientific understanding, and communication skills. This project is co-supported by the DMR Electronic and Photonic Materials and CHE MSN (Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry) programs.</AbstractNarration>
