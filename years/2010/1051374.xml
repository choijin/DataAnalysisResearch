<AbstractNarration>This set of two inter-related workshops is designed to advance theorizing about human rights as well as identify and evaluate quantitative and qualitative indicators of human rights. It will identify promising lines of inquiry regarding how legal rights operate as resources, the actors involved in translating rights on the books into social practice, and the social mechanisms through which such translation occurs. These potential new research directions focus on the role of rights discourse and framing strategies in the rights' translation process, the role played by scientific and technical expertise in that process, and the operation of cause lawyering in relation to this same domain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshops will also foster new collaborations among scholars -- anthropologists, economists, political scientists, sociologists, and legal scholars -- working in this shared intellectual area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Consistent with its stated goals, this project, titled Rights and their Translation into Practice: Toward a Synthetic Framework, resulted in two inter-disciplinary scholarly workshops held at the Rogers College of Law, University of Arizona, and a subsequent book publication.  The workshops brought together scholars from across a variety of academic fields including economics, law, sociology, political science, public policy, anthropology, and history. The workshops were especially innovative in bring together scholars and practitioners across what ordinarily have been separate niches studying civil and political rights on the one hand, and economic, social and cultural rights on the other.  The workshops also innovated in bringing together scholars who focus primarily on the United States or Europe and those who focus on rights globally, especially in Africa, Asia and Latin America.  Prior to each workshop, paper presenters submitted draft papers that were then constructively critiqued by assigned discussants prior to a more generalized discussion.  Substantially revised versions of many of the papers presented are being published in a book organized and edited by Project PI Robin Stryker, University of Arizona, and her conference co-organizer, LaDawn Haglund, Arizona State University.  The book, in press with the University of California Press and to be published in 2014, is titled Economic, Social and Cultural Rights: Emerging Possibilities for Social Transformation.  Among key economic, social and cultural rights are rights to food, water, housing, health, education, a basic level of economic well-being and social security, and the collective land rights of indigenous peoples.  The book's twelve empirical chapters document successes and failures in achieving legally mandated rights in different regions of the world, and in different economic, political, cultural and legal contexts. To organize and compare the findings in all of these chapters, the co-editors co-authored Chapter 1 of the book, providing a synthetic explanatory framework they call MAPs. M stands for all variety of social mechanisms (e.g., litigation and judicial enforcement, politics, goal setting and monitoring, etc.) used in moving from rights provided by international and national law to rights achieved in practice. A is for the variety of actors that can be involved, and P is for the concrete pathways that actors and mechanisms combine to create in specific times and places.  Guided by the framework developed in the first chapter of the book, the co-editors undertook comparative analyses based on the book's empirical chapters.  Their final co-authored chapter of the book presents results of these analyses, providing 40 conditional generalizations about what makes for more vs. less effective rights realization.  These conditional generalizations in turn set the stage both for further research and for more effective rights-related practices.  Because the MAPs framework moves beyond litigation and judicial enforcement to consider whether and how any concrete pathway may involve non-judicial actors and mechanisms in addition to or instead of judicialization, our book is able to raise the question of alternative mechanisms and pathways.  This is of enormous importance to rights bearers, rights providers and rights advocates because, depending on context, some routes to rights realization are likely to be more feasible than others.  The book's emphasis on limits and constraints in addition to opportunities for achieving basic economic and social rights makes it well suited to policy and practitioner entrepreneurship as practitioners make strategic choices and confront trade-offs among potential pathways.  With respect to legal doctrine, the book suggests how and why some types of doctrine promote more effective rights realization than do other types of doctrine,  The book also suggests how and why, at least in democratic polities, litigation and judicial enfo...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
