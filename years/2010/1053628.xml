<AbstractNarration>In this project we are combining two geophysical methods for imaging Earth's interior (seismic and electromagnetic) to improve our understanding of the geologic history, and present structure of the Earth in the Pacific Northwest United States.   These studies will improve our understanding of the very dynamic Earth in this region, providing information that will ultimately help to mitigate geologic hazards such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, and inform efforts to develop natural resources (e.g., geothermal energy).   The core dataset for this project is provided by the NSF-funded Earthscope Transportable Array, which provides co-located spatially uniform grids of high quality seismic and electromagnetic (EM) sites.   Initial comparison of images obtained from the seismic and EM Earthscope data separately reveal striking similarities, which suggest a common large-scale geometric distribution of different, but plausibly related, material properties.  Through this project we are developing more sophisticated methods for integrating the two datasets, with the goal of providing new constraints on physical state and composition of Earth's interior in this region.   The methods developed are expected to be more widely applicable, both to similar studies of Earth structure and geologic history in other regions, and for smaller scale applications of joint geophysical imaging to resource exploration or environmental problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bulk rock conductivities at crustal and upper mantle depths are strongly influenced by even small amounts of an interconnected conductive phase, making EM methods a powerful tool for mapping fluid distributions and constraining magmatic processes.  However, interpretation of EM data in isolation is often ambiguous, as there can be multiple possible causes for high conductivity, and resolution is intrinsically limited by the diffusive nature of EM fields in a conductor.  By integrating EM and seismic data non-uniqueness in both can be reduced, providing more powerful and useful constraints on composition and physical state of Earth's interior.   With regard to methodology, our approach will span a spectrum, from simple inter-comparison of "unbiased" models obtained by inverting each type of data separately, through testing of hypotheses of common structure, to formal joint inversion.  The collaboration is strengthening connections between seismic and EM researchers, and through training of young researchers in complimentary geophysical techniques, promises to enhance future interpretation of Earthscope and other geophysical datasets in the coming years.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project involved interpretation of geophysical data collected in the continental US as part of the EarthScope USArray facility.   We have used magnetotelluric (MT) data, which is based on the time variations of electric and magnetic fields measured at the surface of the Earth, to infer electrical conductivity of the subsurface.  In the Earth this physical property is mostly controlled by presence of fluids, melt, and some minerals such as sulfides and graphite, and at great depths, by temperature.   Our work focused on imaging and interpreting large-scale deep (10-200 km) conductivity variations in the crust and upper mantle, and the relationship of these to seismic images which constrain temperature and composition of the Earth.  The main tool used in our work is 3D inversion, using constraints from seismology and other geophysical or geological methods to reduce ambiguity.    The inversion method involves searching (with an automated scheme) for electrical conductivity distributions which can reproduce observed data.  Because these 3D inversion methods have only recently become practical for MT data, much of our research has focused on further development of the methods, and learning to apply these to obtain reliable deep Earth images.   This experience is relevant to more applied applications of 3D EM imaging for resource exploration and management problems.  We initially focused on regional scale inversions of the Northwestern USA (NWUS), to include EarthScope footprints covering the Mid-Continent Rift (MCR) and Southeastern US (SEUS).   Our results have provided an unprecedented view of electrical resistivity from the middle crust to deep within the mantle, providing important new clues about ongoing and active geologic processes (mostly in the western US) and the deep-time history of the assembly and evolution of the North American continent.  Some example images from the work supported by this project are shown in the attached figures.   Figure 1 shows the distribution of EarthScope MT sites, with boxes outlining the three areas we show results from.   Results from the NWUS (Figs. 2, 3, 4) reveal a resistive subducting oceanic plate, pervasive layers of conductive lower crust (hot colors) in geologically active provinces (the Basin and Range, Snake River Plain/Yellowstone, Cascade volcanic arc), and thick resistive blocks (cool colors) of the much older continental core (e.g., the Wyoming Craton). Conductive lower crustal layers are absent in the MCR area, which has been geologically quiet for almost a billion years.  This clearly shows that these high conductivities at about 30 km depth are a transient feature associated with the current geologic activity.  They almost certainly represent hot saline fluids released from cooling melts near the base of the crust.   These fluids slowly leak to the surface with time scales of 5-10 million years, and can be detected in ground water in the west.  The most prominent conductive features in the MCR area (Fig. 3) are highly conductive linear features, spatially coincident with the contact, or suture, between two ancient geologic provinces identified in surface geology.  We interpret these deep conductive features as electrically conducting minerals (graphitic carbon and sulfides) thrust deep within the Earth when the provinces collided roughly 1.7-1.8 billion years ago.   The two conductive sutures imaged are cleanly cut by the aborted MCR, with occurred roughly 1.1 billion years ago. Similar deep conductive sutures are found to coincide with ancient collision zones throughout the continent (Fig. 5). These are particularly clear in the SEUS, where a series of Appalachian-parallel elongate crustal conductivity anomalies coincide with major terrane sutures.  Finally, the MT data require a thick (&gt; 200 km) layer of stiff cold mantle beneath the Piedmont and Coastal Plain, just outboard of the  modern Appalachian topographic escarpment.  It is likely that the observed sharp lateral contrast in deep rock properties can help to explain why this ancient mountain range maintains significant elevation, and very steep slopes.
