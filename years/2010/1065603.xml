<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to better model the human perception of quality variations in audio, video, and audiovisual signals.   A fundamental challenge in accomplishing this goal, however, is to develop a human subjective testing methodology that can assess such the perceived quality variations with sufficient accuracy in time.  Rather than conducting human trials that simply ask subjects to rate the signal quality at given moments in time, in this research the electrical patterns of each subject's brain responses to multimedia signals of varying quality are captured using a high resolution electroencephalograph (EEG).  By analyzing these EEG signals, it becomes possible to detect a change in the perceived quality of the signal before the human observer/listener even becomes consciously aware that the quality has changed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major difficulty, however, is that the EEG waveforms captured during these trials contain large amounts of noise, and it is therefore necessary to sift through a large set of data to identify the components of the collected EEG waveforms that correspond to changes in perceived quality.  To accomplish this task, both deterministic time-space-frequency analysis techniques will be applied as well as stochastic techniques based on information spectra.  To create computer-based models of perceived quality, AR/ARMA (autoregressive/autoregressive moving average) modeling techniques will be considered and support vector machines along with related kernel-based classifiers will be designed to output class indexes corresponding to perceived quality.  Beyond its potential for improving audiovisual transmission systems, the broader impacts of this research include the possibility that it will open up new and more efficient avenues for transferring information from computers to human beings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As stated in the title, the goal of this research was to determine how one might infer the human perception of audiovisual quality directly from brain responses as measured by an electroencephalogram (EEG).  Underlying this specific goal, however, is the broader problem of understanding how the brain processes audiovisual stimuli.  Most of our efforts in this project have been directed towards gaining such understanding since very little previous research existed.  We have learned a lot about how the human brain processes audio and video: both the brain responses that individuals appear to have in common and those that appear to be differentiated.  For example, in Fig. 1 we study the modeling of spectral power features as log-normal and plot the estimated mean (given by E(X) and variance (given by V(X)) at each spatial location on the scalp for different qualities of video ('base' = full quality).  These results are averaged over 38 subjects with hundreds of different presentations per quality level.  We see that, depending on the position of the electrode on the scalp, there are variations as the quality changes.    Choosing a single electrode in a spot where these variations versus video quality are particularly prominant (specifically, electrode #22 which is above the occipital lobe), we see in Fig. 2 that there is clearly a correlation in the mean estimate of the log-normal distribution (labeled as Greek letter 'mu' in the figure) and the ratings for the same video sequences provided by the test subjects.  It turns out that this correlation justifies the use of cepstral feature vectors for quality classification purposes.  Interestingly, we have also found that human brain response to video can be very effectively used as a biometric for security or privacy applications.  Fig. 3 illustrates the clustering of higher dimensional feature vectors (projected onto 2-dimensional plane) for a subset of test subjects (including three subjects who participated in the complete set of trials twice on different days, circled in red).  We see that the feature clusters are largely separated, indicating that human identication and verification results are likely to be very good when machine learning is applied.  In fact, from single video presentations, we achieve identification accuracy of around 70% (using the above-mentioned cepstral power features).  If multiple video are presented to a subject, identification rates in excess of 90% are achieved.  During the course of this project, we also studied the information theoretic modeling of human perception with a  particular focus on the audio stimuli.  After introducing a novel framework for evaluating audio quality perception based on recorded EEG brain data for subjects listening to time-varying distorted audio, we used an information theoretic analysis to quantitatively measure how accurately the quality of the audio stimulus was transmitted over the brain response channel as shown in Fig. 4.

In particular, there appeared to be a higher amount of information flow between the cortical regions when the subjects were listening to distorted quality audio. This strongly suggests an increase in brain activity in the regions of interest when the the subjects were listening to distorted audio, most likely because the subjects were forced concentrate harder on the reduced-quality audio to understand or interpret it.
