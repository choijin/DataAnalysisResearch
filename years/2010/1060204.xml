<AbstractNarration>The American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC) requests support to conduct the 2010&lt;br/&gt;TCU STEM Leaders? Forum (Forum) for the National Science Foundation/ Tribal Colleges and Universities&lt;br/&gt;Program (TCUP) awardees and for the presidents at each of the nation?s 33 accredited Tribal&lt;br/&gt;Colleges and Universities (TCUs). The Forum will focus on strategies and best practices for&lt;br/&gt;successfully recruiting and retaining American Indian students in science, technology, engineering&lt;br/&gt;and mathematics (STEM).&lt;br/&gt;During the 2-day TCU STEM Leaders? Forum participants (including TCUP principal investigators&lt;br/&gt;and project directors, TCU presidents, and NSF representatives) will discuss issues and participate&lt;br/&gt;in formal sessions during which they will share and explore best practices and innovative&lt;br/&gt;approaches to strengthening the American Indian STEM pipeline. The Forum will provide a opportunity&lt;br/&gt;for tribal colleges to engage in and contribute to the national discussion on broadening participation&lt;br/&gt;in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;A key outcome of the proposed Forum will be increased success in recruiting and retaining&lt;br/&gt;Indian student in STEM programs at TCUs, as effective practices are identified and implemented.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Forum will promote a community of practice among NSF TCUP managers and faculty,&lt;br/&gt;facilitating the exchange of best practices and strategies for achieving the common goal of&lt;br/&gt;improving STEM participation and achievement among American Indian students. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;Forum will engage national STEM leaders, including the leadership at NSF and tribal colleges,&lt;br/&gt;in a critical dialogue focusing on the current state of knowledge and understanding of broadening&lt;br/&gt;participation strategies as they are applied by tribal colleges.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;The Forum will make an important contribution to the ongoing debate on how best to promote&lt;br/&gt;broader participation of the nation?s underserved and underrepresented minorities in STEM&lt;br/&gt;education and professions. It will promote the exploration and greater understanding of state-of-the-art&lt;br/&gt;broadening participation strategies not only by tribal college faculty and administrators,&lt;br/&gt;but by the leadership at NSF and other federal agencies with science missions.</AbstractNarration>
