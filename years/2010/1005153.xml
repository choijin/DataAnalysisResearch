<AbstractNarration>Binghamton University in general, and its Computer Science (CS) Department in particular, are successfully complementing an outstanding reputation for undergraduate education with vibrant and growing graduate-level research programs. This combination provides fertile ground for an outstanding NSF REU Site in experimental computer systems research. Each summer, the Binghamton CISE REU Site attracts ten top undergraduate students from a wide variety of CS and Computer Engineering departments across the country. Participants include (i) students from under-represented groups, (ii) women, and (iii) students with limited local access to graduate-level research programs in their home institutions. Students immerse themselves in intensive high-quality research projects directed by one or more CS Faculty Research Mentors at Binghamton, for a ten week period in the summer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Binghamton's CISE REU Site exposes students to high-quality computer systems research, trains them to be effective researchers, and influences them through exciting and positive experiences to continue to pursue a research-oriented career path, including graduate study both at Binghamton and at other universities. As part of the REU experience, students write research-style papers and make public conference-style presentations in Binghamton's CS Department.  In preparing to do so, the students make significant contributions to the department's research programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Departmental research areas of expertise (and therefore potential areas for REU student projects) include computer architecture, energy-aware computing, graphics and image computing, virtualization, Internet search and information retrieval, security, cloud and grid computing, circuit design, algorithmic optimization, data mining, mobile and sensor networks, and more. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program includes an effective evaluation strategy carried out by a local educational evaluation expert. The combination of a high quality research environment, dedicated and talented Faculty Research Mentors, and a feedback loop driven by this evaluation professional, ensure the strong intellectual merit of the proposed activity.</AbstractNarration>

Students contributed to and completed dozens of projects over the three-year award. Examples from the area of Virtual Machine (VM) migration exemplify the kinds of outcomes and contributions that students made.  Virtual Machines represent an important technology for managing cluster and cloud computing environments, allowing multiple users and processes to conveniently and efficiently share resources.  VM migration concerns the movement of VMs between physical computers; being able to do so efficiently and reliably, with little impact on clients and other parts of the system, is central to the effectiveness of VM technology. One REU student project advanced research in gang migration. Gang migration refers to the simultaneous live migration of multiple Virtual Machines (VMs) from one set of physical machines to another in response to events such as load spikes and imminent failures. Gang migration generates a large volume of network traffic and can overload the core network links and switches in a datacenter. REU students helped implement a new approach to reduce the network overhead of gang migration using global deduplication (GMGD). GMGD identifies and eliminates the retransmission of duplicate memory pages among VMs running on multiple physical machines in the cluster. The project resulted in a GMGD prototype that can reduce the network traffic on core links by up to 65% and the total migration time of VMs by up to 42%.  Another project introduced a new approach, called Scatter-Gather live migration, which reduces the eviction time (the time needed to remove the entire VM from the source host on which it is running) when the destination host is resource constrained. The key idea is to decouple the source and the destination hosts. The source scatters the VMÆs memory state quickly to multiple intermediary computers in the cluster. Concurrently, the destination gathers the VMÆs memory from the intermediaries using a variant of post-copy VM migration. REU students helped implement a prototype of Scatter-Gather, reducing the VM eviction time by up to a factor of 6 while maintaining comparable total migration time against traditional pre-copy and post-copy for a resource constrained destination.
