<AbstractNarration>Hampton University, in collaboration with Carnegie-Mellon University, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, the University of the District of Columbia, Norfolk State University, Winston-Salem State University, Morgan State University, Jackson State University, Elizabeth City State University, Duke University, the University of Alabama Tuscaloosa, and the University of Michigan, proposes the ARTSI Alliance (Advancing Robotics Technology for Societal Impact). ARTSI is a consortium of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and major research universities (R1s) working together to increase African American participation in computer science, with a focus on robotics. This extension proposal will expand ARTSI to seventeen Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and roughly 10 major research universities (R1s). Hampton University is the new lead institution; Carnegie Mellon University remains the lead R1 school. The extension introduces three new initiatives that (1) improve the quality and uniformity of robotics instruction by developing robotics curriculum modules specific to the needs of HBCUs, (2) pilot a program to attract STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) students to HBCUs by offering robot programming activities in local high schools, and (3) pilot skill-building program for rising sophomores to better prepare them to become involved in robotics research. The extension also includes new collaborations with the Caribbean Center for Computing Excellence (a BPC Alliance in Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ARTSI Alliance (Advancing Robotics Technology for Societal Impact) was founded in 2007 as a consortium of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and Major Research Universities (R1s) working together to increase African American participation in computer science with a focus on robotics.  The mission of the ARTSI Alliance was to provide education and research opportunities to engage undergraduate students from non-traditional backgrounds in the study of robotics in areas that are relevant to society. ARTSI had the following goals: (1) Increase the number of underrepresented (primarily African American) students who pursue advanced training in computer science or robotics; (2) Increase the institutional capacity of HBCUs to offer educational experiences in robotics; (3) Build an active community of HBCU faculty and students who collaborate with each other and with R1 faculty on robotics teaching and research, and (4) Conduct outreach activities for the broader public to increase awareness of and interest in African American achievement in robotics, and recruit new students to the pipeline.  The twenty-six ARTSI partners comprised seventeen HBCUs and nine R1s.  ARTSI engaged African Americans in computing with interdisciplinary, collaborative robotics education and research projects that focus on improving society in areas such as healthcare, the arts, and entrepreneurship. The ARTSI AllianceÆs industry partners included Seagate, Intel, Google, Motorola, Apple, Boeing, and iRobot.  ARTSI Activities spanned the academic pipeline from K-12 through the faculty ranks. At the K-12 level, students were recruited with community outreach using robotics road shows and educational videos, summer camps, and after-school programs. At the undergraduate level, HBCU students were exposed to new robotics curricula, and they were encouraged to pursue advanced training in graduate school through summer research internships.  HBCU students also engaged in small research projects at their own institutions, assisted with outreach activities (service learning), and led robotics competition teams. Selected HBCU students spent 8-10 weeks working in robotics labs at major research universities, interacting with faculty and graduate students, and learning what academic research is about. Projects conducted during the academic year and summer REU programs are presented at the annual ARTSI Student Research Conference. At the faculty level, ARTSI increased the number of HBCU faculty educating students in robotics and involving students in robotics research, by providing faculty mentoring, summer research experiences for underrepresented faculty at R1 robotics labs, summer faculty workshops, and development and dissemination of robotics educational materials through a web-based portal.  The ARTSI Alliance fostered a symbiotic relationship joining the strengths of HBCUs in conducting outreach and education in a nurturing learning environment with the R1sÆ strengths and resources for conducting word-class research.  The ARTSI Alliance motivated students to pursue computer science careers by promoting the creative and socially beneficial aspects of researching and designing new computing and robotics technology.  The following are accomplishments of ARTSI Alliance:  1) Increase Participation  275% increase of undergraduate participation in the program since 2007 for cumulative total of 179 (2007) to 493 (2013) across 17 HBCUs. 43% of graduating ARTSI students attended graduate school. 53% of ARTSI students aspire to the PhD compared to 17% in the Data Buddies Survey. 91% increase of underrepresented minority student participation since 2007.   2) REU Impacts  56% of ARTSI undergraduate participants are women and womenÆs participation in ARTSI has increased 84% since 2007.  102 ARTSI REU students across 10 R1s, 14 robotics labs (98% were underrepresented minority; 20% were female).  57% (58) of REU students have graduated. Of these REUs, 36% (...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
