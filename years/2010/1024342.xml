<AbstractNarration>SES-1024342&lt;br/&gt;Kristen Marcussen&lt;br/&gt;Richard Serpe&lt;br/&gt;Kent State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will help to clarify the relationship between social roles and psychological distress. The study extends identity-discrepancy theory, which differentially predicts depression and anxiety as a result of discrepancies between how individuals believe they are viewed by others (self-relevant perceptions), how they desire to be in a given identity (aspirations) and how they feel they should be with respect to a given identity (obligations).  The investigators hypothesize that discrepancies between self-relevant perceptions and aspirations will be associated with depression, whereas discrepancies between self-relevant perceptions and obligations will be associated with anxiety.  Using a nationally representative sample of 1000 adults, this research refines and tests measures of identity that better differentiate aspirations and obligations attached to identities, examines the relationship between aspirations, obligations and well-being within the context of five distinct identities, and broadens the scope of identity-discrepancy theory by examining the extent to which self-esteem influences the relationship between identity discrepancies and psychological well-being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has the potential to help scholars better understand the causes and consequences of stress on mental health outcomes. The results may help increase our knowledge of how mental health problems result from the successful or unsuccessful enactment of social roles in everyday life. In doing so, the findings will broaden our theoretical understanding of the relationship between stress and psychological well-being, and may also have implications for clinical research and practice in mental health populations. Finally, the study will provide opportunities for mentoring undergraduate and graduate students. Students will be involved in each phase of the project, gaining valuable research experience.</AbstractNarration>

Identity theorists argue that the ability to verify one&rsquo;s identity, or confirm one&rsquo;s self-views, is directly related to their psychological health. We combine aspects of two sociological and psychological theories into an integrated model of identity (identity-discrepancy theory) to examine this assertion. We ague that our new model advances identity theories of mental health by differentially predicting depression and anxiety as a result of discrepancies between self-relevant perceptions (how individuals believe they are viewed by others) and identity specific aspirations (how they desire to be in a given identity) and obligations (how they feel the should be in a given identity). Specifically, we expect that individuals who experience a discrepancy between their self-relevant perceptions and their aspirations will experience depressive symptoms, and individuals who experience discrepancies between self-relevant perceptions and obligations will experience anxiety symptoms.

Respondents were asked to report on their aspirations and obligations about two identities. The four identities studied in this project were: parent, employee, spouse/partner, and friend. To examine the self more broadly, we also included a "person" role, which asked individuals to respond to how they wanted to be and felt obligated to be more generally as a person. For each identity, respondents were asked to say how they felt they (1) wanted to be, (2) should be and, (3) thought others evaluated them to be on various dimensions of each identity (e.g., loyal, efficient, ambitious).
