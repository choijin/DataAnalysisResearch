<AbstractNarration>This award in the Chemical Synthesis (SYN) program supports work by Professor Daniel L. Reger at the University of South Carolina to carry out fundamental studies on the preparation and characterization of first row transition metal complexes that are designed to have novel structures that produce unusual and useful properties.  Designed ligands (groups that bind metals) bring two metals into proximity promoting bridging of the two metals by small groups (X).  These M-X-M systems show unique magnetic and optical properties that can be controlled by the choice of metal and X group.  Linking ligands that also contain designed functionalities that promote strong, but indirect, interactions yield new structural and bonding arrangements that test how these important indirect interactions impact on physical properties.  Particularly important are ligands that have backbones with specific orientations that "project" or "amplify" the special characteristics of the ligands on to the structures of metal complexes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Graduate students working on the project train for academic positions as well as industry and government employment.  Outreach collaborations with faculty and undergraduate students at two HBCU institutions nurture scientific development of minority students.  Development of this chemistry is important in such diverse areas as asymmetric catalysis, non-linear optics, and sensing applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The most well-known forces that hold molecules together are hydrogen bonds, the forces that hold together the two strands of DNA and other important compounds necessary for life.  Using ground-breaking advances in the preparation of new types of molecules, some derived from amino acids that are the building blocks of biomolecules, we have studied compounds with different forces, but the same strengths as hydrogen bonding: strong &pi;???&pi; stacking.  We have used these new compounds to study solids with highly organized structures and properties that could be used in the formation of new materials of importance to society, such as sensors for toxic gases or in energy storage devices. These studies have also changed the way that scientist think about the solid state; solid state compounds have significant flexibility.    In more fundamental studies, we have been able to prepare the first class of metal-containing compounds with a linear metal&ndash;X&ndash;metal bridging arrangement (X = small negatively charged species) that leads to a property, antiferromagnetic exchange interactions, that has not previously been studied in this arrangement and in a system that can be systematically changed.  A variety of measurements have been used to investigate these new compounds to reveal how the exchange interactions can be controlled. This property is important in the development of new types of magnetic materials for use in devices and that is also important in many metalloenzymes.  Four graduate students have carried out these studies and been (or will be) awarded the Ph. D. degree from the University of South Carolina.  These students developed the skills and knowledge needed to carry out synthetic research and measure the properties of the new compounds. In addition, they developed outstanding writing skills and also the ability to present the new science in oral reports.  They also have contributed to the teaching of the diverse undergraduate students at South Carolina.          Last Modified: 07/15/2015       Submitted by: Daniel L Reger]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
