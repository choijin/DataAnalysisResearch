<AbstractNarration>This proposal is to provide support for the participation of US researchers and graduate students in an international conference on "Bifurcation Theory, Integrable Systems and the Bispectral Problem" at Sofia University in Sofia, Bulgaria during May 15-19, 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will stimulate the exchange of ideas between US and foreign mathematicians in the areas of integrable systems, the bispectral problem and bifurcation theory. In each of these three areas mathematicians use similar algebro-geometric, representation theoretic, and analytic methods. By bringing researchers in these three areas together, the conference will create new collaborations and strengthen ongoing collaborations between US and European mathematicians. It will expose a number of young researchers and graduate students from the US to fundamental research by leading mathematicians. Informal sessions will provide ample opportunities for junior researchers and graduate students to interact with experts in the fields. The conference will also provide a valuable opportunity for the US graduate students to exchange ideas and education experience with their European peers. This award is co-funded by the Office of International Science and Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
