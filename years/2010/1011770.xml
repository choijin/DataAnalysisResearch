<AbstractNarration>The Environmental Chemical Science (ECS) program will support the collaborative research project of Profs. Veronica Vaida and Rex Skodje of the University of Colorado at Boulder. The collaborating investigators and their students will employ a combination of theoretical modeling and advanced laser-based spectroscopic methods including cavity ringdown and cavity enhanced spectroscopy to study the effect of water on the formation and chemical reactivity of secondary organic aerosols. The project will increase our molecular level understanding of secondary organic aerosols and contribute to increasing the accuracy of prediction of climate models. The project will provide excellent training opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students in a cutting edge research area of great societal importance.</AbstractNarration>
