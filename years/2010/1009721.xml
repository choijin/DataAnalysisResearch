<AbstractNarration>Large relatively high-elevation surfaces with low relief are common on&lt;br/&gt;the continents. Such uplifts have a significant impact on the geological &lt;br/&gt;record by influencing drainage networks and sediment supply, on climate by modifying&lt;br/&gt;atmospheric circulation, and on biogeography and the biota. Work in geodynamics has&lt;br/&gt;shown that such uplifts amount to a telling signature of mantle dynamics. Thus, they&lt;br/&gt;provide a means to discriminate among hypotheses about how the continental lithosphere&lt;br/&gt;and the deeper mantle interact through processes that result in uplift and mass transfer in&lt;br/&gt;continental interiors. The Hangay Dome in central Mongolia provides an excellent and&lt;br/&gt;accessible laboratory to investigate these processes and determine the degree to which&lt;br/&gt;mantle upwelling, mafic underplating, lithospheric foundering or plume activity have&lt;br/&gt;been important agents in its uplift. This five-year project proposes to use the Hangay&lt;br/&gt;Dome as such a laboratory to coordinate studies of both the structure and state of the&lt;br/&gt;lithosphere and the sublithospheric mantle as well as the history of surface uplift and&lt;br/&gt;landscape evolution. The project will involve observations and measurements made using&lt;br/&gt;broadband seismology, basalt and xenolith petrology and geochemistry, 40Ar/39Ar&lt;br/&gt;geochronology, stable-isotope and vesicular-basalt paleoaltimetry, geomorphology and&lt;br/&gt;10Be geochronology, molecular genetics of divergent fish populations, and U-Th/He and&lt;br/&gt;4He/3He thermochronology.  The Hangay Dome?s widespread exposures of basaltic lavas,&lt;br/&gt;which were erupted over the past 30 Ma across a broad range of elevations, will be key to&lt;br/&gt;the integration of all these data.  Dating of the basalts will enable linkage of petrologic data&lt;br/&gt;bearing on basalt genesis and the nature of the Hangay-Dome mantle with studies that&lt;br/&gt;use the lavas as time markers for documenting landscape evolution and the history of&lt;br/&gt;surface uplift.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We undertook this geologic/geochemical study of the Hangay and surrounding mountain ranges of Mongolia in an effort to understand the tectonic controls of deformation in north-central Asia.  The Stanford group was largely tasked with determining the topographic history of these mountain ranges using a newly developed technique called "stable isotope paleoaltimetry".  This method is based on the observation that there is a strong orographic affect on the stable isotopes of precipitation as the heavy isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen are preferentially removed during orographic precipitation. Thus, by collecting hydrous minerals formed in ancient soils it is possible to recontruct the isotopic composition of ancient waters and this information provides key constraints on the height of mountains in the past.  Our studies consisted of determining the oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon isotopes of paleosols (ancient soils) adjacent the Hangay and Altai mountain ranges of Mongolia.  Today, these ranges create a prominent rainshadow that separate boreal forests to the north from the vast deserts to the south, such as the Gobi.  These ranges also create an isotopic rainshadow that is induced by the strong orographic effect.  Based on these isotope record of palesols we were able to determine the timing of surface uplift of these mountain ranges.  Our results show, that contrary to previous findings, the Altai and Hangay as surface features have been at or near their present height since the early Oligocene (some 30 million years ago).  This finding suggests that the tectonic mechanism responsible for the deformation of this region of north-central Asia must have been operative at the very early stages of the collision between the Asian and Indian plates and were forming during the time of uplift of the Tibetan Plateau.   Our research has even broader implications with regard to the large-scale controls of the Asian climate system, as well.  Specifically, we demonstrate using modern air-parcel back-trajectory analysis that the Altai and Hangay mountains today play a key role in blocking Siberian moisture to the Asian sub-continent and are a key player in the arid climate of central Asia.  Based on our records of carbon and oxygen isotopes of paleosols we suggest that this aridification was largely caused by differential surface uplift of the Hangay in the Oligocene and the Altai in the Miocene.  Our analysis of published stable isotopic records south of the Hangay and extending into Tibet show that this aridification was most likely caused by uplift of the Hangay and Altai rather than by uplift of Tibet as was previously proposed.  This radical finding shows that these northern bounding ranges may be the key driver to the long-term aridification of Asia.        Last Modified: 09/29/2015       Submitted by: C.
