<AbstractNarration>The Initiative in Innovative Computing in the Harvard University School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, in collaboration with the Encyclopedia of Life Learning and Education Group, University of Nebraska State Museum, Northwestern University Department of Learning Sciences, the Center for Human Growth and Development at the University of Michigan, the California Academy of Sciences, the Field Museum of Natural History, the Boston Children's Museum, the Harvard Museum of Natural History, and TERC, will develop, evaluate and disseminate Life on Earth, a developmentally-appropriate intervention for learning about the Tree of Life, Common Descent, and Natural Selection in museum settings.  The primary goals of the project are to improve museum visitor understanding of evolution and to use innovative touch-screen technology to enhance museum visitor learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The deliverables are eight developmentally flexible Life on Earth activities, designed to allow visitors to choose their own difficulty level.  Each activity is designed to engage visitors in learning one of the two key concepts of evolution: common descent and natural selection.  The activities are unified within a conceptual framework based on a research-based, peer-reviewed developmental learning progression for an understanding of evolution.  Specific target audiences are: Beginner (3rd-5th grade), Intermediate (6th-8th grade, and Advanced (9th-Adult). These activities, developed as computer software, will be delivered via a compelling multi-touch, multi-user digital interface with the potential to transform the way science is experienced in informal settings.  The highly qualified and experienced core team is supported by a strong advisory group of evolutionary biologists, science educators, and informal learning professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The activities will be developed in diverse museum settings with input from their different audiences: natural history museum, science museum, children's museum.  The direct potential public impact is estimated at approximately 4.5 million for the partner museums; potential indirect impacts are across the ISE field through a free software package downloadable to any institution with the appropriate hardware.  The potential professional audience is exhibit developers seeking to develop learning experiences about evolution in natural history museums, science museums, zoos, aquaria, and other ISE institutions.  Front-end evaluation, formative evaluation and prototyping will be conducted by the project team lead by Dr. Judy Diamond and Dr. Ann Spiegel.  Summative evaluation will be conducted by TERC.</AbstractNarration>

Building on research in the Learning Sciences and Human?Computer Interaction, the Life on Earth exhibit includes three interactive experiences: <strong>DeepTree</strong>, the focal activity, offers visitors the opportunity to see, touch, and manipulate a phylogenetic tree of life containing seventy thousand species. This tree of life represents the evolutionary relationships of species from the beginning of life on Earth, about 3.5 billion years ago, to the present. DeepTree's deep zoom interface encourages visitors to &ldquo;fly through&rdquo; the vast branching patterns of our evolutionary history while investigating relationships among species. This exhibit demonstrates that all life on Earth is related through shared derived traits, and includes major times of divergence (see Image 1). <strong>FloTree</strong> is a hands-on simulation illustrating the dynamic population-level processes of speciation and biodiversity underlying evolution (see Image 2). <strong>Build-A-Tree</strong> is a multi-level puzzle game that challenges visitors to construct phylogenetic trees of increasing complexity (see Image 3). The Life on Earth exhibit has been installed in the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, California, at the University of Nebraska in the State Museum and in the School of Biological Sciences in Lincoln NE, the Field Museum in Chicago IL, and Harvard Museum of Natural History in Cambridge MA. The DeepTree has also been distributed to Europe at the Oxford University Natural History Museum, UK, Mus&eacute;e National d'histoire Naturelle&nbsp;in Luxembourg, and Centro Ciencia Viva de Estremoz<strong><em> </em></strong>in<strong><em> </em></strong>Portugal.

In the first two conditions, pairs of youth interacted with the DeepTree exhibit on a tabletop display for ten minutes. In a third condition, they watched a ten-minute video on the topic of evolution and the tree of life.
