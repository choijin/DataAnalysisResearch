<AbstractNarration>Katayoon Dehesh        IOS-1036491&lt;br/&gt;HPL-pathway mediated stress signaling networks in plants&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As sessile organisms plants must cope with numerous abiotic and biotic stresses.  As a result of these stresses there are substantial losses in crop yield.  To counteract environmental stresses plants utilize a number of different mechanisms including fatty acid based pathways to signal for a stress response, ultimately leading to stress tolerance. One such a pathway is HYDROPEROXIDE LYASE (HPL) pathway responsible for the cleavage of oxygenated fatty acids into a range of metabolites.  It is well established that plants perceive and respond to HPL-derived metabolites, but the underlying mechanisms responsible for mechanism of action of these metabolites, have remained elusive. Elucidation of these mechanisms is central to the identification of signaling pathways mediating the activation of necessary adaptive responses; thereby enhanced tolerance to environmental challenges. This research program exploits a combination of cutting edge molecular, biochemical and genetic approaches using a plant model system in order to provide significant insights into the mechanistic basis of a previously uncharacterized HPL-pathway mediated stress signaling networks in plants in agriculturally important stresses caused by abiotic stresses such as draught and flooding-induced hypoxia. Understanding of the role of HPL cognate metabolites in the plant tolerance to abiotic stresses will have two major impacts. Educational impacts are through: (1) creating a strong and multidimensional program to mentor scholars in state-of-the-art interdisciplinary research; (2) extended efforts to recruit underrepresented minority students; (3) providing summer internship opportunities for high school students and teachers, and college students. Broad social impacts are expected through potential discovery of novel components with potential utilization in biotechnological applications geared towards enhanced tolerance to abiotic stresses in agronomic crops.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Plant adaptation to various stresses such as drought is a very complex process, which affects all aspects of plant life, including physiological processes, such as control of transpiration, deep reorganization of plant metabolism, mediated by alteration of gene expression profile, and even changes of plant morphology and life cycle. Mechanical damage of plant tissue, wounding, occurs as a result of many abiotic factors such as wind, rain, hail and during bioticstresses, such as herbivores attack or pathogen infection. Plant survival often depends on fast detection of tissues and organs damages and healing, in order to prevent water loss and pathogen penetration through damaged areas. Amongst the stress induced metabolites are oxylipins, derivatives of oxygenated unsaturated fatty acids that function as active participants and regulators of various biological processes. Oxylipins are formed not only in plants but all organisms bacteria to human. In plants, oxylipins are involved in stress signal transduction, regulate stress-induced gene expression, and interact with multiple signaling pathways, including signaling pathways of plant hormones. In the studies presented here, we examined the role of metabolites of two branches of oxylipin biosynthesis, allene oxide synthase (AOS) and hydroperoxide lyase (HPL) branches in tailoring plant response to drought and mechanical wounding. AOS branch is a dominant oxylipin biosynthesis branch, since metabolites produced in this branch, jasmonates, have high biological activity, regulate vitally important processes, and are ubiquitously present in all plant species from algae to higher plants. HPL catalyzes formation of active metabolites and green leafy volatiles. Being a major competitor of AOS for a hydroperoxide substrate, HPL controls substrate availability for jasmonates biosynthesis, and hence, influences jasmonates-regulated cell processes. In this NSF supported studies we clearly show that wounding and drought differentially alter metabolic profiles of the AOS and HPL branches of the pathway: while wounding induced an accumulation of downstream metabolites of the branches, JA and the HPL derived 3-hexenol, drought, in contrast, repressed them. Unlike wounding, drought conditions leads to accumulation of the initial products of AOS and HPL branches, 12-OPDA (JA intermediate) and 3-hexenal, correspondingly, testifying the blocking or the luck of induction of downstream steps of the pathway. We specifically demonstrate the importance of fine-tuning of oxylipin pathway metabolites as way to tailor plants responses to the nature of stress encountered. For example under draught conditions, plants accumulate 12-OPDA, a metabolite that together with the hormone ABA reduces stomatal aperture as a way to reduce water loss. We further verified the potency of combination of 12-OPDA and ABA in inducing stomata closure in a range of crops including tomato and canola. This novel finding could be instrumental in devising new biotechnological tools for enhancing plant drought tolerance.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/01/2015<br>      Modified by: Katayoon&nbsp;Dehesh</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
