<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division supports Professor Gary E. Douberly at the University of Georgia for a combined high resolution infrared laser spectroscopy and helium nanodroplet isolation (HENDI) study aimed at probing isolated amino acids, model di- and tri-peptides and nucleic acid base species.  These investigations will provide detailed structural information for these biologically important systems.  This methodology will also be employed to determine with high accuracy the thermochemistry associated with the interconversion of biomolecule conformers and tautomers.  To address the role solvent plays in driving conformational changes in biomolecules, HENDI will be used to determine the structures of biomolecule-water clusters upon successive addition of water.  These measurements will provide definitive tests for the theories that are needed to interpret the experimental studies of bio-macromolecular dynamics, such as those that probe the structural changes of a protein as it folds in its native environment.  Collectively, these studies will contribute critically needed benchmarks for the calibration and testing of the molecular modeling and quantum chemistry methods that are presently used across a vast array of fields in chemistry, physics and materials science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will focus on the fundamental structural properties of isolated biomolecules, which will have a broader impact on a wide array of studies aimed at understanding the function and chemistry of biomolecular systems.  The broader impacts of this research also include the training of graduate and undergraduate students in the use of advanced laser technologies, optics, electronics, vacuum systems, and cryogenic techniques.  In order to involve students from underrepresented groups, partnerships will be established with chemistry faculty at historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in the state of Georgia.  Professor Douberly will present seminars and lectures on biophysical spectroscopy on an annual basis at these institutions.  Undergraduate students from these HBCUs will travel to the University of Georgia to participate in the research activities carried out under this award.  Each year, student participants will present their results at regional scientific meetings.  Professor Douberly will serve as a mentor and advisor to student participants during their research activities, as they navigate through the graduate or professional school application process, and beyond into their professional careers.  The anticipated outcome will be to encourage students from this underrepresented group to pursue advanced education in the physical sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellecual Merit  With funding via the NSF CAREER program, Professor Gary E. Douberly at the University of Georgia has initiated a research program that employs the helium droplet isolation method to address a diverse set of fundamental problems in chemical physics. The low temperature (0.4 K) and rapid cooling associated with helium droplets provides a perfectly suited medium to isolate and probe a broad range of molecular cluster systems. The sequential addition of molecular species to helium droplets often leads to the stabilization of high-energy, metastable cluster configurations that represent regions of the potential energy surface far from the global minimum. Single and double resonance infrared (IR) laser spectroscopy techniques, along with Stark and Zeeman capabilities, have been used to probe the structural and dynamical properties of these systems. A variety of studies have been carried out using these techniques, such as the characterization of small peptides, constituents of evaporated ionic liquids, metal cluster adsorbate systems, open-shell van der Waals complexes containing the Cl atom, and several kinetically stabilized intermediate species associated with hydroxyl radical gas-phase chemistry. For example, a spectroscopic study of the HOOO radical revealed permanent electric dipole moments that disagreed qualitatively with a commonly used theoretical method, CCSD(T), which is often referred to as the "gold standard" in quantum chemistry.  Employing an even higher level of theory for the electronic structure calculations of the system, it was shown that the theory and experiment could be brought into agreement.  At the CCSDT(Q)/CBS level of theory, a value for the radical's dissociation energy was obtained that implies a negligible concentration of HOOO in the troposphere.  It therefore can be concluded that the hydridotrioxygen radical represents, at most, a minor sink for hydroxyl radical in the atmosphere.  Broader Impacts  Technological developments accrued during this period of funding have been broadly disseminated with others in the laser spectroscopy and helium droplet communities, including the designs for various "pick-up" cell and the hardware/software necessary for scanning a commercially available cw-OPO laser system.  A common theme of the spectroscopic work carried out under this award is the comparison of high accuracy experimental measurements to emerging theoretical methods in computational quantum chemistry.  The PI's experimental measurements serve as stringent benchmarks for these theoretical methods, which ultimately will contribute to the establishment of predictive theories in fields such as atmospheric chemistry, astrochemistry, combustion chemistry and biochemistry.  Professor Douberly has taken advantage of several opportunities for training, development, and mentoring during the funding period.
