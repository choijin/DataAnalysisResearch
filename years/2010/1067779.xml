<AbstractNarration>Cooperative interactions are pervasive in nature. For example, a variety of practical approaches for utilizing cooperativity and polyvalency are present in biological systems, such as hemoglobin-oxygen and virus-cell surface interactions. These systems exploit the fact that multiple, simultaneous interactions have collective binding affinities that can greatly exceed those of the individual constituents. An enhanced understanding of these type of interactions has already proven useful for biosensing applications. Recent successes include the proximity ligation assay (PLA) and the related molecular pincer assays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, funded by the Biosensing Program, in the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport System Division of the National Science Foundation seeks to utilize the proximity ligation effect to select target-binding sequences (aptamers) from a random sequence library of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA).  The main goal of the project is to use known antibodies or aptamers to ?find? new aptamers in the random sequence library, then to use DNA-based experimental models developed by the Investigator to fully optimize cooperative assay formats in which the investigator plan to use the aptamers. Finally, the investigator plans to disseminate the knowledge gained on cooperative interactions to the public through outreach efforts targeting middle school classrooms.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merits:&lt;br/&gt;In GOAL 1, the investigators propose to select aptamer pairs against various targets related to diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. The selection of aptamer pairs against these targets will significantly improve the flexibility of current assay formats, providing highly sensitive, homogeneous assays for these analytes. In GOAL 2, the investigators plan to develop novel competitive assays against smaller targets (peptide hormones) should greatly increase the flexibility of these cooperative assay formats (e.g. PLA). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will certainly impact the PI?s teaching, student training, and outreach efforts. Furthermore, through the collaborative development of classroom modules with Auburn Science In Motion (AUSIM), the project is particularly poised to make an impact on middle school classrooms in Alabama, serving a large areas populated with groups underrepresented in science. In GOAL 3, the investigator outline plans to further develop current modules for AUSIM, and possibly to extend this to Alabama Science In Motion, which has impacted over 99,000 students annually with their classroom module-based approach. These efforts will allow highly efficient dissemination of knowledge that we will gain on cooperative interactions in nature.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes related to Intellectual Merits:  This project funding was utilized to develop several new methods for sensitive detection of proteins.  Since these methods have improved the state-of-the-art in a broadly applicable way, they are poised to impact a variety of scientific fields and commercial or medical settings.  Work supported by this project has resulted in the publication of three high quality, peer-reviewed publications in the scientific literature, as well as the awarding of an issued patent for technology developed during the project support period.  The electrochemical proximity assay (ECPA) was developed for highly sensitive and selective detection of proteins (see image 1, "ECPA figure").  This technique holds promise for rapid detection of proteins in point-of-care settings such as hospitals as well as in protein quantification in research laboratories.  A method to select aptamer pairs was developed, termed the cooperative selection of multiple aptamer pairs ("CoMAP", see image 2).  This technology has potential to impact the rapidly growing aptamers market for biomarker detection and discovery.     Outcomes related to Broader Impacts:  In addition to direct training of three Ph.D. scientists and a postdoctoral scientist in Chemistry and Biochemistry, this project funding was used in part to support development of educational modules for middle school teachers and students in low-income, minority schools in the state of Alabama.  Developed modules are available on the Auburn Math and Science Partnership website (AU-MSP), located here:  http://www.auburn.edu/academic/cosam/departments/chemistry/outreach/MSP_AU_web/MSP-AU.htm       Last Modified: 09/25/2015       Submitted by: Christopher J Easley]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
