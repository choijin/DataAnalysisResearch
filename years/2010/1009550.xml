<AbstractNarration>MASSCLEAN: A powerful new tool for the study of stellar clusters&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Massive stellar clusters delineate spiral arms and map the star formation history of our Galaxy. This research program uses a novel approach to locate and characterize massive open star clusters of the Milky Way, the Local Group and external galaxies using image simulations. This work will use optical and (primarily) infrared observations and the newly created image analysis tool, MASSCLEAN, which stands for "Massive Cluster Evolution and Analysis package". &lt;br/&gt;This distinct approach will make significant advances in stellar cluster analysis and lead to better constrained cluster characteristics in both resolved and unresolved systems. The improved knowledge of stellar clusters in the Milky Way from this program will allows us to better estimate poorly constrained values, such as the high-mass cluster mass function and open cluster lifetimes. Improved values for the Milky Way will lead to more meaningful comparisons to similar values derived for other galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator (PI) is part of the team of the "Vista Variables in the Via Lactea"(VVV) infrared survey team. Observations with VISTA (the 4-m Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy in N. Chile) are expected to give the newest, deepest, and highest resolution near-infrared images of the inner Milky Way to locate new massive clusters. These optically obscured objects make up a significant, yet currently under-explored, structural component of our Milky Way. The PI and her collaborators will use optimized search algorithms and more accurate cluster characterization, using combined spectroscopic and image analysis techniques to uncover the massive cluster population of our Milky Way. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studying massive star clusters in the Milky Way provides resolvable analogues to calibrate the integrated light of unresolved extra-galactic massive star clusters. MASSCLEAN will also provide improved models for integrated photometry of stellar clusters, allowing researchers to derive more accurate ages and masses of extragalactic star clusters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A major component of this research program is the open access and support of the stellar cluster image analysis tool, MASSCLEAN. During the grant period, the PI's group will produce a searchable database of 100s of millions of stellar cluster models to provide age and mass estimates for unresolved, extragalactic stellar clusters via the cluster's integrated photometric properties and using a chi-squared minimization routine. The PI is deeply involved in a number of large-scale initiatives at all levels of education (particularly grade school and undergraduate education) aimed at increasing the representation of women in science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We see stars scattered about in the sky as if by random.   Yet, virtually all stars where first born within a cluster of stars.  These stellar clusters, typically made up of hundreds to thousands of stars, can in rare occations contain as many as a million or more stars!  But such very massive stellar clusters are rare in our Milky Way galaxy.  In fact, before we started our research, most would have said young clusters of more than 10 thousand stars did not exist in our Milky Way because no one had ever seen one.  However, absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of absence.  In this project we set out to show just how wrong that assumption was.  It seems counter-intuitive that extremely massive clusters with 10's of thousands of stars could be lurking in our galaxy and we couldn't see them. Our image simulations of the stellar field density and extinction showed just how difficult these giant clusters are to see!  Once we better understood how to find them, using our simulation software MASSCLEAN, we set out to better constrain the properties of these massive young clusters in mass, age and distance.  In the past decade, astronomers have gone from believing no young, massive clusters exist in our galaxy to now counting tens of young massive clusters to exist, all with more than 10,000 stars in them!  These massive young clusters make up the most significant major new structure now known to exist in our Milky Way galaxy.   Our cluster simulation software has also been powerful in constraining the characteristics of young intermediate mass stellar clusters existing far away in distant galaxy.  In these cases the cluster, which may contain thousands to many tens of thousands of stars, is so far away that we see only a blurry blob. With our simulations, we have shown how to extract the most likely combination of age and mass based on the integrated (total) light received by the stellar cluster.   With revised ages and masses, we have completed an extensive study of the massive cluster age distribution in the Large Magellanic Cloud.  Our results point towards a far less extreme destruction rate than previous studies had concluded based on false cluster age distributions.
