<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project concerns a novel, rapid and cost&lt;br/&gt;effective detection system for fecal contamination in water supplies. Although existing methods can&lt;br/&gt;detect fecal contamination in water samples, improvements are needed in sensitivity, accuracy, and speed.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal describes the refinement of a novel sensor utilizing an insect chemosensory protein as the&lt;br/&gt;recognition element in a product that detects indole, a characteristic metabolite of coliform bacteria. The&lt;br/&gt;biosensor acts with high specificity and sensitivity, allowing the rapid detection of low level E. coli or&lt;br/&gt;fecal contamination in water supplies, and encompasses a novel implementation of lateral flow&lt;br/&gt;technology that can be used at home or in industry.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are that insect CSP-based biosensors as described constitute a&lt;br/&gt;platform technology with direct applications in the detection of environmental, chemical, or biological&lt;br/&gt;compounds or contaminants, including the detection of harmful volatile organic compounds (VOCs),&lt;br/&gt;quality control of foods and pharmaceuticals, the detection of toxins or stereoisomers generated during&lt;br/&gt;chemical or pharmaceutical synthesis, and the detection of volatile compounds present in weapons or&lt;br/&gt;explosives. These biosensors can also be used in medical diagnostics as well as numerous other&lt;br/&gt;applications where high speed, sensitivity and analyte selectivity are required. The platform technology&lt;br/&gt;has immediate application to a variety of important sensor and detector implementations that affect&lt;br/&gt;numerous industries, public safety, and public health. The water safety monitor described herein is only&lt;br/&gt;one example of the applications possible.</AbstractNarration>
