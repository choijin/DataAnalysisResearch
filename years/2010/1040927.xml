<AbstractNarration>Global Harmonic Analysis&lt;br/&gt;NSF/CBMS Regional Conference in the Mathematical Sciences&lt;br/&gt;University of Kentucky, June 20-24, 2011&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Global harmonic analysis may be viewed as an extension of classical&lt;br/&gt;Fourier theory on the line and on the circle to the geometric setting of&lt;br/&gt;Riemannian manifolds. Riemannian manifolds provide models of both com-&lt;br/&gt;pletely integrable and chaotic dynamical systems, and also provide a setting&lt;br/&gt;in which the connection between "classical" and "quantum" behavior can be&lt;br/&gt;carefully studied. Moreover, just as harmonic analysis on the line and the&lt;br/&gt;circle are a fundamental tool in the study of both linear and nonlinear differ-&lt;br/&gt;ential equations in these settings, so global harmonic analysis is fundamental&lt;br/&gt;to the study of di¤erential equations, such as the wave and Schrödinger equa-&lt;br/&gt;tion, on manifolds. On a general Riemannian manifold, harmonic analysis is&lt;br/&gt;the study of eigenfunctions of the Laplacian in the given Riemannian metric.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Global harmonic analysis refers to the use of the global dynamics of geo-&lt;br/&gt;desic fow on the manifold to study the large-eigenvalue asymptotics of the&lt;br/&gt;eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the Laplacian on a manifold. Since global&lt;br/&gt;eigenfunctions of the Laplacian on a manifold are eigenfunctions of the wave&lt;br/&gt;group, and the wave group propagates singularities along geodesics, the high-&lt;br/&gt;frequency properties of eigenfunctions are connected to the long-time dy-&lt;br/&gt;namics of the geodesic flow. Two cases of particular interest are quantum&lt;br/&gt;complete integrability, where the underlying geodesic flow is completely in-&lt;br/&gt;tegrable, and quantum chaos, where the underlying geodesic flow is ergodic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Steve Zelditch of Northwestern University will given ten lectures&lt;br/&gt;on global harmonic analysis. He will begin with basic examples (constant&lt;br/&gt;curvature spaces), develop material on pseudodi¤erential and Fourier inte-&lt;br/&gt;gral operators, derive trace formulas including the celebrated Duistermaat-&lt;br/&gt;Guillemin trace formula, and discuss applications to properties of eigenfunc-&lt;br/&gt;tions and eigenvalues and inverse eigenvalue problems. Completely integrable&lt;br/&gt;and ergodic systems will be considered in depth.</AbstractNarration>
