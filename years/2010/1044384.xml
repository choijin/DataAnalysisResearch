<AbstractNarration>Temple University's Center for Reimagining Children's Learning and Education, the University of Delaware, and Johns Hopkins University are collaborating with the Children's Museum of Manhattan and several other children's museums, science centers, and researchers around the U.S. to conduct a two-day workshop to review and expand the research base on the role of play in children's learning of STEM.  The workshop is associated with a larger, multi-faceted initiative called the Ultimate Block Party (UBP), whose mission is to make a case for and conduct activities on the science of learning and the importance of play in children's lives and their development of 21st century skills. Associated with the workshop, UBP activities in 2010 include a major event on October 3 in Central Park, New York City, whose purpose is to provide families with engaging activities that emphasize how the science of learning supports the critical role of playful learning in children's education.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop participants will include both researchers and practitioners who will share knowledge about children's learning in informal settings and strategize on how to maximize the kind of scientific learning that takes place in free-choice learning environments.  A particular emphasis will be on sparking curiosity about STEM by children from all socio-economic and ethnic groups.  On the second day, participants will also contribute to the event in Central Park by observing and commenting on the event, its impact on attendees, and possible improvements for future events in New York and around the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The process includes an evaluation of the workshop and the production of a workshop report. Dissemination will be both to academic research and informal science education communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ On October 2, 2010 museum professionals and academic researchers attended the Museum Play Panel Workshop funded by the National Science Foundation and initiated by the Ultimate Block Party. This workshop, hosted by the ChildrenÆs Museum of Manhattan, was designed to bridge research and practice in informal education, the science of learning, and play. Panelists representing childrenÆs and science museums were paired with university researchers and each group presented information on two key topics: 1) How to best capitalize on museumsÆ unique role in encouraging children and families to learn through play; and 2) How to effectively document the impact of informal education.  The genesis of this workshop stems from the critical need for a common framework of shared information across museums and better methodology for assessing museum impact. Museums can benefit from strong communication channels to support the sharing of best practices while academic researchers and museums mutually benefit from research that informs both learning theory and informal education. The Play Panel Workshop serves as one step towards addressing the need for wide scale conclusions about informal learning based on research that observes and measures museum impact.  The Workshop had a strong focus on accessibility and reach. To be successful, museums must know their audience and fully understand how to provide a range of playful learning experiences to meet the needs of various families. Museums can share information on demographics with each other and discuss how to best meet the needs of various visitors, including grandparents who are often young childrenÆs primary caregivers. Workshop attendees described the need to draw older adults such as grandparents into the museum learning experience, enhancing "playing across the lifespan." Play experiences provide natural entry points for children to engage with adults of any age both in the museum and beyond. Conversations that begin in the museum can continue on the bus, at the dinner table, or in the waiting room at the doctorÆs office and a key message is to encourage public awareness that we are all scientists. Curiosity and inquisitiveness is not age-specific; being playful and inventive are invaluable traits across the life span.  Ideas are only as good as our ability to communicate them and the notion of "getting out the message" to a large, diverse public was another workshop theme. Technology can be a powerful tool in disseminating content to children and adults alike, but first museums, the Ultimate Block Party, and others must agree upon what the unifying messages are. This warrants further discussion, as does the notion of how to shift focus away from content-driven passive learning towards a greater understanding of how to engage learners in the process of scientific inquiry.  There was general consensus among the Workshop participants that the timing is right to reclaim playful learning for children and adults of all generations.

Rather than giving overburdened parents and grandparents more to do, the goal should be to help adults see true educational value in the simple everyday moments of their childrenÆs lives.  There was strong support for the Ultimate Block Party as a platform for a community event that can reach parents in compelling new ways. The New York City Block Party was designed to bring together families from all of the CityÆs boroughs and served as an opportunity for parents and caregivers not only to observe play but...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
