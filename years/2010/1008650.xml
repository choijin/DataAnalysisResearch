<AbstractNarration>Organic chemists rely heavily on physical models of molecules, so it not surprising that models are also commonly employed to help teach organic chemistry. It has been assumed that when undergraduate students work with these models, ability to construct an internal representation of the molecular structures is enhanced. But few studies have examined this directly and empirically. In addition, virtual models (3-D computer visualizations) have replaced concrete models as powerful computers become available, inviting comparison between learning with real and virtual models. Researchers at the University of California-Santa Barbara and the University of Maryland will conduct a series studies to examine how undergraduate organic chemistry students use models to advance their understanding of molecular structures that require visualizations in three dimensions. This study investigates the benefits of students' use of concrete or virtual models, asking:  &lt;br/&gt;-Does model use improve students? ability to translate between different representations of molecular representations? &lt;br/&gt;-What aspects of models are most effective for representation translation?&lt;br/&gt;-Does instruction in model use alter the frequency and quality of model use?&lt;br/&gt;-Do models support students of low spatial ability more or less effectively than students of high spatial ability?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study uses experimental methods to systematically explore the uses of both concrete and virtual models in promoting meaningful learning in organic chemistry in a series of studies set in the controlled environment of the psychology lab.  An important dependent variable for this study measures students' ability to translate between alternative diagrammatic representations of molecules, an essential skill that all students of organic chemistry must master. Measures include accuracy of the representations that students produce in representational translation and students' interactions (including gestures) with the concrete and virtual models during task performance. The study also tests its emergent theory of model use in university classroom settings by comparing the performance of undergraduates who are trained to use models with those who have had no such training.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study is important because it systematically studies model use in organic chemistry. If students learn to use models more effectively, then they may find more success in undergraduate organic chemistry, a gatekeeper course for many advanced STEM professions. The ability to visualize molecules may be especially challenging for students with low spatial abilities, and the deliberate training in model use may allow more students to not only pass organic chemistry, but stimulate their ability to use models in eventual STEM professions. This study should result in a better understanding of the effectiveness and appropriateness of concrete and virtual models for enhancing student learning in chemistry and new instructional activities for use in chemistry classrooms.</AbstractNarration>

Organic chemistry is particularly demanding of spatial skills, because the reactivity of compounds depends not just on what atoms make up a molecule, but also on the spatial structure or arrangement of these atoms. Chemists  use many different diagrams and models to represent  molecules, but students struggle with mastering these representations, and many students drop out of organic chemistry as a result.  We focused on the use of three-dimensional ball-and-stick models (both physical and virtual) and gestures for teaching molecular structure and diagrammatic conventions in organic chemistry. Our research included surveys of students, observations of instructors teaching with models, laboratory studies, and classroom interventions.  One initial finding was that although organic chemistry instructors use molecular models extensively in the classroom and encourage students to buy their own model kits, students have poor attitudes towards models.  Most students report that they do not purchase model kits and do not use them while studying, because building models of molecules is too time consuming and because they find models confusing in their own right.  Another important initial finding was that when we observed organic chemistry instructors in the classroom, we found that they use gestures as instructional resources in addition to models.

The most successful of these was to have students first solve diagram translation problems on their own (with models available) and then use models to check their solutions. Students who received this "models as feedback" instruction were much more likely to use models in later problem solving and their success rate increased from 30% before instruction to 80% after.  They also improved their attitudes towards using models as learning aids more generally.  Comparisons of Models and Gestures.  In another series of experiments we compared the effectiveness of teaching students about molecular structure and diagrammatic conventions with models versus gestures.  These experiments revealed that diagram translation was best when students were taught with models and had models available at test, but poorest when models when students were taught with models but models were unavailable at test. Students taught with gestures alone (no models) were equally successful at test, regardless of the availability of models.  These results have important practical significance as students typically do not hav...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
