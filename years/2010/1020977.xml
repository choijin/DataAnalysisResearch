<AbstractNarration>This award will fund U.S. participation in the AIMS' Eighth International Conference on Dynamical Systems and Differential Equations to be held at Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany during May 25-28, 2010. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference series is a biennial event whose objective is to create an opportunity to bring together mathematicians and scientists, working in the area of dynamical systems and differential equations with different training background and research approaches, to communicate and report on recent achievements, exchange new ideas and discuss future research directions in an atmosphere that prompts considerable interaction and inspiration. As past conferences have demonstrated, the conference will foster communications and collaborations among established researchers, young scientists and graduate students working in the fields of dynamical systems and differential equations. The funds will provide partial support for travel expenses of participants, especially for graduate students, recent Ph.D.s, and participants from under-represented groups in the mathematical sciences. This award is co-funded by the Applied Mathematics and Analysis programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The American Institute of Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) founded and organizes the Conference Series on "Dynamical Systems, Differential Equations and Applications" biennially that provides a vital international forum for mathematicians and scientists working in the ever growing field of analysis and applied analysis, including dynamical systems, differential equations, and real-world applications.  Each Conference takes place in a different region of the world to benefit most people.  The following five features make the Conference unique and outstanding.   (1) Its high quality and broad coverage so that each participant will be able to find numerous stimulating talks; (2) its well-organized symposia that are participated by most of the leading experts of the world in the chosen areas; (3) its capacity of arranging each Conference to take place in a different region to benefit most people; (4) its organizer, AIMS, which is backed by thousands of supporters.  Its proceedings is also published by AIMS; and (5) its financial support for and broad participation by young researchers and graduate students.  The 8th AIMS International Conference on Dynamical Systems, Differential Equations and Applications was held at The Dresden University of Technology, Dresden, Germany, May 25  - 28, 2010. It was participated by 1400 mathematicians and scientists, a new record, from 61 countries. The four-day Conference featured 7 plenary speakers, 71 special sessions and 10 contributed sessions.  More than 1300 talks were presented. The Conference was beneficial to all participants, especially the graduate students and young Ph.D.s.  The NSF grant supported partial travel expenses for 14 graduate students including some female, 18 post-doc trainees and young faculties, and 5 session organizers from US to attend the Conference.  The Conference at Dresden was saluted by an article at Dynamical Systems Magazine, http://www.dynamicalsystems.org/ma/ma/display?item=346.   The peer-reviewed proceedings of the Conference, edited by Wei Feng, Zhaosheng Feng, Maurizio Grasselli, Xin Lu, Stefan Siegmund and J&uuml;rgen Voigt, will be published in summer 2011.  The first Conference took place at Southwest Missouri State University, Springfield, MO, USA, in May 1996. Since then, the Conference has been hosted by Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai, China; Kennesaw State University, Kennesaw, GA, USA; University of North Carolina at Wilmington, Wilmington, NC, USA; California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, USA; University of Poitiers, Poitiers, France; and University of Texas at Arlington, Texas, USA. The number of participants has grown from 250 in 1996 to a record of 1400 in 2010. Therefore, the Conference Series has proved itself to be a much needed and anticipated grand event for people in the fields.  The Conference Series has been financially supported by the United States National Science Foundation.       Last Modified: 03/04/2011       Submitted by: Yaw Chang]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
