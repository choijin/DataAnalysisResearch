<AbstractNarration>This project will apply a novel technique in gravitational lensing to the measurement of fundamental parameters related to dark energy and the acceleration of the cosmic expansion. The focus is on strong gravitational lensing by massive clusters of galaxies. In strong lensing, the gravitational bending of light by the cluster produces multiple images of background galaxies. The new aspect to be explored in this project concerns those cases where there are multiple images of multiple sources at different distances behind the cluster. Because the lens is the same, analysis of the images can permit the extraction of the lens-source geometry, from which follow constraints on the overall cosmology. Applying this technique quantitatively requires good models for the mass distributions in galaxy clusters and along the full line of sight. To this end, the Principal Investigator and a supported graduate student will perform a ray-tracing analysis through cosmological structure-formation simulations, to quantify the expected statistical and systematic errors on the recovery of cosmological parameters from simulated lens systems. They will then apply the analysis to a sample of five cluster lenses, for which Hubble Space Telescope imaging data exist, and obtain joint constraints on the cosmological matter density and the dark-energy equation of state. In addition to advising the student supported by this project, the Principal Investigator will develop and teach a seminar in scientific communication for undergraduate astronomy majors. This course will jointly benefit university and K-12 students though the presentations that enrolled students will make to a high-school physics class.</AbstractNarration>

The most dramatic observations occur when large light deflections are produced by the most massive objects in the universe, namely clusters of galaxies. Clusters are the most recently assembled structures in the universe and are composed primarily of dark matter, although in the grip of the gravity of dark matter they hold about a 1000 or so galaxies - tiny specks of light in the vast invisible ocean of dark matter. The deflection of light rays from galaxies that lie behind the cluster is produced by this large repository of dark matter in clusters. The effect manifests as a distortion in the observed shapes of the background galaxies view through the cluster. The distortions are typically small, shearing the original shapes only slightly causing them to look elongated, termed as weak lensing. However, occasionally, the distortions can be so strong that the shapes of background galaxies can be wildly mangled, producing highly elongated arcs, and, in fact, multiple copies of the same galaxy on the sky. These effects characterize the strong lensing regime. The precise strength of these stretches in shapes is determined by the detailed distribution of dark matter all along the line of sight from the background galaxy via the cluster to us - everything behind, in and in front of the cluster. The path of light rays also depends on the geometry or shape of space through which they travel. The inference of vast amounts of dark matter is actually attributed to observations of these severe distortions. Observed mangled images are in fact used to back out the detailed distribution of dark matter in clusters. The dependence of the strength of the distortion on geometry allows the use of lensing phenomena for cosmography, i.e. measurement of the cosmological parameters that characterize our universe. In this NSF project, we proposed to study how we could effectively exploit this lensing effect to constrain both the dark matter distribution within clusters as well as measure the properties of dark energy that can be inferred in turn from the measurement of the geometry. One of the goals of observational cosmology is to make the most accurate measurements currently possible of the cosmological parameters that best describe our universe.
