<AbstractNarration>The research study will examine the relationship between student attributes and behavior while working through a series of science projects on computer. This project seeks to advance understanding of how middle school student behaviors within using educational software influence science learning.  The investigators will measure how student attributes such as poor goal orientation, low self-efficacy, and low perseverance are associated with learning outcomes.  They will investigate how these attributes lead to negative behaviors such as gaming the system rather than learning the material, off-task behavior, haphazard inquiry, and help avoidance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will use survey measures of student attributes, automated detectors of student behavior during use of educational software, and measures of student learning to develop models of how different student behaviors lead to improved learning outcomes.  The models are chosen to test which behaviors mediate the relationships between student attributes and learning and how the behaviors do so.  The researchers will use statistical models, such as path analysis, to test their hypotheses.  The study will be conducted in 500 ethnically and economically diverse middle school students who are part of a science assessment project in those schools.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The findings are intended to serve as a basis for creating new educational software and classroom practices that identify in real-time students with low grit, low self-efficacy, and non-productive goal orientation.  Through research with diverse populations, and in a domain where many American students are falling behind, the project has the potential to benefit learners currently disenfranchised from science learning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In recent years, there has been increased interest on engagement during learning. This is of particular interest in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) domains, in which many students struggle and where the U.S. needs skilled workers. The interest in engagement is important, as it is critical to deep learning. This project: 1) laid out and tested some issues important to framing research on this topic, and 2) developed an automatic detector of disengagement and of carelessness (a type of disengagement). Specifically, we concretized engagement, a fuzzy construct, by operationalizing and detecting (i.e., identifying using a computational method) disengaged behaviors that are antithetical to engagement. We, in turn, developed 2 real-time detectors (i.e., machine learned models) of disengaged behavior and of carelessness.   Our work addressed two main issues, which are critical to engagement: 1) that it is contextualized, and 2) that it is malleable. These are both relevant to educational stakeholders because it means that students who are disengaged in one school topic may not be in another, and it also means that we can affect change in studentsÃ† engagement in school.  Transformative Nature. This project is transformative in terms of the methods used; that is, we developed new automated detectors of disengagement and carelessness advancing the state of the art in student modeling and educational data mining.  Broader Impact. By improving the sophistication of detectors for disengagement and carelessness, we can determine exactly when students need support. In the future, these detectors can serve as a basis for a new generation of adaptive educational software and classroom practices that address low engagement in school. Since many students are falling behind in science, the project can benefit learners who are currently becoming disenfranchised from science learning. Given the national importance of scientific literacy emphasized in current reform efforts, this gives the project potential for broad impact in the long-term.
