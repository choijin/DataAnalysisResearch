<AbstractNarration>1006070&lt;br/&gt;Patton&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support the student travel and the Student Paper Competition at the 32nd Annual International Conference of the Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS) that will be held in Buenos Aires, Argentina from August 31 through September 4, 2010. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mission of the Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS) of the IEEE is to advance the application of engineering sciences and technology to medicine and biology, promote the profession, and provide global leadership for the benefit of its members and humanity by disseminating knowledge, setting standards, fostering professional development, and recognizing excellence. To support its mission, EMBS of the IEEE has been organizing annual conferences of the engineering in medicine and biology society for past 30 years. Each year, this annual conference which is the largest meeting of biomedical engineers in the world attracts 2000-3000 people including about 800 students presenting more than 1800 papers from all over the world. The student activities include a widely publicized and well-respected Student Paper Competition and meetings with pioneers and leaders in biomedical engineering, special symposiums and mentoring programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2010, EMBC will be held at the Sheraton Hotel in Buenos Aires, Argentina from August 31 through September 4, 2010. It is expected that more than 1500 scientists, engineers and students will be attending this conference from all over the world. About 150-200 papers are expected to be submitted to the Student Paper Competition. From those, twenty-five finalists will be selected through the use of an on-line review and judging system for making the final oral presentations during the conference. The proposed funding will help US-based student finalists to travel to present their research paper in the Student Paper Competition. It will also provide the prizes for the winners of the Competition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The EMBC Student Competition is indeed a critical portion of the conference, provides a forum where top-notch students are able to compete with other superlative students in a wide array of eleven bioengineering disciplines. Student participants are able to view their research, and their presentation of that research, from a much broader perspective. Without the incentive of this Competition, many students would be unable or less likely to attend the conference, thus missing an introduction to the world of knowledge available at such conferences. In addition, the Competition plays a crucial role in recognizing the talents of women and minorities in the field of bioengineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Competition promotes not only education within bioengineering disciplines, but fosters the next generation of bioengineers by providing a unique opportunity to students to meet and network with the leading biomedical professionals and scientists in the world.</AbstractNarration>
