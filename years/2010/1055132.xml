<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports Professor Frank Turecek of the University of Washington, for mass spectrometry studies of electron capture dissociation and electron transfer dissociation reactions in biomacromolecules.  The goal of this research is to provide new identification methods for peptides and proteins, including structural features connected to non-covalent interactions (tertiary structure) and post-translational modifications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the research are based on Professor Turecek's unique abilities to use his knowledge of organic ion reaction mechanisms and computational chemistry to assess energy distribution in these reactive intermediates, and his group's ability to design and build novel instrumentation for mass spectrometry.  His research group gains expertise across a broad range of disciplines.  The results of their investigations on peptide structure impact the fields of biochemistry and the pharmaceutical industry.</AbstractNarration>
