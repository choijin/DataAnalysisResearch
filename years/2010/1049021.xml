<AbstractNarration>Current general circulation models (GCMs) have difficulty reproducing the rapid Arctic warming and sea ice loss observed over the past decades. One possible factor is that they do not properly represent the radiative forcings from aerosols and tropospheric ozone that could be particularly important in the Arctic. This EaSM Type 1 project will develop an improved understanding of the distributions and decadal trends of aerosols and ozone in the Arctic, including black carbon (BC) deposition fluxes and albedo effects for snow and sea ice, and will study the implications for Arctic climate change over the 1980-2010 period. It will build an interdisciplinary partnership between atmospheric chemists using the GEOS-Chem CTM and cryosphere scientists using CCSM4, to better describe aerosol-chemistry-climate interactions in the Community Earth System Model (CESM). The project will take advantage of intensive observations during the International Polar Year (IPY) to test and improve the GEOS-Chem representation of aerosols, ozone, and BC deposition fluxes in the Arctic. A 30-year GEOS-Chem simulation (1980-2010) with evolving sources from human activity and fires will be conducted and evaluated against long-term records. Aerosols, ozone, and BC deposition fluxes from GEOS-Chem will be input to CCSM4 to simulate Arctic radiative forcing and climate response over the 30-year period. Ensemble sensitivity simulations conducted with CCSM4 will diagnose the perturbations to temperature, sea ice, and atmospheric circulation associated with these radiative forcings. Knowledge gained from this project will be used to evaluate the simulation of Arctic aerosols, tropospheric ozone, and BC deposition fluxes within CESM. Fully coupled aerosol-chemistry-climate simulations of the 1980-2010 period will be conducted in CESM to assess Arctic climate response from aerosols and ozone and to investigate climate feedbacks.  This project will also provide policy analysts with information on the role of aerosols and tropospheric ozone in driving Arctic climate change.  Two graduate students will be trained in interdisciplinary environmental modeling.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Arctic has warmed by more than 1&deg;C over the last century, a rate almost twice the global average. Global climate models (GCMs) have difficulty reproducing the observed Arctic warming, but recent studies suggest that these simulations could be improved by better accounting of aerosols and ozone as near-term climate forcing agents.  The goal of our work was to examine the role of aerosols and ozone in driving climate change in the Arctic on decadal timescales.  To that end, we performed GEOS-Chem model simulations of Arctic atmospheric composition for present-day conditions, and we carried out detailed evaluation of model results with a large ensemble of observations for different aerosol types and ozone over the 1980-2010 time frame.     We first used GEOS-Chem to interpret observations of Arctic aerosols during the 2008 ARCTAS and ARCPAC aircraft campaigns, which occurred in late winter/spring.  We focused on sulfate-ammonium aerosol as well as black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC), and took advantage of longer term records in surface air and in snow (2007&ndash;2009).   We found that growth of sulfur emissions in west Asia may be responsible for the observed increase in aerosol acidity in Alaska over the past decade (Fisher et al., 2011).  Global sulfur emissions are expected to decline in coming decades, a trend which would increase aerosol neutralization in the Arctic, reduce the hygroscopicity of particles, and potentially accelerate Arctic warming.  Model simulations also showed much higher BC snow content in the Eurasian than the North American Arctic, consistent with the limited observations (Wang et al., 2011).  We determined that anthropogenic sources contribute 90% of BC deposited to Arctic snow in January-March and 60% in April&ndash;May and that BC deposition on Arctic snow reduces albedo by 0.6% in spring.     We next extended the GEOS-Chem Arctic simulation to include all of 2008, and evaluated model results with aircraft (ARCTAS), surface, and ship cruise (ICEALOT, ASCOS) observations (Breider et al., 2014).  We determined that Arctic BC is mainly from fuel combustion and boreal fire sources, OC is mainly from fires, sulfate has a mix of anthropogenic and natural sources, and dust is mostly from the Sahara.  We also calculated that the anthropogenic contribution to Arctic aerosol depth is a factor of 4 larger in spring than in summer and is mainly sulfate.  Our simulations suggest a significant role not just for BC but also for OC and dust in shortwave absorption in both the snowpack and atmosphere. Finally, we performed a 30-year simulation with GEOS-Chem (1980-2010) and evaluated the model results against a suite of atmospheric and ice-core observations.  Our results suggest that the recent decline in sulfate aerosol from Europe, the former Soviet Union states, and Russia has contributed significantly to the observed warming over the Arctic in recent decades (Breider et al., ms. in preparation).
