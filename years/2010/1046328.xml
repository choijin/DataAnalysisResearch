<AbstractNarration>Current approaches to predicting changes in community structure and function fail to consider relationships between species' attributes that affect their ecological function, genetic variation underlying those functional traits, and the dynamics of the communities of which they are part. This project will focus on Protea and Pelargonium, two South African plant genera that have undergone dramatic diversification and currently span two biodiversity hot spots, the fynbos and succulent karoo biomes in the Greater Cape Floristic Region (GFCR). This project will develop an understanding of functional trait variation in both genetic and evolutionary contexts, allowing predictions of the characteristics of communities in which they occur and the resilience of those communities to climate change. The project will examine detailed relationships between functional traits, photosynthesis, water use efficiency and leaf life span, including the genetic basis of trait variation and rates of trait diversification. This information will be used to examine effects of taxonomic and trait diversity on ecosystem resilience in response to fire cycle interval.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will expose postdoctoral scholars, graduate students, undergraduates and high school students to international research, including students actively recruited from underserved populations both in the US and South Africa. It will actively enhance conservation infrastructure by working closely in all aspects of the project with the South African National Biodiversity Institute (SANBI) to promote biodiversity science, policy and conservation action.</AbstractNarration>

For Pelargonium, we have documented extensive phenotypic variation among species for functional traits - i.e., those traits related to the plants' success in their local habitats.

We resurveyed plots in the longest running set of permanent vegetation plots in the Fynbos of South Africa (44 years). We found a significant decline in plot species diversity driven by increasingly severe post-fire summer weather events (affecting perennial herbs and graminoids) and alien plant invasion (affecting shrub species). The observed differences in the response of major growth forms and fire-response types could drive major shifts in ecosystem structure and function such as altered fire behavior, hydrology and carbon storage. This is the first example of climate change impacts on biodiversity in the hyperdiverse Cape Floristic Region and demonstrates an important interaction between extreme weather and disturbance by fire that may make flammable ecosystems particularly sensitive to climate change. In addition to these research results, we are also developing important research resources. A reference transcriptome has been published for Protea repens and transcriptome data is being collected for Pelargonium. We also have done sequencing for one species in each genus, with the goal of assembling and annotating full genome sequences for each. We trained 5 postdoctoral researchers and 6 graduate students during the course of the project. They participated in the field work in South Africa, and in the analysis and interpretation of the data we collected. They learned new skills in such areas as phylogenetics, population genomics, physiological ecology and data analysis.   Fifteen papers have been published to date, and papers on the evolution of trait-trait and trait-environment relationships for each genus, as well as on reconstruction of ancestral character states are forthcoming.
