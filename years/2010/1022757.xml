<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to develop a set of laboratory modules and kits for students to explore microscale fluid behaviors and microfludic devices, and to assess and evaluate the effectiveness of the modules and kits at multiple educational institutions.   Ten Microfluidics Laboratory Modules and Kits are being developed and tested in nine existing courses at multiple universities and colleges across the nations.  This project addresses the rapidly growing need for microfluidics technology and a trained workforce. The new learning materials developed from this project allow engineering and science students to explore microscale fluid behaviors and microfluidic devices, and provide opportunities for students to apply science and engineering principles to microscale phenomena and compare them with microscale observations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Microfluidics technology is rapidly spreading and is widely becoming adapted to many areas of industry and research, from new means of drug delivery and bedside health monitoring systems to miniaturized analytical instruments and next-generation fuel cells for consumer electronics. In spite of the rapidly growing need for both microfluidics technology and a trained workforce, the current undergraduate curricula of most engineering schools do not offer microfluidics education.  This is mainly due to (1) lack of faculty expertise, (2) lack of necessary facilities, (3) the tight curriculum occupied by traditional engineering subjects, and (4) lack of commercially available and affordable educational materials. This project aimed to address the lack of microfluidics education in the current engineering curricula by developing and providing a packaged suite of comprehensive laboratory modules and kits.  We developed 10 lab modules and kits and tested them at Drexel University, University of Connecticut, University of Massachusetts at Lowell, the Cooper Union, and Philander Smith College (underrepresented minority institution) via 9 existing courses.  More recently, they were also disseminated to New Jersey Institute of Technology, the University of New Hampshire, and the University of Texas at Rio Grande Valley.   We demonstrated that our microfluidics lab modules and kits produced the following intellectual merits:  - Allow engineering and science students to explore microscale fluid behaviors and microfluidic devices; provide opportunities to apply science and engineering principles to microscale phenomena and compare them with microscale observations.  - Improve engineering curricula to include emerging technologies and enhance student learning through engaging hands-on laboratory experiences.  - Help engineering and science faculty acquire new knowledge and skills in the rapidly growing field of microfluidics; contribute to forming a microfluidics education community.  We also believe that our microfluidics lab modules and kits have the following broader impacts:  - Address the rapidly growing need for microfluidics technology and a trained workforce through broad dissemination and commercialization of new learning materials; accelerate advances in a variety of research areas as well as industries putting the US to take the lead in the technological innovations of the 21st century.  - The new fabrication technologies developed in this project can find numerous applications in many areas, particularly in biomedical applications (e.g. neural probes).
