<AbstractNarration>The US-Africa Advanced Study Institute and Workshop Series in Mathematical Sciences is a collaborative effort between US and African mathematicians.  This program has three main goals: (1) strengthen the US and Southern African human infrastructure in mathematical sciences research, (2) increase and sustain research collaboration between US and Southern African mathematicians, and (3) improve research collaboration between US and Southern African colleges and universities. The Masamu Project (masamu means mathematics in Southern Africa) will be an ongoing professional development program that will enhance the capability of participants to continue to collaborate on research after the Institute and Workshop.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2011 US-Africa Advanced Study Institute will be held in Livingstone, Zambia on November 21 - December 1, 2011.  The Advanced Studies Institute will focus on analysis, dynamical systems, and mathematical biology, and the follow-on workshop will center on mathematical modeling of biological systems.  For 15 days, 13 US and 13 African advanced graduate students and early career faculty will undergo rigorous training and will work collaboratively on research under the supervision and guidance of 9 US, African, and European research mathematicians.  Participants will also attend a panel discussion on careers in mathematical sciences.  Furthermore, heads and chairs from US and Southern Africa will have an opportunity to attend a one-day workshop that will focus on cultivating sustained cooperation between and among US and Southern African Mathematical Sciences Departments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for this award is being provided by the Division of Mathematical Sciences, with co-funding from the Office of International Science and Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
