<AbstractNarration>The recently built Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation (APOLLO) has become the premier lunar laser ranging (LLR) facility in the world, delivering one-millimeter range precision between Earth and Moon as a way to test General Relativity. General Relativity makes specific predictions about the shape of the lunar orbit, so that we may use the Moon as a laboratory, made possible by the reflectors left on the Moon by the Apollo astronauts and unmanned Soviet rovers. The goal of this work is to extend high-quality LLR observations over an additional three-year period, simultaneously collecting calibrated measurements of local gravity well enough to determine site displacements at the millimeter level. In tandem, an intensive effort will be initiated to advance the solar system model to a state that can take advantage of millimeter-quality data. It is by comparison to a complete and sophisticated model that questions relating to gravity, geophysics, and lunar physics can be explored. Though not the main focus, knowledge of the lunar interior stands to gain the most from APOLLO, as the experiment routinely acquires 4 to 5 reflectors in one session, providing exquisite measurements of the lunar orientation and distortion. But this refined knowledge of the moon will also facilitate understanding of how the moon moves in its orbit, as such information is crucial to determining the path of the Moon's center of mass through space.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LLR tests many fundamental aspects of gravity, like the equivalence principle, the constancy of gravity, gravitomagnetism, and the inverse-square law. Improving our knowledge of gravity therefore informs a diverse range of cosmologists, astrophysicists, particle physicists, and string theorists. This effort will also contribute to Earth and planetary science, especially via the inclusion of the superconducting gravimeter data. The open-source solar-system analysis code emerging from the project will provide an interesting platform for analyzing a wide range of data sets, including radar ranging in the solar system, Doppler radar to spacecraft around the solar system, pulsar timing experiments, etc. The same platform can form the basis of covariant studies for future proposed space missions that aim to test fundamental physics. Additionally, graduate student and postdoctoral training is a valuable component of the total effort. Finally, APOLLO will continue its strong tradition of public outreach, including featured appearances on popular television shows.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It may come as a surprise to most people that we do not understand gravity very well, and that it is the most poorly tested of the fundamental forces.  This owes largely to the weakness of gravity relative to the other forces.  While this may seem to be at odds with everyday experience, consider the fact that a magnet held in one's hand can lift a paperclip against the gravitational pull of the entire Earth. Because of this weakness, we can only test our current working theory of gravity&mdash;Einstein's General Relativity&mdash;to about 0.1% precision, and we would like to push this further.  Why is it important to understand gravity more completely? Physics is built on two fundamental pillars: General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Mechanics (via the Standard Model of physics).  The problem is that these pillars are fundamentally incompatible, making physicists very nervous.  Because tests of gravity are relatively low precision, we suspect that we will one day discover a flaw in the theory and need a refinement or replacement of GR.  Thus it is imperative that we subject gravity to the most stringent tests available in our quest to understand the true workings of the Universe.  Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) has long stood at the forefront of tests of GR, using the Earth-Moon-Sun system as a pristine laboratory where gravity is by far the dominant force (less true in a terrestrial laboratory environment).  APOLLO, the Apache Point Observatory Lunar Laser-ranging Operation, has been the world's leading LLR experiment (in data volume and quality) since it began operation in 2006.  This award supported critical operations of APOLLO (described below), which translates to the flagship effort of the best technique for testing a most important foundation in our understanding of physics.  Specifically, this award supported a number of activities in the APOLLO effort.  First, it supported the efforts of graduate student Nathan Johnson (now having completed a PhD) in detector characterization, detector upgrade, and mastering the LLR model while developing a robust statistical technique by which to elucidate realistic errors on estimated parameters within the model.  On this last point, a complex computer model attempts to replicate the LLR measurements between our telescope and the reflectors on the Moon by including all relevant physical effects.  One may use this model to estimate "interesting" parameters such as the fundamental behavior of gravity, but also a host of "uninteresting" yet unknown parameters like initial positions and velocities of planets needed to get all the physics right.  Each estimated value has a formal uncertainty associated with it, but this formal uncertainty tends to be unrealistically small as revealed by a number of tests.  Nathan developed Bootstrap and Jack-knife methods to rigorously pin down realistic uncertainties, finding that they tend to be roughly a factor of 12 to 15 larger than formal uncertainties.  While it would be tempting to "over-report" findings, we must be careful to be fair and honest in assessment of our tests of such a fundamentally important subject.  Second, the award supported operations at the Apache Point Observatory, which is critical to the continuous gathering of the world's highest-quality LLR data.  This includes support for the lead observer, Russet McMillan, who provides a local presence and saves travel costs when minor things go wrong.  Also, we do need to cover travel costs for maintenance, repair, and upgrade efforts at the observatory a few times per year.  Third, this award supported ongoing superconducting gravimeter operations at the observatory, which provides a rare and valuable data record of surface gravity variations at the site&mdash;which aside from being useful to a global geodynamics community is able to tell our project something about vertical displacements of the site that are important for interpreting our measurements. The gravimeter is so sensitive to gravity that a vertical displacement of one millimeter is easily visible as a change in the strength of gravity because the device moved closer to or farther from the center of mass of the Earth! This device allows us to monitor solid earth tides, ocean loading, atmospheric loading, and hydrological loading at the site.  This award was paired with one from NASA for a jointly-funded effort. On the NASA side, we supported John Chandler a the Harvard/Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics to improve the complex LLR model used to extract science from the LLR measurements.  The net effect was a very successful LLR operation that maintained its position of prominence in the global effort to understand the fundamental nature of physics and our Universe.  The APOLLO project continues to operate, and has recently installed (under a continuation of funding separate from this grant) an absolute calibration system that moves LLR into millimeter accuracy for the first time.
