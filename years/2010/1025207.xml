<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project will increase our understanding of learning through service (LTS) programs, specifically aiming to determine whether international service learning is a viable curricular approach with respect to developing desired engineering attributes.  The research questions addressed in the proposal are timely since an increasing number of engineering students participate in international service projects at some personal and institutional expense. The project hypothesizes that LTS improves holistic thinking without detracting from technical ability, and this hypothesis is tested through as well-defined set of research questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project is to validate service learning as an effective educational strategy for engineering students.  Although such programs are popular, they can potentially add costs to college education and some questions about their effectiveness remain unanswered.  This study may develop insights into LTS, and a set of "best practices" that can inform programs that wish to adopt this pedagogy.  There is the potential to demonstrate improved recruitment and retention of under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ISES study, also called the Engineering Pathways Study, focused on measuring how desired attributes of future engineers are impacted by a studentÆs involvement in service or community engagement (CE) efforts and how these attributes develop over the time of a studentsÆ undergraduate education. The three-year project consisted of a sequential, but staggered, study of engineering students; primarily from four institutions.  Cohorts were developed based on studentsÆ level of involvement in curricular and extracurricular service-based activities; i.e., ranked from none to high.   The project used various quantitative and qualitative instruments to explore the impacts of CE on engineering studentsÆ learning; specifically, traditionally technical attributes (e.g., ABET Criteria 3a-e) as well as a mix of non-technical attributes (e.g. global awareness, social context of problems, self-efficacy, identity, civic development, intercultural sensitivity, and psychosocial well-being).  The two major components of the study consisted of semi-annual rounds of administering an on-line survey (for all participants) and telephone interviews (conducted with a sub-set of participants).  An additional instrument to measure intercultural sensitivity was administered to the interview sub-set on an annual basis.     Overall, the project had an initial, total participant number of over 250 (including 120 interviewed), but attrition lead to less than 175 (89 interviewed) continuing their participation throughout the three years.  In summary, the ISES study was successful in collecting an extensive dataset that could illustrate the impact of CE on engineering students &ndash; both in academic performance and personal development.  The multi-indicator efforts, which included both quantitative and qualitative data collection over a three-year period, shows promise to provide significant evidence regarding the positive benefits of community engagement.  Analyses to evaluate how community engagement impacts various indicators of student learning are continuing.       Last Modified: 01/12/2016       Submitted by: Christopher Swan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
