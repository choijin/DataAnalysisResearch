<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project will continue the annual grantees meeting of the NSF's Engineering Education and Centers Division.  This meeting serves to sustain and build networks of researchers and practitioners in engineering education.  In addition, the meeting serves as a venue to evaluate the effectiveness of EEC programs and allow NSF staff to work with PIs in strategizing how to improve programs to meet long-term goals.  The research team will undertake both to manage the meeting, build networks of researchers and practitioners, as well as work with NSF to develop evaluation tools.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project will be to sustain engineering education programs funded by NSF, involve a broad range of participants who are interested in engineering education research, and improve the outcomes of projects supported by NSF funding.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Building Connections within the Engineering Education Research Community  The National Science Foundation (NSF) has sponsored five Engineering Education and Centers (EEC) Division Awardee Conferences since 2007, beginning with a seed grant and then using results to plan and execute a total of 5 conferences. These events, held in the Washington, DC metro area, brought together researchers and practitioners from institutions across the country to share ideas and results, to engage with NSF personnel, and to create and strengthen professional connections. The major goals of the overall project were to:  Enhance networks of researchers and practitioners in engineering education Enable educators to share ideas and best practices within Engineering Education-funded initiatives Deliver workshops to help PIs and coordinators:  --bridge research to practice --engage with cutting edge research in the field --disseminate research findings and teaching practices --enhance diversity across engineering programs, and  --extend the work of NSF in transforming engineering education Support and enhance relationships between PIs and NSF Personnel Stimulate new approaches and initiatives to engineering education problems.   The conferences were attended by awardees, both Principal Investigators (PIs) and Co-Principal Investigators (Co-PIs); graduate and undergraduate students; and teachers involved in Research for Engineering Teachers (RET) programs.   The EEC programs represented at the conferences included:  Engineering Education research programs, e.g. Innovations in Engineering Education, Curriculum, and Infrastructure (IEECI) and Engineering Education Programs (EEP) Research in Engineering Education (REE) Broadening Participation Research Grants in Engineering (BRIGE) Engineering Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) Faculty Early Career (CAREER) Undergraduate Curricular Programs, e.g. Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education in Engineering (NUE) Engineering Research Centers (ERC)   Conference activities included plenary sessions, poster sessions, workshops and networking opportunities. Early conferences utilized workshops as breakout sessions in which PIs with expertise in critical areas (e.g. diversity, sustainability) presented strategies, findings, best practices, and related information to fellow participants. While these provided some opportunities for information exchange and dissemination, the discussion format featured in the more recent events provided improved opportunities for information sharing over the previous yearsÆ workshop format. Over the past four years, the conference program was expanded to include panels to facilitate collaborative relationships between grantees and NSF program officers, increased opportunities for one-on-one networking (including meetings between investigators and NFS staff), and a Graduate Engineering Education Consortium for Students (GEECS).  The conferences were supported by Virginia TechÆs Department of Engineering Education and Department of Outreach and International Affairs through grants awarded by the EEC division. The Virginia Tech team collaborated closely with the NSF team to plan and implement each conference.  Results  The conferences achieved their goals with respect to building a network of engineering education researchers and practitioners. A strong majority of survey respondents (70%) perceived the annual conference as a valuable opportunity. Participants reported high levels for outcomes related to networking, research collaborations, and new teaching practices. More than half of the survey respondents reported meeting people they will likely stay in touch with, and 40% reported encountering new teaching practices they plan to implement. Notably, respondents also reported meaningful outcomes that resulted from prior conferences, including networking, employing new approaches to research dissemination, implementing and sharing new tea...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
