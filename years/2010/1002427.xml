<AbstractNarration>The Double Chooz neutrino experiment will attempt to measure the theta-13 neutrino mixing angle using a very precise comparison of data from a pair of neutrino detectors located near two nuclear reactor cores at Chooz, France. This mixing angle is significant for measurements of CP violation in the neutrino sector, which may shed light on the source of matter-dominance in the Universe. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding for a Front-End Electronics (FEE) system that is critical for the operation of the Double Chooz Near detector. The FEE has been designed at Drexel University, with engineering support from LLNL. Construction will be started at Drexel, with a significant contribution of undergraduate student participation, in the performance testing, installation and final certification. Drexel will partner with nearby Rowan University to involve their undergraduates in the FEE effort, providing them with a physics research experience to which they normally would not have access. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the Broader Impacts, Double Chooz has the potential to be a very precise neutrino detector for determining reactor isotope composition and giving an independent measure of fuel burn-up, capabilities that could find application in non-proliferation monitoring and improving the energy yield of reactor fuel. It is the improvements in neutrino detector precision, addressed in part by this proposal, that will make such practical applications of neutrino detectors possible. Part-time undergraduates will be hired at Drexel and at Rowan, partnering a Media Arts student with a physics student, to create video content related to neutrino interactions and detection. This new content will be added to and integrated with the "Neutrinos at Double Chooz for Everyone" on a website at Drexel.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Double Chooz experiment aims at measuring the 'third' neutrino mixing angle (&Theta;13), by means of a high-precision measurement of neutrino rate and energy spectrum at two distances from a nuclear power station.     The larger goal in current neutrino physics research is to find CP violation (matter/antimatter asymmetry) with neutrinos, as this would shed light on the matter-dominance that arose in the early Universe, rather than having a predominance of anti-matter, or a mix of matter, anti-matter and radiation.  Put in philosphical terms, this is the question of "why is there something, rather than nothing?".   Amazingly, experimental physics may soon be close to the point of being able to answer that philosophical question with hard experimental data from controlled experiments.  However,  the neutrino CP violation parameter necessary for this explanation is multiplied by a &Theta;13  dependent term, so knowledge of &Theta;13 is essential to determine the CP violation.  The objective of the research effort in this particular grant is to build and commission fast front-end electronics for the Double Chooz "near" detector, an essential piece of the effort to make more precise neutrino measurements with Double Chooz, in the quest for finding a precise value of &Theta;13.  The design effort has been completed, with some revisions arising from experience with the first (far) detector. The near detector lab was completed, and put into operation in late 2014.  Since that time, there have been some improvements put in place to give greater reliability and safety, mainly involving the Front-End power supply and thermal interlock systems.  Numerous papers have been published with Double Chooz results measuring &Theta;13 , with improved results still on the way. In addition, a "bump" in the neutrino energy spectrum has been observed (since confirmed by other experiments) that remains a matter of interest for the calculation of neutrino flux from reactors. A discrepancy between the overall detected neutrino flux from reactors (over many experiments, over many years) and improved reactor neutrino flux calculations has giving rise to searches for "sterile neutrinos" and other explanations of the discrepancies.   Given the numerous times that neutrinos and weak interactions have shown surprising and unexpected behavior, these 'anomalies' in reactor neutrino measurments are being given serious attention.
