<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funds for travel and subsistence for a Summer School on Logic, Languages, Compilation, and Verification.  The program can be found at http://www.cs.uoregon.edu/Activities/summerschool/summer10/.  The  instructors are an all-star cast of energetic researchers/educators who are experts in the covered areas.  The workshop has important broader impacts in training the next generation of researchers and educators (for both the instructors and students) by building a sense of community and connecting their research pursuits.  Participation is highly international, which helps build US participation in the global  research community.</AbstractNarration>
