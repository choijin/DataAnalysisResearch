<AbstractNarration>This project examines the feasibility of using new solid sorbents for CO2 capture from flue gas streams. The research is a combination of molecular modeling and experimentation to study the interactions between CO2 and Elastic Layered Metal-Organic Frameworks (ELMs). The project also includes an LCA for a hypothetical 500 MW power plant retrofitted with an ELM adsorption system.  The hypothesis is that such absorbents would be highly efficient in adsorbing and releasing CO2 without substantial energy penalties.  The project addresses head-on the challenge of CO2 capture in the context of messy flue gas streams, which contain H2O and other impurities such as SO2, NOx, etc. Repeated cycling of exposure to a moist gas stream may ultimately degrade these sorbents. Molecular modeling of this process will provide an indication of the extent to which this technology is feasible.  If successful, the advances would have the potential to be transformative in guiding the design of effective CO2 solid sorbent structures and economics of carbon capture. Research findings will be integrated into distance education classes taught to industrial audiences and outreach to middle and high school students in Ann Arbor.  Undergraduates will participate in the research.  A collaboration with researchers in Japan is an important component of the project.&lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by OISE-Japan.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bruce K.
