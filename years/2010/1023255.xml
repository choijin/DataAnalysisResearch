<AbstractNarration>This project integrates two literatures within political science which seek to explain the policy preferences of the mass public.  The first, a psychological approach, argues that preferences are a function of relatively stable dispositions, such as differences in motivation, needs and values.  In other words, citizens match their own priorities to the content of specific policy options.  The second, a sociological approach, suggests that opinion formation is a product of interaction with political elites, whereby citizens turn to trusted others for information relevant to making a judgment, and thus obtain their opinions second hand.  The theory tested in this project argues that each literature has made important contributions, but a more complete understanding of public opinion requires their simultaneous consideration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, the investigators argue that citizens form their opinions through two distinct paths, and that the operative path is determined by the complexity of the issue itself.  When issues are "easy" (i.e., non-technical, symbolic) individual differences in psychological dispositions directly constrain preferences, as argued with the former literature.  However, when issues are "hard" (i.e., technical, new on agenda), citizens must turn to trusted elites for guidance.  Importantly, however, this model posits that elite trust itself is judged on the basis of the perception of shared dispositions between citizen and elite.  In essence, dispositional similarities serve as cues, or heuristics, for delegation.  Citizens trust those they consider to be most like themselves.  Such dispositions can thus have both direct effects on preferences, as well as indirect effect through elite cue-taking.  The theory and its implications are tested using diverse empirical methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While this is a meaningful theoretical contribution in its own right, the model developed herein also has important implications for contemporary American politics.  Some of the most consequential issues currently being debated at the elite level are prototypic "hard" issues.  In such cases, as argued above, citizens will turn to trusted elites.  This project suggests that citizens do not necessarily generate trust assessments on the basis of criteria most relevant to the judgement at hand, but rather on the broader dispostional characteristics of the elites.  Thus, dimensions of evalution irrelevant to a given policy judgment may indirectly influence citizen opion through cue-taking.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Recent research has argued that ideological orientations in the American mass public are, to a large extent, rooted in psychological dispositions related to differential needs for social order, epistemic certainty, and existential security. Citizens high in such needs tend to be conservative in their political outlook, as conservative policies offer institutional stability and a justification of the status quo, while those low in such needs, in their comfort with ambiguity and change, find liberalism appealing. In its focus on a single ideological dimension, however, such work fails to provide a full account of ideology in the American mass public, which, despite the polarization of elites over the last thirty years, remains multidimensional. In particular, work has largely failed to provide an account of economic preferences within a dispositional framework.  This project considers in greater depth the relationship between psychological needs for order, certainty and security and economic conservatism. I argue that the economic domain is unique, relative to the social and foreign policy domains, in that such issues are prototypically "hard," or in other words, technical and non-symbolic. Citizens do not, by default, represent such issues in abstract terms related to institutional stability and change; rather, such representations develop in the context of citizen engagement with political elites, and the cues and frames which these more sophisticated political actors provide. This dynamic creates an asymmetry in how preferences are formed between the engaged and unengaged with important implications for the ways in which needs for order, certainty and security are translated into economic preferences, and thus for the structure of mass ideology.  Utilizing diverse methods and data across many years of American politics, including both experimental and survey-based designs, I show empirically that needs for order, certainty and security do indeed provide an important structuring force to preferences in the economic domain, but in heterogeneous ways across citizens, and across political time. For the highly engaged, such needs drive economic conservatism, while for the unengaged they drive economic liberalism. In addition, I find that the connection between needs and economic preferences amongst the engaged emerged in the context of the rise of cultural politics in the early 1990s, suggesting that the qualitative nature of psychological constraint is time-bound.  These findings have several important implications for a full understanding of American politics.  First, they show that the influence of personality on political ideology is more complex than previous research has considered, both in terms of cross-domain heterogeneity, and in terms of intra-domain variation across different types of citizens.  Second, I find that while personality factors do indeed provide an underlying foundation for the ideological constraint, both the magnitude and  qualitative nature of this constraint is time-bound, and conditional on the nature of party conflict at the elite level.  This suggests that the potential for future ideological realiagnments which, while rooted in these same basic personality factors, are of a very different pattern with respect to the association between social and economic ideologies.  Finally, my findings speak to recent concerns that the rise of "cultural" conflict at the elite level has displaced the economic domain and driven blue-collar White Americans into the Republican Party, suggesting a decrease in social welfare provision over the long term.  This project suggests that displacement is unnecessary for such dynamics in social welfare provision to occur.  Because low SES citizens tend to be higher in these needs for order, certainty and security, they are likely to become increasingly conservative economically as they gain political sophistication.  In other words, rather than displacing economic preference...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
