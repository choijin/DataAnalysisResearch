<AbstractNarration>On January 3, 2010 a moment magnitude, MW 7.1 earthquake occurred along a portion of the Solomon Islands, causing substantial strong shaking and triggering local landslides and a tsunami that impacted several of the islands, most notably Tetepare and Rendova. The event was likely triggered by, and occurred very near the southeastern terminus of the massive MW 8.1 earthquake of April 1, 2007, which itself caused a substantial local tsunami that devastated many coastal areas. This most recent event was unique in that it caused a notable tsunami that was identifiable on two ocean-bottom pressure sensors nearly 1000 km away, even though it was only a moderately large MW 7.1 event. Such disproportionate tsunami excitation is observed with moderately larger (MW 7.5-7.8) rare tsunami earthquakes, yet this exhibits only a modestly slow character.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two main possibilities are proposed to explain the tsunami excitation of the 2010 event: 1) The earthquake was a "partial tsunami earthquake" in that it ruptured both a fast and slow component, giving it a mostly normal energy-moment ratio (a now well established tsunami earthquake discriminant; or 2) Strong shaking from the event triggered a submarine landslide that generated the tsunami.  It is likely that this event ruptured similarly to the 2007 event, with slip occurring primarily in discrete patches along the shallowest portion of the trench, much like slip observed in tsunami earthquakes. We will use the extreme proximity of coastal environments to the rupture area and trench to conduct a postseismic tsunami inundation and near-source geodetic deformation survey along the two most proximal islands to the event to identify the magnitude and distribution of both parameters. Geodetic measurements will include short-term static and kinematic GPS of uplifted and exposed coral communities and subsidence and submergence of anthropogenic structures. SAR scenes will also be evaluated for usable interferograms covering the affected islands. This information will be invaluable at assessing whether the coseismic slip alone was responsible for generating the observed tsunami, and will yield new insight into the potential for tsunami excitation from even low-magnitude 7 events occurring within the shallow trench. The tsunami run-up data will be modeled (in collaboration with researchers from NOAA) using the resultant coseismic interface slip model constrained from the combined geodetic techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RAPID award was supported by the Geophysics, Marine Geology &amp; Geophysics, and Geotechnical Engineering Programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  On 3 January 2010 a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck the Solomon Islands very near the San Cristobal trench, causing extensive landslides and surprisingly large tsunami waves.  Because of the unique proximity of islands to the trench and the earthquake, we performed a post-seismic survey which successfully identified unexpected widespread coseismicsubsidence toward the trench (up to 80 cm).  Surprisingly this earthquake had no discernible postseismic deformation.  Approximately 1000 km from the earthquake, ocean-bottom pressure sensors measured 1-2 cm open-ocean tsunami waves.  Though the tsunami affected a small area, the local tsunami wave heights were very high (up to 7 m) and were comparable to the much larger adjacent 2007 magnitude 8.1 earthquake.    Intellectual Merit:  In this study we advanced the field of earthquake seismology and tsunami science by evaluating the characteristics of this unique event and comparing it to other similarly sized and larger earthquakes (many of which do not create tsunamis).  We found that the seismically determined earthquake mechanism, broad-scale subsidence, tsunami amplitude and open ocean wave heights could all be explained by an extremely shallow low-angle thrust adjacent to the impinging subduction of the two seamounts near the trench.  We argue that this event belongs to a new class of energetic shallow "tsunami earthquakes" that produces a surprisingly large amount of shaking as compared to other earthquakes that rupture in this environment.  Broader Impact:  This small study contributed to the laboratory and field education of three graduate students.  These students will use the tools and techniques learned hear to further advance earthquake and tsunami science.  The results of this study are of significant societal benefit as it highlights these potentially problematic events.  This is because such earthquakes  would not normally be considered likely candidates for tsunami generation.            Last Modified: 04/19/2011       Submitted by: Andrew V Newman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
