<AbstractNarration>The University of Texas, El Paso proposes to extend the work of the Computing Alliance of Hispanic-Serving Institutions (CAHSI) in collaboration with their partners: California State University-Dominguez Hills, California State University-San Marcos, Dade College, Florida International University, New Mexico State University, Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi, University of Houston Downtown, University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez, and the University of Texas Pan American. Together these Hispanic-Serving institutions will work to adapt proven strategies that have positive impact on (1) the number of Hispanic students who enter the workforce with computing degrees; (2) the retention and advancement of Hispanic students and faculty in computing, and (3) the development of sustainable, competitive education and research programs. To accomplish this, CAHSI has already implemented a number of programs, including Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL) that creates an active learning experience for students and leadership experiences for undergraduates serving as peer leaders, the Affinity Research Group (ARG) model that emphasizes the deliberate and intentional development of technical, team and professional skills and knowledge required for research, and Mentor-Grad that engages undergraduates in experiences and activities that prepare them for graduate studies and the professoriate. CAHSI has a strong record of success: recent bachelor's graduation rates of Hispanics in computer science increased by nearly 25% within their member institution, while over the same time period, the national trend showed a 39% decline. This extension will add two new goals to its agenda (1) institute a sustainable infrastructure that supports CAHSI's continued impact and (2) become recognized as an organization that affects decision-making and cultural change at the local, regional, and national levels. To achieve these goals CAHSI will establish the cyber infrastructure to support collaborations and dissemination of CAHSI practices, establish collaborations beyond the Alliance with organizations and institutions sharing common goals, and promote multicultural awareness in administrators, faculty, and students.</AbstractNarration>

The motivation to establish CAHSI lies in the rapid growth of the Hispanic population and the urgency to build a competitive computing workforce and maintain the nation&rsquo;s prominence in technology. CAHSI&rsquo;s efforts are focused on increasing the number of Hispanics who enter computing, graduate from baccalaureate programs, complete advanced degrees, and advance in their careers by implementing effective practices that address causes for underrepresentation. <span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">&nbsp;</span></p> <p>CAHSI's vision is: <span><em>By 2030, Hispanics will represent 20% or more of those who earn credentials in computing, i.e.,</em> </span><em>degrees and certifications that lead to gainful employment and advancement in the field.</em><strong></strong><em></em> The founding institutions are: California State University, Dominguez Hills; Florida International University; New Mexico State University; Texas A&amp;M University-Corpus Christi; University of Houston-Downtown; University of Puerto Rico, Mayag&uuml;ez; and The University of Texas at El Paso. CAHSI has expanded its alliance to over 40 HSIs and organizations across states with high concentrations of Hispanics. Other partnerships sharing CAHSI&rsquo;s vision include some of the most impactful Hispanic organizations in the country, e.g., Excelencia in Education and Great Minds in STEM.&nbsp; CAHSI has been nationally recognized for its evidence-based practices by the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanics as a &ldquo;Bright Spot in Hispanic Education&rdquo; and has been added to the &ldquo;Growing What Works&rdquo; database by <em>Excelencia</em> in Education, a nonprofit organization dedicated to Hispanic student success in higher education.</p> <p><em>Intellectual Merit</em>. CAHSI integrates evidence-based practices and promotes educational cultures to support student trajectories through the academic computing pipeline by consistently fostering multifaceted Hispanic student engagement throughout undergraduate and graduate education. CAHSI has spent great effort and resources to develop organizational capacity for pedagogical change and to cultivate a robust network of partners with tangible, meaningful contributions to CAHSI resources. CAHSI&rsquo;s educational innovations have increased student retention and success. Peer-Led Team Learning (PLTL), for example, has increased course completion rates by 10%. Designated by the U.S. Department of Education as a promising and practical strategy to increase student success, PLTL introduces a peer-led workshop as an integral part of the course. CAHSI students are socialized into the knowledge, skills, and values of the profession from research experiences using the Affinity Research Group (ARG) model, a set of practices built on cooperative-learning principles that have been shown to increase student achievement and self-esteem. From 2009-2014, ARG students have attended professional conferences at thrice the rate of a large, diverse national sample of REU students, and presented a paper or poster at a national conference at thrice the national rate. These differences are statistically significant. The evaluation of CAHSI&rsquo;s organizational capacity at the institutional level found that CAHSI faculty report students are more engaged in computing since CAHSI began, with 79% of these faculty members indicating a positive change in at least one of the following: undergraduate research, peer collaboration, and/or faculty interaction; all CAHSI computing departments are capable of training faculty and students in CAHSI initiatives; and all departments have more than one trained faculty member on campus.
