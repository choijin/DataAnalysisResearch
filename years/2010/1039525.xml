<AbstractNarration>Hunt 1039525&lt;br/&gt;University of Washington&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds are committed to provide partial support for an ESSAS (Ecosystem Studies of Sub-Arctic Seas) Program Open Science Meeting (OSM) to be held 22-26 May 2011 in Seattle, Washington. ESSAS was initiated in 2005, originally as a Regional Program in GLOBEC (Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics) and since the termination of GLOBEC, it is now a Regional Program in IMBER (Integrated Marine Biogeochemical and Ecosystem Research). ESSAS is an international collaborative research program that seeks to improve understanding of how climate change will affect the productivity and sustainability of the goods and services offered by the sub-arctic seas. The scientific approach has emphasized comparative studies, and has included both national programs, often involving field work, and international programs emphasizing the synthesis of existing data and their comparison. The ESSAS program is now in its fifth year and, at this mid-point of its intended lifespan, it is appropriate to assess progress to date and fruitful directions for future work. Additionally, several of the national programs in ESSAS are winding down their field work, and it is appropriate to assess their accomplishments and to showcase their results.  The structure of the OSM will include a day for workshops, 5 half-day plenary sessions, and three afternoons with 3 or 4 parallel sessions each day, depending on demand. There will also be a venue for poster displays and an evening reception to encourage interactions among the authors of the posters and other attendees at the meeting.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Value:                  The ESSAS OSM  showcased progress made both in the ESSAS working groups, and in the national and multi-national programs affiliated with ESSAS, including the Bering Sea Ecosystem Study (BEST) and the Bering Sea Integrated Ecosystem Research Program (BSIERP).  The OSM helped to identify knowledge gaps, and pointed toward future research needs within ESSAS.  It also provided an excellent opportunity to envision ways that ESSAS could interact with other international programs in future comparative ecosystem studies.                     The OSM was attended by 195 scientists (of whom 23 were early career scientists and 28 were students) from 13 countries. There were 98 oral and 61 poster presentations.                  The OSM was structured into three 1-day Workshops, and two half-day Workshops, and nine Theme Sessions:  &bull; 1: Comparative studies of polar and sub-polar ecosystems  &bull; 2: New observations and understanding of eastern and western           Bering Sea ecosystems  &bull;3: Modeling marine ecosystem dynamics in high latitude regions  &bull; 4/9: Nutrients, biogeochemistry and acidification in a changing climate  &bull; 5: New insights from the International Polar Year (IPY)  studies  &bull; 6: National ESSAS programs: Recent advances and contribution  &bull; 7: Anticipating socio-economic and policy consequences of global changes in sub-polar and polar marine ecosystems  &bull; 8: Interactions between gadoids and crustaceans: The roles of climate, predation, and fisheries.  Invited speakers gave presentations during the 4 plenary sessions held each morning.                  Sixty-one posters were on display throughout the meeting, with a dedicated poster session one evening during which many participants were able to discuss the science and results behind the posters.  The last day of the OSM, was taken up with brief reports from each of the parallel topic sessions to inform all of the participants of some of the main findings under each topic.  The wrap-up to the OSM was in the form of 3 special invited lectures.                  The ESSAS OSM has resulted in at least three Special Volumes.  One, in the ICES Journal of Marine Science, has gone to press with 19 research articles and will be available in September 2012. it contains a variety of papers representing most aspects of the material covered in the OSM.  A second special volume will be devoted to Bering Sea studies and will appear in Deep-Sea Research II.  This volume of with 29 submissions is currently completing the editing and review process.  In addition there is a special section of Marine Ecology Progress Series that is in preparation. This contribution will contain a number of papers on the interactions between cod and related fish and crustaceans, especially snow crab and north...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
