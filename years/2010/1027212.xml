<AbstractNarration>The 2010 East Coast Computer Algebra Day (ECCAD), will be held at Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, on May 15, 2010. The purpose of this meeting is to stimulate interest in and enhance understanding of the technical aspects of computer algebra, by providing a meeting for those in the region who are active or interested in any aspect of computer algebra, including theory, software, and applications. The one day format allows researchers from the community and those interested in learning more about computer algebra to meet with each other in an inexpensive and easily accessible way. This meeting will be more informal than a traditional conference, with ample time for unstructured interaction. Participation by graduate students from the region will be particularly encouraged through special invitation to contribute to the poster sessions, and through travel support.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The meeting will include presentations by three speakers who are researchers in computer algebra or who make signi cant use of computer algebra in applications. In addition, there will be contributed poster and software demo sessions, and a panel discussion on trends, open issues and future directions of computer algebra.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The East Coast Computer Algebra Day (ECCAD) 2010 was held at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia on Saturday, May 15, 2010.  Computer Algebra refers to computer software that manipulates symbols, symbolic equations, and mathematical formulae.  Computer algebra systems provide a flexible and powerful tool for doing mathematics using the power of a computer and enable mathematical calculations that would be impossible by hand.    Computer Algebra is important in many applications of mathematics and underlies a lot of applied mathematics, for example, things like computer-aided animation and secure online communication would be impossible without computer algebra.  The purpose of ECCAD 2010 was to stimulate interest in and enhance understanding of the technical aspects of computer algebra, by providing a meeting for those in the region who are active or interested in any aspect of computer algebra, including theory, software, and applications.   The NSF grant was used to pay the travel expenses of invited speakers and to support the attendance of graduate students and junior faculty.    The conference was very successful, with 43 participants from a number of colleges and universities as well as industry.  There were 3 interesting plenary talks along with software demonstrations and posters, as well as a lively panel discussion on computer algebra in education.
