<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Anne Baranger and Alex Scheeline at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  The research projects supported in this site are in broad areas of chemistry.  Undergraduates will be recruited to this site primarily from institutions that lack infrastructure to support undergraduate research, including students from Kennedy King College in Chicago.  The site will support ten students per summer in a ten week program.  A sample of the projects that undergraduates will work on include:  (1) the study of nonlinear dynamics in enzyme-catalyzed oscillatory reactions with Prof. Alex Scheeline; (2)  the label-free detection of biomolecules using arrays of silicon photonic microring resonators with Prof. Ryan Bailey; (3)  the study of the use of inorganic compounds as starting materials to make  solids with interesting properties, with Prof. Gregory Girolami; (4)  the study of protein and RNA folding with Prof. Martin Gruebele; (5) the study of the structure, function and folding of RNA:protein complexes using computational chemistry techniques with Prof. Zan Luthey-Schulten; and (6) the study of the synthesis, characterization and applications of metallic nanoparticles with Prof. Catherine Murphy.   In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a number of professional development activities, including ethics training.  Participants in the REU site will also work with participants in other programs on campus, including the GAANN program, the Women's Chemistry Committee (through participation in a poster session) and the intramural Summer Research Opportunity Program.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training.  This REU site aims to provide research training using state-of-the-art facilities in a broad range of topics in the chemical sciences.  Undergraduate researchers participating in this site will have significant, hands-on access to sophisticated research tools, and will be working with some of the leaders in a number of areas of chemistry.  The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates funds were supplemented by funds from the 3M Foundation, and in collaboration with the Summer Research Opportunity Program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 54 students over 5 years (2012-2015) participated in forefront chemical research.  Intellectual Merit  One peer-reviewed publication emerged during the time a student was on-campus, and at least one student in 10 was a co-author of a peer-reviewed publication written within 2 years after their participation.  The REU proposal hypothesized that students should be recruited using both the Research Experiences for Undergraduates pool and the Summer Research Opportunity Program pool, and then placed in the program which best fit their needs.  Students who were "cross-recruited" were dissatisfied; their self-selection between programs proved to be more accurate than faculty views of which program fit best, and trying to participate in both programs simultaneously proved burdensome, negatively impacting research productivity and morale.  Students who participated found the program stimulating, produced high quality science, and even if they did not attend graduate school found the program helpful in preparing for professional school programs.  Broader Impacts  Students from a wide range of colleges and universities (private and public, large and small, across the US and Puerto Rico) and members of many demographic groups had the opportunity to do research in all chemical subfields.  They worked for faculty ranging from first year assistant professors to emeriti.  Approximately 1/3 of the participants subsequently matriculated to a graduate program in chemistry, biochemistry, chemical engineering, or materials science.  The program thus served its purpose of boosting the research involvement of undergraduate students.  Nevertheless, only about one highly qualified applicant in 8 received an offer to be part of our REU program, with half the offers accepted.  That is, had none of the actual participants applied, there were an additional 7 students in line with applications nearly as compelling.  REU thus shares with graduate school admissions the conflict that there are more eager participants than opportunities available.  Women made up over half of our participants, and underrepresented groups filled 20 to 25% of positions.       Last Modified: 10/21/2015       Submitted by: Alexander Scheeline]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
