<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation award funds the acquisition of a new transmission electron microscope (TEM) and a new ultramicrotome to support research and training in biology, materials science and engineering at The University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM).  The TEM and ultramicrotome replace aging equipment used by researchers answering fundamental questions in evolution, development, physiology, cell biology, ecology, oceanography, climate change and tropical agriculture. The new instrumentation supports NSF and other funded research in a broad range of biological specializations including: marine viral ecology; biodiversity of marine and freshwater algae; basic plant cell biology; marine invertebrate reproduction, larval settling and metamorphosis; evolution of invertebrate myelin; neural stem cell biology; role of mouse Y chromosome genes in fertilization; and others.  Furthermore, the UHM Biological Electron Microscopy Facility uses the new microscope in many educational and outreach activities. The TEM is used for demonstrations for K-12 science classes of local public and private schools, as part of laboratory demonstrations and sessions for undergraduate and graduate university courses in biology and engineering, in a training program for community college faculty and students, other specialty workshops, and for undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral associates conducting research with UHM faculty.  The results of these research and teaching efforts will be broadly disseminated through abstracts and peer reviewed publications, as well as by active participation of students and faculty at professional meetings</AbstractNarration>
