<AbstractNarration>The tectonic development of the Amerasian Basin (the western Arctic Ocean) is largely unknown, but is key to understanding formation of the vast apron of continental shelves that ring the Arctic Ocean. This region is increasingly becoming important because of the receding ice cover due to global warming, national security considerations as we look to the future of new Arctic shipping lanes, and the maneuvering by the seven Arctic nations (including the United States) to expand their continental-shelf jurisdiction in accordance with Article 76 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. This project will test competing hypotheses for formation of the Alpha and Mendeleev Ridges through geochemical analysis of the first suite of volcanic rocks that have been dredged from the western Arctic. This three-year research project will involve several key analytical areas: 1) isotopic dating of selected dredged samples to establish a chronologic framework for follow-up geochemical work, and for tectonic interpretations; 2) petrographic and microprobe analysis of thin sections to identify samples best suited for major and trace element modeling to determine the degrees and depth of melting while also being mindful of any fractional crystallization effects; 3) identify a subset of samples for measurements by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and secondary ionization mass spectrometry (SIMS) of the primary melt volatile concentrations in olivine-hosted melt inclusions; 4) measurement of major elements by electron microprobe and trace elements by laser ablation ICP-MS on the same melt inclusions as those characterized for volatiles to identify the compositions of the most primitive magmas preserved in any form within the submarine lavas, and 5) measurement of a complete set of isotopic compositions for 40 samples. The project will support one graduate student and one undergraduate.</AbstractNarration>

We subsequently also acquired lava samples for analysis collected by our Russian colleagues from Alpha-Mendeleev Ridge and Franz Josef Land &ndash; all thought to be in the same magmatic province.   At least three episodes of magmatic activity have been recognized on the basis of 40Ar/39Ar age determinations in the submarine basaltic samples dredged, drilled or grabbed with a manipulation arm from Alpha / Mendeleev Ridge and Chukchi Borderland of the Arctic Ocean by US Coast Guard Icebreaker Healy, in August-September 2008, and Russian research vessel Captain Dranitsin, in August-October 2012: ca. 112 Ma, ca. 100 Ma and ca. 85-73 Ma.

Eruptions at ca. 100 Ma and 85-73 Ma produced two types of lavas: low-Ti tholeiitic basalts &ndash; LT, and high-Ti alkali basalts &ndash; HT, both assigned to Group 2.

Both LT and HT basalts have Sr, Nd and Hf isotope ratios that fall between MORB and Bulk Silicate Earth (143Nd/144Nd = 0.512669-0.512919; 87Sr/86Sr = 0.703820-0.704764; 176Hf/177Hf = 0.283128-0.283191), and are thus characterized as depleted, most likely originating in a subcontinental asthenospheric source. Contamination of these lavas with small amounts of lithospheric components is a distinct possibility. HT basalts, generally the younger of the two lava types in Group 2, are more depleted in their Nd and Sr isotopic compositions than the older LT basalts. Measured Pb-isotopic ratios plot mostly along and above the Northern Hemisphere Reference Line or NHRL (206Pb/204Pb = 18.59-19.37; ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
