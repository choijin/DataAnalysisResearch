<AbstractNarration>Technical: This project addresses fundamental electronic/photonic materials science synthesis/processing research to achieve condensed phase (CP) atomic layer deposition (ALD) for formation of semiconductor grade (purity, crystallinity) conformal nanoscale films with atomic level control. The key feature of ALD is that limited reactions are used to control the deposition rate, not the time or flux; those reactions are used in a cycle, where an atomic layer or monolayer (ML) is deposited each cycle. Growth is then a function of the cycle chemistry and the number of cycles used. The reactions are controlled by a limiting reagent, generally the deposit surface area. While the vast majority of ALD is performed using gas or vacuum phase processes, this project takes an electrochemistry condensed phase (CP) approach to atomic level control of electronic materials synthesis/processing. The main thrust is exploration of CP-ALD chemistry formation of high quality junctions needed for device fabrication, e.g., the formation of multijunction photovoltaics (PV). Conformal deposition of nanoscale films of semiconductors, metals and insulators on insulators, metals and semiconductors are included. The work aims to increase the diversity of materials which can be formed using CP-ALD. Deposition of compounds and metals on conducting surfaces has been successful. Ideas concerning the deposition of nanofilms on insulators, and of oxides or insulators will be studied. In addition, continued work concerning deposition of metals, elemental semiconductors, and compounds on each other will be extended. Systems proposed for study are from the areas of microelectronics, memory and photovoltaics. &lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with technological relevance in electronics and photonics. The primary impact of this project will be study and development of CP-ALD, in order to provide alternative methodologies to the gas and vacuum based electronic materials synthesis and processing techniques. Dissemination of research results will be by creation of a Wiki, or specialized web page, dedicated to CP-ALD methods, results, equipment, and the ancillary knowledge required to form such deposits.  The PI actively addresses increasing diversity within science and engineering. The project is interdisciplinary, providing graduate and undergraduate  students with advantageous opportunities to do research that bridges basic research and application, and research across traditional fields of materials science, chemistry, and engineering. In addition to experiencing, and contributing to an important topic centered in unique materials research, they will learn basic skills required in the use of electronic materials characterization tools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     This project was designed to investigate chemistry which can be used to form nanofilms of materials via the condensed phase version of atomic layer deposition (CP-ALD). ALD has been manifest as a gas or vacuum phase process.  However, the principles are that surface limited reactions are used to grow materials an atomic layer at a time.  The present work was performed to show the breadth of applications where a condensed phase has been used with these principles of ALD, rather than vacuum.  A distinct advantage of using an aqueous solution to deliver reactants, for example, is that an ultra-pure salt can be used as a precursor, rather than the organometalic precursors needed to deposit most elements using vacuum ALD.  The problem with organometalics is that the organic ligands are difficult to remove from the deposit, leading to contamination.    The examples of CP-ALD investigated include electrochemical ALD (E-ALD) and electroless ALD (EL-ALD).   Both involve the alternated exposure of a substrate to aqueous solutions containing ionic precursors.  In the case of E-ALD, electrochemistry is used to control deposition, while for EL-ALD the reactions are controlled chemically, with the precursors being surface limited in order to maintain layer by layer deposition.    Chemistry applicable to CP-ALD of a range of materials was investigated.  A series of reports have been published describing the growth of Ge nanofilms and the phase change memory materials based on GexSbyTez.  These have resulted in a wide range of stoichiometries for the phase change materials, as well as chemistry for the deposition of a monolayer of Ge, and a cycle, referred to as "Bait and Switch", which allows the E-ALD growth of Ge nanofilms with atomic control.  Nanofilms related to seed and barrier layers in ULSI have been studied.   These layers need to be a nm or two in thickness as the dimensions continue to decrease for transistors in microprocessors.  These studies involved how to grow Cu nanofilms and how to grow them on different materials, such as Ru and Ta.  In addition, studies of how to prevent Cu oxidation during transfer from tool to tool, on the FAB floor, were investigated using atomic layers of chalcogenides and halides.   A number of compound semiconductors such as the GexSbyTez, noted above, were formed using E-ALD.  Others include PV materials such as CdS, CdTe, CIGS and CIS. In addition, superlattices were formed using thermoelectric materials such as PbSe and PbTe.  Chemistries for the formation of fuel cell catalyst based on Pt were investigated.  That is, atomic layers of Pt, Ru, and Pd were deposited using E-ALD.   The modification of Pd films and powder surfaces were investigated for their influence on the kinetics for hydrogen absorption and desorption. Rh and Pt atomic layers have been shown to greatly accelerate the hydrogen uptake rates. The electroless ALD formation of Rh nanofilms on Pd were also investigated, using hydrogen as the reducing agent.  This shows promises, and a patent is being applied for.   All this work has been published in peer reviewed journals.   The PI and his students have also presented the work at National and International meetings.   Four graduate students have acknowledged NSF support in their dissertations.  Three summer undergraduates have been supported, in part, by this grant.  Two were women from low income families.  This work has been responsible for the formation of a small startup company, Electrochemical ALD L.C., which produces instruments with which to perform CP-ALD.   The broad impact of this work is the creation of a new way to form nanofilms of materials.  This is the condensed version of ALD.  Vacuum ALD has been very successful at the formation of nanofilms of oxides.  CP-ALD canÆt, as yet, form oxides, but it can form a wide range of compounds and the more noble metals.  These are materials where vacuum ALD has problems with its organometallic precoursors, indicating the comp...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
