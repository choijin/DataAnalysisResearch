<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: The University of Missouri Columbia proposes to provide a general model for understanding why women pursue STEM-related careers, despite various factors that render such pursuit difficult, drawing on models of intuitive judgment processes.  Beginning with the notion that such decisions often result not from a logical weighing of pros and cons but rather a more intuitive process that is driven primarily by the feeling of rightness, the proposed effort will seek to demonstrate the ways that the positive affect that accompanies success experiences engenders a feeling of rightness, especially for women who are prone to follow hunches. Four experiments will examine gender differences in responses to success at stereotypically masculine (or feminine) tasks. The dependent measures will include task persistence, evaluations of the meaningfulness of the feedback given, and attitudes toward STEM-relevant fields. These studies will test the prediction that individual differences in intuitive information processing interact with positive affect to predict responses to success in STEM-relevant tasks, especially for women. Women who are likely to persist at such tasks or pursue such careers are those who privilege the internal gut feelings that are engendered by success over the messages of a nay-saying context. A final study will examine retrospective accounts of high school experiences in first year college women and will seek to predict their preferences for majors and careers from the interaction of negative climate, intuition, success experiences and positive affect. A prospective follow-up will test these predictions over time. The proposed studies grow directly out of a research program focusing on individual differences in intuition, susceptibility to the cognitive effects of positive affect, the privileging of mental events, and the experience of meaning. These studies will contribute to basic knowledge of personality and the prediction of behavior and to our understanding of the influence of individual differences on the relationship between mood and cognitive processes. Further, this work will embed these processes in the larger social context and provide innovative information about the ways that individuals choose to go against the grain and pursue life goals that stand in contradiction to social expectations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The larger impacts of this work will be evident in four domains. First, educationally, a team of graduate and undergraduate researchers (many of whom are women) will be actively engaged in the research process and included in conference travel. Second, because personality psychology itself remains a male-dominated area, this program of research will provide an opportunity to foster young women scholars with interests in this domain. Third, the research will be submitted to journals in personality and social psychology as well as disseminated more broadly. Fourth, in terms of societal impact, these studies may have implications for a broad range of individuals who pursue apparently unlikely goals, including men who pursue gender-atypical careers and under-represented groups (minorities, economically disadvantaged individuals) who, despite external messages to the contrary, follow their gut feelings toward fulfilling careers.</AbstractNarration>

Yet this success does not translate into the pursuit of STEM careers.  This project examined this puzzle by focusing on how the perception of success may be more or less meaningful to women depending on their emotional responses and personality characteristics.  Specifically, drawing on models of intuitive judgment processes, this project tested the prediction that among women who experience success in STEM contexts, those who feel positive emotion, and who are likely to attend to that emotion, will be more likely to experience their success as meaningful and indicating that the STEM path is right for them.  We predicted that for women who reported themselves as more reliant on gut feelings in decision-making would be guided by affective responses to success in math tasks and that this would lead to greater persistence and interest in those tasks.  Simply put, this project examined the question, "What makes STEM-related fields feel right for those who pursue them?" A series of experiments and correlational studies examined this question.   This work identified 3 important conclusions.  First, for women and men both, trusting oneÆs hunches or gut feelings can facilitate performance and persistence in stereotype-atypical tasks.  Among women, for instance, those who reported themselves as low on trusting their intuition, interest in STEM depended on their performance and feedback.  For women who reported themselves as trusting their gut feelings, that interest remained independent of these factors. Among men, those who reported themselves as trusting their intuition performed better on a stereotypically feminine task.  Second, the experience of positive affect in conjunction with success may play a key role in sustaining effort in challenging academic contexts.  For instance, when solving math problems was difficult, women who were in a good mood were especially likely to persist on those problems.   Finally, in a large sample of college students, we found that it may be important to distinguish between engineering and other STEM fields.  Research on human motivation has shown that a particular constellation of values, namely valuing extrinsic rewards (e.g., money, prestige) over intrinsic rewards (e.g., gaining mastery, helping others), is associated with poorer psychological and physical functioning.  This constellation was uniquely related to engineering interests, in terms of majors and careers, and labeling oneself as an engineering major.  In contrast to other science majors, engineering majors and those interested in engineering were more likely to value extrinsic rewards over intrinsic rewards.  This motivational difference partially explained the gender difference in engineering interests.  These results suggest that the dearth of Americans in engineering may be rooted in perceptions of engineering as lacking in opportunities to facilitate intrinsic goals and to engage in activities that serve broader, shared human needs.  Interestingly, a sample of upper-level undergraduate and graduate students in engineering did not, in fact, differ from other science students in their values and intrinsic motivation.  These results suggest that the perception of engineering as primarily an extrinsic pursuit are, in fact, not realistic.  Young people are often encouraged to pursue engineering because of its likelihood of producing financial benefits. However such messages may understate or ignore the intrinsic benefits of science careers.              The results of these studies are being submitted to a number of academic journals and conferences and our hope is to share with...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
