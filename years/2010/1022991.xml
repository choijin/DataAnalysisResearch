<AbstractNarration>Observations suggest that melt pond number and sizes on sea ice are governed mainly by the ice topography at the beginning of the melt season, and that first year ice behaves much differently from multi-year ice. Funds are provided to test this hypothesis by applying a detailed sea ice model over a limited surface area (200 m x 200 m) and examining how ponds form given different sea ice properties. Results from these experiments will be compared to field data from the SHEBA experiment and more recent observations taken off the coast of Barrow Alaska. Their goal is to use these cases to improve sea ice parameterizations in the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate System Model (CCSM) and the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) CICE model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general objective of this study is to better understand and model the thermodynamic processes that control the evolution of sea ice. Specific objectives are to:&lt;br/&gt;1. Develop a thermodynamic sea ice model with directly resolved melt ponds, using observational data to initialize and test the model;&lt;br/&gt;2. Conduct model experiments to examine how the initial ice surface topography and snow cover affect the formation of melt ponds and the overall melting rate of the ice;&lt;br/&gt;3. Determine if the effects of pond size and distribution can be adequately parameterized in climate models using existing pond volume methods or if ice thickness distributions are required; and&lt;br/&gt;4. Quantify the effect of current and altered climate model parameterizations on the modeled Arctic climate and climate change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to improve our understanding of processes that cause sea ice to melt during the springtime in the Arctic Ocean.  When sea ice melts, the surface often floods as snow on the ice surface melts.  In low-lying areas where the water collects in ponds, the color of the ice changes from bright white to blue.  Because ponds are darker than the surrounding snow and ice surface, they absorb more sunlight and melt the ice more rapidly.  This extra melting makes the ponds deeper and can cause even stronger warming from the sun.  We call this extra melting a positive feedback since it accelerates the rate of melting.   Positive feedbacks in the Arctic have a key role in the warming of the earthÃ†s climate system.  Our study used the physics and thermodynamics of sea ice to understand how ponds change the melting rate of sea ice.  We kept track of the amount of sunlight absorbed by snow, ice, and ponds and used this heat to melt the ice for a 100 m x 200 m patch of the sea ice.   Our model assumed that the sea ice was the same thickness everywhere for the patch, but snow cover was variable with the snow thickness assigned based on measurements of snow from a location off the coast of Alaska near Barrow.  The snow thickness was estimated using a laser system that can measure topography.   A key part of our work was trying to simulate how melt ponds form during the summer melt.  Observations of melt ponds from the Barrow site indicate a three- stage growth pattern for ponds.  First, melting of snow floods the ice surface with fresh water.  Some of the fresh water seeps into the ice and refreezes because the ice temperature and ocean remain cold from winter.  In addition, salt in the ice lowers the freezing point much like salt in an old-fashioned ice cream machine.  Refreezing of the melt water creates an ice barrier that prevents the fresh water from draining into the ocean.  In the second stage of the melting process, ponds formed by flooding start to melt the ice because they are darker and absorb more sunlight.  Eventually, the ponds melt enough ice to form channels through the ice and the fresh water drains.  At the end of the drainage stage, the ponds have a level that is near sea level for the ice.  This is the third stage for ponds; they continue to melt the ice and deepen, but any new melt water quickly drains into the ocean.  We designed our sea ice model to simulate this process, using measurements of ice temperature and salinity to provide information on when fresh water ponds drain into the ocean.   Using our model, we found that overall snow depth and the minimum snow depth at the beginning of the melt are very important for the three-stage pond growth process.  For thin snow, more of the ice is covered during the flood stage, which can make it harder for any given pond to melt enough ice and become a permanent pond after drainage.  We also found that the initial ice thickness determines how much a pond has to deepen before reaching the ice sea level, affecting the area covered by ponds after drainage.  Our model is very good at predicting the observed pond behavior, but only after careful adjustments to the ice thickness and snow depth.   The model is very sensitive to these parameters; even minor changes in snow depth can cause large swings in the resulting pond coverage from no ponds to complete flooding.  In contrast, observed melt ponds show a more consistent year-to-year pattern with almost all years having pond coverage of 40-50 percent after drainage.   Model sensitivity may be a side effect of the limited area of the model.  Melt water on actual ice will often move horizontally until a crack or flaw in the ice allows drainage.  The limited area of the model prevents this drainage and can cause extensive flooding that would not happen on actual sea ice.    Future research will address this and other issues, such as the timing of drainage and the role of sea ice thickness variability.  Our ult...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
