<AbstractNarration>This EAGER proposal seeks to develop new, improved approaches, based on single- and multi-objective differential evolution, to the following important problems:&lt;br/&gt;(i) QoS-based multicast routing in mobile networks; (ii) Energy-efficient routing in hierarchical (two-tiered) wireless sensor networks; (iii) Stability-aware clustering in mobile ad hoc networks with special consideration of group mobility; and (iv) Cross-layer optimization in wireless sensor networks by joint routing and link scheduling in the presence of energy constraints, link interference and noise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to achieve higher energy saving, better network performance and extended network lifetimes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The novelty of this proposal is that it brings the power of differential evolution, a cutting-edge strategy in present-day computational intelligence research, to a group of outstanding, NP-hard problems in computer networks. It presents novel schemes for encoding of trial solutions and also for designing the differential operator for these problems. This research cuts across conventional subject lines ? it embodies an interdisciplinary and transformative application of ideas from electrical engineering, computer communications, computational intelligence, and statistical machine learning. This has the potential to open up a radically new direction in networking research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this research is far-reaching in this era of ubiquitous and pervasive computing. The efficiency, flexibility, and controllability provided in the proposed methods can be used to save costs and improve the quality of the final products in the industry. The proposal also includes well-thought out plans for integrating research and education. The PI will use this project to involve high-school students, women, and undergraduate/graduate students in computer science research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Computers and electronics are ubiquitous in today's society. Networks of computers and of electronic devices are playing increasingly important roles in our lives. Wireless mobile and sensor networks are a special type of network system. For the efficient running of such networks, good computational methods, or algorithms, are needed. This project seeks to solve some outstanding computational problems of practical importance in the field of wireless mobile and sensor networks.     Specifically, this project investigated the development of improved optimization heuristics, based on single and multi-objective differential evolution, to the following problems: (i) Quality-of-service-based multicast routing in mobile networks; (ii) Energy-efficient routing in hierarchical (two-tiered) wireless sensor networks; (iii) Stability-aware clustering in mobile ad hoc networks; (iv) Cross-layer optimization in wireless sensor networks by joint routing and link scheduling; (v) Fuel cell stack modeling for potential use in improving battery life in sensor networks.     Some of the new results obtained in this project have been reported in journal or conference proceedings publications; some more results will be published in future.       The project has contributed to the integration of research and education. Two graduate and two undergraduate students were involved in this project. One of these students is a co-author in some of the publications that came out of this project. The Principal Investigator incorporated some of this research into several graduate-level courses at his home institute.
