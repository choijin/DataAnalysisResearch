<AbstractNarration>The Metcalf Institute for Marine &amp; Environmental Reporting at the University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography is implementing a three-stage sequence of workshops that will bring together science journalists, communications professionals, informal science education professionals, and NSF-funded (RAPID) research scientists who are studying the Deepwater Horizon oil rig failure and its impact on the Gulf of Mexico. During this period of focused interest by the public, the three stages will allow for an iterative process of capacity-building by journalists and informal science educators that will result in a set of experiences and resources to improve the public understanding of the oil spill's impacts and the specific scientific techniques used to assess the impacts. The project's outcomes also include strengthening the communication skills of the research scientists via new media and talks tailored to journalists and informal science educators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three stages are: (1) Three sessions at the October 2010 conference of the Society of Environmental Journalists; (2) an April 2011 2.5-day seminar in Louisiana co-hosted by Louisiana State University and Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (including field experience on an LSU research vessel); and (3) a June 2011 week-long "science immersion workshop" (including laboratory and field experience on a URI research vessel) and five associated public lectures at the Metcalf Institute, including web cast live via Internet2.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three programs are being evaluated by faculty at the Public Policy Research Lab of LSU Manship School of Mass Communication.</AbstractNarration>

Seventy-five percent of the participants in the Metcalf Institute Seminar rated that they were either more confident (50 percent) or much more confident (25 percent) in their ability to explain scientific uncertainty. Additionally, 60 percent stated that they would change their approach toward explaining scientific uncertainty based on the information gained at the Seminar.
