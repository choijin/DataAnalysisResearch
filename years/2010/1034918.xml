<AbstractNarration>Scott D. Michaels &lt;br/&gt;IOS 1034918&lt;br/&gt;Regulation of flowering time by light quality&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proper timing of flowering is key to the reproductive success of plants.  Therefore it is not surprising that flowering time is highly regulated by both environmental and internal signals.  One environmental signal that can accelerate flowering is shade provided neighboring plants.  Plants detect shade as a shift in the ratio of red light to far-red light. Because leaves absorb more red light than far-red light, plants growing under a canopy experience light that is enriched in far-red light.  The overarching goal of this project is to determine, at the molecular level, how plants perceive and respond to far-red enriched light.  The project will employ genetic, physiological, and biochemical approaches to explore the impact of light quality on the genes and proteins that regulate flowering, identify novel components required for the acceleration of flowering by far-red-enriched light, and integrate plant hormones into the pathways that regulate flowering time in response to light quality. This project will also provide training and research experiences at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels. Because many flowering time pathways are highly conserved, it is expected that the knowledge gained in this study will be broadly applicable to higher plants. The molecular circuitry elucidated by this study will facilitate the study and manipulation of light responses in agricultural plants. For example, increasing plant density is a primary avenue to increasing crop yield. Because crowded plants shade one another, however, they experience far-red enriched light that can lead to yield-reducing precocious flowering. A better understanding of plant responses to light quality will allow for the manipulation of these traits, so that plants can be grown at higher density while minimizing undesirable consequences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The proper timing of flowering is key to the reproductive success of plants.  Therefore it is not surprising that flowering time is highly regulated by both environmental and internal signals.  One environmental signal that can accelerate flowering is shade provided neighboring plants.  Plants detect shade as a shift in the ratio of red light to far-red light. Because leaves absorb more red light than far-red light, plants growing under a canopy experience light that is enriched in far-red light (FREL).  The perception and response to light quality is an important factor in agriculture.  Planting at higher densities is a potential avenue to increased yield per acre, however, as plants begin to shade each other, they experience FREL.  In wild type, this leads to undesirable effects, such as increased elongation and decreased seed set.  Understanding the pathways that control the response to FREL will provide opportunities to modulate plants responses to increase yield at high planting density.  Our work under this award has established that the promotion of flowering by FREL is caused by a novel early morning peak in expression of the floral promoter FT.  We have discovered that several signaling pathways contribute to the timing and duration of this peak.  In this way, our work provides a molecular framework for understanding the effect of light quality on flowering time. This will provide an avenue to increased food production, which will become increasingly important as the worldÃ†s population, and standard of living, continue to increase. For example, manipulation of these pathways is likely to assist in the development of crops that can be grown at higher density with out a loss in yield.  In addition to the intellectual merits of this project, it also has broader impacts.  This project has provided training and professional development for 2 postdocs, 1 graduate student, 1 technician, and 5 undergraduates.  This work has also been presented in invited seminars and meeting presentations at elementary schools, as well as US and international Universities.
