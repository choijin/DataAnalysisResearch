<AbstractNarration>Intramolecular reactions represent one of the most important venues in organic synthesis, given their ability to expeditiously bring forth a great deal of structural complexity in a highly regio- and stereoselective manner. With support of this award from the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Division of Chemistry at the National Science Foundation, Professor Richard Hsung's research group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison intends to develop asymmetric intramolecular cationic [2 + 2] cycloadditions using chiral Fe(III) catalysts or chiral Brønsted acids, and to design temporary tethered systems for achieving an equivalent of highly regio- and stereoselective intermolecular cycloaddition. An ultimate goal is to feature the cationic [2 + 2] cycloaddition in a total synthesis of natural product, (-)-bielschowskysin, that possesses anti-cancer and anti-malarial activities.  Achieving a cationic [2 + 2] cycloaddition will lead to a bio-inspired strategy for synthesizing cyclobutanes, and will allow Professor Hsung's program to significantly impact an area of cycloaddition chemistry that is under-explored and contribute to the field of asymmetric catalysis in areas of chiral Fe(III) reagents as well as Brønsted acids.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Designing and developing new methods that can serve as approaches for rapid assembly of complex structures and efficient strategies for constructing natural occurring substances that possess important biological activities remain as one of important quests in modern organic chemistry.  With support of this NSF award, Professor Hsung intends to build a research program based on this premise while focusing on a [2 + 2] cycloaddition manifold en route to cyclobutanes, a four-membered all-carbon containing ring that represents a prevalent motif among medicinally useful entities. In addition, all projects proposed here concern various aspects of basic organic chemistry.  Thus, they provide a unique opportunity for teaching undergraduate students to develop useful synthetic methodologies based on fundamental concepts, structural designs, and proposed mechanistic models. By accomplishing these objectives, Professor Hsung's research efforts will continue to broaden the impact of synthetic organic chemistry on training and education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[NSF PROJECT OUTCOME REPORT &ndash; For The General Public  Title: Developing an Intramolecular Cationic [2 + 2] Cycloaddition P.I.: Richard P. Hsung  Cycloaddition reactions [m + n&hellip;.] are a highly efficient process that allows chemists to rapidly assemble complex rings with various sizes through multiple chemical bond formation from two or more functional entities (m and n&hellip;.).  In the past century, they have become arguably the most powerful transformation in constructing biologically and medicinally relevant substances that are of natural (termed as natural products) and unnatural origins. Among them, four-membered ring cyclobutane represents a prevalent structural motif among natural products and drug candidates. Consequently, [2 + 2] cycloaddition reactions have been at the center of methodological development with an elegant array of efforts already having resulted.  However, despite its current prominence, focus has mostly been on photochemically driven protocols.  Non-photochemical [2 + 2] cycloadditions, and in particular, the cationic pathway, have seriously lagged behind even with the manifestation of cationic [2 + 2] cycloadditions as a biosynthetic pathway that produces naturally occurring cyclobutanes. Non-photochemical reactions possess a number of significant advantages over their photochemical counterparts such as scale of reactions, ease of operations, tolerance of functional group diversities, and control of competing pathways.  Therefore, developing a successful cationic [2 + 2] cycloaddition is of immense significance to organic and medicinal chemistry as well as drug discovery. Our laboratory has developed a novel cationic [2 + 2] cycloaddition that can be promoted by a catalytic amount of acid (either Lewis or Br&oslash;nsted acid), or even better, a catalytic amount of iron salt (FeCl3 or FeBr3), which are environmentally friendly and nontoxic. To reveal the power of this cationic [2 + 2] cycloaddition, we have concisely applied this new non-photochemical cycloaddition to a facile construction of a natural product called raikovenal starting from very simple materials. Moreover, although with moderate success, we were able to establish in principle that it can be rendered asymmetric to make optically active cyclobutanes.  Developing asymmetric transformation is a critical pursuit in synthesis because most natural products exist optically either in left- or right-handed sense. During this endeavor, we also uncovered a new cyclization process that is currently part of our ongoing investigations, thereby further demonstrating the power of serendipitous discovery. Most satisfyingly, we completed an important objective in developing a temporarily tethered cationic [2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction. Temporarily tethered transformations allow one to pursue bond formation in a pseudo-intermolecular manner (between two or more functional entities that are part of two or more molecules), and to achieve a superior level of regio-, chemo- and stereochemical control for which an intramolecular transformation (between two or more functional entities that are all within the same molecule) would offer. Finding a suitable temporary tether in this context turned out to be unusually challenging, but we succeeded and were able to rapidly assemble highly functionalized cyclobutane building blocks that will be amenable for synthesizing related natural products. Most importantly, while efforts toward the originally proposed complex natural product (-)-bielschowskysin had been slow, we successfully constructed an impressive array of cyclobutane-containing natural products through developing a new formidable cascade that features an oxa-[3 + 3] formal cycloaddition along with the cationic [2 + 2] cycloaddition. These completed natural products are clusiacyclol A and B, iso-eriobrucinol A and B, eriobricinol, and canabicylcol. Our success firmly supports that naturally occurring cyclobutanes can indeed be biosyntheticall...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
