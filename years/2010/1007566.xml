<AbstractNarration>Construction of the international Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array&lt;br/&gt;(ALMA) is underway, with early science operations currently planned to begin in&lt;br/&gt;Q3 2011 and full science operations planned for Q4 2012. ALMA is among the largest advances in observational capabilities in ground-based astronomy ever made, larger than the step from 4m-class optical telescopes with photomultipliers and photographic plates to 10m-class telescopes with CCDs, in terms of combined improvements in sensitivity, frequency coverage, resolution, imaging, and spectral capabilities. ALMA will address many of the paramount astrophysical questions of our day, from the earliest epochs of galaxy formation, through the detailed formation of stars and planets in our Galaxy. Such a transformational facility will attract a large&lt;br/&gt;majority of the astronomical community to use ALMA.  To support this very broad user community in fully realizing the dramatic advance in scientific capabilities afforded by ALMA, a cost-effective operations model and plan that is fully consistent with the global ALMA Operations Plan (AOP) has been developed.  The AOP has been vetted extensively by an international working group over several years and is approved by the ALMA Board, the international oversight body for the ALMA.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ALMA operations consists of (i) the facility operations in Chile carried out by the Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO) in cooperation with local support provided by the Awardee and the other international partners, (ii) the support of the basic core functions of ALMA in each region of the ALMA partners by the respective ALMA Regional Center (ARC), and (iii) the full science support of the user communities to realize the scientific promise of ALMA.  The North American ALMA Science Center (NAASC), located at the NRAO Headquarters in Charlottesville, VA, will provide the support to the ALMA user community in North America.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CSA is a transfer of award AST-0705244 (SPO-8) under Cooperative Agreement 0223851 into the new Cooperative Agreement for AUI/NRAO (0836064). &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The array consists of 66 high precision antennas.&nbsp; The array is designed to cover the atmospheric windows from 31 GHz to 1 THz. &nbsp;&nbsp;ALMA is an international partnership of the National Science Foundation (NSF), the European Southern Observatory (ESO), the National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) of Japan, together with NRC (Canada), NSC and ASIAA (Taiwan), and KASI (Republic of Korea), in cooperation with the Republic of Chile.</p> <p><strong>AWARD OUTCOME</strong></p> <p>This award enabled the US share of ALMA operations from the beginning of ALMA Early Science observations to the start of Observing Cycle 4, for which the array is approaching steady state operations.&nbsp; The period included the ALMA Inauguration, the formal end of ALMA Construction, and the end of construction commissioning.&nbsp; By the conclusion of the award, the full array of 66 antennas (Figure 1) was in routine use and the array was nearing full scientific capability.&nbsp; Nearly 500 refereed publications with 5000 citations have now appeared in scientific journals.&nbsp; ALMA has already changed our scientific view of several areas of astronomy, particularly for the formation of protoplanets and protoplanetary disks, and stunning images such as the now-famous HL Tau have been produced (Figure 2).</p> <p>The award provided the US share of Chile Operations at the Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO), and supported US ALMA operations, via the National Radio Astronomy Observatory.&nbsp; Over the course of the award, the JAO has executed four (4) observing cycles.&nbsp; Over the course of the award, the amount of observing time available to the community increased from ~900 hours in Cycle 0 to ~3000 hours in Cycle 4, which began on the ending day of this Award.&nbsp; The JAO, with assistance from the partner regions, commissioned use of nearly all the originally-planned capabilities for ALMA.&nbsp; The award supported day-to-day running costs of the Observatory &ndash; operations and maintenance at the mid-level Operations Support Facility (OSF), the Array Operations Site (AOS) high site, and at the Santiago Central Office (SCO) headquarters.</p> <p>The award provided funds at National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) for the support of the US community in their scientific use of ALMA.&nbsp; At the NRAO North American ALMA Science Center (NAASC), staff provided reduced data in the form of &ldquo;reference images&rdquo; to facilitate the analysis of results by North American principle investigators.&nbsp; These images were stored in a data archive, and became publically accessible, together with the original raw data sets, after a one-year proprietary period.</p> <p>The NAASC staff also engaged the astronomical community to encourage the best, and broadest possible use of ALMA in the US.&nbsp; Over the course of the award, the staff held 5-10 Community Day events each year at universities and institutes distributed across the country.&nbsp; These were one to two-day training events, aimed at novice users, held most often in the weeks just prior to a proposal deadline.&nbsp; In addition, a topical science conference was hosted each year.&nbsp; In the last year of the award (2016), the NAASC hosted the international conference &ldquo;A Half Decade of ALMA &ndash; Cosmic Dawns Transformed,&rdquo; (Figure 3).</p> <p>The award also provided offsite scientific and technical effort at NRAO in support of ALMA Operations in Chile.&nbsp; This included scientific expertise through the North American ARC, and included Astronomer on Duty support, data diagnostics and visiting commissioning support in Chile, documentation, and software testing.&nbsp; The award funded technical support for the maintenance of construction deliverables in hardware and software, as well as development funds for new instruments and software.</p> <p>The scientific progress of ALMA made possible by the award are exemplified by the following &ldquo;before and after&rdquo;

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ INTRODUCTION  The NSF Award "The Operations and Maintenance of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA)," provided the US partner share of funding for ALMA operations and maintenance over the period of 2011-2016.  ALMA is a millimeter / submillimeter interferometric imaging array of revolutionary design located on the Chajnantor plateau in northern Chile at an elevation of 5000 meters.  The array consists of 66 high precision antennas.  The array is designed to cover the atmospheric windows from 31 GHz to 1 THz.   ALMA is an international partnership of the National Science Foundation (NSF), the European Southern Observatory (ESO), the National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS) of Japan, together with NRC (Canada), NSC and ASIAA (Taiwan), and KASI (Republic of Korea), in cooperation with the Republic of Chile.  AWARD OUTCOME  This award enabled the US share of ALMA operations from the beginning of ALMA Early Science observations to the start of Observing Cycle 4, for which the array is approaching steady state operations.  The period included the ALMA Inauguration, the formal end of ALMA Construction, and the end of construction commissioning.  By the conclusion of the award, the full array of 66 antennas (Figure 1) was in routine use and the array was nearing full scientific capability.  Nearly 500 refereed publications with 5000 citations have now appeared in scientific journals.  ALMA has already changed our scientific view of several areas of astronomy, particularly for the formation of protoplanets and protoplanetary disks, and stunning images such as the now-famous HL Tau have been produced (Figure 2).  The award provided the US share of Chile Operations at the Joint ALMA Observatory (JAO), and supported US ALMA operations, via the National Radio Astronomy Observatory.  Over the course of the award, the JAO has executed four (4) observing cycles.  Over the course of the award, the amount of observing time available to the community increased from ~900 hours in Cycle 0 to ~3000 hours in Cycle 4, which began on the ending day of this Award.

The award supported day-to-day running costs of the Observatory &ndash; operations and maintenance at the mid-level Operations Support Facility (OSF), the Array Operations Site (AOS) high site, and at the Santiago Central Office (SCO) headquarters.  The award provided funds at National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) for the support of the US community in their scientific use of ALMA.  At the NRAO North American ALMA Science Center (NAASC), staff provided reduced data in the form of "reference images" to facilitate the analysis of results by North American principle investigators.  These images were stored in a data archive, and became publically accessible, together with the original raw data sets, after a one-year proprietary period.  The NAASC staff also engaged the astronomical community to encourage the best, and broadest possible use of ALMA in the US.  Over the course of the award, the staff held 5-10 Community Day events each year at universities and institutes distributed across the country.  These were one to two-day training events, aimed at novice users, held most often in the weeks just prior to a proposal deadline.  In addition, a topical science conference was hosted each year.  In the last year of the award (2016), the NAASC hosted the international conference "A Half Decade of ALMA &ndash; Cosmic Dawns Transformed," (Figure 3).  The award also provided offsite scientific and technical effort at NRAO in support of ALMA Operations in Chile.  This included scientific expertise through the North American ARC, and included Astronomer on Duty support, data diagnostics and visiting commissioning support in Chile, documentation, and software testing.  The award funded technical support for the maintenance of construction deliverables in hardware and software, as well as development funds for new instruments and software.  The scientific progress of ALMA made possible by the award are exemplified by the following "before and after" images of protoplanetary disks (Figures 4 and 5).
