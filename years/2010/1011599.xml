<AbstractNarration>A central goal of evolutionary biology is to understand how and when biodiversity develops in the novel environments that are created by changing geology and climate. For example, the island of Taiwan emerged from the sea approximately five million years ago and, through colonization from various places, now contains thousands of unique plants and animals. This study will apply new analytical techniques to molecular genetic data to reconstruct the colonization histories of 24 bird species that are unique to Taiwan. The project will reveal how and when the bird fauna of an isolated island was assembled over evolutionary time and improve understanding of the historical development of the bird diversity seen today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance understanding of the evolution of an isolated biota. It also will form the basis for an informal education program aimed at communicating the science of evolutionary biology to the bird-watching general public. The project also fosters new scientific and educational opportunities between students and researchers in Taiwan, Mainland China, and the USA.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In general, two populations that exchange genes evolve together. When they stop exchanging genes, the two populations begin to go their separate ways. When this happens, we say that the populations are diverging. Diverging populations are important because this is how new species are created.

Although I still need to add more species before making rigorous conclusions, it appears the mountains contribute substantially to divergence among populations. This research is a small step forward in helping us understand how biological diversity is formed.   I am committed to disseminating the results of my research to the public. I have made a public presentation at a Bell Museum of Natural History aimed at an audience of non-scientists. I have also given tours of the Bell Museum of Natural History research collections to participants of the Minnesota Master Naturalists Program. The Minnesota Master Naturalists Program is designed to 'promote awareness, understanding, and stewardship of Minnesota's  natural environment by developing a corps of well-informed citizens dedicated to conservation education and service within their communities.' I integrated results of this research project into my tours to demonstrate the value of collections in modern systematic research and as an example of the kind of research that goes on in modern evolutionary biology.    I am also developing a presentation designed for amateur bird-watching groups that will use this research to relate the science of systematics to non-scientists. The popularity of amateur bird-watching groups makes them excellent opportunities for relating the science of evolutionary biology to the public. I expect to begin giving this presentation by the beginning of 2012.       Last Modified: 08/22/2011       Submitted by: Bailey D Mckay]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
