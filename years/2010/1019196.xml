<AbstractNarration>Although a considerable body of research has illuminated many aspects of school bullying, the problem persists and continues to garner much public and scholarly attention. Robust research findings can inform educators and lead to the development of effective prevention and intervention programs. A relative newcomer to the bullying arsenal is cyberbullying, the use of technology to harm or harass others.  This form of bullying has proliferated quite rapidly, but the sparse research to date has been limited to considering prevalence rates, gender differences, and the relation of cyberbullying to traditional bullying. Although there are many similarities between the two forms of bullying, the distinctive features of cyberbullying may lead to unique consequences of victimization. Furthermore, the unique predictors of cyberbullying have not yet been identified. At this point, there is a need to understand early influences that serve as risk or protective factors for later involvement in cyberbullying. In this research project, Drs. Bauman and Card will investigate early influences suggested by modern social cognitive theory, which situates human behavior within a dynamic process of reciprocal interaction of the person, the environment, and the behavior. From this perspective, bullying and cyberbullying can be viewed as attempts by some individuals to control their environments to increase their social status. Other components of this theory describe how children learn behavior (including by vicarious observation), how cognitive processes such as attributional biases, moral disengagement, and contextual factors influence behaviors. This study will investigate the intrapersonal and environmental factors that predict cyberbullying involvement.  It will also illuminate the trajectory of cyberbullying involvement from middle childhood to middle adolescence, when such behaviors tend to peak. By studying children, parents, and teachers over a three-year period, the investigators will be able to trace changes over time in the individual, the environment, and the behaviors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop an understanding of how cyberbullying involvement emerges and how family and school environments affect the development of this behavior. It will illuminate how children's developing social cognitions interact with other factors to increase or decrease their vulnerability to cyberbullying involvement. This work is critical to developing a comprehensive and multi-dimensional understanding of this new and potentially damaging phenomenon. The findings from this investigation will provide a sound empirical basis for the development of effective prevention and intervention programs to reduce the prevalence and harmful consequences of cyberbullying.</AbstractNarration>

Youth who agreed with more statements to justify cyberbullying also reported  higher levels of   of  traditional bullying. Cyberbullying involvement predicted increased  traditional victimization and bullying, but was not associated with  child or parent reports of parental monitoring.  The following factors were predictors of cyberbullying at the same time point:: having a Webkinz account (negative  predictor), giving a friend your password, time spent on Facebook and  the number of Facebook friends, being a cybervictim, moral  disengagement (endorsing statements justifying cyberbullying), being a traditional bully, being a traditional victim,  and child's view of parental monitoring, with the strongest predictor =  being a cybervictim.Predictors of  cybervictimization were the child having a cell phone, being a  cyberbullying (lstrongest predictor), being a traditional victim, being a  traditional bully (negative predictor) and moral disengagement (thoughts justifying cyberbullying, which was a negative  predictor.)

Webkinz, a children's  game/networking site, was a negative predictor of cyberbullying at both  time points, but a positive predictor of cybervictimization at T2.  Cybervictimization  at T2 was predicted by cyberbullying at T1 and T2, and being a  cybervictim at T1, being a traditional victim at T2 and engaging in  self-blame at T2. Predictors of T3 cybervictimization were cyberbullying  at T3, cybervictimization at T2, being a traditional victim at T3, and  exhibiting internalizing symtpoms at T3.
