<AbstractNarration>The project designs and implements technologies that combine artificial intelligence in the form of intelligent tutoring systems with multimedia interfaces to support children in grades 4-5 learning science. The students use LEONARDO's intelligent virtual science notebooks to create and experiment with interactive models of physical phenomena. With this technology, students' models 'come alive' as interactive multimedia artifacts that combine animation, sound, and narration. The curricular focus is on physical and earth sciences, and the technology supports multimodal interactive scientific modeling for four curricular units: forces and motion, magnetism and electricity, landforms, and weather and climate.  A central feature of this environment is PadMates, which are intelligent virtual tutors that support science learning through interactive scientific modeling.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs investigate the cognitive mechanisms by which learning occurs.  Specifically, they study the central issues of problem solving (strategy use, divergent thinking, and collaboration) and engagement (motivation, situational interest, presence) with respect to achievement as measured by both science content knowledge and transfer. With diverse student populations in 60 classrooms drawn from both urban and rural settings, the studies determine precisely which technologies and conditions contribute most effectively to learning processes and outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The products include technologies and findings that should be the basis of a framework to inform the future development of similar systems. The impact should be substantial on all learners given the potential power of the technology to scaffold learning at an important developmental stage.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Recent years have seen a growing recognition of the transformative potential of cyberlearning technologies for science education. By providing ubiquitous access to learning content, supporting collaboration in virtual environments, and offering interactive simulations in virtual laboratories, cyberlearning environments can deliver learning experiences that are qualitatively different from what has ever been available before. The objective of the Leonardo project was to develop and evaluate an intelligent cyberlearning system for interactive scientific modeling in elementary physical science education. Students in Grades 4 and 5 used LeonardoÆs intelligent virtual science notebooks to engage with interactive models of physical phenomena focusing on electricity, magnetism, and air, water, and weather. Through these activities, students had the opportunity to investigate, reflect, and develop their science conceptual knowledge around core STEM ideas.     Intellectual Merit: Leonardo has consistently improved studentÆs understandings of science phenomena. Investigations to date have focused on qualitative and quantitative data analysis of classroom instruction, student use of the cyberlearning environment, and student learning outcomes. Using these techniques, research findings have taken steps towards 1) understanding how technology-rich learning environments like Leonardo can be integrated into elementary science classrooms, 2) investigating how students interact with LeonardoÆs intelligent virtual tutor and interactive science notebook to engage in meaning-making through writing and drawing to learn physical science, and 3) using innovative computer science machine learning techniques to create new models to assess student competency.   Data from the classroom studies have consistently shown that our curriculum development strategies resulted in efficacious learning interactions that produce significant student learning in the content area and usable, useful content aligned to state and national science education standards. Learning gains were seen in a majority of classrooms that represent a geographically and demographically diverse set of students. Analysis of student work were informed with computational intelligence approaches and by the employment of the evidence-centered design framework. The project successfully leveraged machine learning techniques to assess student understandings with prototype multimodal assessment framework developed using student drawing and writing responses. Results suggest that the level of conceptual understanding in student writings and drawings are complementary, and that there is additive value in student learning activity and assessment across multiple modalities.   The project has also successfully implemented a remote professional development (PD) strategy through video and online resources that provided meaningful, yet scalable, support for teachers implementing the units. This deployment strategy exemplifies how mobile-based platforms for elementary science learning can be deployed and supported in a scalable fashion and be used to inform the design of asynchronous PD resources in the form of an online learning environment.       Broader Impacts: More than 3000 fourth and fifth grade students in 35 geographically and demographically diverse schools across 8 states have experienced the highly interactive science investigation scenarios provided by the Leonardo system. A total of 72 teachers completed professional development activities and have used the Leonardo environment in their classrooms. In addition, online resources for professional development are freely available to the public. These resources provide step-by-step instructions to guide teachers in deploying the software, video testimonials from teachers who have used the Leonardo software, and mappings between the Leonardo curricular content and the Next Generation Science Standards.    The projectÆs results have been widely...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
