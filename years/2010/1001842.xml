<AbstractNarration>In the past few years there has been a growing number of connections between enumerative algebraic geometry, in particularly Gromov-Witten theory, and the algebraic combinatorics, in particular Young tableaux identities.  The proposer intend to pursue the study of combinatorial bijections related to these identities. In particular, he intends to investigate multi-weighted analogues of certain classical combinatorial identities which also arise naturally from the representation theory of the symmetric group. He also intends to pursue both enumerative, algebraic and probabilistic applications of the discrete random processes for generation of weighted Young tableaux.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young tableaux are basic combinatorial structure which were introduced over a hundred years  ago in connection with studies of a large class of spaces with symmetries. Over the years, Young tableaux have been further studied in connection with other fields of studies, such as statistical physics, discrete probability, and more recently, algebraic geometry and field theory.  The reviewer intends to pursue the combinatorial aspects of the latter connections, with the intension of developing new tools, which in turn will lead to new results in both fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Several interesting results on the complexity of Young tableau algorithms have been obtained and at various stages of submission and/or publication in peer review journals.  These results shed some new light on the nature of Young tableau bijections.    Specifically, we studied both the weighted hook walk and its connections to enumerative algebraic geometry (joint with Ciocan-Fontanine and Konvalinka) and published two papers on the subject: one in the Journal of Algebra and one in the Journal of Combinatorical Theory Ser. A.  These papers were later extended and generalized by my coauthor and former Ph.D. student Matjaz Konvalinka to other types of Young tableaux and weighted hook walks, such as shifted tableaux and complementatry walks.    In a different direction, we studied connection between these bijections and Kronecker coefficients which represent integers playing significant role in the modern algebra and latest difficult but promising approach to the Milleanium P not equal to NP problem in Computational Complexity.  In a joint effort with my former postdoc Greta Panova and colleague from UNAM Morelia Ernesto Vallejo we published several papers studying both these connections and apllication to classical enumerative Combinatorics.  Perhaps most surprizingly, we showed that one can use this connection in reverse and obtain unimodality of q-binomial coefficients from the basic positivity of Kronecker coefficients.  This reproved and extended classical results by Cayley and Sylvester.        Last Modified: 09/16/2015       Submitted by: Igor Pak]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
