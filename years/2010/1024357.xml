<AbstractNarration>This award funds three different projects involving market experiments.  All three projects address the behavioral relevance of standard assumptions underlying models used in formulating economic policy.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first project generalizes the conventional price setting oligopoly game by considering the effects of having sellers make production decisions in advance rather than to demand, and also by giving products some limited durability.  The second project considers an important issue in the micro-foundations of macroeconomics:  price and information frictions as a source of real effects caused by nominal disturbances.  The third project is an application involving the regulation of financial markets.  When regulators? corrective actions affect a firm?s fundamental value, the very possibility of corrective action may undermine the informative value of security prices.  The experiment evaluates the importance of this interaction between security prices and regulator?s decisions, and it evaluates the corrective power of some potential remedies such as prediction markets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  Each of these experiments sheds light on a context where the predictions of a model conventionally used as a basis for policy actions depends importantly on underlying assumptions that are difficult to evaluate in natural contexts.  Decision making experiments are a useful way to can insight into the behavioral consequences of deviations from these conventional assumptions. In addition, the research team is building new collaborations between an open access urban public university and the Federal Reserve system.  Undergraduate research assistants will get a broad exposure to how research informs policy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported market experiments in three distinct areas.  A first area regards the effects of altering product durability and production conditions on the exercise of market power in standard posted offer (e.g., retail-type) markets.  Experimental results indicate that these routinely overlooked features of retail type markets may importantly affect market performance.   A second area uses experimental methods to examine an important issue in macroeconomics regarding the relative capacity of price and informational frictions to explain real responses to nominal shocks. Here experimental results indicate that while æsticky pricesÆ and æsticky informationÆ both explain lags in the adjustment of markets to a nominal shock, a third factor &ndash;bounded rationality plays a much more powerful role.  The third area pertains to banking regulation.  Our experiment in this area investigates a series of three price-based mechanisms for triggering the conversion a new class of subordinated debt called 'contingent capital' into equity. This new hybrid bond is intended to improve the stability of systemically important banks. Experimental results in this last area indicate that the concerns of theorists regarding fixed and regulator based triggers merit serious attention.  Under both mechanisms trading inefficiencies and high rates of conversion errors were observed for some ranges of market fundamentals.  Further, and contary to theoretical predictions, we find that while the addition of a 'prediction market' to the regulator regime reduces to some extent the incidence of conversion errors, it does not come close to eliminating the informational inefficiencies generated by using a regulator based triggering mechanism.
