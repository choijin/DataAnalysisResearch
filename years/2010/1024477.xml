<AbstractNarration>This workshop will bring together two emerging communities of scholars who share an interest in the study of scientific expertise, but who speak different disciplinary languages. These communities are represented by two young organizations, the International Society for the Psychology of Science and Technology (ISPST) and Studies in Experience and Expertise (SEE). SEE scholars have identified a new category of expertise they refer to as ?interactional? because it is the ability to speak the language of  a  discipline without being able to do the research.  For example, a leading SEE scholar become an interactional expert in gravitational wave physics.  ISPST scholars have a long tradition of studying scientific and technological expertise using methods and perspectives that are not familiar to SEE scholars.  &lt;br/&gt;This workshop will facilitate development of a new, interdisciplinary framework for: a) empirically investigating how people learn to become interactional experts; b) analyzing how to accelerate the development of interactional expertise; c) identifying the various forms of tacit knowledge and implicit learning processes that interactional experts need to master; and d) identifying interactional experts in both contemporary and historical contexts; as well as developing existing ?imitation game? experiments and considering new methods for empirically testing to what extent an individual has attained interactional expertise. One expected end result will be the discovery of new categories of expertise.  Findings from this workshop will be relevant to the management of  large, interdisciplinary scientific collaborations, especially ones in which social scientists, ethicists and policy makers need to be involved. &lt;br/&gt;The workshop organizers are  committed to supporting the attendance and involvement of graduate students working in this area, including groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM disciplines. Initial dissemination mechanisms will include  the SEE and ISPST  web-sites and papers in a special issue of Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of the 2-day workshop was to develop a "trading zone" of ideas and research methods on the nature of expertise. In particular, the workshop brought together scholars from two distinct organizations, Studies of Experience and Expertise (SEE) and the International Society for the Psychology of Science and Technology (ISPST) to discuss, debate, and advance our understanding of who is an expert, what is expertise, and how expertise develops. By bringing together psychologists, philosophers and sociologists who are otherwise unlikely to interact and collaborate, the goal was to produce a deeper understanding of the social, linguistic, phenomenological, and psychological dimensions of tacit knowledge and expertise. Most importantly, workshop participants developed theoretical models and outlined empirical methodologies for understanding how expertise is acquired, learned, and taught.     The workshop focused on Harry CollinsÆ idea of interactional expertise. An interactional expert is someone who develops specialized knowledge and becomes conversant in a domain such that he or she can fool actual (contributory) experts into believing he or she is an expert in that domain (the so-called "imitation game").  But interactional expertise goes beyond just fooling people. It is commonly developed in scientific laboratories, businesses, and universities where people have to converse and exchange ideas with others outside their own area of expertise.     As is to be expected any time scholars from very different perspectives attempt to collaborate on a common topic, there were both disagreements and advances in understanding. For example, one area of disagreement was over whom to label "expert." Collins argued that people with everyday common skills, such as speakers of a language, can be called expert. He coined the term "ubiquitous expert" for such individuals. Most psychologists and philosophers disagreed, arguing that that is stretching the term "expert" too thinly.     But in discussing the nature of whom to label expert, advances in understanding were made. For example, CollinsÆ expanded and elaborated his conceptual model of expertise, namely his three-dimensional "expertise-space diagram." CollinsÆ model adds two dimensions to the usual dimension of individual or group accomplishment. The two new dimensions are degree of exposure to tacit knowledge and "esotercity" (how common or esoteric the knowledge is). A three dimensional model allows for a broader conceptualization of expertise. The psychologist, Gregory Feist added yet a fourth dimension to the model, namely degree of natural talent.
