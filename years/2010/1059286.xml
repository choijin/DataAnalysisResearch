<AbstractNarration>At a time when the U.S. economy is facing enormous challenges, creating jobs that will develop significant technological and scientific innovation and create new opportunities for business growth is of the utmost importance for future economic recovery. Given the challenges that the country faces today, there is an urgent need to transform the economy through advances in science and technology and through the job creation that accompanies them. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Critical to this recovery effort is the nurturing of emerging high-quality, innovative research-performing small businesses. Such start-up companies have been major contributors to job creation in past recessionary periods, and those companies tend to remain robust in even the most severe economic downturns. These nimble corporate ventures, relying on cutting-edge technology, represent an unparalleled opportunity to invest in America?s invention, innovation and economic growth today, tomorrow, and for years to come.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;With that in mind, the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) has established  the Small Business Postdoctoral Research Diversity Program that will place 50 recent Ph.D. recipients with a goal of at least one third being from the underrepresented groups defined as women, persons with disabilities, African Americans, Hispanics, American Indians, Alaska Natives and Pacific Islanders in active Phase II Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) participating companies, as identified by the National Science Foundation. Those are the only companies that will be eligible for this program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ASEE/NSF Small Business Postdoctoral Research Diversity Fellowship Program will encourage creative and highly trained recipients of doctoral degrees in disciplines funded by the NSF, to engage in hands-on research projects in their areas of expertise at the kind of small innovative businesses that historically have fueled the nation?s economic engine. This fellowship program would offer those small, competitive companies the opportunity to attract top scientific and technological talent at a fraction of the usual cost. At the same time, it will recruit postdoctoral fellows from the underrepresented groups to work for at least a year outside an academic setting, contributing to cutting-edge research aimed at promoting scientific excellence and strengthening our nation?s technological prowess.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ASEE/NSF Small Business Postdoctoral Research Diversity Fellowship (SBPRDF) (Award #1059286) program matches recent Ph.D. degree recipients in NSF supported disciplines with eligible NSF Phase II SBIR awardee companies.  Fellows received a $75,000 stipend ($65,000 from NSF and $10,000 from the host company), plus travel and relocation assistance, and individual health insurance premiums from NSF.  Fellowship appointments ranged from 1 &ndash; 2 years.  Since its the first cohort in 2011, more than 1000 Ph.Ds and 650 Phase II companies have posted their profiles on the SBPRDF program website.  Seventy-nine (79) postdoctoral fellows were matched with 77 host companies over the six year period of this program.  Called "a crucial pathway" to provide commercial insights to post-doctoral researchers needed in startup environment, the SBPRDF has proven to be a win-win for all stakeholders.   SBPRDF program fellows advanced knowledge and contributed to new technology each of the NSF areas of research including, biotech and chemical technology, information and communication technologies, nanotechnology, advanced materials, manufacturing, and education applications.  A survey of SBPRDF program fellows revealed that two out of three fellows published at least one technical paper during their postdoctoral appointment, and one out of three fellows filed at least one patent.  SBPRDF postdocs in the survey reported that they gained experience and training in grant writing, project management, entrepreneurship, and mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students.  At a rate higher than expected from start-ups in the SBIR program, according to this survey, more than 43% of postdoctoral fellows were offered employment by their host company at the end of their appointment.    Postdocs who were not hired by their host companies, or who chose another option, found exceptional positions in industry and academia and retained relationships with their host company.  For example, one postdoc declined an offer to join her host company in order to take a tenure track position a local university.  Her former host company is now a major sponsor and collaborator for her research.  This is consistent with our survey in which seventy percent of respondents wanted to collaborate with their host company after the end of their fellowship.  An overwhelming majority of the respondents (84%) believed that the fellowship experience enhanced their professional qualifications and skills in ways that an academic post-doctoral opportunity could likely not.  The emphasis on broadening participation in small business research was demonstrated through strategic outreach to key affinity groups and professional societies.  As a result of this effort, the number of program participants from under-represented groups steadily increased to more than 40% by the end of the grant.   The SBPRDF program continues in FY16 in Award #1552305 with a new cohort.  Under the award, the $10,000 cost sharing requirement from host companies was eliminated and ASEE hired new staff to expand the reach of this impactful program.
