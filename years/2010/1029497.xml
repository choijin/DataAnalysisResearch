<AbstractNarration>In this IRES project, U.S. graduate and undergraduate students under the direction of Professor Evan Scannapieco at Arizona State University will carry out forefront studies of cosmic magnetism with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), a remarkable new European radio telescope.   Due to its sensitivity, resolution, and frequency coverage, LOFAR will allow for magnetic field measurements that are orders of magnitude better than previous constraints.  Over the course of three years, a total of 15 U.S. students will make use of this instrument in collaboration with the German Long Wavelength Consortium and Prof. Marcus Br√ºggen of Jacobs University in Bremen, helping to open a new window on the magnetic universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magnetic fields thread the universe, yet very little is known about their properties.    On galaxy scales, students will probe the connection between star formation and magnetism and the origin of the magnetic fields that surround galaxies. On galaxy cluster scales, they will study the unknown physics of the hot intracluster medium and the evolution of the mysterious "radio relics." On cosmic scales, they will uncover the magnetic properties of the filamentary web of gas that connects all galaxies.  Each of these projects will not only shed new light on the structure of the magnetic universe, but help students to build the expertise necessary to play a leading role in the impressive series of international, low-frequency radio experiments that will take place over the next decade.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The program allowed ten undergraduates and six graduate students to travel to Germany and conduct research projects using the Low Frequency Radio Array (LOFAR), the first of a new generation of telescopes that operates in the extremely low frequency range between 10 and 240 MHz.   The intellectual merit of the program was twofold.  First, it allowed the students to collaborate with German researchers to make valuable contributions to the LOFAR data analysis pipeline: including tools to "demix" science measurements from contaminating contributions from other brights sources on the sky, and tools to automatically process existing shallow data to produce images that can help guide future more-detailed observations.  Second, it allowed the students to derive interesting science results, such as maps of the low-frequency synchrotron emission in the Virgo and Coma galaxy clusters, as illustrated in the attached figure. The largest broader impact of the proposal was to provide a strong preparation for the ongoing careers of the excellent students we were able to draw to the program. Since the program began, six undergraduates have gone on to graduate school at ASU, Ball State, the University of Colorado, the University of Maryland, and Stanford, and one has begun work as a test engineer at a semiconductor company. All six graduate students are carrying out promising thesis research, four in observational radio astronomy, and one has obtained an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.  Furthermore, the faculty and students have given public lectures and interactive presentations for the annual "Earth and Space Exploration Day," allowing them to communicate the excitement of this International Research Experience for Students directly to the local community.
