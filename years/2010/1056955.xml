<AbstractNarration>Over the past decade, the United States (U.S.) innovation ecosystem has repeatedly been subjected to system-wide shocks.  These shocks have ranged from the dot-com bubble burst, to new waves of off-shoring to the recent meltdowns in the automotive and financial sectors.  While past research has looked at the impact of such crises on jobs or discrete sections of the U.S. economy, it has failed to look at how such shocks may change the global locus of productive activity, technology trajectories, and the comparative advantage of nations. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This research demonstrates how the burst of the telecommunications bubble in March 2000 affected the quantity, direction, and locus of innovation both in the U.S. and internationally.  The research focuses on innovation in photonics, a general purpose technology central to growth not only in the telecommunication industry, but also in energy, biotechnology, sensing, imaging, computing and military applications.  This research answers five questions: (1) How does off-shoring impact the research and development (R&amp;D) trajectories of U.S. firms? (2) If off-shoring firms abandon R&amp;D in new technologies, do individual inventors continue their research efforts in those new technologies in other institutions still in the U.S.? (3) Do alternative national innovation systems, such as Japan's, have greater resilience to such shocks? (4) Do the alternative production economics and institutional environments in the developing nations hosting the off-shoring firms lead to new technology trajectories in those nations? (5) How do the characteristics of individual U.S. inventors affect their career trajectories during economic downturns?  The education plan develops a new curriculum to train a new generation of university graduates and policy analysts in analytic tools.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: During times of financial and industrial crisis, policies often focus on responding to job loss or providing firm or industrial bailouts, rather than the long-term impact on the broader innovation ecosystem.  This integrated research and education plan provides policy-makers with insights into what aspects of the U.S. innovation ecosystem are most affected by economic downturns, what technologies are most susceptible to off-shoring, and how to bolster national comparative advantage during such crises.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Shifts in the global locus of manufacturing may affect not just production costs, but alter the nature and pace of innovation. The past 15 years has seen a dramatic shift in the global distribution of manufacturing.  While the U.S.'s manufacturing value added has remained approximately constant, the U.S.'s share of the global pie has declined, due in large part to the exponential rise of production and demand in China.  Traditional economic theory suggests that shifts in manufacturing away from a nation may hurt wages there, but global innovation and productivity gains will not suffer (Samuelson, 2004). However, our research suggests that in certain emerging technologies, shifting manufacturing to developing nations can lead to a race to the bottom globally, with all nations to lose: Moving the locus of manufacturing to developing countries may reduce innovation domestically and globally, at least in the short to medium term (Fuchs et al 2010; Fuchs et al 2011; Yang et al 2013). Production characteristics (wages; yields; downtimes; organization of production) can differ greatly across nations (especially developed and developing ones), changing which product developments are profitable. In two cases&mdash;automobile bodies and high-end optoelectronic components for communications&mdash; when U.S. firms shifted production to developing East Asia, products developed in the U.S. based on the most advanced technologies were no longer immediately profitable. The overseas firms stopped producing these and, in optoelectronics, also stopped innovation in the most advanced products overseas and in the United States (Fuchs and Kirchain 2010; Yang, Nugent, and Fuchs 2014).  Moving manufacturing to developing countries need not be a "race to the bottom." Three constraints shape the impact of manufacturing location on global technology development: (i) the number of manufacturing facilities that a firm can sustain; (ii) the location of design expertise and whether the designers need to be physically present at the production line; and (iii) the importance, security, and enforcement of intellectual property rights (Fuchs 2014).  Local and national policy can then shift the playing field. For example, we find a combination of local and national institutions in China associated with significant regional experimentation in electric vehicle technologies (Helveston et al).  Most importantly, policies that enhance innovation in one sector or technological context may decrease innovation elsewhere (Fuchs 2014).  It is critical to avoid a one-size-fits all policy approach across technologies and nations. (Fuchs 2014.)  At the onset of our research, there was no widely agreed upon or widely available method for disambiguating inventor names (e.g. linking a name, like John Smith, to the correct real-life individual's activities, given multiple John Smiths) in the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) databases, causing problems for the USPTO and a wide variety of innovation policy research thereon. Our research on inventor disambiguation provided the first supervised learning approach for USPTO inventor disambiguations.
