<AbstractNarration>Magnetic fluids (or ferrofluids) are suspensions of magnetic nanoparticles whose properties and flows are affected by applied magnetic fields, making them useful in industrial and biomedical applications. Potential future applications, such as targeted drug delivery and micro fluidic pumping, involve both active interfaces and motion on small scales, upon which the magnetic particle distribution may become nonuniform. In particular, under moderate fields, nanoparticles aggregate into macroscopic chains which, in turn, affect the fluid flow.  These chains have been previously observed by the investigators using high resolution X-ray phase-contrast images obtained at Argonne national lab.  Further progress in modeling and simulation of ferrofluids on small scales demands new approaches.  To speed the pace of development and design of ferrofluidic devices and to facilitate the exploration of new ferrofluid applications, a robust and exible simulation method is required.  This project will develop, validate and apply such a tool, in the form of a multi-scale code for the numerical simulation of interfacial flows of magnetic fluids. These simulation codes will integrate a mesoscale model of field-induced macroscopic magnetic-particle chains and a realistic nonlinear magnetization for the bulk ferrofluid with a state-of-the-art interfacial Navier-Stokes code.  The Navier-Stokes computation will include a high-order curvature algorithm that accurately computes surface tension at interfaces.  Viscous stress due to field induced macro-chains will be derived from a dissipative particle dynamics type model.  The proposal includes carefully planned projects that will involve and support students from Montclair State's diverse population in leading-edge research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will develop a computer simulation of magnetic liquid, also known as ferrofluid, a unique "smart" material that is easily manipulated using ordinary magnets.  While widely used as a liquid seal in computer disk drives, this easily controlled fluid has far greater potential, including applications in biomedicine (drug delivery, eye surgery and as MRI contrast agents) and in small scale devices which manipulate tiny fluid volumes, as used in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals tests.  Progress has been stalled by two obstacles.  First, experiments are limited because the fluid is very opaque, appearing as a shiny black liquid.  Second, the nano-scale particles which give the fluid its magnetic character also lead to internal structures, such as particle chains, which make its mathematical description complex.  This project overcomes the first challenge by using state-of-the-art computer simulations instead of experiments, while it overcomes the second challenge by building simple mechanical models of internal structure based on high resolution x-ray experiments, performed at Argonne national lab.  The investigators will involve students in key roles in the development of this computer simulation tool that can be used to explore, design and test these and other new applications of magnetic fluids.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of this project were to improve knowledge and predictive capability of magnetic fluids behavior at small scales and to advance their computational modeling and simulation infrastructure.  Magnetic liquids, such as ferrofluids, are highly controllable smart materials, built from magnetic nanoparticles.  This ingredient makes them prone to form particle agglomerations: structures that may lead to complex and unpredictable flows and properties.  This effect is most prominent for small scale flows in complex environments, such as in a blood vessel or capillary, or in microfluidic devices, typical examples of active application areas.  Advances in understanding, predicting and modeling fluid-structure effects in magnetic nanoparticle based liquids is essential if these fluids are to be effective in chemotheraputic drug delivery, cell sorting or oil spill cleanup.  A unique feature of the research we performed in the project was its combination of experimental, computational and theoretical work.  Using intense high-energy x-rays, we probed the internal structure of flowing magnetic fluids and directly measured the influence of nanoparticle clusters.  The experimental technique that we developed is novel: it is the first method of its kind to simultaneously visualize magnetic fluid flows and the nanoparticle structures that modify their flows.  We also found new behaviors, such as the ability of long thread-like chains of nanoparticles inside the fluids to hold on to and stop a rising bubble (Image 1).  Such capabilities may be exploited in the design of new devices for bubble or droplet manipulation.  Only using this technique were we able to confirm that thread-like nanoparticle structures readily form when ferrofluid is mixed with blood (Image 2).  Mathematical methods developed for small scale fluid flow enables us to build simple but accurate models of the complex fluid behavior observed in our x-ray experiments.  These models are simple enough to be included in state-of-the art computational fluid dynamics computer codes for simulating magnetic fluids interacting with magnetic fields, with blood and in other configurations.    Results found early in our project led us to develop two new algorithms for the numerical modeling of fluids with two phases -- such as liquid and gas, but also, for example, magnetic fluid and blood.  Both of these new algorithms will be of general interest to a broad range of researchers and computer modelers working on any form of two phase flow.  One of these algorithms permits very accurate interface shapes to be computed at low computational cost.  The other allows any complex initial condition to be easily coded and is being released publicly as a software library.  Finally, we performed several simple simulations and tests that demonstrate that our news codes can be used to design magnetic drug delivery strategies or to plan a large scale magnetic oil spill clean-up operation.  Magnetic oil spill clean-up was presented as a virtual physics lab to undergraduate students and its impact on improved learning measured as part of a masters thesis supported by the grant.  This project involved 9 undergraduate students, 5 masters students (3 of whom wrote and defended theses) and 2 high school students.  Many of these students were members of under represented groups in math, physics and chemistry.  Most of these students participated actively in experiments, working at Argonne National Lab with the principal investigators and in several conferences, presenting posters and talks.
