<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a growing interest in well-defined nanostructured polymers&lt;br/&gt;because of their unique properties and their ability to be employed in areas such as power generation, nanocomposites, nanopatterning, optics, and charge transport phenomena. These advances could have major impact in accelerating the emerging era of electronics for applications in many areas of information technologies and in portable power sources.  The ACS National Meeting on Nanostructured Polymers will provide a setting to discuss in depth of transformative developments with leading scientists from academia, government, and industry. Various sessions will be devoted to the chemistry,physics, materials science, nanoscience, engineering, and device fabrication of electrically-active and optically-active polymer materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ACS National Meeting on Nanostructured Polymers will provide a setting to discuss in depth of transformative developments with leading scientists from academia, government, and industry. Leading researchers will be present to address the critical questions through a combination of presentations and informal discussions. Invited speakers and session chairs represent the highly interdisciplinary nature of this field with experts from chemistry, physics, material science and engineering, chemical engineering, and electrical engineering with both fundamental and technical approaches. Speakers&lt;br/&gt;and session chairs are from a diverse background.  A primary goal of this funding is to assist researchers in the early stages of their careers to participate in the conference and become active in the nanostructured polymers community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This proposal supports the registration of 8 junior faculty members and/or graduate students/postdocs to attend the symposium, "Nanostructured Polymers" Spring 2010 American Chemical Society National Meeting in San Francisco, California.   This symposium focused on the synthesis and development of polymeric materials with significant structure at the nanometer scale. Applications of these nanostructured materials are realized in how one controls properties at the nano-level and translates them into the macro level. Appreciation of this goal has been slower than anticipated for a variety of reasons, but perhaps most importantly due to the incredible complexity of controlling nano-structures under challenging physical, chemical and mechanical boundary conditions.  The ACS/POLY division  symposium on  "Nanostructured Polymers" provided an interdisciplinary setting to discuss these and related topics with leading researchers from academia, government, and industry. The symposium was divided into sessions that highlight what we believed were the major thrusts in nanostructured polymers with contributions from chemistry, physics, biology, materials science, optical science, nanoscience, and device engineering. In addition to a poster session, there was also an oral session on hybrid or multi-functional materials, where two or more materials are combined in a symbiotic fashion to create materials with new properties. We also had a session dedicated to new synthetic methods for creating nanostructured materials, which will dovetail well with the more application-based papers.
