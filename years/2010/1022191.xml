<AbstractNarration>Software is ubiquitous, yet its development remains error-prone.  Software defects are expensive to fix and can result in mission failure, infrastructure damage, and loss of life.  To avoid another generation of software failure, our students must learn the skills necessary to reason rigorously about the software they develop.  This project is developing student exercises to teach principles of mathematical reasoning in multiple courses across the computer science curriculum.  Previous results suggest this approach increases student learning and attitude towards analytical reasoning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expected outcomes include several web-based learning modules called Reasoning Assistants.  These interactive exercises and tutorials allow students to explore software verification, analytical performance, component-based contracts and testing.  The reasoning assistants are complemented by a collection of in-class collaborative exercises.  Materials are being used and assessed at a diverse set of institutions.  Several hundred students and a dozen faculty are expected to participate.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A key outcome for IU Southeast has been the Ph.D. dissertation by Svetlana Drachova-Strang a doctoral student at Clemson University (the primary lead institution on this grant), - Hollingsworth served on the dissertation committee, attended weekly online conference meetings and made multiple trips to Clemson South Carolina. This dissertation contains the full RCI, many performance-based learning outcomes, data collected from assessments based on those outcomes, descriptions of instructional materials developed to support student learning of analytical reasoning principals, a description of the feedback loop developed for refining the RCI and learning outcomes. Another key outcome for IU Southeast was the support for two undergraduate student researchers at IU Southeast who developed collaborative hands-on instructional materials directly related to the analytical reasoning principles. Some of these materials were subsequently used in classes at IU Southeast and Clemson. Key outcomes in dissemination include publications, presentations, workshops, and conference special sessions. The publication of papers related to the teaching/learning of analytical reasoning principles at the undergraduate level in the following: one journal paper, two conference papers, and four technical reports. Presentations include: three workshops on injecting analytical reasoning into the CS curriculum at 2 national conferences (SIGCSE) and two regional conferences (CCSC); one panel presentation on Teaching Mathematical Reasoning across the Curriculum at SIGCSE; two special sessions on Engaging Mathematical Reasoning Exercises at SIGCSE.
