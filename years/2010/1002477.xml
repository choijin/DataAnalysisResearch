<AbstractNarration>The Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques (IHÉS)is an international centre dedicated to fundamental research and located near Paris. This award provides funding to partially offset the costs incurred by IHÉS to finance the stipends and subsistence fees of U.S. researchers spending time at the Institute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;U.S. scientists have consistently been by far the largest group of IHÉS visitors, well ahead of French or Russian scientists, the next two best represented groups. They are undoubtedly attracted by the fact that IHÉS has long been recognized as one of the best places in the world for fundamental research in mathematics and theoretical physics. The international reputation of the Institute's permanent professors and long-term visitors, the broad range of scientific fields represented at IHÉS, the complete freedom researchers enjoy for pursuing their work and the many opportunities for very rich interactions across disciplines are the key factors of this attraction. IHÉS shares many of these characteristics with the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton; it was in fact modeled on IAS, although it is smaller in size, as it does not host researchers in social sciences and the humanities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The award will not only facilitate the access of U.S. scientists to a leading research institution offering excellent working conditions. It will also benefit the entire scientific community, as it will provide opportunities for U.S. researchers to work with fellow scientists from across the world. In the last years, the number of countries from which IHÉS visiting scientists originate has always been over 30.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Over the past five years, as part-involved in the bilateral "GROW" program, the NSF/IHES visitorsÆ program has allowed a significant increase of high level research collaborative actions between the United States and France in the field of mathematics combined with a focus on interdisciplinarity. Intellectual Merit  Focusing on scientific excellence, the program has benefited to more than 2500 US and US based researchers from different backgrounds and universities. Indeed, though ethnic based statistics are forbidden by law in Europe and France, the IHES fellowsÆ visitors program has been committed to concentrate on under-represented students such as women, migrants, or first-generation higher education students, through: (1) a recruitment process that takes into account scientific achievement : the invited researchers are selected on the sole basis of their scientific records by IHES Scientific Council ;   (2)  a set of connections and partnerships with South American, Asian and African universities (Africa program) and institutions.  In this respect, IHES has engaged in a number of voluntary actions for both gender equality and social diversity permitting visitors to be further prepared to successfully deploy and implement multi-actors, multi-sector, multi-field projects being given the background, skills, insights and scientific network to work collaboratively with cutting edge research, instrumentation, analyses, and applications.    By targeting transversal Science, the program has allowed participants from differing scientific backgrounds to meet in an environment conducive to the deployment of autonomous multidisciplinary projects. In this respect, visitors were given access to the leading players in amongst other fields: physics, biology, biomathematics, IT and Big Data, finance, and economics or insurance.    IHES-NSF fellows have gained operative and formative skills to: (1) further their ability to explore frontier scientific questions and develop testable hypotheses, (2) design and demonstrate original scientific pathways, (3) develop their ability to access and implement working partnerships with other scientists, global agencies and industries, (4) in this respect, increase their ability to obtain, at the European level, individual funding for their research, especially through ERC or MSCN schemes and (5) present, publish, and communicate (through seminars, schools&hellip;) their research results to the European and international community in further field than their core research field.    Broader Impact  IHES-NSF fellows have worked as part of a larger established mathematics and physics dedicated Network and a Science Learning Community to build synergistic and long-lasting professional collaborations with International, European and local agencies, industry, academics, and other stakeholders.    These teams have addressed a number of complex mathematics related interdisciplinary problems faced by all major post-industrial nations including the USA in fields such as Big Data, Bio-informatics, speed trading and finance, climate change.... This program has given place to a large number of publications and increased the visibility of its participants. Major contributions to science were made. As for example:  (1)   Laurent Lafforgue proved that the full functionality principle of the Langlands program is equivalent to an explicit family of nonlinear Poisson formulas;  (2)   Maxim Kontsevich made with several coauthors fundamental contributions to several subjects including wall crossing, Mirror Symmetry, Teichmuler flow or cluster algebras;  (3)   Misha Gromov opened new directions for mathematics in theoretical biology;  (4)   Alain Connes developed his theory of non-commutative geometry in the direction of quantum fields theory and motives;  (5)   Thibault Damour made several important progress on general relativity and black holes;  (6)   Nikita Nekrasov and Vasily Pestun obtained major results on Seiberg-Witt...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
