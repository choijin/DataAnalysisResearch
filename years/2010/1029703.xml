<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to address the challenge in trustworthy sensing and communications, as content-rich audio-visual streams become increasingly adapted on-the-fly for individual receivers. The proposed project develops a novel framework of Forensic Hash for Information Assurance (FASHION) in sensing and communications. The framework utilizes a strategically designed compact string and the associated decision mechanism to transcend the capabilities of conventional hash and non-intrusive forensics. Offering more forensic answers about data integrity, origin, and processing history in higher accuracy and efficiency, the proposed framework overcomes the current one-size-fit-all dilemma to enable trust assessment to a high level. The main investigations include: what evidentiary information to form forensic hash; theories and algorithms on how to compactly and securely encode forensic hash, and robustly and securely associate it with source data; attack strategies and counter-attacks; and developing a Testbed for experimental evaluation of the proposed framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit lies in exploring the unchartered area of Information Forensic Hash that transcends from prior art, advancing theories and algorithms of assured cyber sensing and communications, and providing new capabilities and tools to the community. In particular, the proposal leverages recent advances in non-intrusive forensics to add flexibility and reveal richer information for trustworthiness assessment of cyber-based sensing and communications. The proposed research has the potential to open a new research area in information forensics which is very relevant to the health and development of the cyber-infrastructure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research, if successful, could have significant impact on many applications of national interests, including the US IT infrastructure, as sensing and communicating audio-visual data have become a central part in government operations and in services by the high-tech industry, whose continuing success is critical to U.S.'s economic prosperity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact comes from the seamlessly integration of research with education/outreach through the framework's Testbed and special honor programs, to actively attract and nurture under-represented students to develop a successful engineering career.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In recent decades, we have witnessed the advancement of information technologies leading to the ubiquitous availability of multimedia devices and digital content. This path of technological evolution has naturally led to a critical issue that must be addressed next, namely, to ensure that content, devices, and intellectual property are being used by authorized users for legitimate purposes, and to be able to forensically prove with high confidence when otherwise. When security is compromised or authenticity is forged, forensic methodologies and tools are employed to reconstruct what has happened to digital content in order to answer who has done what, when, where, and how.  In order to verify the integrity of a digital document, security practice often creates a piece of digital reference known as a hash.  A hash is generated based on the document content using cryptographically sound operations so that only an authorized user (such as document owner or sender) can develop a valid hash, attach with the document, and later the hash can be used by others as a reference. When the document content is tampered, the result from a verifying operation would show inconsistency with the attached hash, thus revealing the content tampering.  Authenticating multimedia content, however, is more sophisticated than text data, because not only can multimedia content can be stored in substantially different format, they are also transcoded in various ways, for example, to reduce the bitrate when transmission bandwidth is limited, to a different size when the end-user has a display device of different size and shape than the senders. An example of size change combined with content tampering is shown in the attached Figure 1.  This NSF supported project tackles the verification of digital data through a novel framework of forensic hash, which is a small-size reference of about a few hundred of bytes that can help reveal more information about the processing history of the data under question and facilitate answering questions about what has been done on the data.  Forensic hash constructions developed through our research provides robust geometric transform estimation, accurate tampering localization, excellent discrimination capability and a novel capability to estimate seam carving &ndash; the state-of-the-art resizing tools for images and video. With such capabilities in answering a broad scope of forensic questions in an accurate and efficient way, our proposed forensic hash can be a valuable tool to help evaluate the trustworthiness of electronic media and signals.  We have further leverage the new forensic hash framework and extend it to address an important problem beyond security. Increasingly, images transmitted and rendered at receiversÆ end may have a different size and aspect ratio from those of the original, in order to meet the heterogeneous situations and needs of transmission bandwidth and display capabilities.  This calls for automatically monitoring and evaluation of image quality for Quality-of-Service (QoS) assurance in broadband communications and online/mobile media applications.  We use "retargeted images" having undergone content-adaptive resizing as an example and made novel use of the forensic hash framework from this research project to tackle the new challenge of quality assessment for retargeted images. For the U.S. wireless and communication industry to address the marketÆs needs and global competition, the research outcome from this project contributes to technology innovations. Furthermore, the mentoring and engagement of the undergraduate and graduate students who participated in this research (including female and under-represented minorities) have contributed to the work force development in STEM areas that is critical for sustained technological advancement and prosperity.
