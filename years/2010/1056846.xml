<AbstractNarration>This CAREER award from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program supports work by Professor Jamie Walls at the University of Miami (UM) to develop a new class of techniques utilizing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), the fundamental spectroscopy behind magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  In conventional NMR, multiple measurements are needed in order to acquire full chemical information, often requiring very long experimental acquisition times.  Dr. Walls is developing an alternative "multidimensional" approach that generates signal in a single experiment.  The method is based upon correlations between spin transitions rather than individual spin transition frequencies, and may help speed up structural and dynamical NMR studies of biomolecular and other systems, and reduce MRI imaging times. It may also prove applicable to other spectroscopies and disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the course of training undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral researchers, Dr. Walls is developing a new imaging and spectroscopy lab that uses NMR to illustrate the importance of numerical simulations in experimental science.  Working with his undergraduate and graduate students, Dr. Walls is also developing a weekly science radio program, La Semana en Ciencia (The Week in Science), that will be produced in both English and Spanish at the UM School of Communication's radio studio.  The program will highlight the excitement and importance of new scientific discoveries, with aims of enhancing science literacy and inspiring students to consider careers in science.  La Semana en Ciencia will make cutting edge science more accessible to Hispanic students, who are traditionally underrepresented in scientific disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on the development of a new class of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) pulse sequences that can selectively excite spins based upon correlations between transitions and not on the actual transition frequencies themselves.  One class of pulse sequences that were developed were pathway selective pulses (PSPs), which were pulse sequences that selectively excited a system based upon whether a particular evolution pathway was available.  Since the signals from 2D and higher dimensional NMR experiments can be interpreted as arising from the evolution along frequency encoded pathways, the development of pathway selective pulses could be used to speed up the acquisition of higher multidimensional spectra, which can be very time consuming.  The intellectual merit of this project lies in the ability to add conditional constraints to methods for controlling quantum evolution in such a manner that an excitation would occur if and only if certain evolution pathways were available to the quantum system.  This opens up new avenues for quantum control.  Additionally, a new effective relaxation mechanism was also discovered whereby sharp features and/or features where the line shape is non-differentiable at some finite order were shown to be long-lived.  This is a consequence of mathematical properties of the Fourier coefficients for such sharp spectral features. As a result, signals from those features tend to "relax?? more slowly and can be highlighted using delayed-acquisition.  Experimental and theoretical results were also performed that explored the boundary between inhomogenous broadening and homogeneous broadening in spin systems, where it was shown that homogeneously broadened systems, such as dipolar solids, can behave like an inhomogeneously broadened system under certain circumstances.   The broader impacts of this project are the development of new techniques that can speed up the acquisition of multidimensional spectra and can reduce the scan times in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  Since spin is the prototypical quantum system, many of the methods developed in this work could be exported to other scientific disciplines where quantum coherence and its control play critical roles, such as in quantum computing.  Additionally, the ability to suppress Klein tunneling electrostatically could be an important tool for developing electronics based on graphene, which has many unique physical and electrical properties.  This NSF award also led to the training of graduate and undergraduate students and post-doctoral researchers in NMR methodology and simulations.  The award period resulted in 10 publications with additional work in preparation.  The PI has also developed an NMR laboratory class for undergraduate students in addition to a graduate class where students learn the latest in NMR methodology.
