<AbstractNarration>This award, made to the University of Iowa, is supported by the Department of Defense ASSURE program and the NSF Directorate for Biological Sciences. The University of Iowa will provide research training for 10 weeks for 8 students, for the summers of 2010-2012.  The scientific focus of the research program is microbiology.  The program encourages students to pursue a career in basic science and gives them the skills to succeed in that path.  Each student will conduct an independent laboratory research project under the guidance of a faculty and a graduate student co-mentor.  Lectures, workshops and social activities will expose students to graduate school and other career options, will include training in ethics and the responsible conduct of research, and will promote informal interactions.  At the end of the summer, students will prepare a written report and present their findings at a University-wide symposium.  Students will also be encouraged to present their results at regional or national meetings. The success of the program will be assessed by student tracking and an evaluation process that includes use of a common assessment tool.  Students will receive a stipend and money for travel and living expenses. The program is open to undergraduates who have finished their sophomore or junior year of college, are interested in scientific research, and are U.S. citizens or permanent residents. Recruitment will emphasize students from demographic groups that are underrepresented in the sciences and/or students from small colleges where opportunities for research are lacking.

The impact and success of the program was assessed by various means, including tracking of students and use of an REU common assessment tool.  INTELLECTUAL MERIT.  The program provided a substantive research experience with significant potential to generate new knowledge.  All 24 participants produced a poster describing their findings.  Five won travel awards to attend ABRCMS, and one received a poster award.  Historical data indicate about 10% of participants end up as an author on a peer-reviewed manuscript, but there is a considerable lag before these papers are published.  BROADER IMPACTS.  The program contributed to the development of our nationÆs Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) workforce by providing a solid basic research experience and skills to succeed in STEM fields.  Approximately 50% of the participants in our REU were underrepresented minorities, 66% were female and 70% were from small colleges with few opportunities research.  Virtually all participants reported increased enthusiasm for pursuing science.  Long-term tracking indicated about 50% will matriculate in a PhD program in the biological sciences, 25% pursue careers in medicine, and 25% do a variety of things, including teaching or working in a laboratory setting.
