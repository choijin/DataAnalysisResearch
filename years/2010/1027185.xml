<AbstractNarration>This project will develope a new code for the simulation of magnetic reconnection.  The code will treat the electrons and ions as separate but coupled fluids.  The first step will be the development of a solver for the equations of the electric field and magnetic field.  The next step is to develop a module that solves for the equations governing the electron fluid.  This module will have the capability of switching on or off different terms in the electron equations in order to study the effects of the different terms.  Once the electron fluid code has been fully developed the ion fluid modlue can be quickly derived from the electron fluid.  The final step will be to couple the electron and ion fluids and the electric and magnetic field solvers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By treating the electrons and ions as separate fluids the new code will have the ability to investigate cross-scale coupling in collisionless magnetic reconnection.  Collisionless reconnection is the most important process that couples the energy in the solar wind into Earth's magnetosphere and eventually down to the ionosphere and neutral atmosphere.  Collisionless reconnection is also a critically important process in the generation of magnetic substorms and storms.</AbstractNarration>
