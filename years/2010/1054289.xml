<AbstractNarration>The primary goal of the proposed research is to improve the understanding of the decay for solutions to the wave equation on black hole backgrounds.  Kerr spacetimes and perturbations of such are of particular interest, due to aspirations to contribute to a proof of the stability of this family of solutions to Einstein's equations.  Recent work has focused on proving localized energy estimates and Strichartz estimates, which are both measures of the dispersive nature of the wave equation which are known to be fairly robust.  The former have played a key role in Tataru's recent proof of the long conjectured Price's law, which asserts a certain decay rate for solutions to the wave equation on the Schwarzschild and Kerr backgrounds.  A key feature of these blackhole spacetimes which demands extra attention is the existence of trapped rays.  In flat space, light travels on lines which escape to infinity.  Thus packets of a solution which are initially overlapping but traveling in even slightly different directions quickly spread out, and this spreading promotes decay.  On Schwarzschild, the paths on which light travels are dictated by the geometry, and in particular, there is a region, called the photon sphere, where photons can orbit the blackhole.  Such trapping, where the rays remain in a compact set, is a known obstacle to certain dispersive estimates, such as localized energy estimates.  Trapping also occurs on the Kerr family of spacetimes, though its geometry is more complicated.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;General relativity asserts that the universe is a (1+3) dimensional curved space and that gravity corresponds to the curvature of this space.  A common description is to think of the universe as a trampoline.  A mass, such as a bowling ball, which is placed on the trampoline causes it to curve in such a way as to attract other objects on the surface.  Einstein's equations model the curvature and evolution of such curvature of universes.  Though Einstein's equations are quite nonlinear, a few special solutions are known.  These are typically found by imposing many symmetries to simplify the equations.  Of particular relevance to this proposal are the Minkowski space time, the family of Schwarzschild space times, and the Kerr family of space times.  These correspond to the flat solution, to spherically symmetric black holes, and to rotating black holes respectively.  A natural question to ask is whether these solutions are stable.  That is, if one starts close to, say, a member of the Kerr family of space times, will it necessarily remain close to a member of the Kerr family.  The only rigorous proofs of (nonlinear) stability are for the Minkowski space time, which began with the seminal work of Christodoulou and Klainerman.  The stability of the Kerr family of space times is a major open problem in mathematical relativity which has been garnering much interest recently.  A thorough understanding of the decay properties of the wave equation on such backgrounds is considered to be prerequisite knowledge to any proof of such stability.  The studies in this proposal are expected to directly contribute to this.  The teaching components of this proposal consist primarily of the development of a course on general relativity as well as a first year seminar course.  The research and teaching components are integrated through reading seminars and directed research projects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The sponsored research focused on proving dispersive estimates for waves in the presence of background geometry.  Local energy estimates, which measure the rate that energy vacates a fixed bounded set, are an example of such bounds.  Geometries of special interest are the Schwarzschild and Kerr black hole space-times from general relativity.  These have the feature that light, at spots, may orbit the black hole, which is called trapping and is a known obstruction to local energy estimates.     With the support of the grant, 17 papers have been published or were accepted for publication.  The coauthors on these include four graduate students and three undergraduate students whose research was directed by the PI.  Topics include: two papers that demonstrate the stability of Price?s law, which predicts the rate of decay of waves on black hole backgrounds, when there are time dependent perturbations of the geometry; two examinations of local energy estimates on higher dimensional black hole backgrounds; a series of papers studying the Strauss conjecture, which regards global existence for certain nonlinear wave equations, on geometric backgrounds including the Schwarzschild and Kerr space-times; studies of the existence of solutions to quasilinear Schr&ouml;dinger equations, which can be thought of as having geometry that depends on the solution; examinations of the effects of a new type of trapping; and a study of the stability of local energy estimates on non-trapping backgrounds.     The PI has directed the theses of four doctoral students and expects the completion of another in 2019.  He has also directed three undergraduate honors theses, and two of these were awarded highest honors.  Another honors student is expected to finish in 2019.     The two courses that were proposed, a first year (undergraduate) seminar on discrete Fourier and wavelet analysis and an undergraduate topics course on geometry and relativity, were developed and taught.  The PI was a member of the department?s Faculty Learning Community and the Finish Line Project, which focuses on the retention of first generation university students through best classroom practices.  For his teaching, the PI was recognized with the 2017 Sue Goodman Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Education (inaugural award) from the Department of Mathematics at UNC and the 2018 Board of Governors? Award for Excellence in Teaching from the UNC system.     During the tenure of the grant, the PI served as his department?s Associate Chair and as a member of the chair?s Advisory Committee.  He is the faculty advisor for UNC?s AMS Graduate Student Chapter, was the chair of two postdoctoral hiring committees, and was a member of three other hiring committees.  He also served on both the undergraduate and graduate committees.  The PI was a co-organizer for the national meeting SIAM Conference on Nonlinear Waves and Coherent Structures, a co-organizer for a conference in honor of Patrick Eberlein, and a co-organizer of 3 AMS special sessions.  He is a co-founder and co-director of the UNC PDE Mini-schools program.          Last Modified: 07/29/2018       Submitted by: Jason L Metcalfe]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
