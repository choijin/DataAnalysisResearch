<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professor Tim Stelzer at the University of Illinois.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After nearly 20 years of planning and construction, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is now the highest-energy particle collider in the world. Data from the LHC is likely to lead to nothing less than a new "Standard Model" for the next generation of particle physicists, describing the fundamental building blocks of matter and their interactions at an even higher energy scale.   In his research, Professor Stelzer aims to develop methods to improve the efficiency by which new theories beyond the Standard Model might be tested at the LHC.  This class of new theories includes those in which the symmetries of the Standard Model are augmented by a so-called "supersymmetry" relating particles of different spins to each other.  Typically, once a new theory has been identified as interesting, it may take a team of researchers a year or more to complete the calculations necessary to determine how this theory could be tested at the LHC.  Methods developed and implemented by this award aim to reduce that time from years to days, dramatically increasing the range of new physics that can be studied as the LHC data is collected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will also have significant broader impacts.  Professor Stelzer will involve graduate students and postdocs in his research, and thereby provide critical training to junior physicists beginning research in this field.  He also intends to give public lectures on his research results, and develop new learning materials for undergraduate students based on results from the LHC.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This main goal of this project was to develop tools that would allow theoretical and experimental physicists to efficiently perform the extremely complex calculations needed to extract insight into the nature of our universe from the data coming from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.  The quality and quantity of data being generated at the LHC is an unprecedented technological achievement.  Interpreting these data presents unprecedented intellectual challenges. Indeed, only a handful of physicists in the world have the technical expertise required to perform the calculations necessary to compare a theoretical model for the particle interactions with the experimental data.  Furthermore, the calculations for a single study could take a team of experts years to complete.  This project exploits the techniques developed over decades by these experts and incorporates them into an integrated software package that will automatically select the appropriate technique and apply it to a specific situation.  The result  is a program that can automatically perform calculations in minutes that would require experts months to complete.     Performing these calculations is computationally intensive (it could take over a week to perform the calculation on a single computer).  As part of this project, we built a 260-node computing cluster available to the community, which researchers can access via the Internet.  A physicist can simply specify the process of interest and the number of events he or she would like to have simulated. The code is then automatically generated and run in parallel on the cluster, dramatically streamlining the process.  Currently thousands of physicists are registered users on the system.  Perhaps the strongest evidence of the impact of this program is that the papers referring to this work are among the most cited each year in high energy physics.
