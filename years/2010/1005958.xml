<AbstractNarration>Technical: This project seeks to endow Si-compatible materials with increased optical functionality. Epitaxial architectures that arrange Ag islands in proximity to Ge/Si(100) quantum dots (QDs) will be investigated to assess plasmonic enhancements to luminescence efficiency. The localized surface plasmon (LSP) mode of the Ag island is predicted to improve both the absorption and emission of photons by the Ge QD. Increased absorption results from the dramatic field concentration near the Ag nanoparticle. The Purcell effect increases the spontaneous emission rate. Recent theoretical work suggests that plasmonic enhancements will be greatest for optimally arranged Ge dots and Ag islands if the LSP resonance frequency is close to that of the QD exciton. The near UV LSP resonance of the Ag islands will be tuned to match the near IR exciton energy of the Ge/Si(100) QDs using a combination of shape resonance effects and by varying their dielectric environment. In the ideal case, theory predicts the luminescence enhancement can approach two orders of magnitude.&lt;br/&gt;One focus will be to determine whether the inhomogeneously strained planar surface of the Si layer that caps the buried Ge dots can affect the thermodynamics or kinetics of Ag island nucleation. The second focus will be on the nm-scale pits found immediately above the Ge dots just prior to completion of the Si cap layer. &lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: this project will positively affect the education and future career of the student(s) involved in the research. They will be trained in the synthesis as well as the structural and optical characterization of materials and architectures in the rapidly growing field of plasmonics. Additionally, links to the highly successful Science is Fun program offered by the Leroy Eyring Center for Solid State Science at ASU will be established.&lt;br/&gt;This program impacts on average 12,000 high and middle school students annually. The PI will work closely with Science is Fun staff and interns to develop hands-on, age-appropriate activities that demonstrate interaction of light with photonic structures using naturally occurring butterfly wings, bird feathers and seashells as ?attention grabbers?.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award investigated using the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) of epitaxial Ag islands to enhance the photoluminescence of self-assembled Ge quantum dots (QDs) grown on Si.  These Ge QDs luminesce at the technologically relevant 1.5 &micro;m wavelength, but their low light output has precluded wide-ranging application.  Significantly increasing their radiative efficiency could have great technological impact in the area of Si-based optoelectronics.     The LSPR can dramatically enhance the electric field strength near the Ag islands, which could, in theory, increase photoexcitation and radiative recombination in the Ge QDs.  These effects should be maximized for optimal arrangement of the Ag islands and the Ge QDs and by carefully tuning the energy of the LSPR.   The Ge QDs were grown using molecular beam epitaxy and the Ag islands were grown in an attached metal deposition chamber specially built for this investigation.  The spacing between the Ag islands and the Ge QDs was varied in a controlled fashion by depositing an epitaxial Si cap layer atop the Ge QDs.     The shape of the Ag islands was controlled through variations in the growth and annealing conditions.  Their optical properties were investigated using spectroscopic ellipsometry.  This experimentally measured optical response was interpreted using a newly developed model that describes the Ag islands as interface dipoles.  This model faithfully reproduces the main features of the experimental spectra and is anticipated to be useful for describing the plasmonic response of metallic nanoparticles supported on substrates with dielectric functions that vary significantly over the relevant energy range.     Photoluminescence spectra acquired at 10K from regions of the same wafer with and without Ag islands were compared to assess the effects of the Ag LSPR on the luminescence of the Ge QDs.  Disappointingly, the largest enhancement factor identified was only about 1.5, which is significantly smaller than the orders of magnitude that had been previously predicted by theory.     This award completely supported the dissertation research of one PhD student and partially supported another.  A Research Experience for Undergraduates supplement supported the activities of three students, all of who are now pursuing PhDs in programs across the country.  Significant education and outreach activities were undertaken in collaboration with the ASU-hosted Science is Fun program, which has impacted thousands of K-12 students throughout the Phoenix metro area during its lifetime.  This award developed an educational module describing the photonic properties of bird feathers and butterfly wings that was well received.
