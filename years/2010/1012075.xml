<AbstractNarration>Dmitri Babikov of Marquette University and Martin Gruebele of the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign are supported by an award from the Theory, Models and Computational Methods program of the Chemistry division to develop computational methodologies to study the problem of encoding information in vibrational wave packets by entangling polyatomic vibrations.  The PI's goal is to assess whether molecules or molecular ions could help quantum information processing. Some of the theoretical predictions are tested using experiments  carried out on jets of neutral molecules at low temperature. Although these test experiments do not correspond to true quantum computing, they allow achieving and utilizing a high degree of coherence.  They also give rise to important information on how the coherent vibrational wave packets evolve as well as the effect of various sources of dephasing. Theory and experiment are combined to achieve gates with up to 4 qubits (e.g. Shor's algorithm for factorizing the number 15) with rotationally and vibrationally excited states of the thiophosgene molecule. The PIs and their students study the effects of decoherence induced by molecular rotations, field inhomogeneities, and vibrational states not part of the computing states are being explored.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum computing and quantum information are emerging fields that attempt to use the special, and often non-intuitive, properties of quantum mechanics to enable calculations that are very difficult or even impossible using current technology.   Experimental demonstration of vibrational QC using a polyatomic molecule opens up new opportunities for the practical realization of a quantum processor.  A series of interdisciplinary seminars are planned to take place at both Marquette University and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on the topics of Quantum Control and Quantum Information.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Quantum computing is still regarded as a "long shot," but the benefits from its enhanced computational speed are so great that it must be pursued. Quantum bits (or "qubits") allow a type of parallel processing that would change the way we do data encryption, or solve some very hard computational problems. Just as silicon chips carry "0" and "1" bits in conventional computers, atomic states or low-temperature junctions have been recently investigated as carriers for qubits. Qubits can simultaneously be in the "0" and "1" state without loss of information, thus speeding up computing when properly handled. In our work, we expanded the horizon of quantum computing to molecular vibrations as carriers of quantum information. Vibrations are easily manipulated with laser pulses, and we investigated the small molecule SCCl2, binding together a sulfur, carbon and two chlorine atoms. By computer modeling we showed how to shape laser pulses for accurate manipulations of vibrational qubits in SCCl2, studied how robust such pulses are with respect to experimental noise, and proposed how to read quantum information out of this molecule. In our experiments we identified the vibrational states in SCCl2 that could be used for such quantum computation and readout procedures. Another difficult problem is how to communicate information between different molecules, and one possibility is to use molecular ions, since ions can be trapped, cooled, isolated from the environment, and brought into interaction in a controlled way by means of the external electric fields.
