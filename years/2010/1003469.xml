<AbstractNarration>In response to the rapid implementation of a variety of new geospatially-based technologies into the agricultural sector, this project is improving a number of existing technical agriculture programs by integrating real-time sensor and monitor technologies into teaching curricula through context-based experiential learning. The project is developing an information-enhanced, technologically-advanced agricultural outdoor laboratory at the institution's working farm that is serving as a focal point for integrating a variety of courses in the curriculum. Instead of implementing geospatially-based sensor and monitor technologies independently within each discipline, information from a variety of disciplines is being integrated through activities that are utilizing the newly installed technologies. These are generating system-level information that is providing students with decision making and planning experiences. The project is providing expanded student participation in contextual technology projects, developing and integrating new courses that incorporate sensor and monitor technologies into existing agricultural education programs, and training faculty to understand and utilize these new technologies. The project is enhancing the agricultural workforce by producing technologically adept graduates who are bringing innovative technologies and skills to employers.  Moreover, the project is providing an improved pathway for highly-trained transfer students who wish to continue their education at a four-year institution, providing opportunities to develop and maintain strong cross-disciplinary interactions among faculty, and recruiting students from traditionally under-served rural populations into technological fields.  Project development and ultimate success are being informed and enabled by a strong formative evaluation component, and summative evaluation results are being presented at national agricultural education meetings and shared with others via the ATE AgroKnowledge Center.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Today's college graduate needs to be technically versatile, solve problems from a systems-level perspective, function in diverse teams and understand the global nature of agriculture.  Abraham Baldwin Agricultural College (ABAC) is embarking on a multi-faceted program to address these  needs through a renovation of the agriculture curriculum, with the aid of this ATE grant&ndash;Transforming Agricultural Curricula (ATE # 1003469).  The essence was to fully integrate technologies from commercially available or market-ready research into the teaching curricula through context-based experiential learning in an outdoor  laboratory.  The use of water for agricultural purposes is both controversial and critical to the continued supply of food and fiber, balanced with a continuing supply of quality water for people to use domestically. Agricultural use of water is highest in crop production.  However, the most visible use of water as seen by the public is on golf courses and in the maintenance of landscapes in high visibility areas.  Thus the areas chosen for development under this grant were soil moisture sensing and precision irrigation control in crop production and the application of these concepts in the maintenance of high quality turfgrass.   The result of the project was to create access to innovative technology previously unavailable to students through the acquisition of the following technology: 1)Automated data logging devices, capable of reading, storing and transmitting data from sensors measuring soil moisture, soil temperature, soil salinity, air temperature, rainfall amounts, relative humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, and any other inputs with the same electronic specifications.  2)Soil moisture and temperature sensors most commonly used in field crop production; sensors that add the ability to measure EC or electrical conductivity of soil, allowing an estimate of soil salinity, as well as measuring temperature and moisture in the soil; and sensors that allow the measurement of soil moisture, temperature and electrical conductivity as the 5TE sensors do, and are designed for use in greenhouse pots. 3)High Resolution Rain Gauge that allows measurement of rainfall or a combination of rainfall and overhead irrigation depending on whether they are installed under an overhead irrigator. 4)Soil-specific calibration for the 10HS sensors &ndash; These soil sensors give good results when used at their factory calibration, but are more accurate when calibrated with soil from the specific area where they are to be used. 5)2-Wire irrigation system with Integrated Control Interface and Stratus II computer system for the Turfgrass and Golf Course Management program. 6)Toro equipment with real-time moisture sensor technology with GPS software mapping to monitor the effects of 3 cultural practices used in turfgrass management including mowing, aerification, and detaching in addition to the MyTurf software with wireless real-time equipment monitoring.  The above mentioned technology was used as the basis for transforming the following courses:  Power Equipment;  Precision Agriculture;  Grounds Maintenance Equipment; Turfgrass Resources;   Grounds Irrigation Systems;  and create the following modules: Irrigation Management Through Soil Moisture Sensing-; Irrigation Control and Management Through the Use of Advanced Technology.  Three of the four project outputs listed as (1) faculty trained in current technology, (2) curricula incorporating water management technologies, (3) expanded student participation in contextual technology projects; were successfully attained.  Of the four expected project outcomes 1) technologically adept graduates, 2) an improved pathway for highly trained transferring students, 3) cross-disciplinary interaction among faculty, and 4) recruitment of students into technologies fields, the first outcome was definitely achieved with students demonstrating a greater than 80% understanding of the technologie...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
