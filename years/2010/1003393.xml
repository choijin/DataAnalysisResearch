<AbstractNarration>The research team aims to reconstruct Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) snowpack using sea surface temperatures (SST) variability and tree-ring chronologies. The researchers hypothesize that by using SSTs, a complete representation of ocean-atmosphere variability can be achieved.  The researchers will also use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to identify coupled regions of Pacific and Atlantic Ocean SSTs and UCRB snowpack and, hence, regional hydrologic variability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary broader impacts involve supporting a graduate student, disseminating research results on an established public website, and working with public and private stakeholders in the water resource arena.</AbstractNarration>
