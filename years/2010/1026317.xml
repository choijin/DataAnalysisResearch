<AbstractNarration>This award will support the acquisition of Nehalem nodes, each with twelve cores and more than 24 GB of memory, Infiniband switch and network, and an NVIDIA S20 series Tesla with  Fermi GPUs. The proposed hardware is well suited to advance research in pure and applied mathematics at the University of Michigan. The hardware will be used for research on algebraic curves of high genus in positive characteristic, grain boundaries of polycrystalline metals and ceramics, Navier-Stokes solvers and exact solutions, very fast Fourier transforms for sparse data, tree codes and vortex methods, formal Laurent series, and quantum dots in materials science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SCREMS hardware will allow us to enrich the content of a range of courses, encompassing the arithmetic of dynamical systems, compressive sensing, image processing, and scientific computing. In addition, the hardware will allow us and our students and postdocs, some of whom belong to under-represented groups, to acquire expertise in parallel programming, high performance computing, and GPU computing. Thus the SCREMS hardware will be a valuable resource for training and professional development.</AbstractNarration>
