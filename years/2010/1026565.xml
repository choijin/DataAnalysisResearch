<AbstractNarration>Abstract for&lt;br/&gt;?CAREER: Secure Communication via Source and Channel Randomness?&lt;br/&gt;Current cryptosystem design depends on two main kinds of algorithms: secret-key and public-key algorithms. Secret-key algorithms are simple and efficient but have key management difficulty. Public-key algorithms are simple in key management but are computationally costly and vulnerable to the man-in-the-middle attack. This research investigates the emerging physical layer security approaches, which either achieve secure communication without keys, or simplify key management by generating keys using powerful coding techniques. This research aims at facilitating implementation of the physical layer security approaches to practical wireless communication systems, and stimulating interdisciplinary collaborations among researchers in mathematics, computer science and electrical engineering.&lt;br/&gt;This research provides a comprehensive framework to solve the problems of keyless secure communication and key agreement (key generation and distribution) for a variety of communication environments including noncoherent communication, channels with compound states, fading channels, noisy eavesdropping, and multihop networks. To be specific, this research investigates robust secure communication under channel uncertainty and delay constraint, fundamental tradeoff in multi-key agreement for different terminal pairs, key agreement algorithms by jointly using source and channel randomness, and key agreement protocols in multihop networks by exploiting network coding. This program is strongly coupled with educational and curriculum development at the University of Hawaii, and involves development of an advanced monograph on the topic of physical layer security to help disseminate the progresses in this active area in and outside the communication society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

This project has investigated various communication systems and key agreement source models under security constraints, and characterized the performance limits of the developed information theoretic schemes. In particular, this project successfully accomplished the following research tasks.  1. This project investigated the fundamental secure communication limits over compound wiretap channels and cognitive multiple-access wiretap channels, and characterized the secrecy capacity for various channel scenarios.    2. This project comprehensively investigated a class of broadcast models with layered decoding and secrecy requirements, employed and developed a series of security achieving schemes, and characterized the secrecy capacity region for these models. This project further explored two applications of these results including broadcast approach over fading wiretap channels and secret sharing. In particular, the connection between secret sharing and secure communication allows readily solving secret sharing problems with more complicated qualified and non-qualified sets, and/or with simultaneously sharing multiple secrets.  3. This project developed a key agreement framework that unifies existing source and channel models for key agreement over wireless fading channels, and studied the scenario in the presence of an active attacker.   4. This project studied a class of security detection problems based on information theoretic measure of maximum mean discrepancy, and characterized the performance of the developed schemes via information theoretic approaches.
