<AbstractNarration>This study will extract the isospin dependence of the Equation of State (EoS) of nuclear matter from several angles.  Using classical molecular dynamics (CMD) we will study the dependence of nuclear binding energy on isospin in nuclei on their ground state, in infinite nuclear matter at a range of density, temperature and isospin conditions, in excited nuclei at varying densities,temperatures and isospin, and in reactions between nuclei with different isospin compositions.  The classical molecular dynamics model to be used is based on proton-proton, neutron-neutron and proton-neutron potentials obtained by the Urbana/Champaign group, and it does not  have any adjustable parameters and does not need the addition of fragment-producing codes or fluctuations extraneous to the reaction.   The project will study the isoscaling dependence (relating nuclei with different neutron-proton ratios) of binding energies of ground-state nuclei (to obtain isospin extensions of the Weissacker mass formula with explicit functional dependence on isospin), the study of the isoscaling dependence of the EoS of infinite nuclear matter (to provide analytical expressions for the energy per particle with explicit dependences on density, temperature and isospin), the study of the isoscaling dependence of the EoS of excited nuclei (to obtain an effective nuclear EoS that could be used to extract experimental information from reactions), and it will investigate nuclear reactions to understand how to extract information about the EoS and its isospin dependence through studies of the neutron and proton flow during the reaction, isospin transport ratio, fractionation, double spectral ratios and isoscaling to assess the value of the isoscaling parameters as probes of the symmetry energy term of the EoS.  All computations will be linked to experimental data from Michigan State University, Texas A&amp;M University, and other accelerators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed activity will be to learn about the unexplored role of isospin in nuclear forces, to refine a computational model - which can be used to test other codes, and to guide experimentalists in designing their experiments in the new facilty under construction in Michigan. The project will be carried out at the University of Texas at El Paso with the participation of undergraduate students and in collaboration with Prof. Claudio Dorso of the University of Buenos Aires. An effort will be made to incorporate Hispanic students (both male and female) into this project.  The broader impact of the project is a benefit to nuclear physics, the recruitment of students to the growing physics area of rare isotopes, the support of nuclear physics as a research option at UTEP and in El Paso, the training of undergraduate students in research methodology, and the introduction of Hispanic students into physics research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[New experiments are producing nuclear systems with excess neutrons and this calls for an extension of our current knowledge of nuclear matter in the new dimension of isospin.  In this project we studied nuclear matter using molecular dynamics to understand the role of isospin on several properties.  The project helped us extend the equation of state of nuclear matter in the new dimension of isospin. In particular we extended the phase diagram of nuclear matter into the isospin dimension, obtained the T-Density-Isospin phase diagram and the isothermal spinodals. We found the limit of stability of nuclear matter for high netron to proton ratios.  We also obtained the dependence of the symmetry energy as a function of the density and -for the first time- of the temperature, and compare this finding with results from other static theories.     Likewise we found that at low temperatures an electron plasma modifies the structure expected in a cold nuclear system, such as that in the crust of neutron stars, but we concluded that the electron gas is not needed to have such structures.  We also made progress in calculating the diffusion coefficient in infinite nuclear systems.  The project used, for the first time molecular dynamics with a thermal reservoir to speed up calculations of infinte nuclear systems.   On the broader impact side, the project trained two UTEP undergraduate students (Enrique Ramirez-Homs and Rodolfo Gonzalez) in research methodology and nuclear theory, and exposed them to the scientific atmosphere of a national laboratory.  Furthemore, the project produced material for the dissertation of a PhD student from the University of Buenos Aires, P. Gimenez Molinelli.
