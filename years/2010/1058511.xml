<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merits: This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will address further development of findings from the Phase I Project addressing development of advanced biopesticides by simple and scalable modification of sophorolipids. The yeast Candida bombicola produces sophorolipids (SLs) in volumetric yields of ~ 300 g/L. The Phase I program demonstrated that by simple chemical modification of unrefined natural SLs, a series of five highly active lead compounds were identified which possess broad spectrum activity against all three major fungal groups that cause serious diseases in commercially important plants. By amidation of the SL fatty acid carboxyl group (e.g. - NH2CH2CH2N(CH3)2), or by reduction of the SL-fatty acid double bond, derivative activity against pathogens greatly increased. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of amide SL-derivatives were generally on a par with tested commercial fungicides.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts/Commercial Potential: The broader impacts of this research address the market pull for green agricultural products by developing a bio-pesticide produced via an efficient microbial fermentation followed by simple chemical modification to improve the performance of nature?s molecules. The goal is to create a superior bio-pesticide product that does not harm the environment, is safe for farmers that regularly handle these materials, and to provide safe food for consumers. SyntheZyme bio-pesticides will contribute to the on-going green food-production revolution. Their introduction into the market is expected to replace an increasing fraction of synthetic chemical pesticides during season-long disease control programs. Furthermore, new safe bio-pesticides are needed to replace chemical pesticides now banned due to tightened regulations and increased concerns about their pollution and health hazards.</AbstractNarration>

Plant pathogenic activities up to 50 times better than competitive products were demonstrated.   In addition to plant fungal pathogens, in vitro studies also showed that SyntheZymeÆs modified sophorolipid products have valuable inhibitory properties against bacterial plant pathogens such as Pseudomonas syringae, Xanthomonas campestris and Acidovorax carotovorum.  Results from in vitro evaluations were further tested using plant systems (in planta) that were purposely infected with a plant pathogen. Results thus far obtained are promising but work remains to be performed on a wider range of plant systems and fungal/bacterial plant pathogens. Further work on field trials will be continued in partnerships developed with potential product manufacturers.   Evaluation of the biodegradation and apparent toxicity of a series of modified sophorolipids was determined by a standard laboratory test method that simulates an environment that might be found in runoff water ecosystems. Products developed were found to meet the criteria of being "ultimately biodegradable." Furthermore, tests thus far give no indication of product toxicity.   A cost model developed by the project team showed that at commercial scale production levels, products developed in this progr...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
