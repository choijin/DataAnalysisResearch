<AbstractNarration>The International Workshop "Supersolidity 2011"  (to be held at the Graduate Center of City University of New York, June 7-10, 2011) is devoted to one  of the most exciting discoveries in solid state physics in the last decade -- possible long-sought supersolid state of matter in free space.&lt;br/&gt;The discovery has spawned an explosion of both experimental and theoretical studies clearly indicating that the quantum solid He4 is richer in new phenomena than ever imagined.&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will provide an exciting timely opportunity for the US and international community of scientists -- young and established --  to learn and exchange ideas on the latest developments around the world in order to unravel the enigma of supersolidity in solid He4 and other systems.&lt;br/&gt;Direct cross-communications create synergy in understanding the phenomena in a very efficient way and play a crucial role in resolving the main theoretical and experimental challenges in the field of supersolidity.&lt;br/&gt;As an essential part of the education and training in natural sciences, the support from the National Science Foundation will allow active participation of young US scientists in this exciting process.</AbstractNarration>
