<AbstractNarration>Legumes such as soybeans, alfalfa or peanuts have the unique ability to associate with soil bacteria named rhizobia.  This symbiosis leads to the formation of root nodules inside which the rhizobia transform air nitrogen into forms assimilable by the plant.  Every year, in the United States, this symbiosis saves around $4.5 billion in fertilizer costs and prevents ecological and health issues associated with the excessive use of chemical fertilizers.  The rhizobium-legume symbiosis presents a high level of species specificity which means that specific legumes only associate with specific rhizobia.  This specificity mechanism is mostly controlled by the structure of LCO (Lipo-Chito-Oligosaccharide) signals produced by the rhizobia and recognized by their host plants. LCOs also mediate associations with symbiotic fungi which occur in legumes but also in many other non-legume crops such as corn, wheat and cotton. LCOs are now used by farmers as plant growth promoters for legume and non-legume crops. Genetic analysis in plants allowed the identification of LCO receptors and proteins such as HMGR1 (3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaryl Coenzyme A Reductase 1) that interact with LCO receptors and are required for the establishment of symbiotic associations.  This project will lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms allowing legumes to recognize symbiotic LCOs and of the downstream pathways allowing LCO receptors and HMGR1 to mediate the development of root nodules with rhizobia and associations with symbiotic fungi.  In the short term, understanding these mechanisms can have a direct impact on yield improvement through a more efficient use of LCOs as plant growth promoters.  This knowledge will also help improve the establishment of plant-microbe associations, with especially high impact under suboptimal and stressful field conditions.  In the long term, engineering new symbiotic associations through these mechanisms may help improve the sustainability of our agriculture for food, feed and biofuel production.</AbstractNarration>
