<AbstractNarration>In this research the fusion of data from different sources will be used to describe an existing site. The fused data will be incorporated into a lightweight interactive design system that facilitates conceptual design. A method for making the transition from the output of the conceptual design phase to a full 3D model suitable for a CAD system used for construction documentation will also be developed.  The work will introduce new methods for gathering and fusing data at an appropriate level of detail for design, rather than following a more traditional approach of creating detailed models and simplifying them for use in an interactive system. The proposed work can have a direct impact on the creative design process by offering a novel approach for creating and editing 3D form. This work is interdisciplinary and brings together research from computer graphics and architecture, computer vision, cognitive science, psychology and design and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Computer-aided design systems have been extraordinarily successful in building design and construction, yet the existing array of computational aids do not offer assistance to in-situ design &ndash; that is, the design of structures relative to the surrounding environment. The design of architectural structures and other built forms (such as sculptures) in existing natural and manmade environments poses substantive and unique challenges. A system to support such design needs to be capable of incorporating constraints imposed by the existing setting, while allowing free creative experimentation.   In this research the fusion of data from different sources to describe an existing site was explored. The fused data was incorporated into a lightweight interactive design system that facilitates conceptual design. This work involved the following contributions:   The base system used as the starting point uses a site model derived from geographic elevation data, on-site point-to-point distance measurements, and images of the site. Existing data resources, multi-dimensional scaling techniques and refinements of recent bundle adjustment techniques for image sets were used to acquire and process the data. New methods to combine the data into a lightweight stroke-and-image billboard representation were also developed.         Using the base site description, an existing stroke-based design system was extended with alternative image-based modeling techniques to enable conceptual design. A variety of methods for creating 2.5D geometry from image operations were incorporated. A designer is then able to create full 3D representations by positioning the 2.5D geometries in the design space. Ultimately a design must be converted to a valid solid 3D representation to be built. In the system used in this research, the positioning of 2D strokes and partial geometries in 3D was integrated into a conceptual sketching system. The problem is then simplified from inferring 3D to converting stroke sets to solid forms. Methods for the integration of parametric solids, automatic free from surfaces, and user intervention were evaluated.   These components were examined in the context of a complete system for architectural design that moves from collecting data to documenting the site, to initial conceptual sketching and finally to solid models. The system was developed in the context of YaleÆs Computing and the Arts Initiative and was continuously evaluated as it was developed by close collaboration with architecture students using the system. There were three basic outcomes from this research: a) new methods for fusing data to describe outdoor sites, b) a novel system for architectural design that is qualitatively different from previous systems, and c) insights into design process that will lay the groundwork for future research.   Intellectual Merit: This work introduced new methods for gathering and fusing data at an appropriate level of detail for design, rather than following a brute force approach of creating detailed models and subsequently simplifying them for use in an interactive system. This investigation advanced our understanding of how humans conceive of and design geometric form, an activity that shapes most of the objects with which people live and work. This understanding includes not only a computer graphics perspective (algorithms and representations) but also an architectural perspective, where practitioners have a deep working knowledge of form creation but may lack a computational or mathematical background.  Broader Impacts: The work will likely have a direct impact on the creative design process by offering a novel approach for creating and editing 3D form, and could also impact the communication of ideas, where 2D representation has dominated. This work crosses disciplines, not only computer graphics and architecture, but other areas related to how humans think (computer vision, cognitive science, psychology) and build (indust...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
