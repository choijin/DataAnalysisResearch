<AbstractNarration>SES-1060891&lt;br/&gt;Paul Mohai&lt;br/&gt;University of Michigan Ann Arbor&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-1060882&lt;br/&gt;Manuel Pastor&lt;br/&gt;University of Southern California&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SES-1060904&lt;br/&gt;James Boyce&lt;br/&gt;Michael Ash&lt;br/&gt;University of Massachusetts-Amherst&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the past two decades there has been increasing interest in understanding the extent and causes of racial and socioeconomic inequalities in the distribution of environmental burdens. This interest has been spurred by a visible and growing environmental justice movement, by public concerns about the health and other quality of life consequences of pollution, and by increasing government attention to these issues. This study analyzes the geographic distribution of airborne industrial toxic pollution in the United States over time to address several questions: (i) Have rates of reduction in air pollution risk over time differed between low-income and predominantly minority communities and other communities? (ii) How does the interaction between income and race/ethnicity as correlates of exposure to point-source air toxics vary across regions and across industrial sectors? (iii) How does individual mobility affect racial and socioeconomic disparities in cumulative exposure: who moves, who stays, and do those who move relocate to more or less polluted localities? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study uses a unique dataset from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Risk Screening Environmental Indicators Geographic Microdata (RSEI-GM). The data offer a fine-grained picture of exposure to industrial toxic air releases identified by chemical and source facility for the entire U.S. for the years 1988-2007. The study will merge the RSEI-GM data with tract-level socioeconomic and demographic data from the 1990 and 2000 Censuses and the 2004-2009 pooled American Community Survey as well as individual-level data from the 1986-2001 Americans Changing Lives Survey. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will establish an infrastructure for the development, maintenance, and sharing of the complex RSEI-GM pollution-exposure database, spatially merging it with social, economic, demographic, and health data, and training graduate students in the management and use of the data. The project will make analytic results available in useful format to public and private decision-makers, including communities, regulators, shareholders, and other stakeholders.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Our project examined the geographic distribution of airborne industrial toxic pollution in the United States in relation to social, economic, and demographic characteristics of affected communities. The study used Risk Screening Environmental Indicators (RSEI), a unique new dataset from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that provides highly-detailed geographic data on exposure to industrial toxic air releases identified by chemical and by source facility. The RSEI data cover the entire United States and are available annually for 1988 through 2011. The study combined pollution data with  socioeconomic and demographic data on neighborhoods from the 2000 and 2010 Censuses and current data from the American Community Survey to examine the correlates and consequences of exposure.  With the RSEI and Census data, we have been able to identify the correlates of high pollution exposure and potential chronic human health risk by neighborhood across the cities of the United States. One remarkable finding from our study is that cities with a high disparity in toxic exposure between white and black neighborhoods have much higher overall levels of population exposure to toxics -- so much so that whites are more exposed to toxics in high-disparity cities than in low disparity cities.  An implication is that pollution exposure is not "zero sum," with lower exposure for one group only possible if another group is more highly exposed; a more equitable distribution of toxic exposure might mean less pollution for all. We also found that the relationship between race/ethnicity, income, and toxic exposure varies substantially across the regions of the U.S. Almost everywhere poor people are more exposed than are non-poor people, and usually but not always, nonwhites are more exposed than are non-Hispanic whites. The analysis can also give guidance to policymakers trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  While greenhouse gas emissions are a global problem, they are often accompanied by co-pollutants with local impacts. Policymakers need to take note of the local impact of co-pollutants when planning where to reduce (or increase) emissions.
