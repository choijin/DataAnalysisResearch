<AbstractNarration>Introduction&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to understand the transnational history of "Chinese-American scientists" including both those who returned to China (where many of them became leaders in the Chinese scientific, nuclear, and space programs), and those who stayed in the US (where they became scientific leaders and played crucial roles in US-China scientific exchanges). The focal point is the period that begins in 1949 with the Chinese Communist takeover of mainland China, which drove the ruling Nationalists to Taiwan. The event left about five thousand Chinese students and scholars, mostly in the sciences and engineering, "stranded" in the United States. Eventually about one thousand of them returned to China by the end of the 1950s while the rest stayed in the US, with profound but so far relatively unexplored impact on science in both countries and on Sino-American scientific interactions during the Cold War and beyond.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This study, which is based on archival research and oral history interviews, will serve to address key questions in the history of science such as: What were the extent and limits of the so-called "Americanization" of international science in the postwar period?  How was the Americanizing influence in turn connected with the transnationalization of the American scientific community itself, as exemplified by the presence of tens of thousands of Chinese American scientists and engineers?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;With the rise of China as an economic and scientific power, and with the emergence of global problems such as climate change that require the scientific collaboration between the US and China, it is more critical than ever to understand fully the making of the scientific enterprise in modern China.  Furthermore, as the US relies more and more on immigrant scientists, a systematic study of Chinese-American scientists will also help us better understand the American scientific enterprise and help inform the making of American national and international science policy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant project on "Chinese/American Scientists: Transnational Science during the Cold War and Beyond" sought to investigate the history of Chinese/American scientists, especially the experiences of about five thousands of Chinese students and scientists in the US at the time of the establishment of the PeopleÃ†s Republic of China in 1949.  About 1200 of these students/scientists returned to China in the 1950s (the "returnees") while most of the rest stayed in the US (the "stayees"), both groups playing influential roles in the making of transnational science in the US and China and in promoting US-China scientific exchanges and collaboration. The term "Chinese/American scientists" is used here to refer to both returnees and stayees.  The major goals of this project have been to better understand the history of these Chinese/American scientists and modern science in the US and China and to help improve science policy making in the form of articles, lectures, and eventually a scholarly book.  Research and work supported in part by this NSF grant have led to a considerable expansion of valuable research materials, including archival materials and oral history interviews with about three dozens of surviving members of Chinese American scientists from the 1949 generation in both the US and China, mostly in their 80s and 90s, an integration of research and teaching, a number of activities in public outreach and engagement related to Chinese American scientists and US-China scientific relations, especially to Asian American community groups, and the publication of some of the preliminary research findings related to the history of Chinese American scientists and US-China scientific relations in both English and Chinese in the forms of lectures, presentations, journal articles and book chapters.  As a result of this grant project, I believe that a fascinating story of Chinese American scientistsÃ† experiences and US-China scientific movements and connections during the Cold War and beyond has emerged, with rich details and with possibly far-reaching implications for our thinking about the transnational nature of science in the US, China, and much of the modern world.  I further believe that this project has helped to rescue an important part of our national and international scientific history and will do more as I and possibly other scholars and members of the public continue to utilize materials, information, and insights developed out of this grant project.  Specifically, magazine/journal articles and book chapters, published or in preparation, that have resulted in part from this grant project have included (in chronological order of dates of publication):  Zuoyue Wang, "Engineering a New Space: Chinese American Scientists and Engineers in Aerospace in Southern California," in Blue Sky Metropolis: Aerospace and Southern California, eds. Peter J. Westwick and William Deverell (Berkeley and Los  Angeles: University  of California Press, in press, forthcoming in 2011) (peer-reviewed).
