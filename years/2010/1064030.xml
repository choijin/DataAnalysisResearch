<AbstractNarration>Although diet is a major aspect of human paleobiology, anthropologists have comparatively little information about the diets of hominins that lived prior to the earliest known archeological record.  Furthermore, many of the tools used to infer diets of early hominins currently provide conflicting information, particularly regarding one of the otherwise best-known early hominin species, Australopithecus afarensis. This study aims to use the chemical composition of fossil teeth to isolate whether these hominins broadened their diet to include foods derived from savannas such as tropical grasses, sedges, and/or animals foods derived from these plants, which leave distinct chemical "signature" preserved in fossils. The implications of this dietary broadening are significant for understanding whether A. afarensis could have used such foods to survive in open savanna habitats giving them an advantage over other related primates during the spread of savannas in Africa during the past several million years. With NSF funding, the researchers will sample fossil tooth enamel from museum samples of A. afarensis and other fossil mammals found in the Hadar and Dikika areas in Ethiopia, and measure its chemical and isotopic composition to constrain the diets of A. afarensis and its surrounding ecological community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will involve international collaborations between US academic institutions and the National Museum of Ethiopia, which provides a venue for public outreach and education within Ethiopia and beyond. This work will provide graduate training for two graduate students and material for outreach through a local interpretive center. Project results will be supported on websites of the Institute of Human Origins and California Academy of Sciences, where scientific issues regarding ancient human life are interpreted for the public and primary through secondary educational communities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Changes in the types of foods available, sought after and consumed by our earliest ancestors may have been central to our evolution towards becoming human. This research set out to test several hypotheses of the diet of an early hominin species, Australopithecus afarensis, known best for the fossils "Lucy" and "Selam" from the Ethiopian Rift Valley.  Direct biogeochemical evidence of diet follows the principle that "you are what you eat" in that the composition of tissues presered in the fossil record preserve some aspects of the chemical composition of the foods consumed.  The research funded under this grant provided for direct analysis of the chemical composition of fossil teeth of members of this species and its surrounding cohort of mammalian fauna.  More specifically, the researchers measured carbon isotopes preserved in a selection of hominin teeth from Hadar and Dikika to test whether their diet included foods derived from C4-plants common in the savannas, and/or animals foods derived from these plants because these foods leave distinct chemical "signature" in the in fossil teeth. The results of this work showed that there was significant variability in the amount of C4-plants consumed, suggesting a high degree of dietary flexibility in the diet of Australopithecus afarensis three and a half million years ago. In addition, the results showed that Australopithecus afarensis was among the earliest of our ancestors to make this dietary shift towards C4-foods derived from the savanna.
