<AbstractNarration>This project explores using the hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of precipitation as a proxy for climate reconstructions from Chinese cave deposits.  The primary goal of the research is to develop proxies for monitoring seasonality in hydrologic cycles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The guiding research principle is that cave speleothem delta Oxygen-18 records the weighted annual average isotopic composition of precipitation making it to the cave whereas the delta Deuterium of leaf wax monitors the growing season (typically summer) isotopic composition of precipitation. The research plan is guided by the hypothesis that the delta Deuterium of leaf wax will have a phase response consistent with summer-monsoon records from India and East Asia and that the winter signal will have a phase consistent with the combined effects of northern hemisphere winter solar insolation minima and ice volume maxima.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary broader impacts involve support for an underrepresented minority student, collaboration among U.S. and Chinese scientists, and a scientific focus on water resource issues in a water-stressed region that carries important social benefits.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ EarthÃ†s climate changes at a variety of time sales, ranging from tectonic time scales (tens of millions of years) to abrupt time scales (decades).  This project was designed to better understand the mechanisms driving climate change in monsoon regions at intermediate-length time scales associated with changes in insolation (solar) forcing, greenhouse gas forcing and terrestrial ice volume forcing.  Here, climate changes at time scales of tens of thousands of years and ice-volume and greenhouse gasses behave quite similarly to one another but significantly differently compared to insolation forcing.  This intermediate-length time scale of climate change is important because the three major forcing factors listed above are very well known for the past million years.  Because of this, we can identify the relative sensitivity of climate change (the monsoon in this case) to these three forcing factors.  Graduate Student Elizabeth Thomas worked on this for her Ph.D. thesis.  She is now a new professor at the State University of New York, Buffalo.      We reconstructed changes in monsoon strength over southeast China for the past 300,000 years using the Hydrogen isotopic composition of leaf wax.  We then compared these results to the well-known changes in radiation forcing and ice volume (which varies similarly to changes in greenhouse gasses).  We found that change in the monsoonal climate of southeast China is strongly related to direct insolation forcing with lesser influences of changes in global ice volume and greenhouse gases.  This finding is different from that reconstructed for central China on the basis of speleothem (stalagmite) oxygen isotopes, which indicate that change in the monsoonal climate of central China is more sensitive to changes in ice-volume and greenhouse gases.  Thus, there are strong regional differences in how sensitive the monsoon is to these important climate drivers.  We are already engaged in additional research designed to see if our climate reconstruction using the geological record matches the results of climate simulations using mathematical models (climate models) of the type used to forecast future climate change.  If they are found to agree, we will have additional confidence that the future projections are correct.           Last Modified: 02/16/2015       Submitted by: Steven C Clemens]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
