<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-1007383&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Michael Wolf&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator will continue his research in two-dimensional geometric variational problems. In particular, he proposes projects in several areas of classical minimal surface theory, all concerned with using Teichmuller theory to prove existence or uniqueness or properties of minimal surfaces in Euclidean three-space. He proposes research in two areas of Teichmuller theory: Weil-Petersson geometry and grafting.  Both bring a Riemannian perspective to problems often studied via other methods. In addition, he proposes studying problems arising in convex projective structures on surfaces as well as work on degenerating harmonic quasi-isometries of the hyperbolic plane. These last are informed by his earlier work on high energy harmonic maps. In recent years, the PI has focused considerable attention upon education at all levels. He supervises graduate students; he coordinates a VIGRE program at Rice University encompassing roughly a dozen small research groups in the mathematical sciences whose vertical organization ranges from the undergraduate stratum through the graduate and postdoctoral level to the permanent faculty; he participates in one of these groups himself, he lectures to teachers and acts as a scientific advisor to programs to enhance the mathematical understanding of K-12 teachers.  He serves the broader mathematical community by serving on the editorial board of three journals, through organizing large and small conferences and through lectures to general audiences. He is quite involved with undergraduate advising. The PI will continue with all of these activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the guiding principles of science is that Nature is efficient: when we encounter natural phenomenon, we expect that the shapes we find will use the least material for their construction, or be the thinnest that can be made with a material or will span the largest region possible, or some other sort of optimization.  At the same time, a common geometric component of many natural systems is a two-dimensional surface, usually configured in some curved manner.  These surfaces occur at all scales, from the boundary of a protein to the surface of the brain to the frontier of the magnetosphere.  In this project, we investigate problems that relate aspects of the shapes of surfaces to quantities they might optimize, and also how deforming one feature of the shape of a surface affects other qualities of that surface.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PI Michael Wolf continued his work on the geometry of curved surfaces. He is interested in solving optimization problems on surfaces -- for example, trying to find ways of mapping shapes with least energy to other shapes or finding a surface in a shape which are, at small scales of measurement, of least area. He is also interested in using solutions of such optimization problems as probes to understand more about the geometry of these surfaces themselves.  Many of these problems rely on relating different flavors of modern geometry: familiar shapes from high school mathematics like polygons relate to algebraic objects like polynomials and also to solutions to systems of differential equations.  For example, together with his collaborator David Dumas, Wolf concluded a substantial project that related the space of polygons to the space of polynomials that arise when considering an unusual type of sphere (really a generalization of the well-known hyperboloid of two sheets); that sphere satisfies a collection of equations from calculus.  Another project, also with a collaborator, focused on the geometry of the space of all the different shapes a surface can have:  for example, one might imagine all the different shapes of pretzels one can have, decide on a good way of measuring distances between two such shapes, and then ask how curved is that space of pretzels.  Remarkably, that space of surfaces finds applications in many areas of contemporary mathematics and even theoretical physics, so understanding its basic geometry is a significant problem. Several more problems whose statements and solutions were quite different but where the style of relating different styles of geometry is common and where methods from solutions of optimization problems were used, were also solved, usually with a collaborator.  The PI is active with developing young professional mathematicians: he worked with three graduate students during this period and two postdocs, one at Rice University and one at another university.  The PI continued the pioneering of a program at Rice University that helps new science and engineering students, whose high school background leaves them at risk for leaving science and engineering majors, persist in those majors.  The problem of U.S. students of high potential becoming discouraged from pursuing undergraduate degrees in science and engineering because of the gap between what their high school prepared them for and what college expects is both of national concern and growing. We know we can have an effect for many students at Rice University through our methods; it is interesting to imagine extending this effect to other settings.
