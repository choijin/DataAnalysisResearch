<AbstractNarration>A common feature of many modern human-engineered systems, such as medical devices, automobiles and aerospace vehicles, is that they involve interaction between discrete software systems and continuous physical systems.  Several such systems are safety critical and failures can be catastrophic.  How to guarantee that these systems are designed and built correctly? Traditional approaches based on testing need to be supplemented with approaches based on formal methods.  Unfortunately, formal verification is an intractable problem in general and, hence, no single formal verification approach can uniformly perform well. This project develops a new approach for formal verification that complements existing approaches.  Having a suite of formal verification tools can help find errors earlier in the design cycle to reduce overall development cost and increase assurance of designed complex cyber-physical systems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project contributes to the existing formal verification technology by developing a new approach for formal verification, called bounded verification.  Bounded verification verifies a system by performing a bounded search for a witness that would establish the property.  Depending on the property, a witness is a Lyapunov function, an inductive invariant, a controlled invariant and so on.  Search for a witness is cast as satisfiability of a quantified (\exists\forall) formula.  Satisfiability is decided using a combination of techniques including counterexample guided inductive reasoning, compositional reasoning, simulations, and fixpoint computations.  Witnesses generated by bounded verification of the design are used to bootstrap formal verification of the implementation.  This project also extends the bounded verification approach to performing automated synthesis of systems.  Bounded verification explicitly provides witnesses for correctness, which can be used to aid in the certification process. This project also introduces new links for interaction between the fields of theorem proving and formal verification that aim to foster collaboration and promote progress in both areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Software is routinely interacting with the physical world via sensors and actuators to create complex cyber-physical systems.  These systems perform several safety-critical functions in our society today.  Formal verification and formal synthesis are the only approaches that can guarantee correctness of such systems and avoid catastrophic failures.   This project developed a new technique for formal verification and formal synthesis called bounded verification and bounded synthesis.  It makes the hard verification, respectively synthesis, problem feasible by bounding the verification or synthesis search space.  The key idea is reduction of the verification or synthesis problem to the search for a witness or certificate, which is encoded as a quantified (exists-forall) constraint.  Satisfiability for such constraints is decided using a combination of techniques including counterexample guided inductive reasoning, compositional reasoning, simulations, and fixpoint computations.   The project developed a theory of bounded verification and bounded synthesis.  This includes a set of foundational, and practically useful, deductive inference rules for verification of properties, such as  reachability, safety, stability, bounded stability and controllability, of discrete, continuous and hybrid systems.  The project also developed new checkers for exists-forall quantified constraint satisfiability.  A new formal verification tool, HybridSal relational abstracter, was developed and released.   This project applied the new verification and synthesis approach on a few different domains, ranging from synthesizing programs and switching controllers to verifying safety and stability of hybrid dynamical systems.  The results have invigorated interest in the field of formal synthesis and quantified constraint solving.  There is also an increased adoption of verification techniques beyond numerical simulation in industry.   The project also developed the safety envelope approach for securing a cyber-physical system, where monitoring techniques are used to ensure that the system remains inside a set of good states.  The bounded synthesis approach was used to synthesize imperative programs with loops, Byzantine fault-tolerant algorithm for interactive consistency, and a distributed self-stabilizing algorithm.  The project also developed a new nonlinear constraint solver, a new decidability result for verification of linear systems, and the time-aware relational abstraction technique for hybrid systems.
