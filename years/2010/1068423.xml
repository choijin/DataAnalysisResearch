<AbstractNarration>This grant provides support for the conference "Ramification in&lt;br/&gt;Algebra and Geometry" to be held at Emory University, 16-20 May 2011.&lt;br/&gt;This conference is primarily focused on the interaction between&lt;br/&gt;algebra, geometry, and number theory within the following thematic&lt;br/&gt;areas: the arithmetic of linear algebraic groups and homogeneous&lt;br/&gt;spaces, cohomological invariants, essential dimension, division&lt;br/&gt;algebras and the Brauer group, Chow groups and motivic decomposition,&lt;br/&gt;generic Galois extensions, and Brauer-Manin obstructions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference brings together international experts and junior&lt;br/&gt;researchers working in these areas.  The unifying theme is&lt;br/&gt;ramification.  The geometric notion of ramification is familiar to&lt;br/&gt;anyone who has seen a screw (helicoid): looking along the length of a&lt;br/&gt;screw, the central axis--where all the threads meet--is where the&lt;br/&gt;screw is "ramified."  Off the central axis, the screw is not ramified:&lt;br/&gt;a laser beam passing through the threads parallel to the central axis&lt;br/&gt;pierces only distinct sheets of metal.  Here, the ramification&lt;br/&gt;distinguishes a screw (helicoid) from a spring (helix).  Abstractions&lt;br/&gt;of this concept have proved fundamental in many areas of mathematics;&lt;br/&gt;this conference will focus on some of the recent applications in&lt;br/&gt;algebra and geometry.</AbstractNarration>

Some of the lectures were recorded and can be downloaded for free from iTunesU at   http://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/ramification-in-algebra-geometry/id443224115  In addition to showcasing new research by established experts, the conference also promoted talented graduate students by offering them the opportunity to give brief plenary lectures.  The conference also offered unique networking opportunities for young predoctoral and postdoctoral researchers to establish contacts with international experts and amongst themselves.
