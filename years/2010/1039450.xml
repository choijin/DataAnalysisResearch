<AbstractNarration>Technical. A Gordon conference on electrodeposition will be held August 1-6, 2010 at the Colby-Sawyer College in New London, New Hampshire with focus on cutting edge topics at the intersection of electrochemistry and materials science. The meeting will bring together materials scientists, electrochemists, solid-state physicists, and surface scientists to explore important scientific questions ranging from fundamental processes at solid/liquid interfaces through materials synthesis, processing, and characterization. There will be sessions on: atomic scale processes, nucleation and growth, nanostructures, synthesis of metals and semiconductors, semiconductor nanowires, thin film deposition, self-assembly and patterning, energy conversion and power generation.&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical. The conference will promote education and the pursuit of knowledge relevant to technologies and emerging applications such as energy conversion and power generation. The meeting will provide a unique forum, encouraging interactions and collaborations across all disciplines related to electrodeposition. In addition to formal lectures from established researchers, the conference will encourage and promote participation of students and researchers new to the field by including a session for contributed short talks with late-breaking news, three poster sessions, and a session dedicated specifically to early-career researchers. The meeting organizers will also strive to expand the participation of women, racial and ethnic minorities and other individuals who have traditionally been under-represented in this field. The meeting will foster professional and scientific development of students as well as international exchange among a wide range of scientists whose interests and capabilities span several disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;The conference is co-funded by the DMR Electronic and Photonic Materials, Metals and Metallic Nanostructures, and Solid State and Materials Chemistry Programs.</AbstractNarration>
