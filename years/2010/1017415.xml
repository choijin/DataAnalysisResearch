<AbstractNarration>Given  a  graph, such as a social/computer network, or the blogo-&lt;br/&gt;sphere, how will a virus (or rumor or new product)  propagate  in&lt;br/&gt;it?   Will  it take over, creating a pandemic?  How to select the&lt;br/&gt;'k' best nodes/edges for immunization, or, conversely,  the  best&lt;br/&gt;'k'  blogs  for the fastest dissemination of a new idea?  The an-&lt;br/&gt;swer to such questions is vital, for public health,  for  network&lt;br/&gt;security,  for  market  penetration, for blog monitoring and many&lt;br/&gt;more applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the PI's past work, they studied arbitrary graphs, and  showed&lt;br/&gt;that  propagation  depends  on a single number, namely, the first&lt;br/&gt;eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the network.  Specifically,&lt;br/&gt;they  studied  the  so-called  'epidemic  threshold' for flu-like&lt;br/&gt;propagation (``SIS'' model = susceptible-infectious-susceptible),&lt;br/&gt;on  un-directed, un-weighted static graphs.  All earlier work fo-&lt;br/&gt;cused on full cliques, or homogeneous graphs, or  specific  cases&lt;br/&gt;of  power-law  graphs  -  *all* of which are special cases of the&lt;br/&gt;PI's eigenvalue result.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The major thrusts of the current proposal are two. The  first  is&lt;br/&gt;*theory*: For a mumps-like model (``SIR'' = susceptible - infect-&lt;br/&gt;ed - recovered), and for additional models, when will a virus re-&lt;br/&gt;sult in a pandemic?  What can we say about weighted graphs? About&lt;br/&gt;time-evolving graphs, like an  ad-hoc  network  of  mobile  phone&lt;br/&gt;users?   The  second  thrust is on *algorithms*: Given a graph, a&lt;br/&gt;virus  model  (SIS,  SIR,  etc),  and  a  fixed  budget  of   'k'&lt;br/&gt;nodes/edges  to  immunize, how can we quickly find an  optimal or&lt;br/&gt;near-optimal solution, to best contain the  virus?   How  can  we&lt;br/&gt;modify  the algorithm, when the network changes over time?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TECHNICAL MERIT of the work is  that it is the first to focus&lt;br/&gt;on *arbitrary* graphs, thus including real  ones.   In  contrast,&lt;br/&gt;the  vast majority of past  analytical work makes unrealistic as-&lt;br/&gt;sumptions about the graph topology (cliques,  homogeneous  graphs&lt;br/&gt;etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The BROADER IMPACT is high, as dynamics of large-scale graphs ap-&lt;br/&gt;pear in numerous settings: cascades on blogs; product penetration&lt;br/&gt;and  viral marketing; rumor/information propagation; immunization&lt;br/&gt;policies; advertisement policies etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For  further  information  see  the  project   web   page:   URL:&lt;br/&gt;http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~christos/NSF-PROJECTS/Immunization/</AbstractNarration>
