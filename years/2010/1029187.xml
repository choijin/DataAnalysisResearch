<AbstractNarration>This award will provide partial support for the conference "Cool Stars 16," to be held in Seattle, Washington in August, 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This meeting will bring together students and professionals in the large community of stellar astronomy.  This biennial conference, one of the largest regularly-held topical meetings in astrophysics, concentrates on "cool" stars with temperatures less than that of the Sun.  The subject matter includes all aspects of the evolution of low-mass stars, including their formation and ultimate death.  The conference will also explores connections between stellar and solar research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Cambridge Workshops on Cool Stars, Stellar Systems and the Sun date back to 1981, when the first one was organized in Cambridge, Massachussetts to provide a forum for astronomers working on cool stars and the Sun to meet and discuss their overlappng research interests.  The Cool Stars workshops have since evolved into the premier meeting for cool star research, convening every two years, alternating between US and international locations.  The major scientific results in this field for the past two decades have been presented at Cool Stars meetings, including the detection of the first extrasolar planet (which is orbiting a cool star), and the detection of the first confirmed brown dwarf (also orbiting a cool star).  The 16th Cambridge workshop (Cool Stars 16) was held on the University of Washington campus in Seattle, Washington, USA during August 28 - September 2, 2010.  It was a great success, with nearly 350 attendees, a five day poster session, twelve splinter sessions, eighteen contributed talks and twelve invited talks.  The major science themes of the meeting covered standard cool stars topics, including formation and evolution, fundamental parameters, magnetic fields and activity, and two timely new topics: time domain (especially focussing on results from the new NASA Kepler mission) and galactic context (notably contributions from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey).  The splinter sessions concentrated on particular forefront research areas, ranging from extrasolar planets to chemical abundances and radii observed with interferometry, to new wide field surveys of young stars and brown dwarfs.  Solar astronomy was also well represented, with a special session on solar and stellar flares.  NSF support was particularly helpful in allowing many young scientists, primarily graduate students, to attend the meeting, present their research, and participate in the exciting discussions of new scientific results that took place.  The Scientific Organizing Committee took special care to ensure gender equity and representation from diverse populations among those who were supported.
