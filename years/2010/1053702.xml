<AbstractNarration>The past decade has proven that variational approaches to approximate Bayesian inference hold&lt;br/&gt;the key to pragmatic solutions to many signal processing problems previously thought to be fundamentally difficult. Important signal processing problems where the application of appropriate&lt;br/&gt;variational approximate Bayesian inference techniques led to significant breakthroughs include the decoding of capacity approaching codes for noisy channels, underdetermined speech source separation, and distributed estimation over networks. These applications provide evidence that variational inference techniques have revolutionized the state of the art in signal processing because of their ability to provide high performance estimates at reasonable complexity and communication (equivalently, energy consumption) costs. However, the tradeoff between their performance and required complexity and communication, the very phenomenon leading to their widespread and growing adoption, remains incompletely understood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The underlying thesis of this project is that entropy &amp; information geometry lies at the heart&lt;br/&gt;of the tradeo^ff between performance, complexity, and communication in variational inference based&lt;br/&gt;signal processing. The research being performed improves our understanding of entropy geometry,&lt;br/&gt;which primarily dictates the fundamental relationship between the performance of a collaborative&lt;br/&gt;estimation algorithm and its communication cost. This research also develops the information geometric relationship between a variational inference signal processing technique's performance and&lt;br/&gt;complexity. Together, these insights allow algorithms for robust speech processing and collaborative estimation over networks to be developed that provide optimal performance at a tunable complexity and communication cost. In addition to its benefits in each of these areas, the work has a synergistic aspect in that it contributes directly to the creation of an overall design science for&lt;br/&gt;efficient distributed variational inference signal processing algorithms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the past decade, variational inference-based signal processing algorithms have enabled technologies ranging from improved error control decoders in cell phones, to protocols where multiple sensor nodes interact over a network to estimate a common underlying phenomenon, to algorithms for cleaning and enhancing noisy human speech.  This six year CAREER project took a look at the role that the shape of joint uncertainty or entropy between different quantities plays in how well these algorithms can work, and how they can be improved using it.  While this high dimensional object capturing joint uncertainties is easy to define, and its shape plays a key role in determining limits for the best designs for these engineering problems, a proper description of its shape remains unknown for four or more unknown quantities.  Part of the work under the award was to provide new bounds, and techniques to generate them, for this shape.  Also, new architectures were proposed for speech enhancement and collaborative estimation, and the research conducted guides how future such systems, including distributed machine learning systems, may be built.     More broadly, the project has supported several societal objectives beyond conducting science and engineering research.  The projected broadened participating in computing research by supporting the Ph.D. studies of two women engineers and two underrepresented minority students.  The research conducted under the project has been also incorporated into courses at Drexel, enabling a larger audience to benefit from its results.  Undergraduates at Drexel were involved in the research through a research experience for undergraduates supplement.  Students involved in the project garnered knowledge and skills which has enabled them to be major contributors to the US economy, several of them filling the timely roles of data scientists.
