<AbstractNarration>1049458&lt;br/&gt;Weiss&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Partial support is requested for the 2011 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Cardiac Arrhythmia Mechanisms, to be held February 13-18, 2011 at Hotel Galvez, Galveston, Texas. This is the fifth Gordon Research Conference on Cardiac Arrhythmia Mechanisms. The meeting convenes biannually, with past meetings held in 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009. These meetings provide a venue for international scientific discourse on the mechanisms that underlie disturbances in cardiac rhythm and lethal arrhythmias, and the novel approaches to therapy and prevention.</AbstractNarration>
