<AbstractNarration>Identities, specifically opinion leadership, may play an important role in motivating risk information seeking and sharing about polarizing issues. This case study involves in-depth interviews with opinion leaders representing various perspectives on proposed natural gas drilling in New York State's Marcellus Shale. The work takes place in three upstate New York counties where gas drilling may occur. The focus is on how people negotiate a potentially complex information situation -- one that consists of myriad messages about risks to self, others, and the environment -- and on why people share information. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The findings have implications for professional communicators who work with topics that have potentially polarizing social or public policy implications, and for scientists whose work may become the center of a polarizing public debate. This research identifies appeals that encourage people to gather, act on, and share information about contentious issues such as natural gas drilling, with an eye toward engaging with a variety of messages in making an informed decision and with implications for public engagement and participation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Demand for energy sources that emit less greenhouse gases than coal, along with new technology, has spurred an increase in oil and gas development in "unconventional" formations such as shale rock. An important aspect of such development involves hydraulic fracturing. "Fracking," as the process is commonly known, uses a pressurized mixture of water, sand and chemicals to fracture the rock and allow oil and gas to flow more easily. Proponents contend that it will not only boost the economy but also provide more secure, domestic energy supplies and facilitate a transition from coal-based electricity generation. Opponents focus on potential adverse impacts to public health, the environment, and communities.  This project explored how people living in areas of the United States with potential unconventional natural gas development &ndash; specifically, upstate New York - become informed, and inform others, about potential environmental, economic, health, and social impacts. In particular, it focused on two areas:  People may encounter a variety of information about potential economic, health, social, and environmental impacts. How do they become informed and seek and share information about specific types of impacts over others?       How do people engage in such behavior over time as development progresses through different stages and different impacts emerge and gain attention?   From a theoretical angle, we argued that seeing oneself - and being seen by others - as an opinion leader can act as powerful motivator for becoming informed, looking for information, and sharing information about these impacts. People can see themselves/be seen as leaders for various reasons: by virtue of occupying particular "positions" in a community (such as an elected official); belonging to particular groups that are believed to have expertise on this issue (such as landowner coalitions who negotiate with energy companies on natural gas leases); and possessing traits such as being "in the know" about important community matters.  We conducted 36 in-depth interviews with opinion leaders in three upstate New York counties. We found that opinion leadership was tied to each of the aforementioned three domains (role, group, and personality). These domains were associated with specific impacts about which people perceived social and personal pressure to remain informed. Examples included potential water contamination; economic impacts related to job creation in communities; and effects on community infrastructure and general well-being. In many instances, moreover, interviewees wanted to remain as knowledgeable about as many impacts as possible. Over time, however, some felt that it was difficult to fulfill these expectations and saw themselves less as leaders.  From a theoretical perspective, this study provides insight into how opinion leadership can be tied to role, group, and personality-based domains: in short, people can see themselves - and be seen by others - as a leader for many reasons. It is important for communication scholars to understand these reasons so that they can develop more effective means of identifying leaders. From a practical perspective, moreover, this study suggests that opinion leaders have an important part to play in preparing communities for the potential impacts of oil/gas development, including encouraging people to become better informed about these issues and encourage them to participate in decision-making processes when such opportunities arise.
