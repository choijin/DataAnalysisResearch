<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A microscopic understanding of the mechanisms of charge trapping, transport, injection, and charge generation in organic semiconductors is presently lacking.   The development of organic circuits and solar cells could be greatly accelerated if a better basic understanding of these fundamental processes were available.  Improving our basic understanding of fundamental processes in organic semiconductor devices is challenging.  Nearly all organic semiconductor devices show significant device-to-device variation, and the most promising devices are often comprised of complex multicomponent blends.  To build up a microscopic picture of charge trapping and transport in organic semiconductors, we will study organic devices in situ using vacuum, variable-temperature electric force microscopy.  We will use light-enhanced electric force microscopy as a tool to spectroscopically identify impurities, study charge generation, and probe trapping mechanisms in a wide range of organic semiconductors.  In a second set of experiments, a high-compliance silicon microcantilever will be used to measure minute electric field gradient fluctuations near the surface of an organic semiconductor.   From these electric field fluctuations we propose to deduce (and image) the diffusion constant of charges beneath the cantilever tip.  We expect these microscopic studies will open up exciting possibilities for advancing our understanding of charge generation, transport, trapping, and injection in organic semiconductor materials and devices.   This project will train graduate students in the arts of advanced scanned probe microscopy and nanofabrication.  These students will broaden their training by working on collaborative projects with scientists at academic, federal, and industrial laboratories.  This work is funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order for our nation to obtain energy independence, we must be able to manufacture solar cells that can convert sunlight efficiently into electricity.  Many materials are being examined for use in solar cells, and none work as well as we need.  One promising class of materials is semiconducting polymers, plastics that have the remarkable property of being able to both absorb light and conduct electricity.  In order to get these materials to work well in solar cells, the materials need to absorb light, the absorbed light must be converted into an electrical current, and the current must be carried through the material and extracted into a wire.  These last two processes - the conversion of light to current and the transport of charge - are not well understood in these materials.  Without a better understanding of these processes, it is not clear how to manufacture improved solar cells from semiconducting polymers.  Characterizing these materials is challenging, because their properties show large variations across distances separated by only 10 billionths to 100 billionths of a meter - distances hundreds to thousands of atoms across.  To advance our understanding of semiconducting polymers, we will develop new kinds of microscopes that can take pictures of both moving and stationary charges at this length scale in working solar cells.  This work will promote the general welfare by training PhD and undergraduate students to do research in energy-related materials and nanotechnology.  This work will involve collaboration and knowledge sharing among multiple universities, government laboratories, and industrial laboratories.  This work is funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program of the U.S. National Science Foundation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   We employed the funding from this grant to develop new ways for studying plastics used to make solar cells and circuits. There is a worldwide effort underway to manufacture solar cells to convert light into electricity from carbon-based materials (plastics) instead of silicon. While silicon solar cells work fairly well, they absorb light poorly; carbon-based materials, on the other hand, can be made to absorb light very well. Carbon-based materials require less energy than does silicon to purify and process; this makes carbon-based materials excellent building blocks for constructing both low-cost portable circuits and solar cells. While carbon-based solar cells and circuits have been demonstrated by many groups, the resulting devices have many problems and we do not understand very well how they work.  With funding from this grant, we developed a new kind of microscope that allowed us to image electrically charged defects in an organic circuit; we used the microscope to show that a certain carbon-based circuit was breaking down because molecules in the circuit were undergoing chemical reactions.   We used the same microscope to directly observe the movement of charge created from light in a plastic solar cell; we studied a solar cell made from a blend of two special polymers and showed that the poor performance of the solar cell was the result of an intermixing of the polymers.  A second microscope was created that measures the motion of electrical charge in a film in a new way, by detecting and imaging the electrical noise created by the movement of the charges in the film. Using this microscope we made the discovery that the electrical noise from moving charges in carbon-based circuits was far smaller than expected.  The microscopes we developed have thus uncovered new information about the motion of electrical charges in carbon-based materials that can guide the creation of better carbon-based solar cells and circuits.  This research project enabled three undergraduate scientists and engineers to carry out laboratory research, helped educate and train multiple PhD-student collaborators, and supported the education and training of one PhD scientist hired by a solid-state lighting company.
