<AbstractNarration>The ecological effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill on coastal areas of the Gulf of Mexico will persist for decades.  Scientists need to quantify these effects in ways that will best allow for understanding and responding to this environmental catastrophe.  There are three key challenges for ecologists:  adequate sampling of the important species across coastal habitats as soon as possible, coordinating the scientific effort to monitor a broad range of habitats and species, and creating a large database to effectively use the collected scientific data.  This is a RAPID project that will expand an ongoing long-term study of vegetation on coastal dunes habitats, in order to monitor the effects of the oil spill in future years.  An original 11-year study of the vegetation on St. George Island, FL, provides critical baseline data on coastal plant communities.  The methods from this study will be replicated at four other sites along the west coast of Florida, across a gradient of exposure to the oil spill. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of this RAPID project, a workshop will be conducted to bring together ecologists investigating oil spill effects in coastal areas, with the goal of planning how the scientific community should respond to the oil spill.  In particular, this workshop will address how to coordinate the responses of the many scientists and agencies involved to obtain the best scientific data possible, as well as the creation of a single database for the use of scientists, associated agencies, and the public.  This workshop will have long-lasting effects for the coastal research associated with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, by creating guidelines for research and data collection.  The research on coastal dunes will provide hands-on field experience for a number of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as training in soil analyses, data processing, and some data analysis.  The fieldwork will also involve local chapters of the Florida Native Plant Society to help with the identification of plants in their area, help protect and census sites, and create local plant guides for each site.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The environmental effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010 remain largely unknown.  Two significant problems became evident during the initial event.  First, there was very little good baseline data about coastal and marine ecosystems in the Northern Gulf of Mexico.  Such baseline data is necessary to quantify any effects of the Deepwater oil spill.  Second, the initial response was disorganized.  Agencies and scientists were simply unprepared to respond efficiently to an environmental disaster of this magnitude.  This NSF funding was used to address both of these problems for coastal ecosystems that might be affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, using two activities.  First, a workshop was conducted in September 2010 to evaluate what baseline data was available for coastal habitats, what data could still be obtained before the oil spread too far, and what methods should be used to maximize the value of this data.  The workshop involved 25 ecologists who work on coastal environments, from saltmarshes and barrier island dunes to saltmarshes and oyster bars.  The workshop was especially valuable for exchanging information about methods and database use that will maximize the value of data for years to come.  Second, some funds were also used to initiate permanent plots to census vegetation on barrier islands across the Northern Gulf of Mexico.  Barrier Islands are the dominant coastal habitat in the Gulf, occurring on some 70% of the shorelines.  Plots had already been established by T. Miller on St. George Island in northern Florida and have been censused annual since 1999.  Using the experience from this ongoing study, similar plots were then set up at seven sites, each separated by approximately 100 miles, from Louisiana to south Florida.  Most of these sites have been censused each year since the oil spill.   The initial work funded by this grant was able to document the amount of oil found across different dune habitats, as well as the vegetation patterns at each site.  Significant amounts of oil were found in the sands at several sites, especially in the area immediately behind the foredunes.  No immediate effects of oil on the vegetation were found at any site, although it is very difficult to evaluate such effects without pre-spill baseline data.  This data does provide "near-baseline" information, which will be invaluable for accessing long-term effects of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  The project did help to educate a number of established scientists about a broader set of methods for collecting ecoystem data and for data management.  It also contributed to the education of about ten graduate students who attended all or parts of the conference.  The field portion of the study involved several graduate students and undergraduates, all of whom learned basic methods in plant ecology and information about coastal ecology.  The work should lead to better planning for the scientific response of scientists to future environmental disasters.
