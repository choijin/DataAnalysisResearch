<AbstractNarration>The project is making scholarships available to academically talented low-income students pursuing degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Qualified students are eligible to receive scholarships for two years of academic study at the college and a transfer scholarship upon transferring to a four-year university in a STEM field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is achieving the following objectives: &lt;br/&gt;1. Providing scholarships to at least 58 academically talented, financially disadvantaged STEM students, including those from underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;2. Providing academic support to scholarship recipients so that at least 80% persist to transfer with a grade point average of 3.0 or higher. &lt;br/&gt;3. Providing counseling support to scholarship recipients so that at least 80% complete transfer requirements, apply, and are accepted as transfer students to a four-year institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The project is increasing the academic success of students through financial support, enhancement of student engagement with faculty, and exposure to their chosen field. It is strongly supported by the statewide Mathematics Engineering Science Achievement (MESA) program and by the college through the Divisions of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Financial Aid, the President, and the Board of Trustees. STEM faculty act as mentors for scholarship recipients to help optimize their educational experience, refine their interests, and assist them with socialization into a disciplinary culture. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The project is increasing the enrollment of students from traditionally underrepresented groups in the STEM fields at the college. It is also improving their retention and success and increasing the number of students who transfer to four-year universities as STEM majors. Strategies include the promotion of self-efficacy in students, independent learning, and early exposure to research and disciplinary culture. Obtaining a degree in a STEM field prepares students for rewarding high-wage employment in areas of local and national need benefiting both individual students, and local and national economy. Best practices and lessons learned are being documented and shared with other institutions.</AbstractNarration>

More than10 students presented their research findings at conferences and research symposiums.  In addition, 22 students participated in Leadership Retreats, and 90 students participated in field trips to universities and industry sites.  Students participated in workshops including writing a personal statement, resume writing, time management, internship/research application, university application, and presentations including speakers from industry and universities.
