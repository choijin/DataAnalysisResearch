<AbstractNarration>This award is funded under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5). One of the most outstanding questions in astronomy and astrophysics addresses the origin and evolution of the cosmic accelerators that produce the highest energy (UHE) cosmic rays. This question may be best addressed through the observation of UHE cosmogenic neutrinos that travel from their source undeflected by galactic and interstellar magnetic fields and unimpeded by interactions with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. However, uncertainties in the predicted cosmogenic neutrino fluxes make it difficult to design an array with sufficient sensitivity to collect a statistically meaningful sample of events. At very high energies (above 10^15 eV), neutrinos could be most efficiently detected in dense, radio frequency (RF) transparent media via the Askaryan effect. The abundant cold ice covering the Antarctic, with its exceptional RF clarity, has been hosting several pioneering efforts to develop this RF approach. From the expertise gained in these experiments and utilizing the infrastructure developed by the U.S. Antarctic Program, it is proposed to develop radio-listening equipment that can constitute the Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) and install it in the ice near the geographical South Pole. The primary goal of the ARA array will be establishing the absolute cosmogenic neutrino flux through the modest number of events. As the proposed radio antennae are deployed in ice holes extending below the firn layer to 200-m depth, they will have the ability to distinguish surface noise from sources originating deep in the ice cap (otherwise not possible in balloon-borne experiments). The ARA will have sufficient sensitivity to establish the presence or absence of the secondary UHE neutrinos produced by the interaction of cosmic rays with CMB. Such an observatory would also provide a unique probe of long-baseline high-energy neutrino interactions unattainable with any manmade neutrino beam. The adopted clustered geometry of the array (in which a single localized cluster may act as a standalone array) would allow trading the precise angular resolution for the increased event rates. The flux measurement and experience gained in operating the limited number of stations would frame the performance requirements needed to expand the array in the future to measure a larger number of neutrinos with greater angular precision in order to study their spectrum and origins. The project will continue contributing significantly to the training of the next generation of scientists by integrating graduate and undergraduate education with the technology and instrumentation development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Just over 100 years ago, Victor Hess discovered cosmic rays in a  series of hot air ballon flights during which he took readings of  radiation levels and inferred that the Earth was being constantly  bombarded with radiation from space.  In the century since, the spectrum  of cosmic rays, which extends to energies in excess of a professional  baseball pitch, has been measured, but the source of the cosmic rays  remains a mystery.  In addition, the exact composition of cosmic rays,  believed to be a mix of protons and ions of heavy elements such as iron,  is uncertain.  In the 1960's, it was realized that th highest energy  protons could interact with the cosmic microwave background, which  should lead to a decrease in the number of protons observed at Earth, if  the radiation was coming from large distances (outside the "GZK  radius").  Such a decrease was observed recently by the latest  generation of cosmic ray telescopes, but questions remain.  Is the  decrease in the cosmic ray flux due to these interactions, or are the  cosmic accelerators simply "running out of steam"?     One  byproduct of both cosmic ray acceleration and their interactions on the  cosmic microwave background is neutrinos, nearly massless fundamental  particles with a tiny mass, and no electric charge.  Due to these  properties, neutrinos travel in straight lines from their source without  the deflections that charged particles suffer, and can travel through  matter nearly unimpeded.  They could provide "X-ray vision" for the  universe, and perhaps reveal the source of the cosmic rays, and also  shed light on their composition.  However, the very properties that make  them an ideal messenger also make them extremely difficult to detect,  since particles are detected through their interactions in matter.   The  Askaryan Radio Array will be a telescope design to detect the highest  energy neutrinos.  These neutrinos are byproducts of the interaction of  the highest energy cosmic rays.  There are substantial challenges in  building such a telescope.  Because the number of neutrinos at high  energies is small, and only a small fraction of them can be captured and  detected, the telescope must be very large, on the order of 100 square  kilometers, in order to obtain even a small sample for study.  One  technology that may be feasibly monitor such a large area at a  reasonable cost is based on the detection of radio frequency emissions  from neutrino interactions in cold ice.  In order to be detected, a  neutrino must first interact, thus a large "target volume" of dense  material is required.  The highest energy neutrinos interactions are  expected to produce a characteristic radio frquency pulse once they do  interact.  If this interaction occurs in a radio transparent target  volume, this emission can be detected from some distance away.  Cold ice  is very RF transparent, and the Antarctic ice cap is nearly 3  kilometers thick in the region near the South Pole, making the ice the  South Polar ice the ideal target medium on which to build such a  telescope.  This MRI was granted for the purpose of prototyping  equipment for such a telescope, and installing and operating a small  portion of a future telescope array.  This was a huge techical  challenge.  First, it was necessary to develop a drill which employs hot  water to drill 200 meters through the snow layer, and into the deeper  ice where antennas would be installed.  This drill had to be portable  enough to deploy over the entire 100 square kilometer site.  The  antennas had to be sensitive to a broad spectrum of frequencies, and  caliration devices had to be capapble of producing a broadband pulse.   In order to track the path of neutrinos through the ice (and thus  reconstruct their direction and infer their origin), precision data  acquisition timing calibration was required.  Antennas are clustered  into group which are each served by a central GPS clock, an atomic  clock, and digitizing electron...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
