<AbstractNarration>Dr. Gaudi will help usher in the next phase of exoplanet science by constructing statistically robust samples of exoplanet demographics spanning a broad range of planet and host-star properties, which can then be used to test predictive theories of planet formation.  His strategy to accomplish this will be to employ several detection methods, leverage existing surveys by quantifying their detection efficiencies, develop strategies for increasing the sample sizes of next-generation surveys, and synthesize results from different methods.  Specifically, he will (1) use current microlensing surveys to constrain the demographics of planets beyond the snow line, and develop analysis software enabling such constraints to be derived from next-generation surveys, (2) assess the prospects for determining the demographics of giant planets in the short-to-intermediate period range using high-multiplexed radial velocity surveys, (3) construct simulations of all-sky space surveys for transiting exoplanets, and use these to optimize survey strategies and so maximize their yield, and (4) synthesize results from all methods to paint a broad picture of exoplanet demographics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To complement these research goals, Dr. Gaudi will engage in a number of outreach and educational activities designed to interest and educate gifted students in careers in science, and provide an academic outlet for two relatively overlooked, disadvantaged, and stigmatized minority groups.  Specifically, he will (1) create and teach several week-long courses in exoplanet detection to students at the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy (IMSA), a public high school for gifted students, and mentor students from these courses who are interested in careers in astronomy, and (2) give public talks on exoplanets and organize star parties for kids associated with the Kaleidoscope Youth Center in Columbus (a safe haven for LGBTQ youth), and kids at Camp Sunrise (a summer camp for children affected by HIV/AIDS).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project outcomes report summarizes the goals and findings CAREER Award 1056524: "The Demographic of Exoplanets."  The general goal of this grant was to usher in the next phase of exoplanet science by constructing statistically robust samples of exoplanet demographics spanning a broad range of planet and host-star properties, employing and developing a diversity of surveys and detection  techniques.   The general goal of the public outreach was to interest and educate gifted students and GLBTQ and HIV-impacted youth in science through engagement in astronomy-related activities, to raise awareness of GLBTQ equality issues within the astronomy community, as well as to mentor and train undegraduates, graduates, and postdocs, and to  engage in public outreach activities.  The primary activities in this grant were concentrated in three areas, each of which either directly address the specific goals of the project listed above, or address the general overarching goal of the grant.  (1) KELT Transit Survey  The Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope transit survey was designed to detect giant, short-period transiting planets orbiting the brightest stars that are not readily accessible to radial velocity surveys.  The KELT survey, which was heavily subsidized by this grant, published the discovery of 20 transiting planet systems over the course of this grant.  It is currently the third most productive ground-based transit survey.  It has discovered the two brightest hosts of a transiting hot Jupiter, one of which is the hottest known transiting hot Jupiter (the discovery of which was published in Nature).  It has also brought the attention of the community to the importances of looking for transiting planets around hot stars.  (2) Synthesizing Results from Exoplanet Surveys  Synthesize results from microlensing, radial velocity, transit, and direct imaging surveys to provide a consistent model of  the population of planets orbiting M dwarfs. Over the course of four papers, OSU graduate student Christian Clanton developed the methodogy to synthesize the demographic results from microlensing, transit, direct imaging, and microlensing surveys, ultimately determining the demographics of planets orbiting M dwarfs over four orders of magnitude in mass and five orders of mangnitude in period.  Christian Clanton's thesis laid the theoretical framework for synthesizing the demographics from multiple surveys.  (3) Development of Exoplanet Detection Techniques, Surveys, and Software  Develop the radial velocity technique to improve its precision and accuracy, write pedagogical reviews of exoplanet detection methods, simlute future surveys for exoplanets in order to optimize their yield, and develop publically-avliable software for the analysis of transiting planet systems.   The Exofast analysis software package, written by OSU graduate student Jason Eastman, was made public and has not been used by dozens of people to analysis transiting planets.   With the support of this grant, I was the lead author or a coauthor on four reviews of various exoplanet methods.  Finally, several papers were written by OSU graduate students supported by this grant that developed exoplanet detection techniques.  A total of 56 refereed publications were published as a result of the work outlined in and supported by this grant.  (4) Mentoring and Outreach Activities  Six OSU graduate students (Thomas Beatty, Christian Clanton, Carl Coker, Calen Henderson, Daniel Stevens, and Steven Villanueva) were either partially funded by this grant, or participated in the activities and outcomes described above.  All went on to astronomy postdoctoral positions (or will soon), with five out of the six receiving independent prize fellowships.  OSU undergraduate Jacob Luhn was supported partially by this grant for a summer project and senior thesis, which resulted in a refereed paper.  He is now a graduate student in astronomy at Penn State.  The PI worked with organizers and camp counselors of Camp Sunrise, a camp for HIV positive youth, to develop activities for the attendees of that   camp.  With the assistance of three OSU graduate students, the PI presented several astronomy demonstrations, including a scale model solar system demonstration, a demonstration of cratering, and a demonstration of a "home made" comet.    With OSU graduate student Calen Henderson, the PI participated in  the American Astronomical Society (AAS) Working Group on LGBTIQ Equality (WGLE). The charter for WGLE is to "promote equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, and questioning (LGBTIQ) individuals within our profession."  To this end, the PI participated in a panel at an AAS meeting in Anchorage where we discussed the status of LGBTIQ at traditional places of employment for astronomers (universities, labs, etc).  I was specifically tasked to review the status for large universities.  To this end, Calen and I gathered statistics on various equality metrics (non-discrimination policies relating to LGBTIQ persons, domestic partner health care benefits, etc).
