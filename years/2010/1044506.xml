<AbstractNarration>This project will support efforts to plan, conduct and evaluate outcomes for a three-day symposium, WEBS: Women Evolving Biological Science, aimed at issues related to the transition of women from early career stages to tenure track positions and leadership roles in academic and research settings.  WEBS targets early career women in the Biological Sciences with a focus on women who have earned their doctoral degrees within the past two to eight years and who do not have tenure.  WEBS participants will be current post-docs, research scientists and assistant professors who face the critical transition period from graduate studies to permanent research and teaching positions.  WEBS includes a component of research and evaluation that addresses what challenges early career women in biological sciences face, how these can be addressed, and how can effective professional development experience be delivered to early career women in the biological sciences in order to improve attrition at this stage.  This symposium represents a new partnership with the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent), an NSF-funded research center that provides a working environment for fertile interactions among scientists.  This partnership with NESCent will create opportunities to foster professional development as well as research collaborations among both junior and senior female scientists in the disciplines of ecology and evolution.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of WEBS is to significantly increase the retention and promotion of women, including women from underrepresented groups, in the biological sciences to create greater diversity in academic and scientific leadership.  Retention of women is critical for fostering diversity and innovation in research and teaching institutions.  Equal representation of women in leadership roles in academic settings will positively influence all aspects of the university community. This symposium targets future leaders and equips them with the information and resources needed to successfully navigate the tenure track and have thriving careers and personal lives.</AbstractNarration>

During the transition from graduate student and postdoctoral scholar, a worrying number of women leave academic research &ndash; many more than their male counterparts.

This attrition represents a waste of talent, a waste of resources invested in training and inequalities in careers prospects and success related to gender.     Women Evolving Biological Sciences (WEBS) is a four-day symposium aimed at addressing the retention of female biologists and issues related to the transition of women from early career stages to tenure track positions and leadership roles in academic and research settings. WEBS explicitly addresses the factors impacting the success of women in academia and scientific careers with the goal of equipping early career women with tools and a network to inform and support their career progression and decisions.

WEBS equips participants with the information and resources needed to successfully navigate the tenure track and have thriving careers and personal lives. Through a series of panel discussions and workshops, WEBS provides the following:  * Concrete skills and take-home tips for addressing a range of issues from navigating the tenure track, designing a research program and managing time to establishing and maintaining successful mentoring relationships and balancing career progression and life responsibility;  * Opportunities to build a peer network and potential mentoring relationships with senior scientists;  * Exposure to the range of potential paths and success stories of women in the biological sciences.     These early career female biologists are empowered to identify areas where they need help and seek out resources to address them and are enabled to navigate a career path the most suitable for their career and life satisfaction. To date, four WEBS symposia have been held with NSF funding.  WEBS 2013 was held in partnership with the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center (NESCent).  NESCent is committed to cross-disciplinary research in evolution and catalyzes and facilitates such research through a suite of programs ranging from its Science and Synthesis Program to its Education and Outreach Group.  An important aspect of all these programs is the support of research and education across disciplinary, geography and demographic boundaries, including outreach to groups who are underrepresented in evolutionary biology.  NESCent is particularly interested in supporting the professional development of women in science.     The WEBS-NESCent partnership, in particular, was a great success.  Participants reported that "WEBS exceeded [my] expectations across the board&hellip;.[and they came away with] great information tips, development of relationships, and resources to move forward with."  In particular, WEBS participants benefited by expanding their professional network to include opportunities afforded by NESCent and by interacting with NESCent postdoctoral fellows.  In addition, NESCent postdoctoral fellows had the opportunity to network with WEBS...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
