<AbstractNarration>The behavior of a communications network depends on the configuration&lt;br/&gt;of hundreds to thousands of switches, routers, firewalls, and other&lt;br/&gt;devices.  For example, a campus network may have as many as 2,000&lt;br/&gt;inter-operating network devices and about one million lines of&lt;br/&gt;configuration; whether the network operates correctly depends for the&lt;br/&gt;most part on the configuration of these devices.  Human configuration&lt;br/&gt;errors are the single biggest contributor to network downtime. This&lt;br/&gt;project seeks to develop techniques to make networks easier to manage&lt;br/&gt;by improving both configuration testing and synthesis. Testing takes&lt;br/&gt;as input an existing network configuration and determines whether the&lt;br/&gt;configuration is operating correctly.  Synthesis generates&lt;br/&gt;configurations automatically.  The project draws on two testing&lt;br/&gt;techniques to make network configurations easier to test: differential&lt;br/&gt;testing and dynamic testing.  Differential testing generates test&lt;br/&gt;cases to characterize the run-time behavior of two different programs;&lt;br/&gt;analyzing differences in network-wide configurations can help testing&lt;br/&gt;by allowing test cases to focus on the smaller subset of&lt;br/&gt;configurations that change more frequently.  Differential analysis may&lt;br/&gt;make testing more tractable by reducing the amount of configuration to&lt;br/&gt;test.  Dynamic testing checks the correctness of a program by&lt;br/&gt;executing it; this execution can be performed in a parallel "shadow"&lt;br/&gt;network, for example.  The expected results from this project include&lt;br/&gt;tools for network operators to test and automatically generate&lt;br/&gt;network-wide configurations for both enterprise and ISP networks.  The&lt;br/&gt;tools will also be useful in graduate-level courses.</AbstractNarration>
