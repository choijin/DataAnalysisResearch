<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will re-engineer an environmentally troublesome waste material, end of life rubber tires, into value-added, sustainable raw materials for the plastics market.  Previous work with composites containing ground tire rubber (GTR), manufactured using ambient or cryogenic processing, has yielded limited success.  In this project we will use cryogenically-ground GTR to create extruded recycled polypropylene (r-PP) composites.  Our preliminary results indicate that cryogenic GTR has a higher percentage of small particles than commercially-available ambient GTR at the same mesh size.  Smaller particles provide more boundaries for impact energy dissipation and larger surface area to interact with the polymer matrix.  Using this raw material, and building on knowledge of the differences in surface area and chemistry for the two types of particles, we will successfully demonstrate high-performance composite material samples.  A successful outcome of this work will enable improved formulations and processing methods, resulting in superior mechanical performance of composites.  This performance will be verified by laboratory tests in Phase I, leading to a Phase II effort focused on scale-up and commercialization of this process in conjunction with strategic partners. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to enable the use of recycled rubber powders derived from end of life tires in a value-added product for the plastics market.  This will increase the market potential and profitability of this recycling process and expand the range of available options for dealing with the significant environmental issue of approximately 300 million used tires generated per year nationwide.  The commercial opportunity is estimated to be $0.3 - 1 billion and is spread across the construction, automotive and consumer markets.  Clear and significant societal benefits would also result from the transformation of a problematic environmental waste into a versatile and sustainable raw material.</AbstractNarration>

Lehigh Technologies Inc.'s PolyDyneTM cryogenically ground rubber particles are unique in their small size (50-400 micron), high quality (free from fiber and metal) and available in industrial quantities. Previous work with composites containing ambient ground or cryo-ground tire rubber (GTR) yielded limited knowledge of the differences in surface area and chemistry that result between the products of the two GTR processes (ambient vs. cryogenic) and the effects this may have in extruded recycled polypropylene (r-PP) composites.  This grant supported the fundamental research and development work needed to understand how to use PolyDyneTM engineered rubber powders, derived from end of life tires, in r-PP, hence increasing the available, higher-value options for dealing with the significant environmental issue of approximately 300MM used tires generated per year in the USA.  Lehigh Technologies engaged Georgia Institute of Technology, Center for Polymer Processing, with its director, Professor Jonathan Colton, as a subcontractor in this work, expanding Lehigh TechnologiesÆ interaction with GA Tech  and creates the potential for larger scope long-term research between Lehigh Technologies and the Institute.  The proposal provided job opportunities for high-end R&amp;D technical positions at Lehigh Technologies which has over 40% minority representation in their technical and engineering staff.  GA Tech is a leader among US universities in graduating minority engineers.  This proposal represents the opportunity to fund fundamental research instrumental to the industrial utilization of a problematic environmental waste issue and as a result encourage the use of a new, sustainable raw material.  The Phase One objectives were:  A. To understand the effects of surface area of cryogenic-Ground Tire Rubber (GTR) on processing and mechanical properties of the recycled polypropylene (r-PP) composites and compare it to ambient GTR/r-PP composites.  B. To develop GTR/r-PP composites with improved processability and enhanced/target mechanical properties for engineering plastics applications.  Conclusions of Stage I   The Phase I objectives have been met.  We now have a clear understanding of GTR particle size effect when used in various thermoplastic polypropylene systems; property improvement with reduced particle size has been demonstrated. The following specific conclusions are drawn regarding the effect of GTR characteristics on properties of PP/GTR composites  -       The chemical constituents and their percentages were about the same in cryo and ambient powders except Cr300. It consisted about 6 % more ash owing to additional process aid in the RoTap process.  -       The particle size distribution of Amb400 particles was much coarser than cryo400. The smaller particles had significant amount of fines relative to their nominal sizes. It resulted in higher surface area of cryo particles than ambient for same nominal size. The surface area increased by two orders of magnitude from Cr400 to Cr50 particles.  -       Low resolution XPS showed that all the ambient and cryo-grind particles have same chemical constituents and about the same composition. Sulphur was not detected on the surface. High resolution spectra of Cr400 indicated presence of C-O bonds on the surface.  -       The morphology of Cr400 particles showed consistently smooth particles. Amb400 consisted of a combination of smooth and rough particles. However the overall surface area of cryo-grind particles was higher than am...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
