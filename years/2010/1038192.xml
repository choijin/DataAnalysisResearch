<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The I3 Berkeley Science Connections Program (I3BSC) will build bridges from the undergraduate&lt;br/&gt;to graduate levels for traditionally underrepresented (UR) students.&lt;br/&gt;I3BSC focuses on the mathematical and physical sciences (MPS) in an effort to open the door for&lt;br/&gt;students from diverse backgrounds to key fields of modern science, in which underrepresentation&lt;br/&gt;of both ethnic minorities and women of all ethnicities is long-standing and remains severe. New&lt;br/&gt;bridges to and into the beginning years of graduate training will be built on research experiences&lt;br/&gt;of increasing intensity for undergraduates and incoming graduate students. The research activities&lt;br/&gt;will be fortified with systematic access to structured academic enrichment and professional&lt;br/&gt;development opportunities and resources, as well as a network of peers, near peers and scientists&lt;br/&gt;who are further advanced on the academic pathway and will serve as mentors.&lt;br/&gt;I3BSC targets the transition into graduate school for undergraduates in their junior and senior&lt;br/&gt;years and through the first two years of doctoral study. It focuses on the advancement of students&lt;br/&gt;into MPS careers, particularly academic careers, incorporating and also going beyond the goals of&lt;br/&gt;retention in science majors and completion of degrees.&lt;br/&gt;I3BSC?s approaches lend themselves to study and evaluation. We will examine if and how the&lt;br/&gt;variety and frequency of interventions effects UR advancement in science and the influence of&lt;br/&gt;particular interventions. For example, the mentoring aspect of the project will provide a unique&lt;br/&gt;window into learning how mentoring affects not only the mentee, but also the mentor. While&lt;br/&gt;there is a growing set of literature around instructional beliefs and practices within the classroom&lt;br/&gt;there is little published about this more informal aspect of academic life.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;I3BSC is designed to take the highly effective work of four separate NSF programs that now work&lt;br/&gt;independently from each other at Berkeley, each operating with different MPS disciplinary foci&lt;br/&gt;and targeting different points on the educational pathway. I3BSC extends each of the four&lt;br/&gt;approaches to make them more uniformly and consistently available for all UR students at UC&lt;br/&gt;Berkeley who are majoring in any of the MPS departments at Berkeley or are entering any of our&lt;br/&gt;MPS doctoral programs.&lt;br/&gt;I3BSC will create new synergies that extend the work of these four key NSF-supported programs:&lt;br/&gt;Berkeley?s NSF-California Alliance for Minority Participation Program (CAMP), which supports&lt;br/&gt;students across STEM fields in undergraduate research experiences, community building and&lt;br/&gt;professional development; Berkeley?s NSF-AGEP program, The Berkeley Edge, which increases&lt;br/&gt;URM doctoral degree production, and advances PhD students and post-doctoral fellows to&lt;br/&gt;professorial careers; a NSF-supported program for mentoring lower-division students in Physics,&lt;br/&gt;the Compass and Society for Women in the Physical Sciences joint mentoring program; The&lt;br/&gt;NSF-Explorations in Statistics Research Program, which is an intensive week-long program for&lt;br/&gt;undergraduates to explore cutting edge research in Statistics. We will include students from all&lt;br/&gt;groups that add diversity under the post-Proposition 209 definition (URMs, women, students with&lt;br/&gt;disabilities, first-generation to college), because these groups are severely underrepresented in the&lt;br/&gt;mathematical and physical sciences, with a primary focus and priority given to those Berkeley&lt;br/&gt;students who are eligible for participation in CAMP, Compass-SWPS-PURNA, and AGEP.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Overview The I3 Berkeley Science Connections Program was designed to introduce students to the world of research and to prepare them for mathematical and physical sciences (MPS) doctoral programs through increasingly intensive research opportunities and professional development. I3 Berkeley Science Connections activities were offered to undergraduates and first year graduate students to encourage students from diverse backgrounds to participate in these key disciplines of modern science.  Intellectual Merits The I3 Berkeley Science Connections Program provided opportunities for students at different educational stages to engage in and discover the rewards and excitement of scientific research. These included:  Summer Rising for undergraduates who were rising sophomores; Explorations in Science Research (EiSR), as well as mentored summer research opportunities, for undergraduates in their sophomore, junior, and senior years; and the Summer Fellows Program for entering graduate students.   These programs introduced students to the frontiers of research in MPS with the longer-term goal of increasing their interest in, and preparation for, advanced studies in these disciplines.  The I3 Berkeley Science Connections Program successfully identified promising students with interest in mathematical and physical science disciplines, recruited them to graduate school, and assisted them with scholarships, professional development, inclusion in a cross-generational community of scientists, in-person mentoring and social networking relationships,  as well as other supportive activities to help them reach their educational and career aspirations. US students from around the country had the opportunity to interact closely with, and be mentored by, UCB science faculty, advanced graduate students, and professional scientists. Broader Impacts With a focus on increasing the representation of ethnic minorities and women in these fields, the I3 Berkeley Science Connections Program impact was broadened by a series of annual retreats attended by hundreds of students from diverse backgrounds. During the retreats, students benefited from professional development and advise, presented by faculty, research scientists, and other STEM professionals, on engaging in research and advancing their careers. At the retreats, students also were offered guidance by scientists who work in museums and other informal educational settings about how to communicate science to different audiences, including the public. The I3 Berkeley Science Connections Program conducted, published and disseminated scholarly research on the student experience in the STEM fields: the Berkeley Life in Science Study (BLISS).This study produced findings that were published in PLOS One in 2017. The research was widely presented to numerous audiences of faculty deans, students, and at national scholarly conferences.  A larger follow-up study across four universities was inspired by BLISS, and results from the follow-up study were published in PLOS One 2019.
