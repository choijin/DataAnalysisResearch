<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;This project is to analyze earthquake data collected after a large earthquake sequence occurred in the Malawi section of the East African Rift zone.  InSAR data from the area will also be analyzed to determine how the region was affected by the earthquakes.  The goal of the proposed work is to obtain a better understanding of the deformation associated with the inception and early stages of rifting of a continent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This project has a large component of international collaboration.  The PIs have a strong relationship with the Malawi Geological Survey department and will host Malawi colleagues in the U.S. so they can learn earthquake relocation techniques.  The PIs will also travel to Malawi to speak with various groups, and help to install the software needed for seismic analysis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    In November and December, 2009, a rare sequence of earthquakes occurred in northern MalawiÃ†s Karonga province that is part of the Western Branch of the East African Rift system where the continent of Africa is splitting apart.
