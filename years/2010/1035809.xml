<AbstractNarration>Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;      This project funds travel support for students and a few junior faculty to attend the 30th ICDCS (International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems) to be held in Genoa, Italy, June 22-25, 2010. ICDCS is a premier conference and has a wide coverage of topics in distributed computing and the attendance will provide an excellent opportunity for students and junior faculty to interact with senior researchers of international standing.  The selection of the grantees will be done via a rigorous application process that considers the expected benefits, interest and social factors (minority, women) of the participants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Travel Support for the 30th International Conference on   Distributed Computing Systems  The International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems is a forum for scientists and engineers in academia, industry and government to present their latest research findings in any aspect of distributed computing.  ICDCS is a flagship conference in the field of distributed computing. The conference has made significant impacts to the computing community since it was founded in 1979.  The selected papers have influenced the design and implementation of many distributed computing systems, software and applications today.  The goal of the travel grant was to encourage students, who may typically have financial obstacles, to attend ICDCS 2010. Funds from this travel grant gave young researchers and students in the United States an opportunity to travel to and participate in ICDCS 2010 in Genoa, Italy. Besides technical paper presentations, the conference offered a wide range of technical activities including panels, posters, demos and keynote talks. Attending such a high-caliber technical conference is extremely valuable for future researchers. Participants were exposed to the state-of-the-art research in the field and had the opportunity to interact with peer graduate students, researchers and experts from all over the world, gaining knowledge that is likely to shape the future of the field.
