<AbstractNarration>This project aims to develop efficient statistical algorithms for estimation of complex dynamics, nonlinear components and disturbances, with applications to threat detection in engineering and biological systems. Four interconnected research tasks will be addressed: (1) partial state estimation of dynamical systems; (2) adaptive smoothing spline estimation of functions with varying roughness; (3) P-spline estimation of shape restricted functions; and (4) estimation and threat detection of power systems, genetic networks, and engineering systems. By integrating novel techniques from asymptotic statistics, optimization and control theory, theoretically sound and efficient detection algorithms will be developed and be applied to potentially transformative systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A number of critical national infrastructure and important engineering or biological systems consist of numerous components and are constantly subject to disturbances. The failure of these components and/or hazardous disturbances pose threats to national security, economy and health. The success of this project will allow practitioners to better predict system dynamics and imminent threats, and therefore to avoid potentially damaging consequences. In particular, it will be useful for detecting adverse disturbances in power systems, deepen the understanding of dynamical behaviors of epidemiological diseases, and improve precision and reliability of aerospace and other engineering systems. The investigators will also actively pursue various educational and outreach activities by engaging students at all levels to strengthen and broaden awareness of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

Broader Impacts:  1. This grant supported Teresa Lebair (Ph.D. student of the PI) to attend several conferences and present her research results. And it also supported summer research of an undergraduate (Suvari Das) at UMBC. Suravi carried out research on estimation of genetic networks under the PI's guidance.  2. The PI has promoted student interests and activities in STEM areas. As a faculty advisor of two student societies/chapters, the PI has greatly contributed to events that have inspired students interests and benefited their career developments in science and engineering at both undergraduate and graduate levels. The PI has been involved in the 3rd SIAM Mid-Atlantic Regional Applied Math Student Conference in 2012 as a co-organizer (representing the SIAM Chapter at UMBC).
