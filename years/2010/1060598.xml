<AbstractNarration>The Lehman College Computer Science and Mathematics Scholarship Program is designed to retain under-represented minorities and women in mathematics and computer-related fields. The program has four key components: funding through scholarships and equipment; advising and mentoring; career planning; and building a community of scholars. Scholarship recipients receive support for professional development and career planning which emphasizes collaboration and communication skills for success in the workplace.  The program nurtures an active learning community which includes scholarship recipients who have graduated and entered the workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is based on research on the recruiting and retention of under-represented minorities in STEM fields.  The project encourages women and members of under-represented groups to complete computer science and mathematics majors and to join the STEM workforce.  Data collected by the project will add to the body of literature which describes successful approaches to recruiting and retaining women and minorities in STEM degree programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This project, the Computer Science and Mathematics Scholarship Program (CSM) at Lehman College CUNY, helped economically disadvantaged students successfully attain STEM bachelor's degrees by providing support in the form of stipends, advising and mentoring by faculty, and a wide range of workshops on different aspects of scientific careers in academia and industry. The ultimate goal is to increase the number and diversity of STEM educated professionals in order to maintain leadership in scientific/technological areas such as health care, industrial innovation, environmental protection, energy development and national security.  Almost all CSM students were from groups underrepresented in STEM fields, namely women, Hispanics and African-Americans, and one of the main benefits of the program was to give students access to information relevant to STEM careers that is generally more freely available to groups that are already well-represented in STEM fields. This access to information proved to be critical, as the more successful CSM students took full advantage of the workshops and mentoring opportunities to graduate well-prepared and with solid STEM career options.
