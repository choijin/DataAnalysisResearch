<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will investigate the feasibility of a&lt;br/&gt;high-performance FPGA implementation of full 3-D seismic Waveform Inversion (WFI), the&lt;br/&gt;most advanced and resource-demanding seismic imaging application used today in the oil and gas&lt;br/&gt;industry. The objective of WFI is to estimate a model of the Earth?s subsurface that minimizes&lt;br/&gt;the difference between recorded data and synthetic simulated data derived from an iteratively&lt;br/&gt;adjusted Earth model. The computational kernel of WFI is the 3-D wave equation in a&lt;br/&gt;heterogeneous medium. This equation is solved repeatedly in a gradient optimization process&lt;br/&gt;yielding highly accurate seismic images. The deliverable of the Phase I project will be a novel&lt;br/&gt;Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation of an especially optimized WFI kernel&lt;br/&gt;in the form of a socket compliant special-purpose device. In a continuation Phase II project, the&lt;br/&gt;Phase I deliverable will be evolved into a prototype full-fledged implementation of WFI,&lt;br/&gt;delivering order-of-magnitudes improvements in performance over conventional software&lt;br/&gt;implementations on traditional hardware. As microprocessors reach the limits of attainable clock&lt;br/&gt;frequencies and power consumption, there is a growing need in the oil and gas industry to go&lt;br/&gt;beyond conventional computer software/hardware solutions. The proposed project addresses this&lt;br/&gt;need.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to usher in a new era of low impact,&lt;br/&gt;low energy, and much higher-performance computing in the oil and gas industry. FPGA&lt;br/&gt;computing is likely to become a disruptive technology for geophysical exploration, allowing&lt;br/&gt;unprecedented improvements in capability and performance. With the proposed technology, 3-D&lt;br/&gt;seismic data will be processed faster, and used more effectively to characterize and delineate oil&lt;br/&gt;and gas reservoirs in extremely complicated geological settings. Furthermore, the proposed&lt;br/&gt;technology will enable WFI in production settings. The urgent need for this new capability is&lt;br/&gt;highlighted by domestic and foreign oil companies' recent announcements that their main&lt;br/&gt;technological focus and critical requirements are for increasingly challenging environments. In&lt;br/&gt;this context, the accurate, higher resolution, and faster seismic imaging enabled by FPGAs will&lt;br/&gt;have economic impact by: (1) improving the odds of finding new deposits of oil and gas, (2)&lt;br/&gt;reducing extraction and development costs by providing higher imaging accuracy, (3) increasing&lt;br/&gt;the amount of hydrocarbons recovered, augmenting the national oil and gas reserves, reducing&lt;br/&gt;dependence on foreign oil, and benefiting the U.S. economy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PROJECT  OUTCOMES REPORT FPGA-accelerated 3-D Waveform Inversion for Geophysical Exploration   Outcomes Summary Waveform Inversion (WFI) is todayÆs most accurate seismic imaging application for oil and gas exploration, but  seldom used commercially because of its extreme demand of computational resources.  This SBIR Phase I project addresses this drawback by demonstrating the feasibility of a specialized Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation of the computational core of WFI, delivering order-of-magnitude improvements in performance over implementations on conventional processors. The Phase I result will be expanded in Phase II into a complete FPGA implementation of WFI, providing a new capability for oil and gas exploration. Intellectual Merits  This Small Business Innovation Research project investigated the feasibility of a high-performance Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation of full 3-D Waveform Inversion (WFI), the most advanced and resource-demanding application used in industry for oil and gas exploration.  The computational kernel of WFI is the numerical solution of the 3-D wave equation in a heterogeneous medium.

As microprocessors reach the limits of attainable clock frequencies and power consumption, there is a growing need in the oil and gas industry to go beyond conventional computer software/hardware solutions. The proposed project addressed this need, and set the stage for a full hardware-implemented version of WFI of unprecedented performance, to be prototyped in the continuation Phase II project. Broader Impacts  The technology developed in this project addresses the  large and unmet demand for compute intensive high-end seismic imaging in the oil and gas industry.  The market for oil &amp; gas exploration software products and services is estimated at $3 billion per year.  Commercial potential of the proposed technology is directly applicable to the fastest growing and strategically most important areas of U.S. exploration, namely the deep water subsalt oil and gas regions of the Gulf of Mexico federal waters, and complex shale gas plays in the continental U.S.  The hardware accelerated wave-equation technology that DRC is proposing to develop to help image these prospects is orders of magnitude faster than what can be done today, and more accurate than what is currently available on the market, and it is therefore much more cost effective.  Currently, due to the excessively long runtime required for 3-D WFI on conventional computers, the seismic exploration industry cannot commercially apply the technology.  With the advent of the technology proposed herein, WFI will be fast enough for deployment in industry, replacing standard depth imaging in the market place and taking over a substantial part of the $500+ million seismic imaging market.  We expect FPGA computing to become a disruptive technology for oil and gas exploration, allowing unprecedented improvements in capability and performance. With the technology assessed in Phase I, 3-D seismic data will be processed faster, and used more effectively to characterize and delineate oil and gas reservoirs in extremely complicated geological settings. The urgent need for a new capability is highlighted by domestic and foreign oil companies' recent announcements that their main technological focus and critical requirements are for increasingly challenging environments such as the Deep Water Gulf of Mexico.  In this context, the more accurate, higher resolution, and faster seismic imaging demonstrated in the Phase I project , and to be prototyped in Phase II,  will have major economic impact by:  Improving the odds of finding new deposits of oil and gas. Reducing extraction and development costs by improving accuracy.  Increasing the amount of hydrocarbons recovered. Augmenting ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
