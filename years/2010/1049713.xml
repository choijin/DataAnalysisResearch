<AbstractNarration>Fluid flow through subduction zones is a fundamental process on Earth.  As oceanic plates get subducted into Earths interior, water and other volatiles (i.e. CO2, N2) are released from the subducting plate into the overlying mantle wedge.  These fluids are the primary cause for the melting of the mantle and the production of water-rich magmas that cause explosive volcanic eruptions.  In addition, volatiles are either efficiently recycled back to the atmosphere through subduction-related volcanoes (as is the case for N2) or are potentially carried into the deep mantle (as may be the case for CO2).  The extent of volatile recycling in subduction zones, therefore, has significant bearing on the overall volatile composition of the mantle and the atmosphere.  In this proposal, the research team will target localities within the Costa Rica subduction zone complex where gas-rich cold springs release volatiles to the atmosphere.  In addition, several springs will be monitored continuously for gas composition in order to investigate temporal changes related to earthquake activity occurring in the region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research plan of this project involves producing a volatile dataset - comprising the isotope systematics and abundance characteristics of He, CO2, N2, CH4, O2, and Ar together with major/trace element, stable isotope (D/H and 18O/16O) and carbon-14 signatures of aqueous fluids (groundwaters), with the aim of understanding details of volatile provenance, flux and temporal variability.  These springs are located trench-ward of the volcanic front and therefore sample volatiles that are potentially released from the mantle lithosphere and/or crust of the subducting slab before it reaches a depth corresponding to the volcanic front. In this way, this work aims at investigating what proportions of the volatiles that are subducted actually reach the volcanic front. Additionally, as various volatile species are expected to have different release/retention characteristics on the down-going plate, we can gauge how volatiles fractionate from one another by sampling profiles parallel to the direction of plate convergence. Moreover, by taking advantage of well-mapped structural controls on the hydrogeology, we will also determine the influence of faulting on the loss of volatiles along three targeted sections of the Costa Rica fore-arc (Nicoya, Central Pacific Coast and Oso Peninsula). Finally, because the fore-arc region of Costa Rica is the location of numerous large earthquakes occurring on a large number of active faults, it is proposed to investigate the relationships between fault localities, the occurrence of cold springs, gas compositions, and earthquake activity through (a) a widespread sampling campaign targeting ~ 100 sampling locations at the three sections of the forearc, and (b) continuously monitoring the gas composition of several selected springs using specifically-developed instrumentation (Spartah device). In the case of a local earthquake, the team anticipates being able to capture such an event by continuous monitoring of gas chemistry and documenting any changes in the gas composition of the springs. This part of the project has the potential to better understand earthquake processes in this region. To further these aims and to provide research opportunities for local scientists, the PIs will contribute to the M.Sc. Hydrogeology program at the University of Costa Rica through lectures, practical sessions and field-based training modules covering various aspects of hydrogeology, hydrochemistry, volcanology and structural geology. Monitoring efforts at Poas volcano in Costa Rica will also continue to investigate the potential role of volatiles in signaling the onset of impending hazardous conditions at the volcano.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project had three focus areas: 1) investigation of the gas compositional changes of Poas Volcano, Costa Rica in order to provide new insights into phreatic eruptions occurring at this site since 2008; 2) investigation of gases dissolved in groundwaters on the Nicoya and Osa Peninsulas, Costa Rica in order to determine the source of these gases in the waters; 3) performance of laboratory experiments to investigate how nitrogen isotopes are distributed between a liquid and a gas phase.  At Poas volcano we were able to collect new gas samples from high temperature (up to 350C) gas vents in the volcanic crater and use these data with data collected over an almost 15 year period to show that the current explosive activity was caused by injection of new volatiles perhaps from new magma in the lat 1990's.  Subsequent crystallization of the magma and formation of hydrothermal minerals formed a seal below the volcanic crater that became pressurized over time.  Increasing pressure is finally released through explosive eruptions.  The sampling and analytical work throughout the Nicoya Peninsula showed that nitrogen in groundwater is primarily derived from sources deep within the crust or even below, with minor contributions from air and sediment.  These results are significant because they show that nitrogen which originated from sediments that are transported on the oceanic crust into the Earth is not released in the region of Nicoya but is instead transported deeper into the Earth's mantle, even beyond the volcanic arc in Costa Rica.  This in turn implies that the ultimate source of nitrogen in the Earth, at least based on the results obtained in Costa Rica, is to a significant part from subducted oceanic organic materials.  These findings have important implications for the general chemical evolution of the Earth's interior  Lastly, our experiments on nitrogen isotope fractionation in water provided new data on how this gas is distributed isotopically between a water phase and a gas phase.  Our results show that this distribution is controlled by kinetics and not equilibrium, at least in the types of bubbling springs that are very common in hydrothermal environments.  Our data have important implications for interpreting new nitrogen isotope data in the future because they allow us to distinguish between results that are indicative of the source of nitrogen versus results that are simply due to degassing from water.  Broader Impacts:  The work at Poas volcano provided new insights into the eruption mechanisms occurring at this volcano.  These new findings helps that staff at the volcano observatories in Costa Rica to implement a gas monitoring program that allows them to frequently measure gas emissions.  This data in turn allows the scientists to better forecast these eruptions and issue warnings for the National Park.  In some instances these warnings have resulted in park closures that protect many national and international visitors' lives.   The project also has contributed to the education and training of a Ph.D. student in gas and water sampling, geochemical analyses of these gas and water samples using state-of-the-art analytical techniques.
