<AbstractNarration>The rapid diagenetic conversion of biogenic SiO2 to authigenic clay and subsequent burial in deltas has potentially major implications for the marine Si cycle, ocean alkalinity balances, and the cycle of multiple elements that are incorporated into clays (for example, K+, Li+, Ge, and F-).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, a research team at Stony Brook University will conduct an integrated study using a novel application of the natural cosmogenic radionuclide 32Si, diagenetic modeling of del7Li and Ge in pore water and sediment, and laboratory incubation experiments to constrain the quantity, compositions, and mechanisms of formation of authigenic clay. They will focus on the clinoform delta complex in the Gulf of Papua, for which they have archived samples available for pore water and sediment analysis, and initiate new sampling of a representative coastal mudbank of French Guiana, deposits that represent a functional diagenetic extension of the Amazon delta. The latter site will provide a basis for optimization of analytical techniques, laboratory experiments, and generalization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The Si cycle is a central component of biogeochemical processes controlling ocean and Earth surface composition. Knowledge of Si sources and sinks and their response to anthropogenic perturbations are critical to predictive models of future ocean conditions. Authigenic aluminosilicate formation and burial in tropical deltaic systems appears to be a significant component of the marine Si cycle but is relatively poorly constrained. Elements such as Li and Ge that are closely coupled to the Si cycle and extracted into authigenic aluminosilicates are also used in reconstruction of ancient Earth surface processes and provide perspective on modern ocean biogeochemical balances. The integrated study proposed here, including novel application of the cosmogenic radionuclide 32Si with potentially major implications, will provide important new quantitative constraints on the role of tropical deltaic systems in the Si cycle and on processes controlling the flux of minor elements such as Li and Ge at the continental boundary. Graduate and undergraduate education and technical training will be integrated into laboratory and field research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Silica is an essential nutrient and an important control on primary production patterns, the biological pump, and carbon cycling in the oceans.  Over the past few decades, one of the major changes in our understanding of the modern marine Si cycle has been the progressive recognition that continental shelves and margins are more significant global sinks for biogenic SiO2 than previously believed, perhaps rivaling or exceeding the Southern Ocean diatomaceous sediment belt.  There is growing evidence that a major pathway by which biogenic silica is trapped along continental margins is through storage of diagenetically altered biogenic Si in the form of authigenic clays, particularly in tropical regions where the greatest sediment inputs to the ocean occur.  The magnitude of this additional pathway of biogenic Si burial is very difficult to quantify because of the large background of lithogenic clay debris supplied to the continental margins, and thus it is not yet widely accepted as a significant sink for Si.  An independent characterization of possible Si sinks such as authigenic clay would be a critical constraint on Si budgets because these budgets traditionally have been calculated assuming the Si cycle is in steady-state in order to obtain balance.  In this research, we utilized for the first time the natural cosmogenic radionuclide 32Si (half life ~ 140 yrs) in a novel application to confirm the extensive rapid formation of authigenic clay in tropical deltaic deposits, and to demonstrate that 32Si provides an independent means by which to quantify the global magnitude of biogenic silica burial in both altered and unaltered forms.  Specifically, our results show:  (1) In sediments from the Amazon &ndash; Guianas coast of S. America, one of the major sediment dispersal systems on Earth, natural 32Si is found predominantly in mineral pools other than the operational biogenic Si pool commonly used to constrain the Si cycle.  (2) The extraction of 32Si is consistent with its incorporation into rapidly formed authigenic clay.  (3) Models of sediment transport from the Amazon to the Orinoco deltas show that 32Si&ndash;based estimates of reactive Si storage are likely 20 &ndash; 30% greater globally than presently estimated (+0.3 Teramol/yr).  (4) Measurements in the Gulf of Papua deltaic complex in Papua New Guinea, also indicate that most 32Si is present in clays rather than diatom debris and that a quantity of biogenic Si as authigenic clay equivalent to most of the river delivery of Si is stored within the Gulf.     Thus, 32Si validates the inference made in our previous research that rapid reverse weathering (authigenic clay formation) is a major pathway affecting the Si cycle in high sedimentation rate continental margin environments.   Perhaps most importantly, although 32Si is very difficult to analyze, it provides a means of independently constraining diagenetic processes controlling Si and biogenic Si storage in the global ocean. The present research indicates that deltaic and associated dispersal systems rival the Southern Ocean in importance as sites of reactive biogenic Si storage and that the marine Si cycle remains to be accurately constrained.
