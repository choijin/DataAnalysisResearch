<AbstractNarration>CBET-0748016&lt;br/&gt;Wilhite&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a CAREER grant to fund research and educational activities aimed at re-designing permselective catalytic membranes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the world's growing energy demands, pollution concerns and the need for greater energy diversity, a solution is sought for a universal, emission-free fuel.  Hydrogen has emerged as a promising energy alternative.  This research seeks to improve the extraction of hydrogen from green carbon sources.  The PIs will combine modeling and experimental efforts aimed at developing a multi-layered catalytic membrane reactor, which can be used as a single device to reform ethanol, butanol, or glycerol; selectively oxidize carbon monoxide; and deliver hydrogen for use in fuel cells.  This proposal aims to improve the design of permselective catalytic membranes by combining concepts of (i) composite or multi-layer catalytic and permselective membranes, with (ii) external manipulation of reaction and separation via applied thermal (conductive), concentration (diffusive) and pressure (convective) gradients. The resulting composite-catalytic membranes will be directly applied to the socially, environmentally and industrially critical task of realizing cost-effective and energy efficient reformers capable of extracting hydrogen from green hydrocarbon sources.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research seeks to establish a new design paradigm for realizing cost-effective catalytic membranes for selective chemical reactions and/or gas separations.  This new concept in reactor design advances clean, renewable energy production from domestic agricultural products.  The resulting scientific developments and fundamental discoveries will provide a basis for generating new pedagogical tools and teaching experiments enriching both undergraduate and graduate education.  The PIs will also use these educational materials to increase public awareness of green energy technologies and to foster interest in science and technology careers amongst K-12 students through multiple outreach activities provided by the University of Connecticut School of Engineering, Connecticut Global Fuel Cell Center and Connecticut Biofuels Consortium.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Research performed under this award was aimed at demonstrating the ability to achieve simultaneous production and purification of hydrogen (a clean-burning alternative fuel) from biomass-derived liquid fuels such as bio-diesel or ethanol. Project outcomes include (i) the development of new design rules for achieving simultaneous production and purification of hydrogen from biomass using a multi-layer catalytic membrane reactor design; (ii) development of new reactor models capable of accurately predicting multiple reactor design performances; (iii) construction of an experimental apparatus which validated modeling work and allowed demonstration of multi-layer membrane designs for simultaneous production and purification of hydrogen; (iv) creation of over 60hrs of online recorded lectures covering undergraduate and graduate-level chemical reaction engineering.  One of the leading challenges today for realizing a clean and sustainable hydrogen-fuel infrastructure is the realization of hydrogen purification technologies capable of producing carbon monoxide-free hydrogen fuels from biomass without relying upon permselective membrane materials. Current state-of-the-art permselective materials for hydrogen purification are based upon palladium metal films, which owing to their rare-earth and precious-metal composition are inherently unsustainable for a broad-based future energy infrastructure.   This research effort demonstrated novel single-layer catalytic membrane designs capable of achieving hydrogen:carbon monoxide selectivities in excess of 90:1 at hydrogen recoveries of 25 - 40% from biodiesel reformate mixtures, in the complete absence of any permselective gas separation materials. This represents a significant advance towards sustainable gas separation technologies in support of hydrogen production from biomass.  This research effort likewise demonstrated that multi-layer catalytic membranes consisting of steam-reforming, water-gas-shift and combustion catalyst thin films are capable of achieving hydrogen:carbon monoxide permselectivities in excess of 120:1 at hydrogen recoveries approaching 40% from ethanol-water mixtures which may be readily produced by fermentation of biomass, again in the complete absence of permselective membrane materials. This likewise represents a significant step forward in realizing inherently sustainable hydrogen generation technologies from biomass.
