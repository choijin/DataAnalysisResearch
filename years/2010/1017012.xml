<AbstractNarration>Network coding brings the promise of increased wireless network capacity by decreasing the overall number of&lt;br/&gt;transmissions. In practice however, many challenges remain in realizing the gains from network coding. In particular&lt;br/&gt;the interactions between network coding and transmission rate control have not been carefully studied to date.&lt;br/&gt;While transmission at higher rates favor a capacity increase, they can diminish overhearing possibilities, a key requirement&lt;br/&gt;of network coding.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal considers the problem of transmission rate control and network coding in a holistic&lt;br/&gt;way. A framework that examines the interdependencies between the use of network coding and multiple transmission&lt;br/&gt;rates with respect to various functions  spanning the link and routing layers, is developed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following tasks are being undertaken: (i) Design a network-coding aware transmission rate control module&lt;br/&gt;that allows nodes to transmit at the high bit rates while at the same time facilitating network coding.&lt;br/&gt;(ii) Design a set of functions at the link and routing layers that provide the best trade-offs between applying&lt;br/&gt;network coding and controlling interference and network congestion&lt;br/&gt;(iii) Implement and extensively evaluate a unified framework combining all of our functional modules on wireless testbeds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is tightly knit with  new education programs by establishing wireless teaching&lt;br/&gt;laboratories and introduce cross-disciplinary courses that bridge the physical and higher layers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project investigates the use of network coding in multi-rate settings. Unlike in single rate settings, we show that applying network coding blindly in multi-rate settings could in fact hurt the achieved wireless throughput capacity.  We undertake a comprehensive study to determine when and how to apply network coding.  Intellectual Merits: We make the following contributions in this project.  A. We show that blindly applying network coding in multi-rate settings could hurt the network capacity. We determine the conditions conducive to network coding, and design a framework PACE, that adaptively switches between using network coding and store-and-forward policies to derive the highest throughput.

Specifically, our approaches recognize that overhearing is a fundamental requirement for effectively encoding packets. Thus, in one approach the rate is maximized while imposing some requirements on the overhearing probabilities. In a second approach, we design a stochastic rate selection algorithm that chooses the transmission rates with the knowledge that network coding is to be applied.
