<AbstractNarration>Traditionally, there has been an isolation of responsibilities of&lt;br/&gt;physical layer (PHY) and higher layers of the network stack leading to&lt;br/&gt;severe inefficiencies in bandwidth-limited wireless&lt;br/&gt;networks. Remedying these inefficiencies requires rethinking and&lt;br/&gt;redesigning wireless protocols such that higher layers and PHY work in&lt;br/&gt;synergy. This project explores three schemes under the PHY-Informed&lt;br/&gt;Networking (PHY-IN) framework. 1) Carrier Sense Multiple Access with&lt;br/&gt;Collision Notification (CSMA/CN) mechanism detects and aborts&lt;br/&gt;collisions, breaking away from the existing collision avoidance&lt;br/&gt;(CSMA/CA) based schemes such as 802.11. 2) Constellation BAsed Rate&lt;br/&gt;(CBAR) adaptation scheme jumps to the best feasible rate suitable for&lt;br/&gt;a varying channel. 3) Remap scheme permutes bit-to-subcarrier&lt;br/&gt;assignment for a retransmission to improve the chances of its success.&lt;br/&gt;The PHY-IN framework has the potential to impact the landscape of&lt;br/&gt;future wireless networking protocols. Apart from mentoring both&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate and graduate students into independent researchers, this&lt;br/&gt;project, involving an EPSCoR university and a research lab, will also&lt;br/&gt;help broaden the participation and industry collaboration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The wide adoption of mobile devices such as smartphones has made wireless networks an essential part of our digital life. The amount of traffic generated by mobile devices has been growing exponentially (Cisco predicts a 13 times increase of cellular data traffic between 2012 and 2017).    Traditionally there has been an isolation of responsibilities of physical layer (PHY) and higher layers of the network stack &mdash; PHY is in charge of encoding/decoding bits whereas the higher layers provide packet-level services abstracting the PHY as a bit-pipe.

Currently, a sender when it does not receive an acknowledgement simply repeats the transmission hoping that it will not fail again. If the sender could appropriately alter the encoding of retransmission, it would likely succeeds as interference may not affect it the same way as the original transmission.

Remap is different from the existing, passively repeat paradigm, and introduces a novel concept called retransmission permutation to permute the bit-to-subcarrier mapping after each transmission. Retransmission permutation is a powerful diversity technique that can recover frequency selective losses from subsequent retransmissions when there is no collision.

The key insight is that, if the sum of energy on a contiguous band is low, we can conclude that all channels in this band are available with just one measurement. Based on this insight, we design an intelligent search algorithm to minimize the number of measurements. We prove the algorithm is asymptotically optimal. We prototype our method using simple analog filters and analog energy detectors. Our evaluation using real TV white space signals shows the effectiveness of our algorithm. Our solution is called QuickSense.   Our key fi...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
