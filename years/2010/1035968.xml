<AbstractNarration>This project studies the potential feedback between soil moisture and precipitation.  A positive feedback would mean that enhanced soil moisture leads to enhanced precipitation, as a wetter surface provides a source of evaporation for subsequent rainfall.  In that case, precipitation would lead to wetter soil, which would in turn lead to further precipitation, while a lack of precipitation could lead to a lack of soil moisture and hence further reductions in precipitation leading to prolonged drought. This study assesses the influence of atmospheric and land surface heterogeneity and spatial scale on soil moisture-precipitation coupling, principally at daily timescales, through two interconnected approaches: 1) diagnostic analysis of available observations, reanalysis products, and global climate model (GCM) output; and 2) conceptual modeling of land-atmosphere interactions using process-based idealized models expresed as analytic equations as well as atmospheric column models coupled to simple soil models (eg "bucket" models). A primary objective of this activity is the development of robust, physically-based metrics for quantifying and comparing intraday soil moisture/precipitation coupling in models and observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The issues addressed in this project have relevance to society as well as science, as drought duration and intensity have substantial consequences for agriculture.  In addition, the project will support and train a postdoctoral researcher, thereby helping to support and train the next generation of scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the course of our project, the project PIs (Lintner, Findell, and Gentine [Gentine was covered by a separate award number]) along with the project postdoctoral researcher Alexis Berg, investigated the coupling between the land surface and the atmosphere.  In particular, we focused on how the state of the land surface, such as the partitioning of surface energy in latent and sensible heating, impacts the occurrence of precipitation.  The major scientific outcomes and findings of this research project include:  identifying strong regional signatures in the coupling between the morning evaporative fraction (the ratio of latent heating to the sum of latent and sensible heating) and afternoon convective triggering in reanalysis projects and current-generation models; applying for the first time a neural network-based approach to isolate the sensitivities of convective triggering to land surface and atmospheric thermodynamic conditions; developing an idealized model for the coupling between large-scale circulation, convection, and the land surface to build intuition about interactions between atmospheric and land surface controls on rainfall; developing a 1D coupled boundary layer-convection model based on a probabilistic distribution of surface thermodynamics; and analyzing simulations using a protocol in which soil moisture is prescribed to a climatology, thereby severing the interaction with rainfall and allowing the isolation of interactive soil moisture on climate variability.  In on-going work, insights from this project regarding the processes controlling or modulating are being used to diagnose the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) family of models, including evaluation of the sources of error and bias.  We anticipate such insights may stimulate improvement of the land surface component of this model, which represents an important tool for future projection of the climate system.     Funding from this project supported (either fully or partially) over a dozen peer-reviewed publications, including a 2011 paper in Nature Geoscience led by Findell. The project postdoctoral researcher (Berg) produced 3 first-authored papers, which contributed to his being awarded an NSF Postgraduate Fellowship at the conclusion of his project participation.  The project participants convened a session at the 2011 American Geophysical Union Fall meeting in San Francisco on quantifying the pathways of land-atmosphere coupling in models and observations and have contributed to the GEWEX Global Land Atmosphere System Study "Local Coupling" working group.  Two of the PIs (Lintner and Gentine) leveraged work on this project to secure funding in late 2013 through the Department of EnergyÆs Green Ocean Amazon campaign, which seeks to address the interplay between convection and vegetation over the Amazon.  LintnerÆs involvement also led to participation on the dissertation committees of two PhD students at Rutgers University working in related areas, and Lintner used results of this work in support of the development of an introductory seminar course on climate interactions in Fall 2014.
