<AbstractNarration>This project explores the utility of speleothems from the Island of Niue as archives of climate information from the Southwest Pacific (SWP) region.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific objectives of the study are to: (i) acquire high resolution time-series of oxygen and carbon isotopes from speleothems spanning the Holocene; (ii) derive precise absolute chronology of the records based on a combined use of uranium/thorium dating method and floating-lamina counting chronology (iii) improve the understanding of carbon isotope variability in Niuean stalagmites; (iv) better understand rainfall variability in the SWP; and (vi) assess tropical and extra-tropical linkages by comparing contemporaneous proxy climate records&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary broader impacts involve collecting data from a sparsely sampled region, creating a uniquely strong sampling strategy between modern precipitation and cave deposits, supporting undergraduate and graduate students, and building strong international collaboration with colleagues and students from Niue.</AbstractNarration>

A stalagmite dated by multiple-techniques (band-floating chronology; AMS radiocarbon and U/Th by MC-ICPMS ) was found to contain 500 years of record (AD 2000-1500) and a mean growth rate of 98 &plusmn;40 &mu;m/yr.
