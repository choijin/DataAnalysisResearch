<AbstractNarration>Droplet based quantitative analysis of single-cell cytosol in large cell populations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; In this project will be created a new single-cell analysis device for detecting compounds inside human red blood cells.  The current state of the art for single cell analysis is flow cytometry.  Although flow cytometry may quickly analyze the cytosol of many cells, it cannot probe for very many kinds of compounds.  In this research, a plastic microfluidic device will be used to lyse the cells, encapsulate the contents of the cell in a droplet with a fluorescent dye and  then detect how much of the target molecule was present inside the cell.  The plastic microfluidic device will be fabricated and then used for the detection of ion, enzyme, and small compound levels in human red blood cells.  The project will support a graduate student and an undergraduate researcher of differing disciplines to promote collaborative learning.  The work will allow the students to interact with others at professional conferences and workshops while presenting results.  The researchers will also give a short class at a local K-12 school, and will offer a half day tour of the researchers' labs to the students to help promote interest in science and technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A miniaturized, polymer chip was designed and tested so that individual cells would be captured in individual droplets.  These droplets may be manipulated in many ways, including methods that break open the cell captured within.  Because each cell is captured in its own droplet, the contents of the cells don't mix when the cells are broken, and an individual analysis of the contents of each cell may be made.  This is revolutionary because no two cells are the exact same, and an understanding of the statistical distribution of proteins and other cellular components enables us to understand more than the "biology of the average".  To make this technology widely and inexpensively available, the research team developed polymer (plastic) chips, which are intrinsically easier and less expensive to manufacture.  To make this chip easty to use in the laboratory, the chip was designed to fit inside existing laboratory equipment.  Most laboratories have cell cytometers, which are devices that use a micro fluidic stream to align cells in a flow tube in a single line, which moves through the tube and is interrogated by laser or other devices.  The chip designed here is completely compatible with the most common of flow cytometers.       Last Modified: 11/04/2019       Submitted by: Albert P Pisano]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
