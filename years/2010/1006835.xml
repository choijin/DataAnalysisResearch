<AbstractNarration>Technical: This project aims for greater understanding of the microstructure and properties of dilute nitride-bismide semiconductor alloy heterostructures. The project is interdisciplinary and collaborative among investigators at U-Michigan, U-Notre Dame, U-College Cork, and the Tyndall Institute (Ireland). A primary objective is to identify and understand synthesis/processing mechanisms along with conditions needed to manipulate the microstructure and consequent electronic states and optical emission efficiencies of these materials. Dilute nitride-bismide alloy films will be synthesized using plasma-assisted molecular-beam epitaxy, using both amphoteric (group IV) and alternative (group VI) dopants. The microstructure will be tailored using a novel approach to seed compositional patterns using pre-growth focused-ion-beam implantation. The atomic-to-nanometer-scale structure will be determined using state-of-the-art microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. These results will be interpreted using a complementary set of computational studies, including density functional theory, tight-binding calculations, and effective-mass based calculations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: The project addresses basic research issues in a topical area of materials science with technological relevance in electronics and photonics. The scientific insights from this project are expected to enable the development of temperature-insensitive light-emitters, high efficiency photovoltaics, and high performance transistors to be used in the telecommunications, radar, and automotive industries. Graduate, undergraduate, and high school students will benefit from working together in an interdisciplinary scientific learning environment across disciplines of chemistry, physics, and engineering. The established collaboration constitutes an advantageous approach, benefitting from the complementary expertise of investigators covering theory and experiment. The new knowledge created will be broadly disseminated through publications and presentations. Outreach activities will emphasize the mentoring of women and underrepresented minorities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Due to their significant energy band gap bowing, dilute nitride and dilute bismide compound semiconductor alloys can be grown with a range of band gap energies while maintaining near lattice matching with common substrates. In both cases, the large composition-dependent bowing parameters are typically explained in the context of the band anti-crossing model, which considers interactions between the conduction band (CB) or valence band (VB) edge states of the host and a localized state associated with the solute atom.  Since these simple models consider a single local atomic environment, ignoring any fluctuations intrinsic to random alloys, such as clusters involving two or more atoms, they do not predict extraordinary physical phenomena, such as the non-monotonic composition dependence of the GaAsN effective mass.  Furthermore, these models do not take into account non-substitutional incorporation of solute atoms, and/or alloy clustering or phase separation above those of the random alloy.  Thus, the N- and Bi-related (cluster) states and their interactions with the CB and VB of GaAs need to be explicitly included in models for the electronic structure of these and other highly mismatched semiconductor alloys.  To understand and control the atomic to nanometer-scale structure and properties of dilute nitride and dilute bismide semiconductor alloys, we explored relationships between film growth, N and Bi incorporation mechanisms, and the properties of GaAsN and GaAsBi alloys.   During the course of the project, the team made several significant contributions to the field of electronic materials, including the following:       Quantified the [N]- and T-dependence of the GaAsN electron effective mass Discovered the origins of persistent photoconductivity in GaAsN alloys Discovered the influence of statistical phase separation and N-interstitials on the optical spectra of GaAsN Identified the dominant interstitial complex in GaAsN alloys  Revealed the role of the stoichiometry threshold on the growth of GaAsBi alloy films First measurement of spin lifetime in GaAsBi alloys Identified the influence of surface reconstruction on dopant incorporation in GaAsBi alloys Identified the influence of arsenic species on the growth and electronic properties of GaAsBi alloys     Broader Impact  During the 5-years of the project, 5 graduate, 9 undergraduate, and 5 high school students participated in the research, leading to 10 archival publications, 23 student conference talks, and 21 PI/co-PI invited talks.   The cohort included 8 female students including 1 female graduate student, 3 female undergraduate students, and 4 female high school students.  All of the students learned about novel semiconducting alloys and their importance for electronic and optoelectronic device applications.  In addition, the students learned various technical skills including ultra-high vacuum techniques, AutoCad design, and Mathematica programming.  Due to the experimental emphasis of our research, the students have several opportunities to work in a team.  In addition, both undergraduate and graduate students attend weekly group meetings, which often consist of a presentation from one of the students.  A significant percentage of the undergraduate students who have participated in this project have enrolled in graduate school following their graduation. Two doctoral students received PhDs in Materials Science and Physics, respectively; one is employed at a government laboratory and one at a start-up company.
