<AbstractNarration>This grant supports a symposium on the potential use of aerosols for geoengineering.  Geoengineering refers to deliberate modification of the earth system to counteract the warming effect of greenhouse gas increases, and this symposium will consider the prospects, risks, and uncertainties associated with schemes in which aerosols are injected into the atmosphere (typically the stratosphere) to cool the planet by reflecting sunlight back to space.  The symposium will take place as part of the annual meeting of the American Association for Aerosol Research (AAAR, held October 25-29 2010), and has four goals: 1) to strengthen connections between the two communities, 2) to evaluate scientific uncertainties that affect the use of aerosols for geoengineering, 3) to expose aerosol researchers to current geoengineering research, and 4) to generate feedback for geoengineering researchers on aerosol processes. A chief concern to be addressed by the symposium is that proper geoengineering decision making requires a complete understanding of the risks and benefits associated with each geoengineering scheme. Thus, it is important for aerosol experts to be active in improving the overall understanding of geoengineering. The AAAR annual meeting is an ideal venue for exposing aerosol experts to current&lt;br/&gt;geoengineering proposals&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the workshop lies in furthering understanding of aerosol-climate interactions,while the broader impacts include 1) addressing an issue of critical societal importance, 2) fostering collaboration between two scientific communities, 3) enhancing the participation of women in science, and 4) supporting early-career scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Geoengineering, techniques to counteract global warming by modifying the Earth system rather than removing the primary causative agents &ndash; the greenhouse gases, has been suggested as a means to counteract dangerous climate change.  Many proposed geoengineering schemes involve changes in atmospheric aerosols either as a driver for solar radiation management (i.e. the intentional reduction of the amount of sunlight absorbed by the earth and atmosphere) or as a feedback to from the geoengineering scheme.  However, the geoengineering-research and aerosol-research communities only have minor overlaps, and it would benefit each community to strengthen collaborations.      Our outcome was to bring together aerosol researchers and geoengineering researchers at the 2010 American Association for Aerosol Research (AAAR) annual conference for a special symposium on Aerosols in Geoengineering.  The objectives of this symposium were to strengthen the connections between the aerosol-research and geoengineering-research communities, evaluate scientific uncertainties that affect the use of aerosols for geoengineering, expose aerosol researchers to current geoengineering research, and generate feedback for geoengineering researchers on aerosol processes.  More than half of the NSF funding of the proposed symposium was used to provide travel support to enable early career scientists and graduate students to attend and present as part of the symposium.  The abstracts of the presentations are all archived on the website http://aerosol.ucsd.edu/aaargeoengineering2010.html, which will be maintained at UCSD for reference purposes.
