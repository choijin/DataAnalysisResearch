<AbstractNarration>This project will elucidate the water cycle on Mars, by measuring the time-varying water content in Martian water-ice clouds. The PI and collaborators will modify and adapt data-analysis methods that they have developed for use with ground-based multi-spectral-bandpass near-infrared imaging of Mars, and apply it to the wealth of imaging data acquired by the CRISM instrument aboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft. The purpose of their approach, which makes extensive use of Principal Component Analysis followed by radiative transfer modeling, is to separate the reflected-light signature of clouds from that of the surface and infer the optical depths in water and carbon dioxide features. These measurements of cloud optical depth will be important observational constraints for other theoretical efforts to model the Martian atmosphere. A significant fraction of the image processing and analysis work will be performed by undergraduate students at the PI's primarily undergraduate institution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The guiding phrase for study of Mars for the past decade has been summarized as "follow the water". Water is one of the few known necessary conditions for life&mdash;in this case past and/or present Martian life as well as future human habitation. Thus, Mars study has included trying to measure the total water budget and model the entire water cycle(s). Understanding the water budget and cycle is key to characterizing the present climate which is used to help paint a picture of the Martian climate over time.  The science groups working on these climate models require "ground truth" measurements from the observing community of water in all forms over all possible time-scales.  As clouds are an important climate effect and driver, knowledge of the standard cloud patterns, as well as deviations from those patterns is needed.  This project was designed to provide maps of martian cloud optical depth (a proxy for amount of water) over diurnal, seasonal, and interannual timescales.  The data used were spectral image sets gathered at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) at the 1995, 1997, 2001, and 2003 oppostions as well as spectral image sets from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) spacecraft.  The major problem to be overcome is that, in order to measure the cloud properties, the surface reflectance must be independently known.  However, the surface properties can only be found after properly modeling away the atmosphere and clouds.  This apparent paradox needs to be solved.  I built up previous work with the IRTF data that showed there was an intrinsic underlying set of dimensions that could describe the data variations and that this set was mostly constant over all time-scales.  This was confirmed with the CRISM data as well.  This new space was used to recover a set of 3&ndash;5 constant spectra that can be used to represent the surface; this technique, which was improved upon in this project, can solve the apparent paradox.  This works quite well with the CRISM data, which are of very high qualtiy and constency, but still need some improvements for the IRTF data which are more variable, due to the nature of our own chaning atmospheres effect on ground-based observations.  In the end, I have been able to produce maps of cloud optical depth over an entire Mars set of seasons; these results show good agreement with past results.
