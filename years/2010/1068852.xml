<AbstractNarration>The objective of this award is to assemble self-limited structures and material that undergo large-scale structural changes in response to changing environmental conditions such as temperature, solution properties, or imposed force. As a basic building block the project will utilize bacterial flagella, a helical polymer which acts as a nanoscale spring and exhibits non-monotonic force-extension relationship that is not commonly found in synthetic materials. To achieve the goal the project will utilize a combination of experimental, computational and theoretical tools to elucidate the behavior of flagella based materials at three levels of hierarchy. First, the project will characterize and model the mechanics of individual flagella, as well as chimeric flagella engineered to achieve new polymorphic switching responses. Second, will be to generate, characterize, and control attractive interactions between a pair of flagella. Finally, these same attractive interactions will be used to assemble flagellar bundles or ropes consisting of thousands of flagella. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study holds the promise to generate nano-structured, responsive fibrous materials with well-controlled mechanical and structural properties, in which conformational changes of individual monomeric units at Angstrom scales cooperatively cascade across multiple lengthscales to produce macroscopic mechanical changes in millimeter-sized materials. The educational and research component of this project will be integrated by expanding an REU program to hold an annual "Theory Meets Experiment" symposium for undergraduates participating in summer research at Brandeis and University of Massachusetts, to expose novice researchers to the distinct and complementary methods of theoretical and experimental research in soft materials. In addition, a partnership will be explored with Jennifer Sabin, architect, designer, and lecturer at the University of Pennsylvania School of Design in order to explore the relationship between complex biopolymer assembly motifs and a state-of-the-art textile design and fabrication process.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project scope:  This project investigated the role of shape and shape-deformation in the assembly of biological filaments.  Biological filaments are key structural elements inside of cells (such as cytoskeletal filaments) as well as functional appendages outside of cells (like pili or flagella of bacteria).  These protein-based structures are typically ~5-25 nanometers in diameter, and are therefore, highly deformable under a range of physical forces.  Particularly relevant to the goals of the present study is the growing class of filaments which are known to be naturally-curved in isolation (including the well-known bacterial flagella, membrane bound filaments of Caulobacter crescentus and the recently identified extracellular protein architecture in the shells of pteropods, Clio pyramidata).  Working in collaboration with experimental colleagues at Brandeis Univ., this project developed theoretical models to investigate the fundamental role played by filament curvature in the cohesive assembly behavior of such highly-flexible filaments, in general, and, intrinsically-curved filaments, in particular.     Key outcomes:  1) The role of bending in cohesive contact between intrinsically straight filaments - For decades, models of interactions between straight, filamentous molecules have been consistently built on the assumption of a (rigid) cylinder geometry.  This simplifying assumption neglects the inherent flexibility of nanoscopically thin objects and the obvious potential of long molecules to gain contact by bending around one another, leaving a basic question about the optimal shape of flexible filaments undergoing cohesive broadly unresolved.  To address this, we developed a physical and geometrical model of the effect of filament-scale forces to shape the double-helical geometry of twisted pairs of cohesive filaments.   Exploring a range of inter-filament force types, we demonstrated that cohesive forces generically favor non-zero helical twist of filament pairs and connected that optimal cohesive geometry to model-independent properties of flexible tube close-packing (in 2-plies).   We further related the stability of parallel cohesive pairs of flexible, tubular filaments to the pairwise/non-pairwise additive nature of interactions between filament surfaces.  2) Quantitative measurement/modeling of microtubule binding &ndash; Inside and outside of cells, macromolecular filaments, from DNA to microtubules, are often organized into self-associating bundles or fibers.  Developing a quantitative understanding of the cohesive forces that holds these structures together has been a decades long challenge.  An experimental technique, developed by our collaborator Zvonimir DogicÆs group, has provided new method to directly measure the strength of cohesive binding between macromolecular filaments through the fluctuation analysis of optically-trapped and fluorescently-labeled filaments.  As a first demonstration, this method was applied to study the cohesive interactions between microtubules condensed in the presence of polymers that osmotically squeeze the filaments together.  In collaboration with Michael Hagan also at Brandeis, we developed theoretical models to test the current understanding of the surface structure of microtubules as well as the nature of "osmotic" forces between these charged molecules.  We demonstrated that the most commonly used Asukara-Oosawa model fails significantly to describe the strength of osmotic cohesion, and the agreement with experimental measurement is only somewhat improved with the introduction of charged repulsive bristles into the model, to capture the more realistic effect of N-terminus polyamino acid tails decorating the microtubule surfaces.  Hence, the collaborative study provides not only new opportunities to directly probe intermolecular forces in a range of biological and synthetic assemblies, it also poses new challenges to our understanding of the nature of osmotic forces between c...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
