<AbstractNarration>Zeger&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1009954&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The project develops foundations for the recently booming&lt;br/&gt;applied mathematics field of network coding.  Network coding&lt;br/&gt;offers the promise of improved performance over traditional&lt;br/&gt;network routing techniques used in practical engineering&lt;br/&gt;applications.  Emphasis is placed on the fundamental theory of&lt;br/&gt;communication in networks that allow coding in addition to&lt;br/&gt;routing.  Applications include improved throughput in packet&lt;br/&gt;networks and power savings in wireless ad hoc networks.  The work&lt;br/&gt;exploits the diverse mathematical, engineering, and computer&lt;br/&gt;science background from the investigator's previous work and&lt;br/&gt;involves mathematical analysis, algorithm design, and computer&lt;br/&gt;simulation.  The main topic areas investigated are: the role of&lt;br/&gt;alphabet size and error correcting codes in network coding,&lt;br/&gt;techniques for computing or bounding network capacities,&lt;br/&gt;determining the scalar or vector solvability of networks,&lt;br/&gt;theoretically achievable rates under a limitation of the number&lt;br/&gt;of network nodes that can perform coding, and bi-directional&lt;br/&gt;networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     This project has applications to practical engineering&lt;br/&gt;problems involving packet switched networks, such as sensor&lt;br/&gt;networks, military battlefield networks, and local area networks. &lt;br/&gt;The most prominent example is the Internet, which is used on a&lt;br/&gt;daily basis by billions of people for sending email, downloading&lt;br/&gt;images and video, transferring data, and many other applications. &lt;br/&gt;This project studies the theoretical foundations of how&lt;br/&gt;information can be sent across such networks using mathematical&lt;br/&gt;combinations of data rather than just routing of data. &lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the project studies the fundamental limits of data&lt;br/&gt;transmission, the best methods to transmit such data, and&lt;br/&gt;variations on the types of networks used.  The project includes&lt;br/&gt;graduate student participation as well as some undergraduate and&lt;br/&gt;high school student contributions, with emphasis on the&lt;br/&gt;interconnection between mathematics, engineering, and computer&lt;br/&gt;science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Network coding provides an alternative method for conveying digital information through a network, when compared to the more tradition technique of routing. Routing is commonly used on most networks today such as the Internet, but network coding may provide improved performance in the future.  One of the most important problems in network coding is to understand when a network is "solvable", namely when the demands that each receiver require can be satisfied by some network code.  Any such code uses some particular alphabet. If such alphabet has an algebraic structure, such as that of a finite field, then the notion of linearity is possible, in which case encoding and decoding of codes can be performed linearly. This may reduce complexity and facilitate analysis. It is of significant concern in the literature to characterize which networks admit linear solutions and for which alphabets such linear solutions are possible.  During this period substantial progress was made on a research problem concerning the sufficient of linear network coding for particular classes of directed acyclic networks. Specifically, multiple unicast networks were considered where each transmitter is paired off with exactly one receiver in a network's graph. For a given number of transmitter/receiver pairs, if was unknown in general whether scalar linear network coding over a finite field alphabet was sufficient. That is, if such a network had a nonlinear solution, the outstanding question was whether a linear solution was thereby guaranteed to exist. The research during this period showed that the answer was yes if the number of pairs was one or two and was no if the number of pairs was 4 or more.
