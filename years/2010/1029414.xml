<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:  This project will contribute to a better understanding of how photosynthetic microorganisms sense and respond to changes in their light environment. This process, which is poorly understood but of global importance, is being examined using the freshwater, filamentous cyanobacterium Fremyella diplosiphon (Tolypothrix PCC 7601). Previous research demonstrated that this organism appears to be using a novel form of gene regulation that involves multiple forms of a translation initiation factor called IF3. Many cyanobacteria appear to contain multiple IF3-encoding genes, making it likely that this form of regulation is widespread within this group. This project will confirm whether an IF3-mediated form of post-transcriptional control regulates the response of F. diplosiphon to the presence of green light during a process called complementary chromatic adaptation. If true, this will expand understanding of IF3 activity from its traditional role in translation initiation to also include the regulation of gene expression in response to environmental cues. This research will also further define the activity and function of a putative cyanobacterial phytochrome photoreceptor encoded within the F. diplosiphon genome whose expression, surprisingly, is regulated by another cyanobacterial phytochrome. Exploration of this novel arrangement will provide new insights into phytochrome signaling pathways in prokaryotes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts.  This research will offer two Ph.D. and twelve undergraduate students training in the fields of signal transduction, molecular biology, microbiology and functional genomics. Based on the prior history of student training for this laboratory, a significant number of these students are likely to be from underrepresented groups. More broadly, because previous work on this project has also suggested that multiple forms of IF3 may regulate gene expression in the chloroplasts of higher plants during embryogenesis and senescence, this research may lead to improved agriculture practices and crop production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is co-funded by the Divisions of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (Genes and Genome Systems) and Emerging Frontiers (Life in Transition).</AbstractNarration>

We also found that DpxA is a member of a large class of bacterial sensory proteins called histidine kinases. DpxA is unusual, however, because yellow light activates its kinase activity, while teal light inactivates it. No such protein has been previously identified. We also found a protein that plays a role in cyanobacterial color vision with similarity to IF3, one of the three translation initiation factors that are required to begin translation. We demonstrated that this protein is actually an IF3 and discovered that the gene encoding this protein could be deleted without killing the cell. This was surprising because IF3s are known to be essential for cell survival. The cyanobacteria survived because their genome encoded a second IF3, which allowed the cell to survive the loss of the first IF3. Only the first IF3 (IF3 alpha) played a role in light color responses, however. Because we identified a light color responsive signal transduction pathway called the Cgi pathway, which we found to operate after transcription was initiated, we believe that DpxA and IF3 alpha are part of the Cgi pathway. We also found that the DpxA works together with another, previously established light color sensing system called the Rca pathway. Its activity is controlled by a photoreceptor called RcaE that has some similarity to DpxA, except that it is most sensitive to green and red light. The DpxA and RcaE photoreceptors work together to control the formation of phycobilisomes.
