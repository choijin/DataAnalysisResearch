<AbstractNarration>This is a collaborative award to support the scientists who will work on the construction, commissioning and initial analysis of data from the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) gamma-ray observatory being built at the Sierra Negra in Mexico. The HAWC collaboration consists of 14 US and 11 Mexican institutions. The observations of HAWC will probe the most extreme environments in the Universe, providing a unique view of non-thermal processes in the Galaxy and beyond. The key science goals of HAWC are to: (a) Measure the spectrum of Galactic sources to the highest energies; (b) Map the Galactic diffuse gamma-ray emission from 1 TeV to 100 TeV, measuring the cosmic-ray flux and spectrum across the Galaxy; (c) Study transient emission from active galactic nuclei (AGN); (d) Monitor the sky for 100 GeV emission from gamma-ray bursts; and (e) Search for new TeV physics with HAWC's unbiased sky survey. HAWC measurements have the potential to shed light on the fundamental symmetries of nature, including the search for Lorentz violation at extreme energies, the search for the dark matter in the universe, and the direct detection of massive relic particles. HAWC is a water Cherenkov air-shower detector consisting of 300 large water tanks. The tanks will be densely packed to cover an area of about 20,000 square meters. The goal is to begin taking data while the array is under construction and to have the full detector online within approximately three years. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: HAWC is an all-sky instrument that will serve as a TeV "finder" telescope for Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) and IceCube and will have the sensitivity to extend the measurement of satellite-discovered sources to TeV. HAWC will build on the strong outreach record of Milagro to bring this exciting field of research to students and the general public. Since HAWC is a joint US-Mexican project, this will be an excellent opportunity to attract talented Hispanic students to the field of Particle Astrophysics and to Physics in general. The project has developed an outreach video about HAWC and web materials about HAWC and Particle Astrophysics in both Spanish and English.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The award funded the research activities at the University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison on the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) experiment.  HAWC is a detector designed to observe gamma rays and cosmic rays in the energy range from about 50 GeV to 100 TeV.  The study of these high-energy particles opens a new window in astronomy and provides us with a better understanding of some of the most extreme astrophysical objects, from supernova remnants in our Galaxy to extragalactic objects like active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray bursts.  With its large field of view and high duty cycle, HAWC provides an unbiased map of the TeV sky with a large daily coverage.  It will search for transient phenomena and contribute to multi wavelength campaigns that study a selected object at various wavelengths, from radio to TeV gamma rays, at the same time.  By studying these objects, HAWC will provide important clues about the origin of Galactic and extragalactic cosmic rays and help to solve the century-old mystery of where and how these particles are accelerated up to energies that exceed those reached at man-made accelerators.    The HAWC experiment is currently under construction near Pico de Orizaba in Mexico.  The completed detector will be operational by summer of 2015.  Data-taking and physics analysis with the partially completed detector has already started.  Our group has participated in the construction of the experiment, the development of the data acquisition system, and the analysis of the first data.  In collaboration with the HAWC group at Los Alamos National Lab, we developed, built, and tested the data acquisition system for the HAWC detector.  The system was extensively tested at UW&shy;&ndash;Madison and is now in stable operation at the site in Mexico.  As the detector is growing, the data acquisition system will grow with it, and the system will be upgraded to full capacity in early 2015.  Our group built and operated the HAWC electronics "integration site" at UW&ndash;Madison, where all electronics components built at the various HAWC institutions are tested before shipment to Mexico.  The integration site is a complete duplicate of the electronics system at the site and allows for testing of both hardware and software components.    With the partial detector now taking data, our group has put an emphasis on the analysis of early data.  We developed map-making and background estimation code for HAWC.  Our analysis focuses on the study of the Moon shadow and the cosmic-ray arrival direction anisotropy with early data.   The cosmic-ray shadow of the Moon is a first test of the detector performance.  The size of the Moon shadow is indicative of the angular resolution and the pointing accuracy of the instrument.  We have compared the observed Moon shadow to simulations that include the deflection of the charged cosmic rays in the EarthÆs magnetic field.  Simulations show that the field leads to an offset and a smearing of the shadow, and both effects have been observed in the data.    While our main physics goal is the study of TeV gamma rays, the high rate of cosmic rays observed with HAWC makes it also a very sensitive cosmic-ray detector.  The arrival direction distribution of cosmic rays at TeV energies should be completely isotropic, as the cosmic rays get scrambled in Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields.  Earlier measurements with detectors in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres have, however, seen large- and small-scale structures in the arrival direction distribution of cosmic rays.  The presence of these structures is one of the most surprising features of the TeV sky and clearly implies that the propagation of cosmic rays from their sources to us is not understood.  With early HAWC data, we have confirmed the previously observed large- and small-scale structure, but have already observed some striking new features.  With the different latitude and energy threshold of HAWC compared to other instruments, d...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
