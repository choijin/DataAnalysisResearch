<AbstractNarration>In this planning visit, the PI Dr. Grellet-Tinner, along with Dr. Alessandra Higa from Oglala Lakota College (OLC) and an OLC student, will visit Dr. Vlad Codrea at the Babes-Bolyai University, Department of Geology-Paleontology, Cluj-Napoca, Romania. They will begin a research collaboration to investigate, through the study of dinosaur eggs, the paleoenvironment and the Cretaceous fauna of the Hateg Basin during the terminal Cretaceous. The proposed research will encompass finding more refined sedimentological records and accessing dinosaur egg clutches whose nature and taxonomic identity are still debated to augment preliminary oological character-based data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific impact of this investigation will benefit the field of vertebrate paleontology in general, refine our understanding of the terminal Cretaceous fauna in the particular Hateg Basin, and bring more data to dinosaur paleobiology. This research effort will also enhance scientific collaboration between Romanian and U.S. scientists. Furthermore, this collaborative paleontology research will involve a student and a faculty member from Oglala Lakota College located on Pine Ridge Reservation.  Paleontology is currently the focus of much attention at OLC and tribal levels, and OLC is a tribal institution with considerable success in training Native American students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields.  This award is sponsored jointly by the Office of International Science and Engineering and the Sedimentary Geology and Paleobiology progam.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Cretaceous Hateg Basin, in western Romania has yielded a diversified dwarf dinosaur fauna. Eleven dinosaur egg clutches were recovered at the Totesti-baraj site. This assemblage represents, so far, the most complete and defined groups of eggs in Europe and the world.  These fossils were previously assigned to a parataxonomic egg family, without taxonomic relevance and uninformative in terms of paleobiology. To further complicate the situation several isolated egg fragments of various sizes were recovered overtime in the 3-4 km long Totesti-baraj exposures. Moreover, osteological remains indicate the presence of several dwarf dinosaur taxa from titanosaurid sauropods to ornithischians.  This research seeks to reveal the identity of the dinosaur parent lineage of these eleven clutches, their paleobiology, and adaptation to the "island effect".  The work was performed with Vlad Codrea, Professor of Biology and Geology at the University Babes-Bolyai (Cluj-Napoca), Thierry Smith at the Royal Museum of Belgium, and Professor Higa at the tribal Oglala Lakota College (OLC).     The intellectual merit- Our results represent the most comprehensive study of the oological remains from the Cretaceous Hateg Basin. New microcharacterizations were used including micro and nano-CT to explore the eggshell 3-dimensional architecture, EBSD to obtain precise crystallographic orientation of the eggshell crystalline structure, SEM and EDS analyses to reveal the elemental composition of the specimens. Preliminary results revealed that the parent species was a dwarf and very derived titanosaur, which continental counterpart (normal size) was indigenous of Argentina and Mongolia. Moreover, it indicates that Totesti-baraj was a nesting site for many dinosaur species stranded on the Cretaceous Hateg Island.

The smallest (to date) embryonic remains were discovered inside one of the eggs and helped to better understand the developmental embryology of this dinosaur lineage.  Broader Impacts- Professor Alessandra Higa, at OLC, collaborator in this project is presently co-author a manuscript with the PI, Drs. Codrea and Smith, to be submitted in June 2011 to a professional journal.  Already the PI gave several presentations at OLC and The Journey Museum, the administrative institution for this project.
