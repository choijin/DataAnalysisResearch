<AbstractNarration>The study of the Roman world remains largely focused on the wealthy - the lettered elite like Cicero who penned the majority of textual sources, and the wealthy whose largesse built ancient cities like Rome and Pompeii.  Yet 90% of the Roman population were poor, rural peasants, about whose life habits, economies and diet virtually nothing is known. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Support from the National Science Foundation will enable continuation of "The Roman Peasant: Environment and Economies" project, the first systematic attempt to excavate and analyze the houses and farms of the Roman peasantry. Directed by Dr. Kim Bowes of the University of Pennsylvania in collaboration with Italian, Dutch, Canadian and Spanish scholars, the project is based in ancient Etruria (western Tuscany, Italy), the region upon which most of the textual models for Roman rural life have been centered. Over a period of three years, the Project will excavate 4-6 examples of Roman peasant farms and habitations. By analyzing their houses, their access to local and imported goods, the organic remains of their meals, mapping local soils and resources, and juxtaposing that data with historical sources (poetry, legal texts and agricultural manuals), the Project aims to reveal the lived experience of this largest, most invisible, group of ancient Romans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Bowes and her team hope to show that contrary to most assumptions, the "Roman peasantry" was neither a homogenous group, nor only engaged in subsistence-level economies. Drawing on new ethnographic studies and work on the modern poor, the Project is beginning to show that Roman peasants of all wealth levels relied both on local resources as well as global economic networks, and were highly mobile, exploiting a wide range of environmental resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will thus address a major gap in both classical archaeology and Roman history. In doing so, it will also contribute to our understanding of modern peasantries and the rural poor, revealing how one of the world's great state systems and global trade networks impacted the lowliest rural dwellers. In exploring the various kinds of power available to rural dwellers - through horizontal, reciprocal relationships and through exploiting their environment - it aims to provide lessons for modern populations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will also have major "human" outputs, training new generations of American undergraduates and graduates with special emphasis on scientific methods - faunal analysis, geoarchaeology, pollen analysis - that don?t often form part of American archaeological training. The Project also sponsors an educational initiative in local primary schools, giving lectures and sponsoring basic "excavations," designed to inspire rural schoolchildren about their own heritage.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our impression of Roman history is dominated by the rich: their great houses and temples, their literature and philosophy. Yet 90% of the Roman population were poor, rural farmers: how would our idea of the ancient Roman world be different if we considered the lives of this silent, poor majority?  "The Archaeology of Rural Rome" was the first project of its kind, designed explicitly to understand the lived experience of the rural poor - that is, Roman peasants. It looked at every facet of peasant life - from architecture and diet to agriculture and trade. Its findings transform dramatically the scholarly assumption of a poor whose ignorance and isolation lead to frequent famine, primitive economic habits, and an overall low quality of life.  Instead, this project provided the seeds for a quite different view - a knowledgeable, socially and physically mobile group of rural farmers who while they lived in modest houses and often suffered from want, nonetheless had access to both information and markets that could have allowed them to escape a grinding cycle of poverty.  Based in southern Tuscany, Italy, the project excavated 10 sites associated with peasants, and analyzed the botanical and animal remains, ceramics, coins and other materials they left behind. We also studied in detail their landscape - the land and its capacities.  At every turn, we found ample evidence for a sophisticated rural world intimately tied to the Roman global economy.
