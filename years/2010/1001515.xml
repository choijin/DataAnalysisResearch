<AbstractNarration>This award supports research on two major projects. The first is gravitational-wave astronomy from inspiral of double neutron-star (NS-NS) systems and black-hole-neutron-star (BH-NS) systems. One goal is to use gravitational wave observations from binary inspirals to measure parameters of the neutron-star equation of state (EOS). A collaboration with three numerical relativity groups will compute the gravitational waves produced in the late inspiral of double neutron-star systems, use the waveforms to analyze the way in which gravitational- wave observations will constrain the equation of state of cold matter above nuclear density, and find the accuracy with which equation-of-state and neutron-star parameters can be extracted. The study of BH-NS inspiral is still in its early stage, with the wide range of black hole masses and spins still to be explored. Computer simulations will explore the late inspiral and merger of systems with varying mass ratios and black hole spins, including spins oblique to the orbital plane. The second project will examine extreme-mass-ratio-inspiral (EMRI). A principal goal of the planned NASA/ESA space-based gravitational wave observatory, LISA, is to observe gravitational waves from the inspiral of stellar-size black holes orbiting supermassive black holes (the EMRIs). To maximize the number of observed events and, more critically, to extract from the observations the characteristics of the sources, it is essential to obtain accurate waveforms associated with generic orbits. Because the ratio of the component masses is small, the orbits and gravitational waves from these binary systems can be described to high accuracy by a perturbative expansion. Finding the conservative part of the self force, a correction needed for parameter extraction, may be the most difficult part of the problem, but it can be regarded as a correction to an inspiral described by the dissipative radiation-reaction force on a particle in near-geodesic orbit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the waveforms from binary inspiral and their implications for gravitational-wave astronomy is a critical part of the nation's substantial commitment to the LIGO and to the planned space-based observatory, LISA. With support from funds from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee's Research Growth Initiative, from a University Scholarship, and from the present NSF grant, graduate students and a post-doctoral research associate will gain expertise in areas of gravitational physics, relativistic astrophysics, and numerical relativity that will be fundamental to the development of gravitational-wave astronomy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Highlights of Completed Research     With the first direct observations of gravitational waves expected in the next few years, we are at the dawn of gravitational-wave astronomy.  The most important targets of this new field are waves from the inspiral and merger of pairs of neutron stars and of binary systems containing neutron stars and black holes.  A primary goal of these observations is to determine the physical parameters of these systems: to find the masses and radii of the inspiral neutron stars and, from them, to infer the behavior of cold matter above nuclear density.  This requires highly accurate numerical solutions to the equations describing orbiting and coalescing neutron stars and black holes.  Postdoctoral researchers supported by the grant developed some of the world's leading codes for this problem and, in collaboration with other leading scientists in numerical relativity, constructed hundreds of simulations of binary inspiral and coalescence.  Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers used these codes in pioneering studies of the accuracy with which neutron-star radii can be measured and the equation of state constrained by future gravitational-wave observations.   The research found that observations of double neutron-star and black-hole neutron-star inspirals are likely to determine the stars' radii to better than 2 km accuracy.  The statistical accuracy is comparable to that from X-ray observations, but interpreting the X-ray data depends on modeling the neutron-star atmosphere.  A key advantage of gravitational-wave observations is their model-independence. The work also found that the detected waveform is entirely determined by the neutron star radius for a given mass:  This result significantly reduces the number of simulations needed to set maximal constraints on behavior of cold matter above nuclear density. Finally, for binary systems of neutron stars and black holes, the work showed the importance of matching a precise numerical waveform for the last set of orbits before merger to an analytic waveform for more distant orbits that maintains its accuracy for hundreds of orbits.  Having an accurate phase of the wave over hundreds of orbits substantially reduces the error with which one can extract the neutron-star radius and constrain the behavior of matter above nuclear density.       The ground-based gravitational wave observatories will see binary systems with black holes that form from the gravitational collapse of the cores of stars at the end of their evolution. At the centers of nearly every large galaxy, however, is a supermassive black hole; their formation and growth are not yet understood.  Gravitational waves from stellar size black holes spiraling in to supermassive galactic black holes are the targets of a future space-based observatory. By analyzing these waves, one can determine with extremely high precision the masses and spins of these rapidly rotating black holes, and one can test general relativity to similarly unprecedented accuracy.  To realize this accuracy requires waveforms of comparable precision, and a second part of the research was part of a major program by several groups to obtain these waveforms.   Because  supermassive galactic black holes are more than ten thousand times larger than the stellar black holes that orbit them, the stellar black holes can be modeled as point particles.  To achieve the needed accuracy, the calculation must find the force on the orbiting particle from the gravitational field produced by own its past trajectory.  Results of the research include:  Development of analytic and numerical tools to find this self-force using a formalism appropriate for rotating black holes. Calculation of the self-force in this formalism for circular orbits. Calculation of a related gauge-invariant quantity and comparison with work in a different gauge by other groups.   This last calculation led a surprising discovery.  Binary systems with large separation ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
