<AbstractNarration>A series of annual research workshops on Intelligent Information Systems, centered on machine learning for speech, language and vision technologies, are being organized at Johns Hopkins University to bring together diverse ?dream teams? of leading professionals, graduate students, and undergraduates, in a truly cooperative, intensive, and substantive effort to advance the state of the science.&lt;br/&gt;The primary goals of the proposed workshop series are to develop machine learning principles applicable to a broad spectrum of intelligent systems, to attract students to the field and to prepare them for research by putting them to work on exciting problems alongside senior researchers in a highly collaborative environment.  Creation of research infrastructure and lasting collaborations are secondary goals.&lt;br/&gt;An open call for workshop project proposals is being issued each year to researchers in the worldwide IIS community. Received proposals are competitively evaluated and cooperatively refined at interactive peer review meetings, where project proponents, government representatives, and experts from related fields meet to assess their scientific merit, viability and potential impact. The graduate students attending the workshop are familiar with the field and are selected in accordance with their demonstrated performance. The undergraduates are entering seniors who are new to the field and who have shown outstanding academic promise; they are selected through a national search. The participation of undergraduates in these research programs encourages talented young scholars to pursue graduate studies in IIS.&lt;br/&gt;By the end of this 3-year workshop series (beginning 2010), more than a hundred individuals will have conducted intensive collaborative research: about 30 academic and industry researchers, 20 researchers from government and national laboratories, 30 graduate students, and 20 undergraduates. Additional benefits of the workshops will be the collection or creation, and dissemination of valuable tools and data for IIS research, the establishment of fruitful and long-lasting collaborations, and the cross-fertilization of ideas among the participants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF award was used to organize a series of six-week-long summer research workshops on Intelligent Information Systems from 2010 to 2015, centered on Machine Learning for Language and Image Technology (MLLIT).  Each year, these workshops brought together diverse "dream teams" of approximately 50 leading professionals, graduate students, and undergraduates, in a truly cooperative, intensive, and substantive effort to advance the state of the science.  To get a sense of the diversity of participants in these workshops, see the composition of the 2015 Workshop participants in the accompanying graphic.  With the continuing growth of the world's Internet-based economy, the development of Intelligent Information Systems (IIS) continues to be vital to the US interests. Human Language Technology encompasses automatic speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, topic detection and tracking, information retrieval and extraction, summarization and question answering, etc.  Computer Vision Technology, e.g., image understanding and visual scene analysis, shares many important algorithmic and statistical approaches with Human Language Technology, allowing cross-fertilization. These Machine Learning techniques are of fundamental scientific interest, and are behind the success of companies such as Google, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and IBM.  The primary goals of the proposed workshop series was to advance MLLIT, attract US students to pursue graduate studies in the field, and prepare them for research by putting them to work on exciting problems alongside senior researchers in a highly collaborative environment. Creation of research infrastructure and lasting collaborations were secondary goals.  Several research breakthroughs were made and new research directions were established through this series of workshops.  A few illustrative examples are provided below, along with web-links to the other accomlishments.     A team in the 2010 workshop investigated methods to automatically analyze video recordings to identfy objects and actions contained in them.  Such methods will permit searching large video archives the way we search text archives (e.g. the world wide web) with text queries. See http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/10-workshop/. A team in the 2011 workshop investigated ways to make computer-generated speech sound emotionally appropriate rather than robotic.  Such speech synthesis techniques are important for facilitating natural interactions with intelligent machines.  See http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/11-workshop/. A team in the 2012 workshop investigated means to improve automatic translation of text from one language to other.  Current methods, e.g. Google Translate, are developed for generic newswire-like text and often result in inappropriate translations for specific domains, such as medical documents. The team found ways to characterize and address such problems.  See http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/12-workshop/. A team in the 2015 workshop made significant advances in improving automatic speech recognition in "far field" conditions, i.e. when the microphone is not within an inch or so of the speaker's mouth.  Such technology is crucial for making spoken communication with computers ubiquitous, as exemplified by Amazon's Echo device.  See http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/15-workshop/.      In addition to establishing new research directions and providing hands-on education to students, the workshops provided an avenue for widespread dissemination of these results and their incorporation into continuing, large-scale, collaborative research efforts by faculty, graduate and undergraduate students from geographically diverse institutions. The workshops created shared "sandboxes" for continuing the research started at the workshop, which resulted in large volumes of post-workshop research: after returning to their home institutions, students in the workshop continued to work on their workshop resea...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
