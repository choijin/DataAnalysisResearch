<AbstractNarration>Collaborators from five institutions will work to build and deploy an Arctic Ocean network of rugged and autonomous buoys (named ?O-Buoys?) capable of observing atmospheric O3, BrO, and CO2 and oceanic pCO2 for a period of up to 5 years (with each O-Buoy being operational for up to 2 years). The original O-Buoy project funded by NSF included design and testing of the O-Buoy. In the current project, 11 new O-Buoys will be constructed and deployed along with the four already built. As a pilot project, two of the new O-Buoys will include seawater sensors for CO2, oxygen, temperature and salinity in addition to the atmospheric O3, BrO, and CO2 sensors. Throughout the project, data from each O-Buoy will be subject to QA/QC protocols by automated processing initially, with preliminary data available on a regular basis on the Cooperative Arctic Data and Information Service (CADIS) site. All final data and metadata will be ultimately archived on CADIS after final analysis at the end of each deployment. This network of O-Buoys, coordinated and clustered with other buoys in automated drifting stations, will enable the scientific community to first observe and, next, better understand the impact of Arctic surface change on atmospheric composition and chemistry. Outreach to local K-8 schools will include an ?Adopt-a-Buoy? program. Video footage from deployments/recoveries and interviews with colleagues and native Arctic people will be contributed to the ongoing http://www.arcticstories.net site, and activities and results will be communicated via the O-Buoy web site.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Arctic sea ice has undergone a dramatic decline in recent years, with a well documented retreat of the summer ice cover, a general thinning, and a transition to a younger ice pack, more vulnerable to melt. These changes are profoundly affecting the physical, biological, and chemical properties of the ocean &ndash; ice &ndash; atmosphere system. The Arctic Ocean is an austere and hostile environment that is remote and difficult to access. These conditions make any observation difficult, but pose particular difficulties for autonomous sensors. Most long-term Arctic atmospheric observations, and in particular most chemical concentration data, have been collected at terrestrial bases around the periphery of the Arctic Ocean, mostly leaving Arctic Ocean locations without any observations.

Our focus was on the measurement of three important gases, bromine monoxide (BrO), ozone (O3) and carbon dioxide (CO2) as well as weather data.  O3 and CO2 are two of the most important greenhouse gases in our planet, yet with very few observations in the very cold Arctic Ocean region.  Increased atmospheric CO2 causes ocean acidification that has already been detected in the Arctic Ocean.  BrO causes extraordinary ozone decreases and mercury deposition that occurs during polar springtime, with attendant significant implications for human and ecosystem health in the Arctic region.  This atmospheric chemistry O-Buoy has enhanced the capability of the Arctic Observing Network to quantify seasonal and interannual variability in a fast changing and highly regionally variable ice field.  We deployed an Arctic Ocean network of O-Buoys to observe atmospheric O3, BrO, and CO2 over the full annual cycle, producing high quality data at climatically important, but logistically dangerous, locations.  Daily data transmissions were by satellite communication from the O-Buoys to a home ftp site where raw data were archived and displayed for immediate observation.
