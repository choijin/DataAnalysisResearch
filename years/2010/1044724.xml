<AbstractNarration>In STEM education, widely accepted teaching goals include not only the development of solid content knowledge but also the development of general scientific reasoning abilities that will enable students to successfully handle open-ended real-world tasks in future careers and design their own experiments to solve scientific, engineering, and social problems. It is often expected by teachers that consistent and rigorous content learning will help develop students' general reasoning abilities.  However, research has shown that the content-rich style of STEM education made little impact on the development of students' scientific reasoning abilities.  Research also indicates that inquiry based science instruction can promote scientific reasoning abilities and that the scientific reasoning skills of instructors can also significantly affect their ability to use inquiry methods effectively in science courses.&lt;br/&gt;In order to effectively implement inquiry based science curricula for students to develop science knowledge and scientific reasoning ability, good assessment tools are needed to evaluate the impact of the different inquiry based curricula.  These assessment tools should be easily applied in large-scale applications and produce valid results for evaluating students' scientific reasoning abilities.&lt;br/&gt;Existing assessment instruments do not provide enough coverage on scientific reasoning. This project will build on existing resources to develop an assessment instrument and a knowledge base on scientific reasoning. The proposed research and development will include the development of a set of standardized assessment instruments on scientific reasoning, a knowledge base ranging from senior elementary school to undergraduate college illuminating the development of students' scientific reasoning, and a community website to archive, share, and disseminate the resources and to sustain future research and development in education that promotes scientific reasoning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Assessment in scientific reasoning (SR) is an important but less developed field. Existing assessment instruments do not provide enough coverage on scientific reasoning. A developed ability in SR is important for students to effectively learn in an inquiry environment and for teachers to effectively deliver inquiry based teaching. This project brings advancement in this much needed area. The assessment tool and the research outcomes can be widely used in teaching and learning of all STEM disciplines.  Broad Impacts  Fostering studentsÆ scientific reasoning ability is one of the major goals of modern day education. To develop studentsÆ capacity in SR, it is important to provide researchers and teachers valid easy-to-use assessment tools on scientific reasoning, which can be used to develop, evaluate and implement science curricula that target scientific reasoning. The assessment tool can also be used to improve the quality of teacher preparation courses that enable teachers to more effectively implement inquiry based curricula and impact learners at all ages.  Through this research project, a comprehensive assessment instrument on scientific reasoning was developed and tested for large scale applications. The results have brought advancement in the resources and literature on assessment and learning in scientific reasoning. Since scientific reasoning is a general ability and highly emphasized area, the research outcomes and products can be used in all STEM education areas to make long term sustained impact on teaching and learning, catalyzing the transformation of current education from content oriented teaching to ability fostering to produce a more competitive next generation workforce.  Summary of Outcomes  This project builds on the existing resources to develop a new assessment instrument on scientific reasoning. The instrument is then used to compare traditional and inquiry based curriculum to investigate if scientific reasoning abilities can be developed through formal education at different ages. Through the research, baseline results have also been established for students from middle school to college levels, which can be used by educators to evaluate their specific education programs.   The new assessment instrument, named as "Inquiry for Scientific Thinking and Reasoning" (iSTAR), contains three versions for college students, pre-service teachers, and middle and high school students. All versions are designed to assess 9 skill dimensions on reasoning on quantitative and proportional relations, control of variables, basic probability, correlation, integrated hypothesis testing, hypothetical deductive thinking, statistical probability, causation, conditional relation and inference.  Large scale surveys using the iSTAR instrument have shown that in current education settings, students in middle and high schools typically achieve 30%-50% proficiency, while college students typically achieve 40%-60% proficiency.  A controlled study on curriculum intervention in introductory college level physics courses using inquiry based physics labs has shown that traditional instruction didnÆt significantly improve studentsÆ scientific reasoning skills. The normalized percentage gain is only 2.5% on average. On the other hand, the same courses using inquiry based physics labs achieved 14% gains on average. This results confirmed that using inquiry based curriculum can improve studentsÆ ability in scientific reasoning.  This research also conducted a case study on student reasoning in control of variables, which is a core foundation for more advanced scientific reasoning such as hypothesis testing and decision making. This study has discovered and validated a developmental progression of control of variable skills from student ability to handle simple controls for situations involving just a few variables, to student ability to handle situations involving complex multivariable controls and causal analysis.
