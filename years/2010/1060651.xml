<AbstractNarration>In the Scholarships for Science and Technology Careers project, Milwaukee Area Technical College (MATC) is providing scholarships to students in three cohorts of approximately 12 students each.  Scholarship recipients are academically-talented, economically disadvantaged students enrolled in MATC's Chemical Technology, Civil Engineering Technology, Electronics Technology, Mechanical Design Technology, Information Technology (IT) Network Specialist, and IT Programming/Analyst Associate in Science Degree programs.  Within the Electronics Technology program, students can graduate with an AAS specialty of Computer Electronics Technology, Biomedical Electronics Technology, and Electronic Engineering Technology.  Students in these programs are targeted due to consistent demand for graduates, growth in local industries, and the needs identified by local economic development initiatives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A college-wide, interdisciplinary team of qualified faculty and staff - all experienced in mentoring, advising, financial aid, and assessment - is administering the project, which has the following objectives:&lt;br/&gt;     -  To increase the number of academically talented, economically disadvantaged freshmen entering STEM Associate Degree programs;&lt;br/&gt;     -  To attract underrepresented women and minorities into STEM careers;&lt;br/&gt;     -  To provide financial support and reduce the need for outside employment;&lt;br/&gt;     -  To deliver academic and individualized support and enrichment experiences designed to increase program retention/completion;&lt;br/&gt;     -  To prepare students for transition into careers or baccalaureate degrees; and &lt;br/&gt;     -  To enhance recruitment of students into another major program on campus entitled "Biochemical Excellence in Science and Technology (BEST)."&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scholarship recipients have access to all MATC support structures as well as additional innovations in services designed to further their success.  For example, pre-testing for at-risk factors, assessments and case management enables early interventions.  Moreover, a core curriculum is being re-sequenced and technical skills social groupings are employed to develop cohorts among the interdisciplinary, urban commuter students.  Participants all have opportunities to help plan and attend scientific conferences and professional meetings.  Internships are available to give participants real-life experiences, and business mentors are helping the scholarship recipients transition into careers or baccalaureate programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of the NSF S-STEM  project, Scholarships for Science and Technology Careers, at the Milwaukee Area Technical College (MATC) was to increase the number of academically talented, economically disadvantaged freshmen (with attention to underrepresented women and minorities) entering STEM Associate Degree programs and prepare them to transition into jobs or baccalaureate degree programs. How did the funds provided achieve the goal of increasing the numbers of students with STEM Associates degrees? By providing financial support to these students so as to reduce the need for outside employment; by delivering individual (advising/mentoring) and academic (tutoring) supports; and lastly, by providing students with mentoring on job placement or continuing onto a baccalaureate STEM degree or both.  For each program year the accomplishments as listed by the PI and co-PI?s are provided.  2016-2017  Awarded 13 student scholarships in Fall 2016.  Awarded 11 students scholarships in Spring 2017.  Of the 13 scholarship students in Fall of 2016, 5 were female and 7 were minority students.  Of the 13 scholarship students in Fall of 2016, 11 continued to Spring 2017 and 2 were released from the scholarship for academic performance.  11 students returned for Spring 2017 of which 4 were female and 6 were minority students.  Of the 11 scholarship students in Spring 2017 5 graduated 6 remain active at MATC.  Of the 5 graduated 4 are employed and 3 are enrolled in baccalaureate degrees.     2015-2016  The Office of Institutional Research identified all students currently admitted to the college in one of the approved STEM programs.  A report was generated with these students' names, ID's, Program of Study, contact email address.  The faculty member then reached out to each of those students (approximately 600 students).    Students were provided with details of this scholarship opportunity, the criteria, and the timeline for application.  A link was also provided to them for an electronic application.  This was all done during the fall semester.  From this large group of students, we were able to review applications and award 15 scholarships for the spring semester.  This was the largest group of students to be awarded scholarships.  This recruitment also resulted in our most diverse group of students, with one third of the awards going to female students.     2014-2015  A committee reviewed 27 applications, confirmed full-time enrollment and GPA, which narrowed down the pool to 17. Of the remaining 17, the committee evaluated the applications, and then selected 10 students to award scholarships. Of the 10, 2 students did not have the financial eligibility, as defined by the FAFSA and the grant, so 8 scholarships were awarded for use in the Spring semester of 2014-15.     2013-2014  Efforts in 2013-14 focused on recruitment of non-traditional students.  A secondary focus was to link the scholarship students with existing student organizations and support activities on campus.  Linking these students to existing activities provides opportunities for students that we cannot otherwise provide to a small cohort.  The number of scholarships awarded was again very small.  However, of the four new scholarships awarded, three of the students are non-traditional - either female or minority students.  In the cohort of students that were working on the second year of their program, we retained 5 of the original 6 students.  Of those 5 students, 2 are non-traditional.     2012-2013  In this first year, the most significant result is that all six students are passing their courses and have been retained, and are continuing in their program of study.  Out of these six students, one is female, and one is a declared minority student.     2011-2012  Planning Year  Milwaukee Public Schools (MPS) reviewed drafts of the scholarship application, developed by the PI and provided feedback on modifications.  PI, Terese Dressel, met several times with the MATC's Manager of Financial Aid and the Director of Recruitment, Assessment and Employment Services. In addition, the PI will be working with the Student Services Specialists in Recruitment as well as the one in Technology and Applied Sciences.   As a part of the planning process, the PI and key personnel developed scholarship guidelines and an application that will be disseminated to the College's Financial Aid department, academic divisions that include Liberal Arts, Business and Technology and Applied Sciences. In addition,  the application was shared with MATC's Tech Prep and Non-traditional Occupations coordinators. The application has also been distributed to external K-12 school districts, such as the Milwaukee Public Schools and the South Shore Consortium (e.g., Cudahy, Oak Creek, K-12 districts).  As another part of the development process, the Associate Dean of Liberal Arts and Sciences and the PI have begun work on setting up the schedule for cohort students in the project. They're exploring means of connecting common blocks of time across the ten identified programs in the project. These blocks of time will be used for the general education courses in the curriculum.          Last Modified: 04/30/2018       Submitted by: Thomas P Heraly]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
