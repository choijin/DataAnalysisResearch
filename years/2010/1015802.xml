<AbstractNarration>Non-volatile memories such as flash memory, Phase Change Memory and Magnetic Memory have the characteristics of low-cost, non-volatility, shock-resistivity and power-economy. Because non-volatile memory consumes less idle power than DRAM by orders of magnitude, achieves fast start-up time and can be twice as dense as DRAM, it is desirable for the computing system industry to use these memories not only as non-volatile storage, but also as main memory. In order to make it possible, however, we need answers to two challenges: The first one is the issue of lifetime and the second is the slowness of write activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to develop solutions to these problems by reducing write activities on non-volatile memory through software optimization and hardware support, which lead to the practical adoption of non-volatile main memory in mobile and embedded systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, consisting of 3 groups of tasks, considers various types of platforms with single core or multiple cores. The type of cache on each platform can be either a hardware controlled cache or a software controlled one. Best cache consistency protocol is studied so that the required write activities to main memory are minimized. This project develops techniques including Write-Aware Scheduling, Recomputation, and Data Migration. These techniques will be combined to yield the best results on various platforms.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: The engineers need to learn how to design the new-generation of embedded systems with non-volatile memory. This project will provide effective tools and solutions to the general engineers.</AbstractNarration>
