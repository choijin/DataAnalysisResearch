<AbstractNarration>A new and unusual set of hydrothermal vents that are the deepest yet discovered and that are hosted in unusual rock types on the seafloor have been found recently on the Cayman Rise in the Caribbean Sea by an international teams of scientists from the US and UK.  This project is a joint activity between NSF and NASA that follows up on this discovery and allows the geochemical and biological sampling and analysis of these unique systems.  One of the sites to be explored is the Piccard vent field which at 5000 meters water depth is the deepest hydrothermal vent site known.  It has evidence for phase separation at the seafloor and may host the hottest vent temperatures ever measured (in excess of 450C).  The other is the von Damm vent site which is hosted in ultramafic rocks and has chimneys made of sulfides instead of carbonates, making it distinctly different from the well studied Lost Cities vent system which is also hosted in ultramafic rocks.  Researchers funded by NSF will sample vent and near vent fluid chemistry, examine chimney mineralogy, and the local geological setting.  A focus will be to determine the extent to which organic compounds are being made through abiotic geochemical processes.  Researchers funded by NASA will sample the microbial and macrobiological life forms that inhabit these extreme environments and link their findings to the site geochemistry.  Comparisons will be made with other known vent systems.  Broader impacts of the work include student and postdoc training and significant public outreach through engagement of National Geographic which intends to feature this research on their Oceanus television program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project investigated the geology and geochemistry of two new seafloor hot-springs that we had recently discovered on the deep ocean floor along a mid-ocean ridge (the volcanically active boundary between tectonic plates) known as the Mid Cayman Rise, situated in the Western Caribbean just south of the Cayman Islands and Cuba.  The two vent-sites studied, named Piccard and Von Damm were each unique compared to all other previously studied hydrothermal fields (hydro- = water, -thermal = hot).  The Piccard site is the worldÃ†s deepest known vent field.  At 5000 m deep it is more than 1000 m deeper than the previous record holder.  This means that not only is the vent-site under much higher pressure than all other known vents but, as a result, the fluids emitted as "black smokers" from the seafloor can reach much higher temperatures (measured temperatures are close to 400&deg;C as they exit the seabed but, we predict, reach maximum reaction temperatures above 500&deg;C deep within the underlying rocks).  These high temperatures, in turn, give rise to unusual chemical compositions compared to other vent-sites.  Not only are they rich in metals like iron, copper and zinc, that form large, and potentially economically valuable ore deposits on the seafloor, but they are also rich in hydrogen which can mix and react with CO2 in the fluids to produce a chemical called formate (a simple molecule made up of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen) which is widely recognized as one of the key building blocks for life.  While there has long been a theory, backed up by synthetic laboratory experiments, that formate could be formed spontaneously under some specific and rare circumstances at the seafloor, our project is the first to have shown that it does actually happen in nature.  Remarkably we also showed that reactions that can generate formate are also active in a completely different geologic setting at the Von Damm vent-site, located just 20km away on the same plate boundary &ndash; but at much shallower depths and pressures (around 2300 m deep instead of 5000 m).  At Von Damm, what is special is not the high temperatures that are seen at Piccard - here, the hottest fluids are only just above 200&deg;C which is rather cool compared to many seafloor hot springs.  Instead, what is special about the Von Damm site is that it sits atop some heavily fractured and faulted rocks that have been dragged up to the seafloor along long-lived (millions of years) fractures.  So rocks that were initially formed kilometers below the seafloor, and are quite unlike the lavas erupted along most mid-ocean ridges, can now react with seawater at high temperatures just beneath the ocean/rock interface.  What is most significant about our work, therefore, is that we have found not just one, but two distinct forms of seafloor venting that each provide a natural laboratory for on-going and future work at which scientists (ourselves included) can investigate whether or not such seafloor hydrothermal systems, in early Earth history, might have had a role to play in the origins of life.
