<AbstractNarration>This is a collaborative project involving four institutions. The proposed research addresses two major questions related to climate in the eastern Alaskan Arctic: 1) How has climate, terrestrial ecology, and pollutant transport changed over the past 250 years in this region, based on ice core reconstructions from McCall Glacier? and 2) How well can we overcome the challenges of core proxy interpretations from ice cores taken from small polythermal valley glaciers through modern-process studies? To answer these questions the investigators conduct an inter-disciplinary analysis of ice core proxies, atmospheric dynamics, modern processes, and numerical ice flow modeling. A 152-meter long core has already been drilled through McCall Glacier and analyzed for 35 chemical proxies. The proposed work will focus on 1) interpretation of these proxies, 2) analysis of pollen in the core, 3) process studies to identify sources of pollen to McCall Glacier, 4) tying the weather and climate record of the past 50 years to the upper section of the core, 5) continuing 3D flow modeling of the glacier and local weather observations, 6) conducting modern process investigations of the effects of seasonal melt on the generation of the core proxy record. The project will support two graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of the project is to understand the climate dynamics of the eastern Alaskan Arctic over the past 200 years through analysis of an ice core extracted from McCall Glacier in 2008.  To accomplish this we studied modern weather on the glacier, modern synoptic climate, pollutant transport, modern processes related to our core proxies, the densification of firn, and how our records related to similar records throughout the Arctic.  Our work has led to advancements in the study of core proxy measurement, proxy-climate transfer functions, and related field techniques.  Our core studies relating to modern climate dynamics have found correlations with the North Pacific Index and Aleutian low, volcanic eruptions, nuclear bomb testing, the Clean Air Act, Arctic Ocean sea ice reduction, Asian industrialization, and much more.  By building transfer functions with modern synoptic climate, we are able to determine annual differences in the pre-modern era of warmer-colder, wetter-drier, sunnier-cloudier, and wind direction.  However, our overarching outcome was that we have successfully demonstrated that ice cores from valley glaciers contain useful paleoclimate information that can be extracted and exploited for climate signals not found in polar ice sheets due to their geographic location and thus we now have good reason to believe that we can improve our spatial density of core measurements globally through the use of valley glaciers.
