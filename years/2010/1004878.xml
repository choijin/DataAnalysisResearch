<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site led by Angela K. Wilson and Robby A. Petros at the University of North Texas for three summers, commencing in 2010.  The site will support eight students per summer in a ten week program.  The majority of the research projects focus on topics in computational chemistry.  Sample projects include:  (1)  the development of embedded composite methods (Wilson); (2)  the combinatorial synthesis of protein-decorated nanoparticles for potential use in targeted drug-delivery (Petros); (3)  the computational study of terminal metal carbide complexes (Cundari); (4)  the physicochemical study of salvation (Acree); (5)  the computation of electronic structure and reactivity in organometallic complexes (Borden); (6) the computation of accurate electronic potential energy surfaces to develop a better understanding of fast gas-phase reactions, like those taking place in chemical vapor deposition (Marshall); (7) the acquisition and analysis of microwave spectra of interesting small molecules (Cooke); and (8) studies of the synthesis and properties of silver nanoparticles (Omary).     In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a number of professional development activities, including a quantum chemistry "Bootcamp," industrial outreach trips, and instruction in technical writing and scientific ethics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Young scientists need exposure to modern research methods and tools as part of their training.  This REU site aims to provide cutting-edge research training in computational chemistry to a significant number of students who might not otherwise have this opportunity.  The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site will be well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ BROADER IMPACT. The high-quality research experiences and scientific training that undergraduates gained in this REU site has provided 32 students during the grant period with the opportunity to experience, in many cases for the first time, how chemistry is done outside of the classroom and teaching laboratory. This experience is critical to building the nationÆs future scientific workforce, particularly a more diverse future workforce.  With the professional skills and training offered by this program, in addition to opportunities for integrated research in experiment and computation, students are becoming better prepared leaders for their careers, which will likely increasingly require a greater working knowledge of both computational and experimental methods - training provided by this program. In addition to the impact the program has on the studentsÆ individual success and the success of the future workforce, the students impact topical fields of chemical research, working in areas ranging from metal organic frameworks to catalysis, and publishing their work for dissemination to the broader scientific community.  INTELLECTUAL MERIT.  The UNT Chemistry Department has provided REU participants with a stimulating research experience at the interface of computational and experimental chemistry. Students increased their fundamental knowledge of chemistry while making substantial scientific contributions to research projects that encompass several topic areas in chemistry, including the design of nanomaterials for solar cells, establishment of protocols in forensic chemistry, catalysis, materials modeling, photochemistry, atmospheric chemistry, and others.  The program has been highly subscribed with ~910 applications for the program's 32 positions, indicating a great need for such training opportunities for undergraduate students.  ~40% of the participants were from underrepresented populations.  &gt;60% of the participants have pursued or are pursuing graduate studies.  17 publications in scientific journals resulted, with additional publications anticipated.
