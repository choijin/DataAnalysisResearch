<AbstractNarration>An award has been made to Indiana University - Purdue University at Indianapolis (IUPUI) to establish an Undergraduate Research and Mentoring (URM) program. The program will provide two-year research experiences in biological signaling to four cohorts of fellows, starting in the spring of 2011 and continuing through spring 2015. Each cohort consists of 4-5 students who will be trained through a multi-mentoring scheme in research related to the ability of life to respond to the environment and communicate essential information. Student projects will be drawn from research on biological signaling at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels with emphasis on quantitative biology and computational modeling. Project objectives include  positioning the URM fellows to (1) demonstrate an understanding of how to conduct scientific research, apply principles of ethical and responsible conduct of research, and engage in scholarship; (2) be academically prepared for graduate study in the biological sciences and related disciplines; (3) be confident individuals with positive attitudes about themselves and their careers; and (4) be able to think critically and communicate effectively using both oral and written forms. Students can choose from topics such as the role of lipids in signal transduction and development, biological function of intrinsically disordered proteins, signal reception and responses to stresses in plants, modeling of protein structure and interactions or structure-based prediction of transcription-factor binding sites, among other projects.  The impact and success of the IUPUI-URM program will be measured using formative evaluation on aspects related to the planning and implementation of the project and a summative evaluation to assess the degree to which the project goals and objectives have been met.  More information is available at http://crl.iupui.edu/index.asp, or by contacting Stephen Randall (srandal@iupui.edu ) or Brenda Blacklock (bblacklo@iupui.edu).</AbstractNarration>

As of 2016, the URM Fellows have produced 84 posters or oral presentations at both regional and national meetings, and were co-authors on 6 peer-reviewed (or other) published papers. Program assessment by way of surveys of fellows and research mentors demonstrated that through their involvement with the program, URM Fellows developed research skills; knowledge of biological signaling; and confidence in their knowledge of science and ability to conduct research.

We employed a multi-year immersion in interdisciplinary basic research in Biological Signaling; defined as the ability to respond to the environment and communicate information at the organismal, tissue, cellular, intracellular, or molecular level.  Approaches ranged from studying the behavior of whole organisms to biochemical, biophysical, electrophysiological, and molecular analyses of signaling mechanisms.

A rich and holistic research experience was provided that inculcated students with the enthusiasm and skills to complete their B.S. and to matriculate into excellent M.S. and Ph.D. programs.  Starting with a mentoring pool of nineteen faculty who had extensive experience mentoring undergrads, we added an additional eleven faculty over the course of the project (due to attrition or simply to contribute additional added expertise) whose home departments included Biology, Chemistry &amp; Chemical Biology, Physics, Computational Biology &amp; Bioinformatics, Psychology, Informatics, Computer and Information Science, Mathematics, Cell and Integrative Physiology, and Biomedical Engineering; representing the IUPUI Schools of Engineering, Science, Informatics, and Medicine. Key components of the organizational structure of the program included 1) a Faculty (mentor) Orientation.  2) a Summer Introductory Camp (introduced the theme of biological signaling and enabled students understand how their particular project related to others through the theme and a laboratory safety program).  The camp was intended to imbue students with the expectations and standards of the program and led into the 9-week intensive (40 h per week) summer activities.  3) the Summer Research Program - Students engaged in a faculty mentor-lead project culminating in their writing an approximately 5 page research paper and presenting a research poster.  4) Academic year activities that keyed into science - Students spent an average of 10 hr/wk in labs, continuing to develop research skills with a goal to present results at on-campus symposia, undergraduate research meetings, or professional venues.  5) Regular cohort meetings were conducted by the Co-Directors to facilitate key student development elements (both summer and academic year).  In addition to weekly meetings coordinated by the research mentors in each laboratory, these meetings provided a forum for understanding and integrating the interdisciplinary theme of biological signaling emerging through their work, developing writing and speaking skills, graduate program exploration and application, faculty-mentor communication, and ethics of responsible research and bioethics discussions.  Fellows also learned to help each other achieve their goals in and out of the program and developed a camaraderie of support that extended well beyond the boundaries of this program. The ongoing friendships and advocacy that developed were heartening to see.  6) Regular meetings were held between the Co-Directors and mentees for academic counseling, goal setting, and monitoring and supporting academic progress.  RESULTS: From a total applicant pool of 70 individuals of under-represented status, the IUPUI URM program supported a total of 28 students (Figures 1-3, attached pdf) for a total of 40.3 student years (most students were supported for multiple years).  The Fellows were supported in this program by twenty participating mentors in Biology, Chemistry &amp; Chemical Biology, Physics, Psychology, Biomedical Engineering, and Cellular &amp; Integrative Physiology.  Six program alumni are currently in Ph.D. or M.D./Ph.D. research-based programs, four are in or have already completed an M.S. program, six are in medical school or health professional schools, and three are employed locally in science research positions (These latter "gap year" students may or may not enter an M.S. or Ph.D. program in the future). Counting only those URM Fellows who have completed their Bachelors degree (nineteen), 80% are in or have completed graduate programs and an additional 10% intend to apply to programs soon.
