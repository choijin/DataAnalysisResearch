<AbstractNarration>Chronological datasets that span large periods of time are the focus&lt;br/&gt;of study in several diverse disciplines: climatology, geology,&lt;br/&gt;biology, history, and anthropology, to name just a few. While these&lt;br/&gt;datasets share strong links to time scales, they exhibit a great&lt;br/&gt;diversity in most other aspects.  For example, some datasets are&lt;br/&gt;derived from ice cores, while others arise from archaeological&lt;br/&gt;artifacts, instrumental records, and numerical modeling.  In each&lt;br/&gt;discipline, researchers have spent considerable effort to carefully&lt;br/&gt;developing a time scale for each such dataset, and to interpreting the&lt;br/&gt;resulting temporal data, in turn leading to scientific insights.  Such&lt;br/&gt;chronological datasets are growing rapidly in both size and diversity,&lt;br/&gt;due to not only increasing activity by scientists worldwide but also&lt;br/&gt;improving technology.  The integration and analysis of this large and&lt;br/&gt;diverse collection of datasets promises to yield significant&lt;br/&gt;scientific breakthroughs. However, such integration and analysis&lt;br/&gt;currently requires a very significant human effort, which severely&lt;br/&gt;restricts our ability to realize its potential value.  Most of the&lt;br/&gt;analysis techniques developed in the past do not scale up to the size&lt;br/&gt;and diversity of data we must now analyze. The goal of this project is&lt;br/&gt;to break this barrier to scientific breakthroughs by developing&lt;br/&gt;methods to solve the problems arising from the diversity and volume of&lt;br/&gt;data, and to implement, test, and apply these methods in an&lt;br/&gt;interactive workbench.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Developing the above workbench requires work in multiple&lt;br/&gt;cyberinfrastructure research topics, which by themselves have received&lt;br/&gt;considerable research attention.  By their nature, however, these&lt;br/&gt;topics do not admit many universal solutions and there is currently a&lt;br/&gt;large gap separating the generalized results available in the&lt;br/&gt;informatics literature and their realization in operational systems&lt;br/&gt;that are ready for use by domain scientists. Our effort will focus on&lt;br/&gt;bridging this gap by adapting and specializing known methods, and&lt;br/&gt;developing new ones when needed, to the characteristics of the&lt;br/&gt;chronological data of interest. This work is not limited to the task&lt;br/&gt;of implementing cyberinfrastructure for the described domains based on&lt;br/&gt;known methods.  Rather, the work requires research effort to map&lt;br/&gt;concepts and techniques from computer science to various scientific&lt;br/&gt;domains, and vice versa, carefully adapting prior results and&lt;br/&gt;developing new ones. This work requires not only expertise on both the&lt;br/&gt;cyberinfrastructure and domain sciences sides of the gap, but also a&lt;br/&gt;close- knit collaboration that can overcome traditional inter-domain&lt;br/&gt;barriers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By enabling effective use of the large and diverse collection of&lt;br/&gt;chronological data, our workbench opens the door to scientific&lt;br/&gt;breakthroughs in multiple disciplines. As just one specific example,&lt;br/&gt;our workbench will improve our understanding of one of the most&lt;br/&gt;important scientific and societal problems: the operation of the&lt;br/&gt;global climate system, past, present, and future. In addition to&lt;br/&gt;enhancing the effectiveness of the scientists specializing in each&lt;br/&gt;discipline, our work will allow researchers from other disciplines,&lt;br/&gt;and people with a more casual interest, to easily access and,&lt;br/&gt;importantly, process and interpret the same data from which key&lt;br/&gt;research results and forecasts emerge. This aspect is particularly&lt;br/&gt;important as it demystifies the related research that may otherwise&lt;br/&gt;appear arbitrary or opinionated. Shared examples will be traceable by&lt;br/&gt;others all the way back to raw data. Our results will be disseminated&lt;br/&gt;not only through the traditional professional channels but also&lt;br/&gt;through outreach to the broader community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal of this project was improving the effectiveness of the data-management workflow in order to advance climate-change research.  All aspects of the data workflow are considered, including acquisition, cleaning and verification, processing using built-in, user-defined, and external functions, interactive exploration and visualization, and conventional rendering as charts and other graphics.  The focus is primarily on large, four-dimensional climate datasets that span vastly different periods of time and spatial domains.  While these datasets share the characteristic of a strong link to a time scale, they exhibit a great diversity in many other aspects. For example, some datasets are derived from physical and chemical properties of ice cores, while others arise from numerical modeling of various physical phenomena such as atmospheric and oceanic circulations and glacier dynamics, along with instrumental records. The integration and analysis of this large and diverse collection of datasets promises to yield significant scientific breakthroughs. However, such integration and analysis currently requires a very significant human effort, which severely restricts our ability to realize its potential value. Most of the analysis techniques developed in the past do not scale up to the size and diversity of data we must now analyze.  The goal of this project was to break this barrier to scientific breakthroughs by developing methods to solve the problems arising from the diversity and volume of data, and to implement, test, and apply these methods embodied in an interactive workbench.  We have designed and implemented an interactive software workbench for working with chronological datasets.  While our focus has been on climate science data sets, our work is also applicable to other data sets that have a strong chronological component.  A key feature of our work is that it allows a researcher to interactively explore the data at all stages, ranging from the initial data importing to various transformations and computations, to the generation of publication-quality graphics.  Our approach is not limited to any predefined set of tools (although we provide several).  Rather, researchers can interactively compose existing tools to generate new ones as they learn more about the data.  While our work has addressed many research topics, it is also noteworthy that our workbench is in operational use by several researchers.  The system is very stable and we have received very positive feedback from students and staff members who use the system for managing their datasets.  Along the way, we developed many software tools and underlying methods.  Some of these are useful on their own as well.  For example, we developed methods for developing robust Web applications using  ReST (representational state transfer).  These methods are used Web sites we have developed, such as 10green.org and icereader.org.       Last Modified: 12/30/2015       Submitted by: Sudarshan S Chawathe]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
