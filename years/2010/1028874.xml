<AbstractNarration>SES-1028874&lt;br/&gt;PI: Sara M. McLanahan&lt;br/&gt;Co-PI: Daniel J. Schneider&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Princeton University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study uses quantitative analyses of multiple data sets to chart changes in the timing of wealth acquisition and marriage across cohorts. It estimates how individuals' and potential partners' wealth holdings relate to propensity to marry. It examines if inequalities in wealth ownership by race and education may explain disparities in marriage entry by race and education. And, it leverages recent exogenous shifts in wealth holdings brought on by the economic crisis to generate better causal estimates of the link between wealth and marriage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This research has the potential of informing us that reduced marriage may stem not from a lack of enthusiasm for marriage, but rather from structural constraints in the context of widely shared aspirations to marry. Additionally, family policy and asset policy have both been areas of recent activity but have largely stood as separate silos. The proposed research bridges these two important areas of policymaking.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ American marriage has changed in important ways over the latter half of the twentieth century and in the first decades of the twenty first century.  Marriage is increasingly delayed and even forgone with those changes particularly pronounced for African Americans and those with relatively less education. These changes are intertwined with increases in non-marital cohabitation and fertility.  In concert, these demographic shifts have important implications for inequality as those who are already disadvantaged increasingly marry later and less, leading to less exposure to the benefits that marriage appears to confer on both children and adults.   Scholars of the family have long focused on how education, employment, and earnings affect individualsÃ† likelihoods of marriage.  However, recent qualitative and ethnographic research suggests that to adequately understand current patterns of marriage entry, scholars must look beyond these characteristics to consider the role of wealth in union formation.  This project takes a comprehensive and multidimensional approach to examining the link between wealth and the transition to marriage.  The first paper employs data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth &ndash; 1979 to model the relationship between the ownership of key personal assets and transition to first marriage. These analyses suggest that ownership of a car and financial assets for men and a car and other assets for women is positively related to entry into first marriages and that accounting for gaps in wealth ownership by race and education explains a portion of the marital divides along those same axes of differentiation.  The second empirical chapter draws on data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study to model the relationship between wealth and marriage in the contemporary period for a sample of disadvantaged parents who were unmarried at the birth of their children.  This work finds additional evidence of a link between asset ownership and marriage entry.  However, there is little evidence that asset ownership is related to entry into cohabitation or that access to other economic resources can take the place of assets for marriage. The final paper uses a novel data source to assess how wealth losses during the Great Recession may have impacted plans to marry and finds evidence that men and women who have lost wealth are more likely to plan to delay marriage.
