<AbstractNarration>This postdoctoral research fellowship focuses on the role of both warming and drying of soils on ecosystem carbon balance in upland tussock tundra in Alaska?s discontinuous permafrost zone. The PI hypothesizes that as tundra soil carbon reserves are exposed to higher temperatures and drier conditions, greater organic matter degradation will occur and CO2 fluxes to the atmosphere will increase. The proposed research involves experimental manipulations of both soil temperature and water table depth, in experimental plots that already have been established for a warming experiment. In addition to examining the additional effect of drying, and the combined effect of drying and warming, on the magnitude of CO2 fluxes, the PI will (1) measure the carbon-14 signature of the respired CO2 to determine the ?age? of the organic matter that is being decomposed, (2) investigate the contribution of deep versus shallow soil layers to CO2 fluxes, and (3) examine consequences of increased soil decomposition on nutrient cycling and plant growth. Results will be disseminated at conferences, in peer-reviewed publications, and through public outreach lectures. The PI will mentor undergraduates in the sponsoring scientist?s laboratory, and work with both graduate and undergraduate students in the field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Overview  Northern high latitude ecosystems play an important role in the global carbon cycle because cold, moist, and frozen soils restrict the breakdown of organic material (dead plants and animals). This very slow decay rate has caused carbon to build up in the Arcticduring the past thousands of years.  Warming air temperatures are causing tundra soils and permafrost (perennially frozen ground) to become warmer and dryer. As a result, the large pool of stored carbon may be transferred to the atmosphere as the greenhouse gasses carbon dioxide and methane.  The goal of this project was to examine effects of warming and drying on ecosystem carbon balance in tundra in Interior Alaska.      Research activities and findings  In the first year of this project, the experimental drying plots were designed and installed (Figure 1).  Soil drying was achieved using an automated pumping system that lowered the water table in twelve experimental plots. The drying plots were located within the footprint of the Carbon in Permafrost Experimental Heating Research (CiPEHR) project, a warming and permafrost thaw experiment in Alaska.  In year two of this project, carbon dioxide exchange between the ecosystem and the atmosphere was continuously measured during the growing season. Other variables measured included wintertime respiration, plant growth, fruit production and leaf phenology (the timing of leaf out and senescence), decomposition, thaw depth, soil moisture and temperature.   Results showed that there was an increase in plant growth when soils were warmed and permafrost thawed without drying, which resulted in an increase in growing season carbon uptake.  However, drying caused a decrease in carbon uptake by plants and an increase in the breakdown of soil organic matter by microbes.  The decline in growing season carbon uptake and increase in microbial decomposition in the warmed and dried plots resulted in a net loss of carbon from the ecosystem to the atmosphere on an annual basis.      Education and outreach activities  In addition to my post-doctoral training, this fellowship project trained several undergraduates and field assistants.  I served as a mentor and undergraduate thesis advisor to two University of Florida (UF) undergraduate students, one of whom received funding from UF to work on this experiment in Alaska. Student research was presented at university-wide and regional scientific meetings, and resulted in a manuscript collaboration.  I also worked closely with field assistants, one of whom is now a masterÆs student at UF working on a project focused on winter respiration from the warming and drying experiments.   The primary goals of my outreach activities were to: make scientific research more accessible to K-12 students and the general public; educate students about the connection between arctic processes and other regions; provide ongoing conversation and training in climate change research.  To achieve these goals, I hosted a PolarTREC (Teachers and Researchers Exploring and Collaborating) teacher, Mr. John Wood, at my field site for six weeks in 2011 and six weeks in 2012.  While in the field, Mr. Wood communicated with hundreds of K-12 students and the general public through daily blogs and an online question-answer forum.  In addition, we participated in several live webinar events, which focused on our research activities and which were attended by 100+ K-12 students, the general public, and education professionals.  My experience with PolarTREC resulted in an ongoing collaboration with Mr. Wood and has enhanced my interactions with students and other members of the local community in Alaska (Figure 4, summary of activities below).
