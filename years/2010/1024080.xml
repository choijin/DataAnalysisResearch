<AbstractNarration>This project will focus on developing Bayes factors, a methodology that is an alternative to traditional statistical testing.  Bayes factors have a natural advantage over classical frequentist hypothesis testing methods in that they can assess the evidence both for and against a null hypothesis.  Bayesian analysis, however, relies on a degree of prior information supplied by the investigator.  This prior specification can be viewed as representation of the investigator's belief in the state of nature before collecting data, and this degree of subjectivity has been a major criticism of Bayesian analysis.  The project will develop so-called "default" methods that both minimize the reliance on this subjectivity and also provide optimal statistical properties in testing both for and against the null hypothesis.  The theoretical study of Bayes factors will guide the choice of default prior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The physical sciences have made gains by demonstrating that certain relationships hold across all conditions.  These kinds of relationships can be termed invariant.  Some social and behavioral sciences, in contrast, traditionally discover new theories by demonstrating that experimental manipulations produce altered responses rather than by proving that the response is unchanged.  Conventional statistical methodology has been developed to prove that responses are not invariant to stimuli, but these tools are ill-suited to proving invariance.  In addition to the development of a Bayesian alternative to classical statistical testing, the project will develop software and make it available through web applets so that researchers can easily use the new statistical tools.  It is anticipated that these new developments will make Bayes factors useful and common in a number of fields, including epidemiology, economics, psychology, wildlife, and biology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The project has three major goals: 1. Development of objective Bayes-factor methodology for common experimental designs and models including regression and ANOVA.  2. Development of objective Bayesian methodology for spatial-temporal models. 3. Development of software to make Bayes-factor methodologies straightforward and convenient for applied researchers and practitioners. All three goals pertain to advancing the statistical methodology known as Bayes factors, which are designed to improve on and replace many conventional statistical tests. In general, Bayesian methodology seeks to incorporate prior information in a logically consistent manner into statistical analysis. Such prior information is incorporated in a so-called prior distribution. Because of advances in computing, Bayesian methods have become practical and have seen widespread adoption, especially in problems involving estimation. However, statistical testing is an area where Bayesian methodology is less prevalent, for at least two reasons. Successful strategies for cases where prior information is not readily available have not been developed for many common problems, and there has been no widely available software. This project addresses both difficulties.  "Objective Bayesian analysis" is a branch of Bayesian statistics that seeks to provide widely acceptable prior distributions for situations when investigators are either unwilling or unable to provide their own prior distributions. The project focused on Bayes factors using suitable objective priors. The following results were obtained. The following results for Goal 1 were obtained: (i) Objective Bayes factors were developed for regression and ANOVA designs. In addition, major theoretical findings on Bayes factors for linear models were developed including a closed-form expression for the Bayes factor for an important class of independent Zellner-Siow g-priors. (ii) Meta-analytic Bayes factors were developed for assessing evidence across multiple experiments. (iii) For normal linear mixed models, it has been shown that when a fixed covariate is confounded with a random effect, bias is introduced into the calculation of the regression coefficient with the usual estimator. Moreover, the standard calculation of the variance is too small. Research explored ways of minimizing this effect, resulting in a dissertation and two submitted manuscripts. Finally, (iv) theoretical results on consistency of the Bayes factor for two-way ANOVA designs when either the number of levels for the second factor is large or the number of repeated observations is large were derived. For Goal 2, a long-standing problem has been to develop objective Bayes inference for spatially correlated data with and without nugget effects. (i) Objective priors for such cases were systematically studied. In addition to the Jeffreys priors and commonly used reference priors, two types of "exact" reference priors were derived based on improper marginal likelihoods, so an "equivalence" theorem is developed in the sense that the expectation of any function of the score functions of the marginal likelihood function can be taken under marginal likelihoods. Surprisingly, the two type exact reference priors are identical. The propriety of the marginal priors and joint posteriors were studied for a large class of objective priors including all the objective priors developed. Interestingly, various Jeffreys and reference priors yield improper posteriors.(ii) A second major class of outcomes pertains to models important in econometrics. Objective priors were proposed for restricted Vector Autoregressive (VAR) models. These priors permit efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling from the posterior of the VAR parameters and estimation of the Bayes factor. Numerical simulations show that when the sample size is small, the Bayes factor is more effective in selecting the correct model than the commonly used Schwarz criterion.
