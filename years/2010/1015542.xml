<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Based on research the PI collected with his Chinese collaborators in Beijing, they discovered that Chinese people who have moved more often were more socially independent and thought more analytically than their stable neighbors.  Previous research with Dr. Oishi at the University of Virginia has shown that people who have moved around a lot more (and even people in communities that have more movers than stable people) have more self-focused identities, rather than group-focused identities. For example, movers tend to describe personal themselves by their personal traits (intelligence, humorous), whereas stable people tend to describe themselves by group identities (church-goer, choir member). Our project showed that this is also true in China.  Prominent cultural psychologists Richard Nisbett and Shinobu Kitayama have also shown that independent people tend to think more abstractly and analytically than interdependent people. The theory is that the way people think is strongly connected to the way their social world is constructed. People in strongly bound social groups (as is common in China and Japan) tend to think more intuitively and "holistically," viewing formal logic as sometimes misleading and oversimplifying. People with more independent, loose ties tend to think more abstractly and analytically, using abstract logic and rules of non-contradiction. In sum: thought style follows social style.  Our research has shown that moving around makes people more independent, and that movers also think more analytically than non-movers. And our research in China showed that this is also true in China, even though China is a typically interdependent and intuitively-thinking culture. Thus, the power of moving seems to be quite strong and perhaps even universal.  Essentially, mobile Chinese people have psychological characteristics that are much more like Westerners than stable Chinese people. As China modernizes and moving becomes more common, Chinese people may become more socially independent and analytic thinkers. In a sense, Chinese minds may be slowly converging on the psychological characteristics of the highly industrialized world.  Of course, this is not to say that the Western way of thought is inevitable, but rather that Western thought is in many ways a product of our industrialized society. And as China modernizes and its society starts accommodating the demands of modern industrialization, office jobs, and modern communication/transportation, the Chinese people will probably show psychological characteristics similar to the rest of the industrialized world.
