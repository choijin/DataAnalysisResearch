<AbstractNarration>The Idaho Scholarships for Transfer Students program at Boise State University (BSU) provides approximately 50 scholarships in civil engineering, electrical engineering, materials science and engineering, mechanical engineering, computer science and mathematics. The overarching goals of the program are to decrease the time to graduate and increase retention for the transfer student cohort. Program objectives are to: 1) establish a transfer student cohort for engineering, computer science and mathematics stu-dents at Boise State University, 2) provide scholarships awards to the transfer student cohort ranging from $2,000 to $10,000 annually for up to four years, 3) implement programming to meet the needs of the transfer student cohort: ALEKS: a mathematics review strategy, 4) develop transfer student leader scholars from within the transfer student cohort, 5) use survey results from transfer students (to be conducted fall, 2010) to inform and adapt programming, and 6) integrate the transfer cohort into existing student support programs.  The strength of the intellectual merit for this project lies in the assembled project team who demonstrate success, commitment and leadership in innovative teaching techniques, undergraduate research, and student success. BSU builds on strong programs to recruit and retain underrepresented and nontraditional students. The program provides a supportive environment for experienced transfer students as well as to students that are transferring to Boise State University for the first time. The program provides specialized program content that is tailored to the needs of transfer students.  The broader impacts lie in the potential to provide a lasting legacy to the families whose sons and daughters receive scholarships, as most BSU students are first-generation degree seekers. Designed to increase the participation and retention of underrepresented groups in engineering, this program leverages existing student support efforts. It significantly raises the visibility and interest in the engineering, computer science and mathematics programs at BSU, resulting in an overall increase in the number of students pursuing these careers. Ultimately, this will result in enhanced economic growth in the Northwest.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Science Foundation supported 54 transfer students majoring in engineering, computer science and mathematics at Boise State University between 2011 and 2016. Prior to this award, there was no support available for incoming transfer students, despite a growing number of transfer students resulting from the establishment of the College of Western Idaho as a regional community college in 2007.     Awards were made to 54 qualified full time students pursuing degrees in engineering, computer science or mathematics. In addition to demonstrating financial need, qualifications included that the students be United States citizens or permanent residents and show academic talent with a minimum GPA of 3.0. Scholarships ranged from $3000 to $6000 per year. Students were supported for between one and four years, with the average length of award being four semesters. Eligibility requirements also required students have between 6 and 60 transfer credits from a community college or university.      A significant result of this program has been its 100% retention rate. This is a very strong result, given that internal data shows that for a variety of financial, personal and other reasons, between 2008 and 2012, 17% of all STEM juniors at Boise State University stopped out of the university for a semester or more.      In addition to improved retention, this program has delivered very strong graduation results, with an overall expected STEM degree attainment level of 100% with 91% (49/54) of the students having graduated as of fall 2015.   This may be compared with university-wide six and eight-year graduation rates of 28% and 34% (respectively, 2004 basis), and a six-year graduation rate for engineering and computer science majors (2006 basis) of 29%. Finally, students who received this scholarship are pursuing graduate degrees at approximately double the rate of STEM transfer students who did not receive the scholarship.      The program connected transfer students with university staff, faculty and resources. Prior work has shown the importance of early success in mathematics in terms of earning a good course grade, thus a focus in the proposal was placed on mathematics programming. The ALEKS online mathematics review program was promoted during transfer orientation and made available to students at no charge through the Idaho NSF STEP program. During this same time, improvements were underway in Calculus I funded through two other grants (NSF STEP and WIDER). These projects brought forth improvements in Calculus in terms of teaching, homework, timing of course content, grade computation and exam content. Faculty collaborated and devoted class time to working in small groups. Pre- and post-implementation of these changes revealed an increase in pass rate of 13.4% and a drop in withdrawal rate of 3.9%.     In order to provide convenient and continuous support of students, a "One Stop Shop" approach was developed. A Scholarship Coordinator who is a licensed professional engineer was designated to provide students with a single point of contact.  Conveniently located in the College of Engineering Advising Office, she assisted students with academic, career and financial needs. In addition to dedicated advising and career support, semi-regular monthly events were held on and off campus at a variety of times to allow for class schedules, commuting, family and work commitments. Activities consisted of a combination of social events (rock climbing and yoga), career development workshops on resumes, internships, research and career fair preparedness. A website along with email and a Facebook group were used to communicate information and details on event programming.      A post-survey showed that students report the scholarship as being critical to their timely graduation. A majority reported that the scholarship both eliminated the need for them to attend only part time and reduced their time to graduation. Students reported that the financial support was critical to their retention and graduation. The survey also confirmed students? desire for a combination of informal social and network activities as well as career focused opportunities. Overall for those that participated in the various events, 54% reported an event as being very beneficial with 75% of the respondents reporting events providing some benefit.      While students enjoyed the informal, active social events, and requested flexible programming, we recommend a more structured approach to event programming for transfer students in order to facilitate a formal cohort development in a streamlined structure such as a class or regular meeting time.
