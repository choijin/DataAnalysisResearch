<AbstractNarration>This project will study how natural selection shapes animal learning abilities.  It will manipulate two theoretically important attributes of a simplified "environment" across many generations.  The project will ask whether these environmental differences lead to enhanced or reduced learning abilities in populations of the fruit fly (Drosophila).  Learning is a basic mechanism of both human and non-human behavior, and investigators have long believed that changing environments select for learning abilities.  It has been difficult, however, to test claims like this because it is hard to measure or control "environmental change" over evolutionary time.  This research will use novel techniques to control environmental change over many generations and it will test hypotheses about the properties of change that select both for and against learning abilities.  It is expected that this project will generate lines of fruit flies (Drosophila) with varying degrees of learning ability, and that these lines of flies will be useful for further study of the physiological basis of learning ability.  It is important to understand variation in learning abilities for several practical reasons.  First, it will help us manage populations in changing environments (for example, in changing climates) and it furthers our understanding of variation in human learning abilities.  This project will provide hands on research experience for at least nine undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We completed three experimental evolution studies as well as extensive behavioral and life history tests on evolved populations of fruit flies. In our work, we addressed three major questions:  1)     How do patterns of change affect the evolution of learning and unlearned preference? Here we tested our "flag" model for animal information use, manipulating levels of reliability and certainty of stimuli over evolutionary time.  2)     Does evolved learning come with constitutive costs? Here we tested for trade-offs in various life history traits of our evolved populations, tested for the maintenance of evolved traits in the absence of selection, and in fixed environments.  3)     How do economic opportunity costs affect the evolution of learning versus unlearned preference? Here we tested an addition of opportunity costs to our "flag" model, evolving flies in a series of environments with differing levels of opportunity cost and stimulus certainty.     Our Results  1)     Increasing certainty favors the evolution of unlearned preference, while reliability favors the evolution of learning.  Both effects were statistically strong, but come with notable differences. First, certainty affects the evolution of preference in an orderly, linear fashion; however enhanced learning did not evolve unless reliability was complete: at 100%. Thus for learning to evolve, the reliability of learning information has to be greater than 75%. Learning exactly where this level is will require testing more intermediate levels of reliability. Broadly, we found that preference evolves across more of our theoretic space than learning does.  Preference interacts with learning to influence how each strategy evolve. We found strong and complex interactions between the most certain assigned stimulus (in this experiment, orange or pineapple substrate), and learning ability. This interacts both across evolutionary time and in influencing choice in our final assays following 44 generations of selection. Strong evolved preference can both enhance and inhibit learning performance. In no treatment, however, do we find that strong evolved preference and low reliability result in decreased learning scores significantly less than control line performance.  2)     Contrary to predictions from the literature, we found no trade-off between evolved enhanced learning and the life history traits we measured. High learning populations do not show a reduction in either how early they are able to reproduce or in their lifetime reproductive success. We find a trend toward the opposite: flies in both high preference and high learning lines reproduce slightly earlier, by a few hours. This is important because it shows that cognitive abilities do not have to be improved at the detriment of either strong reproductive developmental delays, as in butterflies, or in reproductive ability across the lifespan, as is predicted in a number of models.

We also found no effect of certainty or reliability on starvation resistance. Finally, in testing lifespan, we find no evidence for a tradeoff with learning ability, however we do find the interesting result that populations that evolved in uncertain and unreliable worlds live longer.   Enhanced learning does come with costs: we find that evolved enhanced learning ability does decline in the absence of selective pressures. All of our evolved differences begin to decline following 5 generations without selection, and these differences continue to decline following 10 generations of selection. The differences can be reacquired however through continued selections following 15 generations without selective pressure. Our final experiment, placing evolved lines into a fixed environment, with perfect reliability and perfect certainty, are still pending data analysis an...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
