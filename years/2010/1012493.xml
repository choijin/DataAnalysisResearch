<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, Craig A. Ogle and Michael Murphy of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte will study organocopper reagents using rapid injection (RI) NMR spectroscopy.  This approach will further expand the toolkit of synthetic reactions leading to carbon-carbon bond formations.  Specifically, the group will improve alkylation reactions using organocuprates so that they are more efficient with fewer side reactions.  By developing an understanding of these reactions, the group seeks to make rational changes to the reagents and reaction conditions to allow them to control enantioselectivity.  The broader impacts involve training undergraduate and graduate students in the preparation and handling of air-sensitive reagents, the operation of analytical instrumentation, and experimental design. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This work will enhance our fundamental understanding about long sought after copper(III) intermediates in organocuprate chemistry.  Reactions of organocuprates with other organic functional groups have been a "black box" with much lore associated with their reactivity;  This research is focused on separating fact from fiction.  The economic impact of this research could be significant, potentially leading to new products and methodologies in the pharmaceutical industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The proposed research has used a technique called Rapid Injection Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, RI NMR. This technique involves injecting one reactant into the other in the magnet of the NMR spectrometer and collecting a series of spectral images at various times after injection (described pictorially in the figure).  These spectral images can be interpreted to show the disappearance of the reactants and the growing in of the product(s) and if fortunate the formation of intermediate(s) during the course of the reaction.  The proposed research has been able to answer some basic questions about how several very important chemical reactions work, particularly the reaction of organocuprate reagents with electron poor alkenes.  These reactions have been mostly understood by the lore associated with them.  This project has allowed a deep understanding of the reaction pathway by observing and characterizing the intermediates along the way using RI NMR, to take spectral snapshots during the time course of the reactions.  These spectra have been interpreted to reveal what the chemical intermediates look like on the reaction pathway.  The fundamental results found in this research are already starting to find their way into books, chapters, reviews and will undoubtedly eventually into textbooks.  The results from this project will allow drug makers and chemical manufacturers building molecules, using organocuprate chemistry, to carry out their syntheses much more effectively.  Nine students have been trained on this project.  They have used skills developed on this project to find good jobs in the chemical industry or continue their education in graduate school or professional school.
