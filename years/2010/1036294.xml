<AbstractNarration>Lincoln University of Pennsylvania's project entitled:  Lincoln's Excellent Academic Program in Science: Forward, aims at consolidating and sustaining the efforts of the previous project to significantly increase the pool of minority students for degrees and careers in the sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goals of this project are: a) to improve students' performance in targeted gate-keeping STEM courses thus reducing attrition rate and increasing retention and graduation rate in STEM disciplines; b) to improve students' learning and study skills and their commitment to succeed in college, and thereby increase retention and graduation rate of STEM majors; and c) to enhance students' preparation and readiness for professional and graduate school.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These goals will be realized through a structured Supplemental Instruction program, the infusion of undergraduate research into the college experience of STEM majors from the time of their enrollment into Lincoln University, and a structured preparatory program for facilitating admission into graduate and professional schools. Students who enroll in Lincoln's science programs will be mentored, counseled, advised and supported throughout their college careers to ensure that they are successful.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will strengthen Lincoln University's capability to significantly increase the pool of its science and mathematics graduates as well as the number of Lincoln's graduates gaining admission to graduate and professional schools. The nation will benefit from the increase of minority graduates and a better trained workforce in STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
