<AbstractNarration>PI: Marek Romanowski &lt;br/&gt;Proposal No. 1061200&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acquisition of Particle Sizer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this proposal is to acquire a particle sizer appropriate for determination of size distributions of various particles prepared on the nanometer scale for experimental applications in medical diagnostics and therapy.  The main thrust of the research work in this laboratory has been to develop engineered structures in the nanometer size range for medical diagnosis and intervention. Not only is this size range compatible with molecular targeting and cellular delivery, but it also allows for the manipulation of materials with unprecedented control of their optical and electronic properties, specifically tailored for biomedical applications.   Examples generated in this laboratory include biodegradable plasmon resonant nanoshells and spectrally controlled content release.   Data generated by this particle sizer will help the process of manipulation of optical and biological properties of multifunctional nanostructures developed by this investigator.  In addition, this proposal addresses the need of several researchers at this location who require characterization of materials on the nanometer scale.  Such characterizations have become especially important in research programs concerned with molecular imaging and targeted therapy, colloidal chemistry, and conformation of proteins, pursued by the faculty associated with the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Arizona.  Therefore, one of the aims of this proposal is to provide access to this instrumental capability to researchers pursuing related research directions at this location. Finally, an integral part of this proposal is to provide research and educational opportunities to students with interest in engineering materials on the nanometer scale, and to enhance educational curriculum in the areas of photonics, material science, and nanomedicine.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main goal of this funding request is acquisition of an instrument to analyze a broad range of nanoparticles by dynamic light scattering (DLS). This experimental approach, also known under equivalent names of photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) and quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS) is the preferred method for nondestructive determination of size and size distribution of particles prepared on the scale of nanomaters. The main project outcome is the improved understanding of properties of nanoparticles, which accelerates the ongoing research toward functional nanoparticles for applications in medical diagnostics and therapy, or more broadly, nanomedicine. Intellectual merit.  The main thrust of the research work in this laboratory has been to develop engineered structures in the nanometer size range for medical diagnosis and intervention. The experimental capability of this instrument has enabled the development of new functional nanostructures. Not only is this size range compatible with molecular targeting and cellular delivery, but it also allows for the manipulation of materials with unprecedented control of their optical and electronic properties, specifically tailored for biomedical applications, including imaging and drug delivery.   These properties are being explored for new modalities of cancer diagnosis and treatment. Broader impact.  Installation of this instrument provides research and educational opportunities to students with interest in engineering materials on the nanometer scale for applications in human health.  This instrument supports graduate research and expands educational opportunities available to undergraduate students through programs active at the University of Arizona.  Specifically, in the lifetime of this award, and in addition to its research use, the particle sizer was used by graduate students pursuing their degrees in biomedical engineering, chemistry, and radiology.
