<AbstractNarration>This three year REU Site program at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University will train future professionals on critical elements of watershed-based approach to sustainable management of water resources in an interdisciplinary and diverse environment consistent with "The Engineer of 2020" vision. The specific program objectives are to : 1) ensure diversity of participants - at least 60% of REU participants will be from the underrepresented groups (females and ethnic minorities); 2) design and implement a 10-week research program that clearly articulates REU participants? research activities and facilitates their interactions with interdisciplinary research groups; 3) facilitate opportunities for professional development and interdisciplinary cohort experience through weekly seminars, field trips and discussion forums; 4) collaborate with external experts on assessment and engineering education research to evaluate effectiveness of the program; 5) disseminate research and program assessment results through an end of program research proceedings and at various conferences and journal publications; and 6) facilitate opportunities for social interactions that will enhance personal and professional bonding among REU participants. A group of experienced faculty will direct REU participants' research and two external experts will assist in assessment and recruitment activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The site will expand the pool of future researchers in water sciences who will help in addressing one of Grand Challenges of the National Academy of Engineering. A well-conceived plan to disseminate research and assessment results widely is proposed. This REU program will provide significant opportunities for underrepresented groups to be engaged in water sciences research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.</AbstractNarration>
