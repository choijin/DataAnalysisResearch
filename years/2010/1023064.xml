<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to develop a set of active-learning, finite element analysis based course modules with commercial software for use in a variety of undergraduate courses at a diverse set of nine universities across the nation.  The effectiveness of the modules is being assessed by faculty and students with student learning experience progression, learning styles, and personality types being taken into account.  The project advances active-learning techniques in undergraduate engineering education utilizing the finite element method for modeling and analysis of complex engineering problems in eight areas.  The project provides a quantitative measure of how well the modules enhance learning equitably across different student demographic variables.  The project results are disseminated in various ways, such as via an internet website and faculty workshops.</AbstractNarration>
