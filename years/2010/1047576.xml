<AbstractNarration>This project is supporting the HI-TEC national conference and a special forum on technology education within the conference (http://www.highimpact-tec.org/). The forum focuses on the identification of critical issues and the challenges of technology education. Importantly this highly interactive forum is designed to provide necessary feedback to the NSF and other stakeholders to help shape initiatives in response to identified national and global challenges. The forum is expected to engage up to 100 participants from the ranks of community college educators, technicians, and industry personnel in a frank discussion designed to highlight challenges and priorities faced by modern technology education. &lt;br/&gt;Both interactive tools to poll and engage the audience and facilitated focus groups are being used to identify practical knowledge, information, and experiences as well as identify guidelines and priorities for advanced technological education. A final report containing recommendations is being published. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This event significantly broadens the impact of the ATE program by engaging new constituencies in STEM and workforce education. One specific objective of this project is bringing students to the conference to broaden their experience. This conference, more than any other single event, is a highlight and showcase for the Foundation's long-standing efforts and initiatives to support technician education at community colleges.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project sponsored special forums on technology education within the High Impact Technology Exchange Conference (HI-TEC) (http://www.highimpact-tec.org/). This conference attracted over 500 participants from 44 states. HI-TEC involved advanced technological education where secondary and post-secondary educators, counselors, industry professionals, trade organizations and technicians updated their knowledge and skills. Jointly produced by 26 Advanced Technological Education centers, the event focused on the preparation needed by the existing and future workforce for companies in the high tech sectors that drive our nationÆs economy.  The goals of the conference and forums were to:  Provide professional development for      educators through knowledge and   insights into the current state and future of technological education. Disseminate new information on many of      the National Science FoundationÆs      programs focused on community colleges.   To achieve these goals HI-TEC involved community college educators and stakeholders seeking professional development opportunities, training materials, collaborative ventures, and insights into emerging market trends to develop and advance the technical workforce of the 21st Century. The conference highlighted technician and technical professional education. Technicians participated in the conference to update their knowledge and to engage in focused discussions to help educators understand   the challenges of the modern work environment.  Attendees were comprised of 66% men and 34% women and they described their ethnicity as 68% Caucasian, 17% Asian, 6% Native American and 5% African American. They came from community colleges (60%), four year colleges (19%), industry (7%) and two percent were technicians or students.  When surveyed:  100% of      attendees said their expectations were met and they would recommend HI-TEC. 98% of      attendees said there were adequate networking      opportunities. 98% of      attendees agreed or strongly agreed they will be able to use the content/materials presented. 84% of attendees explored new technology areas outside their area of      expertise.   The conference content was designed to directly address the important issues and needs for community college educators. Participants when surveyed ranked the value of the types of knowledge received beginning with the highest as follows:  Availability      of Teaching and Learning Resources Trends      That Affect Industry Building      and Marketing Programs New      &amp; Converging Technologies General      Technical Knowledge Skills      Crucial to Technicians Specific      Needs of Industry Challenges      for Technical Programs Pedagogy Workforce      &amp; Policy Issues  Student      Recruitment   The overall impact of the conference can best be summed up in the words of one attendee: "I donÆt think there is another conference that brings together educators and industry for the benefit of our technical workforce that is as effective in disseminating information and building relationships."
