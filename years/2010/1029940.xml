<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to establish the mechanism that is responsible for wetting and adhesion in organic fiber reinforced polymeric composite materials. Instead of applying fiber surface treatments to the organic fibers that can degrade the organic fiber properties, this methodology involves development of a reactive "nano-nectar" (a "liquid nano-reinforcement") that will lead to reactive nano-matrix materials for improved wettability to the organic fiber surface. Not a simple mixture of nanofiller and polymers, the nano-nectar based reactive nano-epoxy materials are chemically unified and will result in significantly enhanced mechanical properties for their composites. Deliverables include a nanotechnology method for the nano-nectar fabrication, mechanisms of the interfacial wetting/adhesion enhancement, and establishment of the relationships of structure and properties of composites on macro-, micro- and nano-scale levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will demonstrate that nanotechnology is an effective tool for improving interfacial wetting/adhesion of fiber composites. It will offer enhanced composite properties without sacrificing the inherent benefits of the organic fibers. Development of such an approach will be a viable alternative for current ineffective surface treatments for organic fibers. Success of this research will initiate new studies on surface and interface science and engineering and will contribute to the development of new lightweight high performance composites for a broad array of industry sectors including aerospace, renewable energy structures, and ground transportation systems. Organic fibers can avoid problems with carbon fibers such as corrosion with metals and importantly, this cost/energy efficient technology may provide a realistic option to the growing demand for carbon fiber composites, which are currently suffering from a global shortage as applications increase. Students with different levels including under-represented groups will benefit from lectures and seminars as well as involvement in the research.</AbstractNarration>

Broader Impacts  (1) Broadening application of organic fibers: Organic fibers are light weight and have high mechanical properties, but the poor interfacial adhesion with polymer materials hindered their applications. The approach based on fabrication of nano-nectar for reactive nano-matrix that cannot only enhance mechanical properties of resins, but also improve wetting/adhesion of organic fiber/matrix interface without sacrificing the advanced properties of the organic fibers.
