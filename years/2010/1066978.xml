<AbstractNarration>This proposal concerns problems in the intersection between several complex variables, complex algebraic geometry and dynamical systems. The problems stem from a very general program for constructing and analyzing measures of maximal entropy for rational self-maps of projective space. The work will begin with and be guided by the particular case of rational maps preserving a meromorphic two form.  Specific issues to be investigated include `algebraic stability' for degree growth of maps, laminarity of invariant currents in codimension greater than one, and how to intersect dynamically natural closed currents to produce invariant measures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; A dynamical system, at its most general, is any 'thing'-e.g. the weather, a bacteria colony, an economy, or a solar system-that evolves in time according to definite mathematical rules. Given the present state of the system, one often wants to know something about its future state.  Will the earth warm significantly in the next century?  Will the solar system fly apart?  What are the long term financial effects of a given tax cut or government intervention?  In a broad mathematical sense, all of these questions reduce to understanding whether some aspect of a dynamical system is 'stable' or 'unstable'.  That is, does it vary slowly and predictably as the system evolves, and or is it prone to change rapidly and chaotically with a small variation in the system.  The research proposed here aims at better understanding mathematics of dynamical systems, and in particular at determining and describing those parts of a system which are most unstable.  Funding for this proposal will also support the two PhD students the PI is currently advising.  It's broader impact will be felt through the PI's involvement with a Notre Dame summer program for high school math teachers and with the Riverbend Math Center, which is a local independent non-profit organization dedicated to promoting math education at all levels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research undertaken with support from this award concerns dynamical systems, which may be described as mathematics for understanding the long term behavior (i.e. `dynamics') of a system when the rules for that system specify only how it changes from one moment to the next.  The weather is a good example: the laws of physics tell us how this moment's weather determines the next, but it is an important issue of present concern to make long term predictions from these rules about the earth's climate.  My particular research concerns systems with only two variables (as if weather could be completely described by temperature and humidity).  These are much simpler than most physical systems but still complicated enough to be interesting and occasionally applicable (e.g. in computer algorithms or statistical physics).  Mathematicians have devised a single number called entropy that summarizes the complexity of any given system.  For the dynamical systems that I study, I have been concerned o compute this number.  I have further sought to understand those particular states of the system where the most complicated dynamics occurs, i.e. those states responsible for the system's entropy.   It turns out that my systems fall into two main classes, and that knowing the class of the system already gives a good overall picture of how entropy arises.  An important aspect of my work is to find good "models" for my systems, not unlike medieval voyagers depended on making maps of the world that simplified the task of navigating it.  The right model for a system will emphasize the important states and de-emphasize others.  To make my models I depend upon a mathematical tool called a `birational transformation' that was originally developed by Italian geometers a century ago to understand an entirely different set of problems.  As much as the problems I study, I value the connections it involves between rather diverse and previously unjoined areas of mathematics.  The more technical aspects of my work require a great deal of study and attention to digest, but I have been able to share parts of it with people at many levels.  I have advised two graduate students of my own and given introductory lectures to many others in the past several years.  As the director of my department's honors program, I have played a big role in preparing talented and engaged college students for the rigors of graduate study.  I have given lectures about dynamical systems aimed at undergraduate and general audiences.  Finally, I am proud to serve on the board of directors of the Riverbend Community Math Center, which is a South Bend-based non-profit organization whose mission is to improve all aspects of K12 math education.  This fall alone, Riverbend expects to work with math teachers all over the area and to offer extracurricular weekly tutoring and enrichment activities to something around one hundred adults and K12 students.  I am grateful for the support of the my fellow countrymen through the National Science Foundation, and I am pleased to have been able to give back to my community through outreach as well as research.
