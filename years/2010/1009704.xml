<AbstractNarration>Golden&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1009704&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator and his colleagues conduct fundamental&lt;br/&gt;mathematical and numerical studies of phase transitions in&lt;br/&gt;composite materials, with applications to electrorheological (ER)&lt;br/&gt;fluids and sea ice, which share similar microstructural features. &lt;br/&gt;They develop a statistical mechanics framework in which such&lt;br/&gt;transitions can be studied, and explore random matrix&lt;br/&gt;characterizations of composite microstructures and their&lt;br/&gt;evolution.  One central problem to be addressed is the existence&lt;br/&gt;of a critical electric field necessary to induce the fluid/solid&lt;br/&gt;transition in ER fluids.  They anticipate that this phenomenon&lt;br/&gt;goes beyond classical phase transitions in statistical mechanics,&lt;br/&gt;representing a new type of transitional mechanism that depends on&lt;br/&gt;a competition between geometrical entropy and electrical energy. &lt;br/&gt;They also study the fluid transport and related microstructural&lt;br/&gt;transition in sea ice, which plays a key role in Earth's climate&lt;br/&gt;system.  Such microstructures can be identified with random&lt;br/&gt;matrices, and the investigators study the evolution of&lt;br/&gt;microstructural features with such techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Composite materials arise throughout the physical and&lt;br/&gt;biological sciences and across most types of engineering.  One of&lt;br/&gt;the key features of these types of problems is the critical&lt;br/&gt;dependence of the effective material properties on the parameters&lt;br/&gt;characterizing the system.  For example, an electrorheological&lt;br/&gt;(ER) fluid is a suspension of particles in a viscous fluid such&lt;br/&gt;as oil.  If an applied electric field exceeds a critical value&lt;br/&gt;then the particles form chains and the suspension undergoes a&lt;br/&gt;fluid/solid transition within milliseconds.  This electrically&lt;br/&gt;induced transition has been used in applications including next&lt;br/&gt;generation clutches, brakes, micro-fluidic valves, and human&lt;br/&gt;prosthetics.  Another example is sea ice, a composite of pure ice&lt;br/&gt;with brine inclusions, which plays a key role in Earth's climate&lt;br/&gt;system.  If the temperature exceeds a critical value, then fluid&lt;br/&gt;can flow through the ice.  This transition mediates a broad range&lt;br/&gt;of processes in the polar ice packs that are fundamental to&lt;br/&gt;making better predictions of climate change.  The investigator&lt;br/&gt;and colleagues conduct fundamental mathematical and numerical&lt;br/&gt;studies of these transitions in ER fluids and sea ice.  They&lt;br/&gt;bring to bear sophisticated techniques of theoretical statistical&lt;br/&gt;physics to better understand the behavior of these types of&lt;br/&gt;materials.  Through these studies, the investigator anticipates&lt;br/&gt;the development of applications to other high-tech composites and&lt;br/&gt;to other areas critical to our understanding of polar climate&lt;br/&gt;change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The project is cofunded by the Division of Mathematical Sciences&lt;br/&gt;and the Division of Materials Research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Composite materials arise naturally throughout the physical and biological sciences, and are employed in a broad range of engineering, technological and medical applications. The behavior of those media exhibiting a critical transition as system parameters are varied is particularly challenging to describe physically, and to predict mathematically.     For example electrorheological fluids are suspensions of particles in a viscous liquid such as oil.  As the strength of an applied electric field surpasses a critical value, the particles become bound together, forming connected structures, and the suspension exhibits a liquid to solid phase transition. Such systems have been used in clutches, brakes, micro-fluidic valves, and human prosthetics.
