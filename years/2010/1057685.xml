<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase II project will complete the&lt;br/&gt;development of a rapid biosensor for the detection of fecal contamination in recreational water&lt;br/&gt;(both fresh and marine). Under current EPA guidelines, marine water should be tested for the&lt;br/&gt;presence of enterococci while fresh water can be tested for either enterococci or E. coli, but all&lt;br/&gt;testing is hampered by a 1-2 day delay before results are available. The current project will&lt;br/&gt;permit this testing to be completed in approximately 3 hours, thereby dramatically improving the&lt;br/&gt;safety of U.S. recreational waters. It will also provide the US EPA with a means to satisfy a&lt;br/&gt;court-ordered requirement to reduce the time of current recreational water testing to ?same day?&lt;br/&gt;results.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are that the CARD? technology can also be&lt;br/&gt;used to test water parks and swimming pools for other pathogenic microorganisms. Moreover,&lt;br/&gt;the CARD? technology can be used in other markets such as drinking water safety,&lt;br/&gt;food/beverage testing, therapeutics manufacturing, personal care product testing, and&lt;br/&gt;human/veterinary diagnostics. In addition, since the fully automated, portable system does not&lt;br/&gt;require operator input, individuals of varying skill levels will be able to easily perform&lt;br/&gt;sophisticated molecular assays that would otherwise have required extensive training and&lt;br/&gt;equipment. Therefore, in applications that require rapid turnaround of results, such as production&lt;br/&gt;floor analysis of in-process or finished products requiring bio-burden analysis, the CARD?&lt;br/&gt;technology will provide an economical and easy solution to improving manufacturing&lt;br/&gt;efficiencies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The original grant proposal described a method to rapidly detect fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in recreational water.  Since beaches in the US are monitored for safety using old methods based on growing FIB in culture, the delays in making decisions about opening or closing beaches could lead to unsafe use of American beaches.  The methods proposed would not only detect the presence of FIB, but also provide information about the viability of organisms detected.  Since the gene amplification methods generally used to amply DNA found in the target organisms cannot distinguish viable from nonviable organisms, this unique capability would provide valuable information to public health officials making decisions about the opening or closing of U.S. beaches.  As the program proceeded through Phase I, IB and II, it became clear that the underlying technology and instrumentation developed could be useful in the food and beverage industry, which relies on similar culture-based systems to determine if the products are tainted with dangerous bacteria.  Rheonix sought potential partners who could co-fund a Phase IIB program.  A relationship was established with market leader Life Technologies, who contributed over $1 Million to the revamped program, which was matched by $500,000 of Phase II funding from NSF.  Using methods similar to those developed in the early Phase I, IB and II programs, we developed a platform that could detect the presence of food pathogens in a large variety of food matrices.  After Life Technologies was acquired by Thermo Fisher, however, the program was suspended. Rheonix then refocused the program primarily in the area of beverage testing.   Evaluation of the addressable markets in the beer industry (over $250 Million of testing performed on a worldwide basis), indicated that over $25 Million of available testing in the "craft beer" industry remains underserved due to lack of infrastructure and expertise in this industry.  Not only can the presence of such organisms affect the quality and taste of brewed products, but can also damage brand recognition.  In addition, "exploding" beer bottles have also been reported due to the presence of such organisms.  Rheonix has initiated a service business whereby the technology developed with NSF funding will be used to meet the unmet needs in the craft brewing industry.  In addition, it is expected that actual test kits and instrumentation will also be made available to the brewing marketplace by an aggressive marketing effort recently initiated.  Finally, the same underlying technology will be made available (as both a testing service and test kits/instruments) in the larger food and beverage industry, currently estimated to require over $ 2 Billion of worldwide testing on an annual basis.
