<AbstractNarration>The present study asks if children who live in more ethnically and religiously diverse countries have fewer rights, and whether national independent children's rights institutions developed to promote children's rights actually improve children's rights. It has already been established that a country's internal conditions (such as the strength of its democracy) and conditions external to the country (including pressures from international nongovernmental organizations) can promote or hinder human rights. Do these internal and external pressures have similar effects on children's rights? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study seeks to advance knowledge on human rights in general and on children's rights in particular through the introduction of the Children's Rights Index, an international measure of children's rights for over 160 countries for 2004. It will replicate the Children's Rights Index over five-year intervals for the period 1984 to 2009. This study will compare impacts of independent children's rights institutions and ethnic diversity and religious diversity on changes in children's rights. These analyses will contribute to research on whether internal or external factors are more important to promoting children's rights. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The database containing the Childrens Rights Indices and explanatory factors will permit researchers to examine whether stronger rights are associated with superior outcomes for children. The Children's Rights Indices can be used by national governments and international nongovernmental organizations, such as Save the Children. This study will also host an interactive website with maps containing country-specific information on children's rights.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A Comparative-Historical Analysis of ChildrenÆs Rights  Brian K. Gran  Federal award ID: 1025393  The present study, "A Comparative-Historical Analysis of ChildrenÆs Rights," advances knowledge through its findings and development of a new indicator of childrenÆs rights. The present studyÆs broad impacts include shaping policy and practices of childrenÆs rights through disseminating research findings, consultations, and giving presentations, as well as teaching and guiding studentsÆ research projects.  The present study advances knowledge through identifying factors that promote or hinder childrenÆs rights. It introduces the ChildrenÆs Rights Index, an international measure of childrenÆs rights. The present study makes intellectual contributions through determining that children living in more diverse countries are entitled to fewer rights, controlling for other influences. In addition, the present study advances knowledge through finding that childrenÆs rights tend to be stronger where democracy is stronger, which parallels research on human rights. The present study has also found that childrenÆs rights are stronger in more affluent countries, lending support to the contention that "rights" require resources.
