<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop a new robust nanopore platform for direct DNA sequencing. Nanopore methodology offers the potential for a significantly improved approach for DNA sequencing by having an inherent capability of very long data reads that are not compromised by insertions or deletions. In addition, by operating in the single molecule regime, nanopores require minimal consumables, sample quantities, sample preparation, and no amplification. However, the stability of current nanopore sensor platforms has limited their potential. As such, a more robust nanopore is needed. During this project, a highly-stable, reproducibly sized nanopore that is ideally suited for low-noise, high-bandwidth DNA sequencing applications, will be designed and fabricated. The improvement in robustness over current nanopore technology will allow examination of voltage regimes, which previously have not been able to be used in conjunction with nanopores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the fabrication of a low-cost, easy-to-use, DNA sequencing system that provides highly accurate short reads. Inexpensive sequencing has the potential to dramatically enhance biological, medical, pharmaceutical, and biochemical research, by improving ability to quickly gather and analyze genetic information. This project will contribute greatly to the improvement of current nanopore sensor technology, making advanced DNA sequencing capabilities, with reduced operating times and costs, available to more researchers.</AbstractNarration>
