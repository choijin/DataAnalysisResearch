<AbstractNarration>The existence of dark matter is known from gravitational effects, but its nature remains a deep mystery. One possibility motivated by other considerations in elementary particle physics is that dark matter consists of undiscovered elementary particles. Axions and Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) are two possibilities. The thermal motion of the WIMPS comprising the dark matter halo surrounding the galaxy and the earth should result in WIMP-nuclear collisions of sufficient energy to be observable by sensitive laboratory apparatus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is to develop and deploy a small liquid argon detector that has high sensitivity for direct detection of WIMP collisions. This detector, DarkSide-50, builds on past experience and introduces innovative features that will allow it to operate in a background-free mode and thereby achieve a significant science result in spite of its relatively small size. At the same time, this detector will serve as a prototype for a future multi-ton detector. The main innovations being introduced:&lt;br/&gt;- Underground argon depleted in radioactive 39Ar;&lt;br/&gt;- Low background, high-quantum-efficiency QUPID photo-detectors; and&lt;br/&gt;- A compact high-efficiency external veto for neutrons.&lt;br/&gt;These innovations, together with the powerful two-parameter background rejection features of argon will result in a detector of unprecedented background-free performance. DarkSide-50 will either detect WIMP dark matter or exclude a substantial fraction of the favored parameter space. DarkSide-50 will benefit from the facility for extraction and refinement of depleted argon, independently funded by the NSF through a grant to Princeton University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: this activity will advance the development of astroparticle physics and its scientific and educational mission in a variety of ways: (1) it will offer an excellent opportunity for the training of students, who will have a chance to contribute to the success of a cutting edge project in fundamental science and advanced engineering; (2) it will benefit society by developing techniques that could find application in areas ranging from national security to medical imaging; (3) it will support continued development of successful E&amp;O programs such as the Princeton-Abruzzo-South Dakota summer school for high school students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      A wide range of astronomical evidence suggests the existence of a gravitationally-interacting non-luminous component of the universe which has yet to be identified.  This Dark Matter component comprises approximately 27% of the energy density of the universe, and is responsible for the galactic structures visible today.  The DarkSide experiment is a search for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPS), which if they exist, could be identified as this Dark Matter. The DarkSide-50 WIMP detector is a cryostat filled with 50 Kg of liquid argon.

The experiment is undertaken underground at a depth of some 3800m to reduce the cosmic flux, and the detector is embedded inside 2 veto detectors which veto local radioactive decays, and cosmogenic neutrons, (see Figure 1 showing the liquid argon detector embedded in a liquid scintillator and water veto detectors).

This argon is depleted in the radioactive isotope argon-39, which if present in the detector, would cause a significant background signal. After the fill, further calibration tests take a few months, before physics data collection will begin.    DarkSide should run for 3 years before reaching its background limit.  At the end of this period the sensitivity of the experiment is projected to be some 10-45 cm2 for a WIMP mass of 100 GeV.  This is comparable to the present best limits achieved by other detectors using different targets.             Last Modified: 03/13/2015       Submitted by: Ed V Hungerford]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
