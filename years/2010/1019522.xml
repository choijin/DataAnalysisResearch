<AbstractNarration>Long-term research at the Fernow Experimental Forest in West Virginia suggests that continued acid deposition from the burning of fossil fuels may acidify soils and stream water, diminish the abundance of important soil nutrients, reduce tree species diversity, and alter the balance of soil nutrients in ways that reduce the ability of forests to grow and sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide.   Previous results also demonstrate that not all forests are equally susceptible to the effects of acid rain.  Over the next 10 years, researchers will use ecosystem models and continue long-term measurements of precipitation, stream water, soils, and vegetation in both untreated and experimentally manipulated sites in order to determine: (1) how the mix of tree species alters a forests' susceptibility to the effects of acid rain; (2) whether continued acidification (and nitrogen addition) reduces forest growth and carbon storage; and (3) whether continued acidification will reduce the diversity of forest herbs and trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Long-term data are rare but necessary for detecting environmental change, and for quantifying its ecological impact. This project will significantly improve our understanding of the link between changes in air pollution and forest productivity in ways that can inform public policy, enhance ecological theory, and improve forest management practices. The investigator will continue a successful fellowship and intern program that provides summer support for graduate and undergraduate students whose research is conducted at the Experimental Forest. He plans to collaborate with the WVU English Department to create a new undergraduate course that challenges students to write creatively about changes in the environment that take place on time scales of decades to centuries. Long-term chemical and hydrological data are publicly available.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This research advanced our understanding of how "acid rain" affects soil fertility, water quality, and the diversity, growth and composition of vegetation in a forest in central Appalachia.    Critical questions were examined using a unique combination of long-term measurements and long-term experimental manipulations at the Fernow Experimental Forest.   Measurements of rainfall and stream water collected over several decades show that recent amendments to the Clean Air Act reduced rainfall acidity to a 50-year low. However, we have yet to clearly detect a corresponding change in the quality of stream water.  To better understand this resistance to change, we used long-term acidification experiments to exam how changes in the soil and vegetation might be related to stream water chemistry. Our initial findings suggest that changes in forest soils &ndash; such as increases in toxic aluminum &ndash; may reduce the growth of important tree species, reduce the overall demand for nutrients, and thereby help to maintain high levels of nutrient loss in streams despite reduced inputs from rainfall.  In addition to a reduction, or lack of response, in aboveground tree growth, we also found that experimental acidification reduced the amount, length, surface area, branching, and volume of fine roots.    The continuation of existing acidification experiments also allowed us to determine whether chronic acidification can make a forest more-or-less susceptible to damage by severe storm events.  The answer we found is that it depends on the type of storm. More specifically, we found that experimental acidification increased the susceptibility of trees to damage by a strong wind storm in 2009, but reduced their susceptibility to damage by the heavy snowfall associated with Superstorm Sandy in 2012.    By helping other scientists continue their long-term measurements in experimentally acidified forests, our work has documented how changes in forest soils can alter the diversity of forest plants.  This is especially true for herb-layer plants which account for most of the plant diversity in forest ecosystems.  After 25 years of plant measurements we have documented a 25% reduction in the number of herb-layer plant species and a 900% (9x) increase in the cover of blackberry plants.    In conducting this research, we have trained 18 undergraduates (9 women &amp; 9 men), and 4 graduate students (1 women &amp; 3 men).  The undergraduate students included 4 first-generation students, 1 African-American, and 1 McNair Scholar. Two of the doctoral students (one of whom was a first-generation student) have completed their degrees.  A third doctoral student will complete his degree in 2017.  In cooperation with the Department of English at West Virginia University, we also developed a creative writing course entitled "Writing Appalachian Ecology: Long-Term Reflections on Environmental Biology." This summer course began in 2012 and has trained 39 undergraduate students (18 women &amp; 21 men) and 3 graduate students (all women).  Three students were also military veterans. The purpose of this course is to inspire a new generation of non-fiction creative writers by challenging them to learn about (and reflect on) the long-term studies at our study site.    Results from research supported by this grant have been reported in 20 published scientific articles (www.as.wvu.edu/fernow/publications.html), 2 PhD dissertations, 1 paper in review, in portions of 1 book, and have been presented at numerous scientific meetings.
