<AbstractNarration>Stoneworts and brittleworts are types of green algae (family Characeae) that include species that are common in freshwater lakes worldwide and that are ecologically important as food and habitat for invertebrates and small fish. Stoneworts are also used in habitat remediation and are important model organisms in studies of cell biophysics. Furthermore, stoneworts are believed to be closely related to the very first plants that colonized land almost 500 million years ago. Despite their importance in ecology, basic biological research, and evolution, the relationships within this group are very poorly known.  This project will study the systematics and phylogeny of this distinctive group of green algae by using modern genomic methods to re-evaluate the taxonomy of the group. The project will sample more than 200 species and use DNA sequence data from nuclear, chloroplast, and mitochondrial genes.  The data produced will be used to revise the current confused classification of this group of green algae, and it will provide critical data for worldwide studies of algal diversity and evolution.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The grant will support the graduate dissertation research of a Hispanic first-generation student at the City University of New York, as well as support undergraduate research involvement of students from several nearby colleges.  Classroom lessons will be developed for the BioBus, an innovative mobile laboratory with state-of-the-art microscopy equipment that visits K-12 schools in the New York City region.  The BioBus lessons will cover an introduction to structure and function of algae that can be observed with their research-grade microscope equipment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Overview   The project on "Phylogeny and Systematics of the Characeae" advanced our understanding of the evolutionary history and ecology a group of green algae that are important members of aquatic ecosystems worldwide.  Called "stoneworts" because their plant bodies are often covered in a crispy layer of calcium carbonate, the same material used by clams to build their shells, these algae are quite complex in their structure compared to other microorganisms, and they are also close relatives of land plants.  As such, our understanding of their structure and function provides insights into the origin of the many features of land plants that are important to humans, such as sexual reproduction systems and cell biology.       Products  We made hundreds of new collections of specimens of these algae from streams and ponds in North America and Europe, which are now in the plant collections of the New York Botanical Garden and the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.  Among the surprising new finds were a new species from Colorado, and a rare species of stonewort that had only been known from Australia and northern Europe.  These new findings reveal that there is a great deal of undiscovered diversity in these algae, which are used in ecological research and wetland management and restoration.      Broader Impacts  PublicationsEducation  We have published numerous technical articles in the peer-reviewed literature, and presented research talks, invited seminars, and symposium presentations at national and international scientific meetings.   A Hispanic student received his Ph.D. supported by this grant, and over a dozen undergraduates at the New York Botanical Garden and the Academy of Natural Sciences have conducted independent research and worked in curating algal collections at these institutions.  These efforts also contributed to a related project to digitize specimens to be posted on the Internet, making the specimens from this project known and accessible research worldwide.  The Principal Investigators have also given lectures at K-12 schools in New York and Philadelphia.  We also contributed microscope equipment to the BioBus (www.biobus.org), a mobile microscopy laboratory that visits schools, libraries, museums, and science fairs to provide to students and the public a hands-on experience and encounter with microscopic life forms.
