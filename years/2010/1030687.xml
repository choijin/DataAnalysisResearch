<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to formulate a methodology for the design of elasto-fluidic systems (EFSs). EFSs utilize fluid pressure to deform a material envelope with tuned flexibility. They are ubiquitous in nature and may be found in organisms ranging from trees to worms to octopi. These systems achieve a wide range of functionality including desired structure, complex motion, flexibility, and efficient transmission of energy. There are numerous potential applications for elasto-fluidic systems in robots, machines, medical devices, and consumer products. To address the primary goals of the proposed research, it will be necessary to investigate a broad range of technical fields to characterize the salient physical phenomena that govern the behavior of EFSs. The characterization will be utilized in developing a systematic and general method to create EFSs at multiple scales with various materials. The design method will be validated through the design and fabrication of novel proof-of-concept prototypes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the broader impacts of the research are extensive. The systematic synthesis of EFSs represents a paradigm shift in mechanical design. EFSs operate on a completely different set of assumptions that facilitate a wider range of functionality and benefits including lower power and maintenance requirements, simplicity and elegance in design, lower long-term cost, and increased precision. These benefits may prove to be far reaching to other fields in engineering. Beyond the impacts of the research on other technical fields, the PI?s have a vested interest in engaging the next generation of engineers at both the high school and undergraduate levels. In collaboration with local high school teachers, the PI?s have will create, implement, assess, and disseminate modules in high school physics courses that integrate mechanical engineering and biologically inspired design. These activities will be made publically available, and their results will be disseminated at educational conferences.</AbstractNarration>
