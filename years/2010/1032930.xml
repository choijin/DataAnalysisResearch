<AbstractNarration>1032930&lt;br/&gt;Sick&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Internal combustion engine heat transfer that occurs between hot combustion gases and the cooler walls is expected to be of primary importance in several advanced engine concepts aimed at increasing fuel economy and reducing pollutant formation. The heat transfer rates are ultimately determined by boundary layer-type flow along the in-cylinder walls. The underlying physical mechanisms within these boundary layers are still not well understood. A paucity of detailed measurements of gas velocity and temperature distributions adjacent to the walls has hindered the development of models that could be used for design purposes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This research will generate detailed experimental information regarding the velocity and temperature distributions within highly-transient boundary layers that occur within internal combustion engines. Velocity data will be acquired using a micro-particle image velocimetry technique with a high repetition rate laser source. Temperature distributions will be determined using laser induced fluorescence. Ensemble-averaged velocity and temperature data will be determined, as will two-point, auto-, and cross-correlation of parameters over a relatively wide range of operating parameters for transparent engine tests in both the motored and fired modes. Wall heat flux data will be simultaneously acquired. The data will be used by collaborators to develop and validate computational models of this complex and highly transient phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The ability to understand and predict wall heat transfer in internal combustion engines is a key element necessary to reduce pollutant formation and increase fuel efficiency in future engine designs. This research will involve graduate student training, including an international experience for the student. Undergraduate students will also work with collaborators at the Technical University of Darmstadt. The graduate student will participate in various initiatives aimed at preparing women for careers in engineering. Broad dissemination to non-traditional audiences is also planned.</AbstractNarration>
