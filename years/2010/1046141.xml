<AbstractNarration>OISE 10-46141&lt;br/&gt;Elham Fini&lt;br/&gt;North Carolina A&amp;T State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides support for a one-week planning visit ? for the PI, four junior faculty &lt;br/&gt;and three underrepresented US students - to the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom.  The US principal investigator is Elham Fini from North Carolina Agricultural &amp; Technical State University. The foreign collaborator is Gordon Airey.  The primary purpose of this planning visit is to establish collaborative research on production and characterization of sustainable construction adhesive from bio-mass while sequestering carbon and reducing green house gases that would otherwise be released to the atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While there have been several studies on the conversion of bio-mass to bio-fuel, little attention has been give to the use of the heavy sticky residue remaining after the conversion.  To date, the focus has been on extraction of the light  hydrocarbon used as fuel and the heavy residue treated as a waste.  Initial studies done by the PI and her UK collaborator show that this so called waste material can be chemically modified to produce bio-adhesives for several construction purposes while sequestering carbon in the bio-adhesive.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project fulfills the program objectives of providing US  junior faculty and students with a global perspective and access to unique facilities and expertise. It also aims to address the technical, environmental and economical aspects of this interdisciplinary research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As part of the project a workshop on Sustainable Adhesives from Bio-mass (SAB) was organized in Nottingham,  UK, May 23-27, 2011.  Eight US participants and eleven participants from the UK attended the SAB workshop.    The workshop brought together researchers from various areas to work on production and characterization of bio-adhesive from bio-mass.  Presentations and discussions focused on production, characterization and modeling of bio-based materials as well as supply chain and environmental and economic impacts of such materials.  Understanding underlying mechanisms affecting bio-adhesive properties, a bio-adhesive can be designed to increase pavements' resistance to moisture damage and low temperature cracking. As part of the workshop, the team identified several related areas of research including liquefaction processes, chemical and rheological characterization of bio-adhesive, life cycle analysis, multi-scale modeling of bio-adhesive and bio-adhesive interface characterization.   To reach the broader audience, the PI, Dr. Fini appeared on a statewide TV program (North Carolina People with William Friday) on October 14, 2011. The PI addressed the current research and educational activities including partnership with the University  of Nottingham. She further elaborated on the benefits of this research and partnership and the development of new technologies that can produce sustainable construction adhesives.
