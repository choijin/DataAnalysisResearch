<AbstractNarration>Navajo Technical College has been steadily developing its STEM programming for the last five&lt;br/&gt;years, or since the funding of the college?s original TCUP project. Last year?s STEM enrollment&lt;br/&gt;at the college increased by 32.5%. Over a six-year period the increase has totaled 52.6%.&lt;br/&gt;This is significant because only .5% of American Indians are professionals in STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;In science and engineering fields only .3% of the workforce is American Indian.&lt;br/&gt;The Navajo Technical College Engineering and Science Project will develop methodologies successful&lt;br/&gt;at achieving high enrollment and graduation rates for American Indian students. Included&lt;br/&gt;in this development will be activities such as: 1) Launching two new engineering programs&lt;br/&gt;at Navajo Tech, 2) developing an innovative curriculum based upon Native of Ways of Being&lt;br/&gt;and constructivist teaching methodologies, 3) working with high school students in an Engineering&lt;br/&gt;Student Success Initiative program, 4) providing a STEM Lab with professional and student&lt;br/&gt;tutors, 5) an internship program, and 6) economic development designed to focus students on&lt;br/&gt;their future.&lt;br/&gt;The project will build upon the successes of Navajo Tech?s original TCUP effort to present&lt;br/&gt;a replicable model that can be used by other tribal colleges and universities to build extraordinarily&lt;br/&gt;successful engineering programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The "Navajo Technical College Engineering and Science Initiation Project" has been highly successful during its five years of operation.  The major rationale for the project came from the fact that fewer American Indians were earning baccalaureate degrees in Engineering than students from any other minority group in the United States.  Up to the point of the project?s funding by NSF, no tribal college or university in the U.S. had developed either an associate or baccalaureate degree in Engineering.  This project was designed by Navajo Technical University (NTU) to break new ground.  The project was also to work with high schools with significant numbers of Navajo students in order to increase their readiness of an engineering major.     During the project?s lifetime the Higher Learning Commission approved the offering of two baccalaureate degrees at NTU:  Industrial Engineering and Electrical Engineering.  As a result of the work on these degrees an associate degree in Chemical Engineering was launched, a baccalaureate degree in Advanced Manufacturing was developed, and a Certificate, primarily for high school students, in Pre-Engineering was launched.  In March of this year both of NTU?s B.S. degrees will be site-visited as part of the review for ABET accreditation that is in process.     Current enrollment in the two engineering programs include:         Fall 2016    Head Count    FTE      Electrical Engineering    23    21      Industrial Engineering    19    17.33         The number of graduates in engineering is growing:     To date four Industrial Engineering students have graduated, one graduating in Fall of 2015, one graduating in Spring of 2016 and two in Fall of 2016.  The first NTU Electrical Engineering graduate completed degree requirements in May 2016.  The number of graduates will be dramatically expanding at these programs go forward, starting with those slated to graduate in the Spring of 2017.     The engineering programs are also expanding in terms of space at NTU.  A new Electrical Engineering lab and classroom are in the process of being established.  The Center for Digital Technology, which includes a broad range of lab equipment and robotics, is planning to construct a larger building, and at least one new faculty member has been hired to work with the engineering faculty.     Not only has NTU, with NSF help, established the first Engineering baccalaureate degrees among the United States? tribal college and universities, but it has also begun the task of adding a stream of American Indian graduates into the nation?s pool of diverse engineering professionals.
