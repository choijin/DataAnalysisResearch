<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award:  DMS-1007846&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator:  Yi-Jen Lee&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI proposes to continue her study on the relation between&lt;br/&gt;gauge theoretic invariants and Gromov-type invariants under the&lt;br/&gt;framework of Taubess proof of Seiberg-Witten equals Gromov;&lt;br/&gt;especially, its various Floer theoretic extensions. She also&lt;br/&gt;intends to explore the rich implications of the equivalence of&lt;br/&gt;various theories on both sides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symplectic Geometry has its origin from classical&lt;br/&gt;mechanics. However, in spite of much progress made, many basic&lt;br/&gt;questions remain unanswered. An example is the long standing&lt;br/&gt;Weinstein conjecture, which states that there is a periodic orbit&lt;br/&gt;on any compact contact manifold. In physics, "contact manifolds"&lt;br/&gt;provide the framework to describe the motion of particles. On the&lt;br/&gt;other hand, gauge theory arises from the theory of elementary&lt;br/&gt;particles in modern physics. Surprisingly, many seemingly&lt;br/&gt;unrelated invariants defined on both sides turn out to be&lt;br/&gt;equivalent, and therefore facts that are easier to see on one&lt;br/&gt;sides imply similar results on the other side, which might&lt;br/&gt;otherwise be very difficult to establish.  Taubes's celebrated&lt;br/&gt;recent proof of the 3-dimensional Weinstein conjecture is an&lt;br/&gt;example of many possible applications of such equivalence.</AbstractNarration>
