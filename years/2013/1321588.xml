<AbstractNarration>This project is a geochemical study of volcanic rocks from the West Antarctic Rift system. Its goal is to understand the link between mantle composition and the diverse, regional geodynamic processes, which include uplift, rifting, and volcanism. This project uses argon dating to time the processes, and isotope geochemistry and melt inclusion studies to determine whether the area is underlain by hot or wet mantle. The main broader impacts are support for a woman graduate student, undergraduate research, and research infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>
