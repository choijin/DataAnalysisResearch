<AbstractNarration>This research advances the knowledge and capability for securely&lt;br/&gt;performing general-purpose computation and communication on zero-power&lt;br/&gt;devices that rely on harvested energy stored in extremely small&lt;br/&gt;reservoirs such as capacitors.  A type of zero-power device,&lt;br/&gt;computational RFIDs (CRFIDs) harvest RF energy and endure continual&lt;br/&gt;interruptions to power.  Complete loss of RAM on the order of every&lt;br/&gt;second makes the notion of a computational checkpoint fundamental to&lt;br/&gt;this model of computing.  A significant problem is how to perform&lt;br/&gt;effective computation and checkpoints in a secure and&lt;br/&gt;privacy-preserving manner.  The most fundamental question is: how to&lt;br/&gt;securely make forward progress of computation on zero-power devices?&lt;br/&gt;The exploration of checkpointing strategies that exploit the&lt;br/&gt;energy-centric properties of computational RFIDs will lay a solid&lt;br/&gt;foundation for designing secure software and systems for pervasive&lt;br/&gt;devices.  Beyond security and privacy, the research seeks to discover&lt;br/&gt;what kinds of computational problems can be solved in a practical&lt;br/&gt;sense on extremely resource-constrained devices.  While the&lt;br/&gt;experiments focus on computational RFIDs, many of the techniques will&lt;br/&gt;apply broadly to devices with batteries as well.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of this work will lead to improved security for computation&lt;br/&gt;in low-power, untrusted infrastructure.  The expected results will be&lt;br/&gt;published in venues at the intersection of security &amp; privacy and&lt;br/&gt;low-power computation.  Potential applications include improved&lt;br/&gt;security and privacy for (1) implantable medical devices and (2)&lt;br/&gt;sensors embedded in concrete components of bridges and roads.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
