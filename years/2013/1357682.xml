<AbstractNarration>Researchers are developing a low-power nanomaterials-based microheater gas sensor platform. During this project, the research team will tailor the platform for realtime monitoring of hazardous gases such as hydrogen sulfide. To fully discriminate among hazardous gasses, there needs to be an understanding of gas-nanomaterial interactions and how these interactions depend on the temperature of the microheater gas sensors. Discrimination between various gases with similar chemical reactivity will require new measurement techniques and development of new nanoparticle materials with enhanced affinities for specific gases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The low power microheater gas sensor arrays have a very small form factor, average power consumption of microwatts to a few milliwatts, and can accommodate multiple sensors on a single chip without increasing in size. Small, low power, low cost multi-gas detectors that can selectively detect various gases can have a large impact on worker safety, public health, and environmental protection. These gas sensor arrays can be wirelessly interfaced to smartphones, making the data more accessible to the individual user, and remotely accessible via wireless networks. Wide area deployment of such sensors would enable mapping of environmental pollutant and toxic gas release in both industrial and public settings.</AbstractNarration>

To assess the commercialization potential of this technology, our team was tasked with interviewing 100 people from these industries as well as people in the gas detection industry. By talking to these people, we were supposed to gain insight into the needs of the industry and determine whether our technology could alleviate a "pain point". At the end of the program, we were to determine whether we had a "Go" to form a company around this technology.     After interviewing potential customers, we realized that for the most part they were very happy with their current H2S sensors and the issues they did have with them were either related to user interface issues or other issues that our technology would not address. The issues of size for H2S monitors was not an issue, since they were not actually used as a personal monitor, but mostly as a quasi-fixed monitor to test the air before performing confined entry work.
