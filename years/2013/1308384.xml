<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division supports Dr. Stephen P. Cramer at the University of California, Davis to characterize the earliest stages of biological nitrogen fixation and CO reduction using advanced, high-speed vibrational spectroscopy techniques.  These species are prepared either by flash photolysis of trapped intermediates or by photochemical delivery of substrates or electrons.  A variety of CO species have already been observed by IR spectroscopy, but some reactions occur too fast to be seen by stopped-flow FT-IR methods.  Instead, a spectrograph and array detector are used to push into sub-millisecond time scale.  As for N2 intermediates, there is no information about the earliest steps in N2 binding, and a combination of IR and femtosecond pump-probe methods is utilized to search for these species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nitrogenase is a metal-containing enzyme with extraordinary catalytic activities.  For example, it can reduce nitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3), something that no other enzyme can do.  But, it can also reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4) and CO to alkenes (so-called Fischer-Tropsch chemistry), and finally, it can produce hydrogen.  Although these net reactions are well established, the detailed steps for how this occurs are poorly understood.  Some 1-2% of industrial energy production is used to fix nitrogen. Any improvement or optimization of the biological process offers enormous potential economic and societal benefits. Even small improvements in natural N2 fixation, or use of nitrogenase for Fischer-Tropsch fuels production or as an efficient hydrogenase, would contribute to areas with enormous economic and environmental leverage.  This project allows graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to acquire specialized training in lasers and high-speed spectroscopy. They also interact with fellow scientists around the world, including Milan, Madrid, Berlin and Japan.  During the summer they share their skills and help train undergraduates from around the country.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nitrogen is an essential element for living systems, but the N2 molecule in the atmosphere is not usable by plants and animals.  This project was intended to study an enzyme called nitrogenase -- N2ase, which Nature uses to convert atmospheric dinitrogen into ammonia.  Ammonia is a form of nitrogen that can be used by bacteria and plants for growth.  Apart from N2, nitrogenase can also bind and react with CO -- carbon monoxide.  We studied the binding of CO to nitrogenase as a first step towards N2 studies, because CO is easily monitored by infrared (IR) spectroscopy.  Using IR spectroscopy, we observed CO binding to N2ase. We could also observe release of CO from the enzyme following exposure to light, a process called photolysis.  Using IR spectroscopy we then followed CO molecules as they migrated through the N2ase protein.  The experimental data were complemented with molecular dynamics calculations.  Both experiment and theory led to the conclusion that CO does not travel smoothly through the protein.  Instead, it hops from one pocket to another as 'gates' open and close. Since CO and N2 have similar sizes, our findings about gated pockets likely pertain to N2 travel through N2ase.  During the latter half of the project we worked hard to conduct IR measurments on shorter time scales. This is still an ongoign challenge, but we have developed new and promising collaborations.  During this research, two graduate students wrote theses based in part on this work.  We also employed one undergraduate and one high school student during the Summer to assist in the project.          Last Modified: 05/10/2017       Submitted by: Stephen P Cramer]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
