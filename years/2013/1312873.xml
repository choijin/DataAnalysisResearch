<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the Tribal College STEM History Documentation Project is to investigate the growth and development of the tribal college movement. This study will be the first attempt to place the history of the tribal college movement in a larger policy context. Rather than viewing the colleges as exceptional institutions working apart from the mainstream of society, it will explore the relationship between tribal institutions and the larger educational and policy community. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the factors that strengthened the colleges and the challenges faced by both tribal colleges and mainstream agencies in the formation of these relationships. Through its case study approach, it will also provide a better understanding of the National Science Foundation's unique role in the development of the tribal college movement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This study will significantly expand the existing scholarship of the tribal college movement and highlight factors that contribute to the successful implementation of competitive STEM instructional programs. Findings will provide a deeper understanding of barriers faced by institutions that work outside of the educational mainstream and the opportunities and challenges faced by agencies that choose to support their work.</AbstractNarration>
