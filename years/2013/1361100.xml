<AbstractNarration>The conference Group Actions in Riemannian Geometry will be held May 15-18, 2014, at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.  The purpose of the meeting is to study questions from, and related to, Riemannian geometry in the context of symmetry.  The first day and a half will feature a workshop focused on Ricci solitons and symmetry.  The remainder of the conference will bring together a cross-section of experts from across the field, highlighting recent advances in Riemannian geometry in the presence of symmetry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Riemannian geometry is one of the oldest branches of modern mathematics.  The use of symmetry has been an essential tool in the field since its inception and continues to be a fruitful source for building examples, to test conjectures, and test new ideas within the field.  This meeting will expose junior and senior mathematicians to a variety of techniques and applications of group actions from across a broad spectrum of subdisciplines. In doing so, we hope to create new relationships across disciplines and promote the cross-fertilization of ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The website for the conference is http://www.math.ou.edu/~mjablonski/GARG_2014/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The conference Group Actions in Riemannian Geometry was held May 15-18, 2014, at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, in honor of Patrick Eberlein.  The aim of this meeting was to bring junior mathematicians together with experts working in Riemannian Geometry in the context of symmetry.  The first day and a half of the conference were set apart as a specialized workshop on Ricci solitons.  Topics in the workshop included classification results for homogeneous Ricci solitons in low dimensions, general structure results for homogeneous Ricci solitons, and stability of the Ricci flow around homogeneous Ricci solitons.  By adjoining this specialized workshop to the main conference, we were able to bring together experts from many fields to help promote cross-fertilization of ideas.  The remaining two days of the conference covered a broad range of topics including:  spaces of negative curvature, spectral analysis, spaces of positive curvature, Einstein metrics, convex geometry, symmetric spaces, and the geometry of nilpotent and solvable Lie groups.  During the conference, graduate students, postdocs and more senior researchers gave a total of 20 talks.  66 participants attended the conference from across the United States, Europe, South America, and Australia.  Funds from this grant were used to support 22 participants (primarily junior mathematicians).  Various underrepresented groups participated and were supported by the grant funds.
