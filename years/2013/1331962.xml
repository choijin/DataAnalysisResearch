<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit : Women are often subjected by others to the stereotypical belief that they are incapable of being scientists because, for instance, they are assumed to lack the mathematical ability needed to perform scientific tasks. It is possible that the absence or presence of stereotype threat cues in the classroom can determine the types of achievement goals women adopt, in turn leading to changes in scientific motivation.  Vallerand?s (1997) hierarchical model of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation (HMIEM) provides a theoretical framework for this research which examines how perceived competence and interpersonal factors mediate the effect of the environment on scientific motivation.  The proposed research will test the contextual component of the HMIEM in an effort to determine whether individual science motives are mediated by stereotype threat and achievement goals in the nested context of a laboratory classroom environment. The researchers predict that perceptions of classroom environment will have indirect effects on three separate scientific motives?intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, and avoidance motivation. Stereotype threat and performance avoidance goals are expected to have negative mediating effects on intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, and facilitating effects on avoidance motivation. The study will utilize a cross-sectional, multilevel structural equation modeling design. Participants will consist of 2,500 college students enrolled in science laboratory classes at two universities--Louisiana Tech University and Montana State University. Data will be collected using an online survey method. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The findings will enhance understanding of whether gender-biased attitudes, achievement goals, and aspects of the laboratory classroom environment are viewed by students as being more or less facilitative of scientific motivation. Practical recommendations regarding pedagogical strategies and intervention could be made to the extent that these factors are identified. The project has an innovative, multi-media dissemination plan via documentaries and podcasts made available through the Research Channel, and Teachers' Network.  This plan will ensure the findings are heard by those most able to make a difference in the classroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded with the NSF EPSCoR office.</AbstractNarration>
