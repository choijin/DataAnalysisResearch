<AbstractNarration>Research Objective and Approach, This research effort focuses on the application of thin, passive surface coatings to engineer the stability of nanoporous silicon materials and activate them as stable electrodes for electrochemical energy storage and conversion devices.  Silicon combines earth abundance, low mass density, high achievable bulk conductivity, and easily manufactured nanoporous architectures making it ideal for such applications despite reactivity in electrochemical environments that renders it unusable for stable electrochemical devices.  The approach of this research will be to apply gas-phase deposition techniques to coat thin films of stable materials including graphene, metal oxides, and metal nitrides, onto three-dimensional nanoporous silicon.  This allows the silicon-electrolyte interface stability to be engineered while still preserving the controllable structure and surface area achieved with nanoporous silicon.  Electrochemical stability and energy storage capability of these materials will be assessed using the development and testing of porous silicon-based high power electric double-layer capacitor devices.  This research approach will then adopt a plants-to-power storage theme where silicon materials derived directly from plant matter or agricultural waste will be transformed into materials exhibiting stable electrochemical performance due to the application of controlled thin-film surface coatings.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Benefits to Society, If successful, the benefit of this research program will be the design of new materials with direct impact on grid-scale and portable energy systems.  Transformation of abundant silicon-containing resources into energy devices enables low-cost, grid scale systems imperative to future energy sustainability.  The use of processed natural resources to develop electrochemical solar cells, capacitors, and desalination systems collectively represent a sustained route toward basic resources of water and energy that will be transformative for low-income or third-world countries.  Direct integration of silicon energy devices into excess silicon in photovoltaics, sensors, or electronics will enable more efficient electronics and portable technology in addition to the broader crosscutting societal impact of innovation in the surface engineering of silicon nanomaterials.  Furthermore, the PI and Co-PI will participate and lead local and national outreach programs including the Vanderbilt Summer Academy, Vanderbilt students volunteering for science, and the Boy Scouts of America Engineering Explorers to engage K-12 students in order to strengthen and diversify a future STEM workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:   Silicon is the second most abundant element on earth and is a critical foundational material for applications in sensing, optics, and electronics.  However, its high reactivity in chemical and electrochemical media has prohibited silicon and especially nanoscale silicon from being used in applications involving liquids or electrolytes.  In this project, the PI and Co-PI studied atomic-scale surface engineering approaches that can transform reactive nanoscale silicon materials into robust electrodes for chemical and electrochemical applications.  A key early finding in this effort was that few-layered graphene could be grown on the surface of three-dimensional porous silicon materials, and the carbon atoms in the graphene could act as a barrier between the reactive silicon and liquid electrolytes to prevent corrosion or reactive dissolution of the silicon.  As a result, nanoscale porous silicon materials were produced and coated with conformal layers of graphene to maintain the structural properties of the porous silicon, but with the augmented chemical or electrochemical stability of the graphene.  This finding produced a pathway for the our team to develop a porous silicon electrochemical double-layer capacitor that exhibited stable performance in liquid electrolytes, and with charge storage capability rivaling that of conventional all-carbon based electrochemical capacitors.  Building from this approach our team followed two distinct paths: (1) exploring new electrochemical applications of porous silicon scaffolds, and (2) studying advanced alternative routes for surface passivation using atomic layer deposition or room temperature surface passivation methods.  In the first case, our team demonstrated the capability for surface passivated porous silicon to be adapted for capacitance deionization electrodes capable of salt water desalination, and effective for stable and efficient oxygen evolution electrodes for the water splitting reaction.  In the second case, our team used atomic layer deposition to conformally coat porous silicon templates with ultrathin metal oxides to enable electrochemical stability and further studied room temperature coating of metals and conducting polymers on porous silicon to enable stable integrated charge storage devices.  Overall, the findings of this work demonstrate a powerful approach that centers on the decoupled engineering of surface properties to adapt promising bulk materials, such as silicon, into new applications.  To conclude this project, the surface engineering methodology was extended toward the use of diatomaceous earth as a source of silicon that can be processed with magnesiothermic reduction and formed into functional anode materials for lithium ion batteries using surface passivation routes.   Broader Impacts:  The findings of the work in this project emphasize the capability to control the reactivity of nanoscale silicon to enable its function in in a reactive environment.  As a broad range of important technologies utilize silicon materials due to low cost, ease of manufacturing infrastructure, and excellent properties for silicon, these applications are often limited in performance and minimum device dimensions by the limiting interfaces or surfaces that adversely affect the native silicon properties.  In this manner, the surface and interface engineering approaches developed in this project for electrochemical systems can be straightforwardly applied to challenges in solid state devices based on silicon.  This can lead to faster, more powerful electronic devices and more efficient solid state semiconductor energy conversion systems.  Furthermore, the direct capability to use silicon as an energy carrier opens many pathways to overcome challenges central to a sustainable future electrical grid.  One example which was demonstrated by the PI?s research team is the capability to directly integrate energy storage materials into the native silicon in silicon photovoltaic cells to provide on-board storage, which can combat the intermittent renewable power generation from solar cells with energy stored in the unused silicon contained in the solar cell.  Aside from energy systems, the PI?s team has demonstrated the capability to leverage surface engineering to extend the use of porous silicon materials into efficient capacitive deionization water desalination materials that can rival conventional water desalination methods such as reverse osmosis based on total energy input to provide small scale water purification systems. Outside of these broad applications of surface engineering, the PI and team have forged a bridge between the research laboratory and the educational curriculum at Vanderbilt University.  This has led to a first-of-its-kind multidisciplinary course developed at Vanderbilt that covers the broad mechanisms and applications of energy storage technology ranging from electrochemical storage to physical storage.  Additionally, the PI organized a local outreach program through the Boy Scouts of America for two consecutive years of this project aimed to educate high school students in the local Nashville Metro area on engineering opportunities by immersing them in hands-on and educational lectures hosted at the Vanderbilt University campus.
