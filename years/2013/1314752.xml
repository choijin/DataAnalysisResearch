<AbstractNarration>The existence of dark matter is inferred from gravitational effects, but its nature remains a deep mystery. One possibility, motivated by considerations in elementary particle physics, is that dark matter consists of the hypothesized Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs). It should be possible to detect WIMPs directly, as the orbital motion of the WIMPs composing the dark matter halo pervading the galaxy should result in WIMP-nucleus collisions of sufficient energy to be observable in the laboratory. This collaboration utilizes funds to commission and operate DarkSide-50, a WIMP search using a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LAr-TPC) with an active mass of 50 kg. DarkSide-50 will use argon extracted from underground sources (Underground Argon, UAr), which this group has shown to have an Ar-39 content lower, by at least a factor of 150, than atmospheric argon.  Ar-39 is one of the main sources of background in the experiment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A significant by-product of this group's research has been developing techniques that could find application in areas ranging from national security to medical imaging.  This arises from the extraction of rare noble gases (Argon and Helium) from underground sources, and possible applications include the detection of underground nuclear tests and in Environmental Science where Argon is used as a detection media in ultra-low level proportional counter measurements for an environmental radio tracer for hydrologic transport.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Liquid argon is an attractive medium for WIMP detection due to its efficient conversion of energy from WIMP-induced nuclear recoils into both ionization and scintillation. The argon scintillation time profile ("pulse shape") depends on the type of ionizing particle, providing particle discrimination that can be used to suppress background. Pulse shape discrimination in argon provides one of the most powerful background rejections among all dark matter technologies; when combined with the measurement of ionization, the background rejection is further enhanced. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity will advance the development of astroparticle physics and its scientific and educational mission by: (1) offering a continuing excellent opportunity for the training of students, who will contribute to the success of a cutting-edge project; (2) developing techniques that could find application in several areas of benefit to society; and (3) supporting a new education and outreach program, designed to succeed the highly successful Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso-South Dakota-Princeton summer school.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Dark Matter was first suggested in the 1930?s based on studying clusters of galaxies and later confirmed by studies of stars inside galaxies.  Evidence for the existence of dark matter is most compelling, but its nature remains a fundamental mystery.  Particularly intriguing is the possibility that dark matter is made of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs).  WIMPs may be directly detected by their collisions with nuclei on Earth, the but low expected rate of collisions and the low energy of the recoil requires very large detectors with extremely low background rates.   The DarkSide program uses liquid argon as the medium for WIMP detection.  In this project we?ve constructed a detector to house about 50 kg of liquid argon underground in the LNGS laboratory in Italy.  Argon was chosen because of its ability to separate nuclear recoil events from events induced by beta and gamma interactions.  There are a few elements of the DarkSide program that are novel  we are going to use argon that was extracted from an underground well, and we are going to use active shields.  Argon is exceptionally good as a medium to detect WIMPs, however normal argon contains 39Ar which is a radioactive element that acts as an internal background.  The underground argon we used has now been measured to have a factor of 1000 less 39Ar. The active shielding will allow us to identify backgrounds when they interact in the shields so that we can veto events at the same time in the detector.   The DarkSide detector operated for two months with normal above ground argon to demonstrate the capability.  This allowed us to take a "background rich" data sample over the course of months with more background then we?d expect in a multi-year sample. This sample can test our techniques for removing those backgrounds.  We then operated the detector for over two years with underground argon and have produced a number of papers describing the results.  We were unable to observe dark matter so we?ve set limits on what it can?t be.  Some of these limits are the best in the world.   This grant has supported Augustana University?s participation in DarkSide.  It has supported five undergraduates and given them real experience working on cutting edge physics.  Augustana students have participated in operations of the detector, simulations studies, and studies of the underground argon.   The most recent work has focused on creating an on campus photon detector test facility for an approved expansion of this work called DarkSide-20k.
