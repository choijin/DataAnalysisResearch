<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemistry Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program that is co-funded by the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program, Professor Hemali Rathnayake from Western Kentucky University and colleagues Shivendra Sahi, Muhammad Jahan, Rajalingam Dakshinanurthy and Rodney King will acquire an analytical transmission electron microscope (TEM) with cryogenic imaging capabilites. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) organic-inorganic nanostructures as energy harvesting materials for green energy technology; (b) synthesis and characterization gold nanoparticles for antimicrobial applications; (c) genome discovery and exploration; (d) in plant-mediated biosynthesis of gold and silver nanoparticles; (e) nanomachining and characterization of thin films; (f) carbon nanotubes and clays; and (g) modified natural minerals for water treatment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a transmission electron microscope (TEM) a beam of electrons is transmitted through a very thin sample. These electrons interact with the material as it passes through and then an image is formed from such interaction which is then enlarged and focused onto an imaging device, e.g., a camera. This technique is capable of providing direct information on the local structure rather than the average structure determined by other techniques such as X-ray or neutron diffraction analysis. TEM has become an important research tool in the life, physical, material, and environmental sciences. Some examples are the study of complex systems such as tissue, polymers, gels, multi metal oxides, and others. The instrumentation will be used in research activities and also for research training and education of a large number of students from diverse backgrounds.</AbstractNarration>

The research programs of each of these disciplines contributed novel findings to the broader range of scientific community in the form of journal publications (5) and conference presentations (100). Through the GENOM program 52 mycobacteriophages were identified and isolated during the three -year project period.
