<AbstractNarration>Marine zooplankton show strong ecological responses to climate change, but little is known about their capacity for evolutionary response. Many authors have assumed that the evolutionary potential of zooplankton is limited. However, recent studies provide circumstantial evidence for the idea that selection is a dominant evolutionary force acting on these species, and that genetic isolation can be achieved at regional spatial scales in pelagic habitats. This RAPID project will take advantage of a unique opportunity for basin-scale transect sampling through participation in the Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) cruise in 2014. The cruise will traverse more than 90Â° of latitude in the Atlantic Ocean and include boreal-temperate, subtropical and tropical waters. Zooplankton samples will be collected along the transect, and mitochondrial and microsatellite markers will be used to identify the geographic location of strong genetic breaks within three copepod species.  Bayesian and coalescent analytical techniques will test if these regions act as dispersal barriers. The physiological condition of animals collected in distinct ocean habitats will be assessed by measurements of egg production (at sea) as well as body size (condition index), dry weight, and carbon and nitrogen content. The PI will test the prediction that ocean regions that serve as dispersal barriers for marine holoplankton are areas of poor-quality habitat for the target species, and that this is a dominant mechanism driving population genetic structure in oceanic zooplankton.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two graduate students will be trained in association with this project, gaining experience in both sea-going and laboratory research. Science outreach will be conducted through a dedicated cruise blog that will target elementary school children and draw from the live zooplankton images and science content generated during the 2014 AMT cruise. The proposed research will provide important insights into processes controlling genetic variation in marine holoplankton, and is directly relevant to understanding the capacity of these populations to respond to climate change.</AbstractNarration>

The goal of this research was to determine how the pelagic environment controls genetic variation within plankton species, and the extent to which plankton populations in distinct ocean habitats are locally adapted to their environment.

Population genomic studies in both planktonic copepods and pteropods identified genetically distinct populations that were endemic to particular ocean ecosystems (e.g, equatorial Atlantic; Figs. 1 &amp; 2), suggesting long-term isolation from populations in other ocean biomes. For example, using a RADSeq approach to assay single-nucleotide (SNP) variation across the genome in 322 animals of the large-bodied migratory copepod&nbsp;<em>Pleuromamma xiphias&nbsp;</em>(49 &deg;N &ndash; 45 &deg;S, 12 sites; Fig. 2), we documented three genetically distinct populations across the distribution of this species in the Atlantic Ocean, with sites in the equatorial biome exhibiting highest levels of differentiation in Bayesian clustering, principal component, and pairwise&nbsp;<em>F<sub>ST</sub></em>analyses. A suite of 57 loci were identified that were putatively under directional selection, with allele frequencies at these loci strongly linked to ocean habitat.&nbsp;Ecological studies in&nbsp;<em>P. xiphias&nbsp;</em>also found significant shifts in animal condition across ocean biomes, with particularly high variance in condition in the equatorial province (Fig. 3). There appear to be two, co-occurring&nbsp;<em>P. xiphias&nbsp;</em>populations in the equatorial Atlantic that may correspond to populations identified in population genomic studies, one of which has high animal condition and one of which has low condition (residents, migrants).
