<AbstractNarration>Lattices are mathematical objects defined as the set of all integer combinations of some n linearly independent vectors in n-dimensional Euclidean space. For instance, the set of all integer points in n-dimensional Euclidean space forms a lattice. Lattices have attracted the attention of great mathematicians for over two centuries, and have an impressive number of applications in mathematics and computer science, from number theory and Diophantine approximation to complexity theory and cryptography. The award focuses on lattice-based cryptography, an area born in the late 90s, and that has since grown tremendously. Lattice-based cryptography offers what is possibly the only alternative to traditional number-theoretic cryptography such as RSA, and boasts strong provable security, conjectured security against quantum computers, practical and highly optimized implementations, amazing versatility leading to a remarkable number of applications, and more.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad goal of the award is to answer some of the main and most challenging open questions in the area of lattice-based cryptography. These include: Is lattice-based cryptography provably superior to traditional cryptography? Can we obtain better security proofs for lattice-based cryptography, such as proving hardness statements for ideal lattices? Progress on these questions should be possible using techniques from number theory. The award also addresses related questions regarding the computational complexity of lattice problems, such as the hardness of the so-called shortest vector problem. Finally, the award addresses a fundamental question in the geometry of lattices, progress on which should have applications to the rest of the goals of the award, as well as to the mathematical and computational study of lattices in general. Techniques used for closely related questions in convex geometry seem particularly promising.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In summary, in the event of progress in algorithmic number theory or advances in the implementation of quantum computers, lattice-based cryptography is most likely the best (and possibly even only) means for humanity to reclaim modern cryptography as used in nearly any aspect of our lives, including credit cards, online financial transactions, secure phone conversations, and lots more. The award will further our understanding of lattice-based cryptography, and will aim to bring it to the point at which it is ready to replace traditional cryptography.</AbstractNarration>

For instance, the set of all integer points in n-dimensional Euclidean space forms a lattice. Lattices have attracted the attention of mathematicians for over two centuries, and have an impressive number of applications in mathematics and computer science, from number theory and Diophantine approximation to complexity theory and cryptography.   This project focused on lattice-based cryptography, an area born in the late 1990s, and that has since grown tremendously. Lattice-based cryptography is unique in that it is believed to be secure against attacks using quantum computers, a feature not shared by any of the traditional cryptographic schemes. Moreover, recent work has shown that lattice-based  cryptography is practical, and that it is amazingly versatile, leading  to a remarkable number of applications such as fully homomorphic  encryption, which allows computation on encrypted data.  Among the main cryptographic results achieved during this project:    1. A more general and stronger proof establishing the hardness of LWE and Ring-LWE, the two main problems used in public-key lattice-based cryptography. In particular, the choice of modulus and ring, which was somewhat restricted in previous work, was shown to be inconsequential. This result gives greater flexibility in designing advanced cryptographic application based on those problems.    2. The fastest known (exponential time) algorithms for attacking lattice problems. Specifically, our algorithm solves the shortest vector problem (of finding the shortest nonzero vector in a lattice) in time 2n. A more sophisticated version of the algorithm finds "somewhat short" vectors in time 2n/2.    3. The observation that quantum computers can efficiently (i.e., in polynomial time) find a vector that is within a factor of 2&radic;n of the shortest in any principal ideal lattice. The best known classical algorithm for this task requires sub-exponential time 2&radic;n. This is remarkable as this is the first (and essentially only) lattice problem for which quantum computers are super-polynomially stronger than classical computers. The result is based on important earlier work of Campbell et al. and Eisentraeger et al.       The project also focused on an investigation of geometrical properties of lattices, motivated by cryptographic questions. Among the main results achieved there is a "reverse Minkowski" theorem, providing upper bounds on the number of short vectors a lattice can have as a function of its determinants. This result can have applications to the fundamental computational task of integer programming, and to a celebrated mathematical conjecture due to Minkowski.
