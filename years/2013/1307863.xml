<AbstractNarration>This collaborative proposal develops a new method of integrated design of exposure and excitation of electromagnetic (EM) fields in the UHF and low microwave frequency range for next-generation magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at high magnetic fields (B&gt;3T). High magnetic fields improve the signal-to-noise ratio in MRI, and are accompanied by increased RF frequencies, which can lead to propagating modes inside the bore with a patient. For example, at 7T, the required RF frequency is in the 300MHz range, while a bore that fits a human is at least 60cm in diameter, making it above the cutoff frequency for at least one mode of the bore viewed as a waveguide, when loaded with the body. The travelling waves can potentially be advantageous in terms of a more comfortable environment for patients, larger field of view, imaging to-date MRI inaccessible areas, and enabling new spatial encoding schemes and a variety of mode sensitivity profiles. It is important, however, to be able to design the modes in the bore for better excitation field profile uniformity and control of power exposure to the body.  &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The principal goal of the proposed research is development of design methodologies for RF field profiles and associated cavity wall surface impedances and excitation probes, enabled by extremely fast and accurate full-wave higher order computational EM simulations of large body-loaded cavities. Several of the designs will be fabricated, characterized, and transitioned to clinical and research collaborators at Harvard University for imaging research. The specific issues to be addressed are: (a) Understanding the fundamental principles and limitations of radio-frequency electromagnetic field profile design for next-generation travelling-wave, high-field MRI; (b) Developing an engineering approach for modification of surface impedances in body-loaded bore cavities, enabled by extremely fast and reliable simulation techniques; (c) Solving the problem of proper field profile excitation (probe) design integrated with loaded cavity; (d) Evaluation and control of specific absorption rates inside the phantom, animal, or human; and  (e) Implementing the designs for several clinical and research MRI machines operated by collaborators at Harvard University (these implementations are not supported by the proposed grant). The project will investigate periodic or quasi-periodic surface impedance structures in the form of printed resonant structures or three-dimensional dielectric-metal artificial surface impedances, and different types of excitations combining wire dipoles and loops, patch-antenna probes with coaxial feeds, and cavity backed slot exciters (multiple probes for different modes will be incorporated with switching circuits). Other (non-MRI) applications of the resulting research in loaded multi-mode cavities include areas from low-power wireless power delivery in closed spaces to high-power advanced smart microwave ovens. Broader impacts of the proposed work on basic science and engineering support the nation's science and technology advantage. The anticipated results will provide a new method of medical imaging with more comfort for patients, and an increased field of view, sensitivity, and functionality. Broader impacts on society are especially warranted by growing needs for such improved medical diagnostic tool. Because of the potential to change the way medical diagnostics using MRI is done in the longer term, the proposal may be considered transformative in its nature. Multi-disciplinary education at the undergraduate and graduate levels, spanning areas of high-frequency analog circuit design, EM simulations, bio-EM, and metrology, will make an impact on two top institutions in the state of Colorado, strengthening the existing core competency. The PIs at both institutions have been active in outreach, and  related to this proposed work  plan to add several new modules to the existing K-12 outreach, with hundreds of middle-school children on Electric Field Trip visits. A recruiting effort at all levels focusing on underrepresented groups will continue to enrich the educational environments. Collaborations related to medical applications with Harvard and Intermountain Neuroimaging Consortium, international collaboration with XLIM, University of Limoges, in France, and industry partnership (NXP) are evidenced by no-cost technical participation and insertion into clinical studies, student exchanges, and hardware donations.</AbstractNarration>
