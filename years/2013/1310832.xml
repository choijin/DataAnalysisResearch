<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating and developing a portable, high power, tunable semiconductor-based THz (terahertz) source. The technology is based on unique characteristics of high-power widely-tunable two-color laser in a novel two-chip vertical external-cavity surface-emitting laser (VECSEL).  Access to the VECSELs' high-Q intracavity circulating power with orthogonal polarization provide  highly efficient mean for  type-II difference frequency generation (DFG) of THz radiation.  Current THz sources suffer from low-efficiency, low output power in the range of tens of micro-Watts, limited operating temperature or large size and high cost. The intracavity THz generation in the two-chip cavity promises to overcome the limitations by providing high CW (continuous wave) power in the 10s of milli-Watts combined with mature and low-cost semiconductor technology, filling a major gap in THz technology. Targeted frequency in the 0.1 to 10 THz range will be achieved by accurately adjusting wavelength difference between the two chips in the 0.3-30 nm and selecting a suitable nonlinear crystal. The Air innovation partnership provides means to fabricate and demonstrate a high-power CW THz source  in a compact prototype, transforming  the future of THz technology. The business objective is to commercialize a compact, low-cost tunable THz source covering the broad THz spectrum. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The transformative impact of high-power THz source will be in various fields of science and technology including medical, pharmaceutical and manufacturing in the next decade. This will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in commercial and defense market.  The commercialization of this novel laser technology will impact development of new tools in chemical and biological sensing with long term social and economic impact.</AbstractNarration>
