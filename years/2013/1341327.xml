<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this grant is to support more participation of US-based graduate students at the IEEE International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks (ICCCN).  ICCCN is one of the leading international conferences for presenting novel ideas and fundamental advances in the fields of computer communications and networks.  Participation in conferences such as IEEE ICCCN is an extremely important part of the graduate studentsÃ† research and career development, providing the opportunity for them to present their own work, attend panel and keynote speech sessions, interact with peers and more senior researchers, and expose themselves to leading edge work in the field of computer communication and networks.  ICCCN 2014 was held in Shanghai, China on August 4 - 7, 2014.  With this grant, we supported the travel of seven graduate students from seven different universities.  Each award recipient received up to $1200 in reimbursement funds to help defray the cost of registration and airfare to the conference.  These awards enriched the professional development of the students by providing them with an opportunity to attend an IEEE-affiliated conference in their field of study, networking and computer communications.  Each of the supported students presented a full paper or workshop paper at the conference.          Last Modified: 08/13/2015       Submitted by: Christopher W Miller]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
