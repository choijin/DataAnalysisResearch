<AbstractNarration>Membrane-based separations offer a number of advantages over conventional processes. They are often more energy efficient, more environmentally friendly, easy to scale-up and ?gentle? on the process streams. The new members that have committed to initially join the Membrane Engineering Science and Technology I/UCRC at the University of Arkansas represent a range of industries that currently do not use membrane processes to meet their particular separation needs. The new center Site will lead the development of new membrane separation processes that will be tested under realistic and challenging conditions. The knowledge gained will provide insights into other applications for these new processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Water is a very valuable natural resource, and the development of new, cost-effective ways to treat recycle and reuse water is of tremendous societal importance. The research undertaken by the proposed site could have significant engineering, economic, and health impact. One of the major challenges in Arkansas is development of a trained workforce that will help attract new industries to the state. The mission of the NSF I/UCRC program is completely aligned with this need. The new Arkansas Site of the Membrane Engineering Science and Technology I/UCRC will reach out to other businesses in the region that could benefit from the technology and expertise within the MAST Center. One of the new research projects that will be undertaken by the proposed new site will address the needs of the aquaculture industry, which is a major component of the Arkansas economy. The project will be developed in collaboration with the University of Arkansas Pine Bluff (UAPB), a HBCU.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF funding has led to the establishment of  new university site (UA Site) of the multi-campus Membrane Science, Engineering  and Technology (MAST) Center at the University of Arkansas.  The UA Site has led to significant growth of this well-established Industry and University Cooperative Research Center.  During this Phase I award, the research focus has been on the development of new membranes for future separations needs as well as new membrane processes. Development of advanced membranes is being guided by complementary modeling tools.   Figure 1 is an example of a typical microporous membrane.  These membranes are being used for water treatment applications.  Figure 2 shows schematically, an ultrathin graphene oxide based membrane that was developed and featured on the front cover of the journal Carbon.  Zeolite based mixed matrix membranes have been developed to treat aquaculture wastewaters.  Figure 3 shows a scheme that was developed to model the membrane formation process.  Membrane formation is complicated and involves many variables.  It is typically a trial and error process.  The modeling tools being developed at the UA Site will help guide the design of advanced membranes, thus significantly reducing research and development costs.  A feature of the modeling methods is the application of multi-scale simulations from particle-based mesoscale to phase-field based macroscopic scale for investigating the membrane formation process.  During NSF Phase I funding, the UA Site has focused on the treatment of brackish and wastewater. Water is a very precious natural resource.  Development of cost efficient methods to recover and reuse wastewater is of tremendous societal importance.  While membrane process are attractive for treating wastewater, membrane fouling is a major concern.  Fouling leads to a loss of performance and results in the process being uneconomical.  UA Site researchers have used membrane processes to treat aquaculture wastewater, oil and gas co-produced wastewater, poultry production wastewater and municipal wastewater.   Figures 4, 5 and 6 provide schemes for some of the new membrane processes being developed.  Hydraulic fracture operations have led to the recovery of oil and gas from tight rock formations.  However, these operations require the use of large quantities of water.  The water is recovered as flow back water.  In addition, there  is co-produced water that is also recovered during oil and gas recovery.  All of this water is highly impaired and must be treated.  UA site researchers are developing forward osmosis as a new membrane technology for treating this wastewater.  Figure 4 shows a forward osmosis scheme.  Figure 5 shows another membrane process, membrane distillation that is also being investigated to treat hydraulic fracturing wastewater.  Finally Figure 6 shows a process for treating poultry processing wastewater using ultrafiltration.  The three membrane processes described in Figure 4-6 are affected by membrane fouling.  Without arresting the effects of membrane fouling all three processes would not be viable.  UA Site researchers have investigated the use of electrocoagulation to pretreat the feed or remove species that could foul the membrane. They have developed integrated processes that include both pretreatment of the feed followed by a membrane based water recovery operation.  A feature of UA Site?s research is development of membranes such as those in Figure 2 for forward osmosis as well as an integrated process for treating the wastewater such as combined electrocoagulation and forward osmosis as shown in Figure 4.  Biopharmaceuticals refer to medicines that are produced using living cells. However, manufacture of biopharmaceuticals requires validation of removal of contaminants such as host cell proteins, DNA and virus particles.  This is often challenging industrially. During Phase I, the UA Site has developed unique expertise and infrastructure in order to understand the mechanisms of contaminant removal as well as help MAST industrial sponsors design more robust unit operations to validate clearance of these contaminants. Purification processes can account for the majority of the manufacturing cost of pharmaceutical products  Development of more robust unit operations will improve the economic viability of many new life saving therapeutics.  The broader impacts of NSF funding have been significant given that Arkansas is an agricultural state where workforce development is a major state priority.  The UA Site of the MAST Center has provided industrially relevant research and internship opportunities for students.  Several of these students now work in Arkansas or adjacent states.  The UA Site of the MAST has continued to promote diversity among its researchers.  At the undergraduate level over 60% of the researchers were from underrepresented groups in science and engineering.  Through the research output of the UA Site, separations is now a research focus in the College of Engineering.  The University of Arkansas has invested in infrastructure and equipment for new faculty hires in this research focus area.
