<AbstractNarration>An award is made to Marquette University for the acquisition of a small volume isothermal titration calorimeter (ITC) for the purpose of supporting research and education in the departments of Biological Sciences and Chemistry. ITC allows simultaneous measurements of multiple binding parameters in a single experiment, allowing quantitative thermodynamic analyses of biomolecular interactions in solution. A highly sensitive, small-volume instrument is particularly amenable to research in the life sciences, where sample preparation is time-consuming and expensive. This award will enhance research efforts aimed at (a) characterizing binding interactions between proteins and small molecules that will reveal new mechanistic details for metabolic and cell signaling enzymes; (b) characterizing protein:protein, protein:nucleotide and protein:lipid interactions in regulatory systems involved in maintaining cellular homeostasis; (c) measuring detailed thermodynamic profiles of biomolecular binding events in order to complement and enhance existing spectroscopic methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide new instrumentation to support biochemical and biophysical research programs at both Marquette University and Concordia University, and will expand the biophysical infrastructure available to the broader Milwaukee research community. The ITC instrument will support educational initiatives at Marquette University through its incorporation into existing advanced laboratory courses in biochemistry and biophysics. It will also be accessible to students participating in undergraduate research programs in both biology and chemistry. The ITC instrument is easy to operate, allowing undergraduate students to gain first-hand experience in obtaining and interpreting thermodynamic data that are central to modern biochemistry and biophysics.</AbstractNarration>
