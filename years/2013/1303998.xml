<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Melissa A. Hines of Cornell University and her students will use solution-based chemical reactions and surface science techniques to create, understand, and control the performance of high-reactivity titanium dioxide surfaces in technologically relevant environments, including air and solution. This project will develop solution-based chemical techniques for producing well-controlled anatase surfaces in a laboratory environment, for removing growth-directing agents from the surfaces, and for preparing clean, reproducible anatase surfaces suitable for surface-science-based studies of chemical and photochemical reactivity. By correlating the atomic-scale structure of the grown surfaces with the amount of shape-controlling chemicals in the growth solution or the amount of surface-removing chemicals in the etching solution, researchers will obtain quantitative understanding of the surface-site-specific chemical reactions that control the growth and chemical structure of anatase surfaces. The knowledge and techniques garnered from this study will provide new understanding of anatase surfaces under technologically relevant conditions, will lead to the development of new chemical reactions for the production of high-reactivity anatase surfaces and nanocrystals, and will produce a platform for further surface-science studies of anatase reactivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will enable the rational improvement of nanoscale surfaces necessary for emerging sustainable technologies. The project will develop the substrates, the expertise, and the processing protocols necessary for understanding and controlling the performance of high-reactivity surfaces under technologically relevant conditions, including air and solution. By integrating research and education, this project will train postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate students in areas of national need. The project is expected to increase student interest and achievement in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM fields) through a variety of activities targeting K-12 students and their teachers. Particular attention will be placed on increasing the involvement of historically underrepresented groups, such as women and racial and ethnic minorities.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="NSFBody">The goal of this research was to use solution-based chemical reactions and surface science techniques to create, understand, and control the performance of high-reactivity titanium dioxide surfaces in technologically relevant environments. The surface chemistry of titanium dioxide &mdash; a sustainable, earth-abundant, non-toxic metal oxide &mdash; has garnered tremendous attention due to many high-profile applications, including dye-sensitized solar cells, photoactivated self-cleaning or environmentally-remediating surfaces,<sup> </sup>titanium-based dental and biomedical implants, as well as continued advances in the photoreduction of carbon dioxide&nbsp;to enable a carbon-neutral fuel cycle. Nevertheless, many questions remain.</p> <p class="NSFBody">Over the course of this project, we made major strides in understanding and controlling the surface chemistry of titanium dioxide in ambient and solution environments. We developed a chemical procedure that produces atomically-flat surfaces, opening the door to studies at the atomic scale. In doing so, we showed that titanium dioxide surfaces spontaneously coat themselves with a single-molecule-thick layer of bicarbonate which is created from the reaction of water and carbon dioxide. This finding provided new insight into the photoreduction of carbon dioxide. We also developed the techniques to make near-ideal, single-molecule-thick layers of a wide variety of molecules, opening the door to studies of metal oxide photochemistry at the atomic scale. Finally, we developed a new technique for the growth of anatase nanocrystals that can be studied by a wide variety of surface science techniques.</p> <p class="NSFCont">The project developed the substrates, the expertise, and the processing protocols necessary for understanding and controlling the performance of titanium dioxide surfaces under technologically relevant conditions. The materials and techniques developed by this project will enable the rational improvement of nanoscale surfaces necessary for emerging sustainable technologies, including dye-sensitized solar cells and transparent conducting oxides made from earth-abundant materials. The understanding developed by this project will inform the production of higher-reactivity, shape-controlled nanocatalysts. &nbsp;</p> <p class="NSFCont">This research advanced discovery and understanding while training graduate and undergraduate students in an area of national need. Students performed independent research in a highly interdisciplinary field of relevance to many sectors, including renewable energy, nanocatalysis, and sustainable chemistry. Students on this project were educated in both experimental and computational research. This grant provided partial support for the education of six graduate and two undergraduate students.

This module, which uses Cornell-designed string wave generators, was field tested in outreach events at local schools, Harlem, and Washington DC; assessed using custom and standardized instruments, revised, and made available for loan (free!) to any teacher in the US.
