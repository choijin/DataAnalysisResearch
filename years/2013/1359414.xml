<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site at TAMUK supported by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers seeks to provide an impactful summer research experience in the emerging field of sustainable energy and expand research opportunities for underrepresented students. This will enable them to understand their own levels of aptitude and interest in a career in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and give them the tools to prepare for the next stage in their education and career development. The intellectual merit of the REU Site lies in constructing a new and critically needed pipeline for the next generation of sustainable energy researchers, equipped to address the broad theme of sustainable energy research and social and environmental issues, which is a theme of local significance and global implications. The research, educational, and career mentorship provided by the program is envisioned to stimulate the students to look at their academic work in a new light and to provide a spark for possible careers in academic research or industrial innovation. Participating students will tackle various topics of energy research, interact with faculty mentors and students from different engineering departments, and develop a holistic perspective of energy research. The site is designed to guide students to work both independently and as members of a research team. Each student will be required to write a conference paper style report of their research for publication and deliver an oral and poster presentation of their summer research projects in the poster competition at the end of 10-week program. The REU site fits within an initiative in the College of Engineering at TAMUK to involve undergraduate students in research, and to boost the participation of US citizens, especially Hispanic, African-American, and women students into graduate school. The REU site builds on a vision of grooming budding researchers from underrepresented students to embrace the challenge of energy research and building future leaders who proactively contribute to the nation's energy self-reliance agenda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY: &lt;br/&gt;This REU Site hosted at Texas A&amp;M University-Kingsville (TAMUK) and supported by the National Science Foundation's Division of Engineering Education and Centers is designed to develop and implement a model environment for multidisciplinary collaborative efforts where research and education are tightly integrated around the different facets of energy research. It features a 10-week interdisciplinary team approach to mentor students on energy research projects. The proposed sustainable energy research consists of the following major research areas: 1) Renewable energy 2) Traditional clean energy, and 3) Energy Policy, Environmental and Social Impacts. Specific objectives are to: 1) provide research opportunities in different aspects of sustainable energy research to undergraduate students, especially Hispanic, African-American, and women; 2) increase the number of underrepresented students who participate in graduate education; 3) use the REU site for building collaborative links among faculty and students from different departments within the college of engineering at TAMUK. Through participation in cutting-edge research with faculty mentors working at the forefront of their respective disciplines, students will engage in complex scientific studies on sustainable energy research topics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program is structured to teach students how to formulate research questions as well as how to develop and modify research plans with the guidance of their research mentors. Students will learn to work independently and to collaborate with other group members as they conduct research in specific topics in energy research. Ten students from various engineering and science departments will be recruited through a nationwide search with special emphasis on Hispanic, African-American, and women students. Students will report and present their research results in multiple settings. In addition to the hands-on collaborative research experience, technical and social activities will be incorporated into the program to provide students with a solid foundation in analytical, writing, and presentation skills and to enhance interactions between REU students and faculty mentors.</AbstractNarration>

With the support of the REU site itself and five supplement grants, it was able to support 33 REU participants, three veteran students, and one community college teacher between 2014 and 2018. The REU site addressed the broader theme of sustainable energy research and social and environmental issues. In three years (2015, 2016, and 2017), the REU site received 187 completed applications from 105 different universities in 38 states across the nation, and supported 33 REU participants (3 more than proposed), including 16 Hispanic and 15 female students. The 33 REU participants, from 19 different universities in 14 different states, successfully completed 33 different research projects in 10-week summer research program in three major areas: 1) Renewable Energy (14 projects), 2) Conventional Clean Energy (9 projects), 3) Energy Policy, Environmental &amp; Social Impacts (10 projects). All 33 projects were either part of ongoing funded research projects or related to graduate students&rsquo; ongoing thesis or dissertation research projects, including wind/solar/wave/nuclear energy, water/air pollution prevention, water desalination, smart grid, energy management and building energy efficiency. Eight tenure-track and 4 tenured faculty mentors (3 female and 1 Hispanic faculty) and 19 graduate assistants (8 PhD students and 11 second year M.S. students) from all 5 different departments in the College of Engineering at TAMUK served as mentors in this REU site.</p> <p>The REU participants published one journal paper, three conference papers, nine conference abstracts/posters as co-authors based on their research results. The PIs, faculty advisers, and graduates students published three journal papers, six conference papers, three conference abstracts related to the REU projects.</p> <p>In a recent survey sent to all 33 REU participants, 22 of them are still studying as B.S. students including four community college students entered 4-year universities, in which 16 students plan to apply graduate school, 3 students have not decided yet, and 3 students will not. Six of them are attending graduate schools now, and 5 students are working in industries in engineering fields (3 students plan to apply graduate school after gaining working experience and 2 students have not decided yet).</p> <p>Pre and post surveys and follow-up phone interviews were conducted to collect REU participants&rsquo; feedbacks. Totally 91% REU participants rated their overall experience excellent or very good. Based on the survey and phone interview results, this REU site was having a very positive impact on REU participants. It was able to provide an environment that allowed students to gain knowledge and skills, encouraged their continuation in research, and provided important information needed for their decisions about graduate school and careers. Faculty and graduate student mentors had provided good support and guidance for REU participants. REU participants themselves realized significant improvements in different aspects, including Formulating a research question, Planning a research project, Conducting research, Making technical presentations, etc.</p> <p>The survey results showed improvement in the student engagement level by comparing year-1 and last two years. Despite the differences of REU participants, faculty and graduate student mentors, and research project topics, the PIs believed that the major reason leading to this improvement was the change of program design. After year-1, REU participants worked on different tasks under same research project as small groups instead of individual research project, which showed advantages of helping engage REU participants during and after the REU program. Meanwhile, group projects are easier to get more results for journal/conference publications compared with individual projects, so that faculty and REU participants would work together to publish their results.</p> <p>The IR-SEED REU site received fully support from different offices at TAMUK, including the Vice President for Research, Dean of College of Engineering, Associate Vice President for Student Success, Associate Vice President for Student Access, Housing Department, and Recreation Center. With all the support, the REU site was able to provide different services and training to the REU participants, including: 1) provide a reserved classroom with computers and printers/scanners, 2) provide visiting student ID cards to access most TAMUK facilities including library, campus shuttle, etc. 3) apply keys of the reserved classroom and necessary laboratories, 4) creating university student account for accessing internet and computers, 5) offer different professional development seminars, 6) offer different research seminars, 7) offer access to recreation center, and 8) provide the best dorm at TAMUK. &nbsp;Local stakeholders offered field trip opportunities, including Corpus Christi Army Depot, CITGO, Chemours (previously as part of Dupont), Naval Air Station Kingsville, and FAA Lone Star UAS Center.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/31/2018<br>      Modified by: Hua&nbsp;Li</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359414/1359414_10314615_1533074505063_CCAD-2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359414/1359414_10314615_1533074505063_CCAD-2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="REU Student Field Trip to Corpus Christi Army Depot"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359414/1359414_10314615_1533074505063_CCAD-2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="REU Student Field Trip to Corpus Christi Army Depot"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The group of 2017 REU Participants visited Corpus Christi Army Depot</div> <div class="imageCredit">Corpus Christi Army Depot</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Hua&nbsp;Li</div> <div class="imageTitle">REU Student Field Trip to Corpus Christi Army Depot</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359414/1359414_10314615_1533074379333_StephanieConferenceAward--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359414/1359414_10314615_1533074379333_StephanieConferenceAward--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Selected Student Paper Award"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359414/1359414_10314615_1533074379333_StephanieConferenceAward--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Selected Student Paper Award"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">One REU participant from MIT published her results in 2018 ASHRAE Annual Conference and received a paper award in Bachelor's/Master's Level category</div> <div class="imageCredit">Stephanie Chin and Joseph Rendall</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Hua&nbsp;Li</div> <div class="imageTitle">Selected Student Paper Award</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359414/1359414_10314615_1533085471681_IMG_4774--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359414/1359414_10314615_1533085471681_IMG_4774--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2015 REU Participants with TAMUK President and PIs"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359414/1359414_10314615_1533085471681_IMG_4774--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2015 REU Participants with TAMUK President and PIs"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Dr. Tallant, TAMUK President, attended the REU 2015 Ceremony and Final Project Presentations</div> <div class="imageCredit">Hua Li</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Hua&nbsp;Li</div> <div class="imageTitle">2015 REU Participants with TAMUK President and PIs</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359414/1359414_10314615_1533086395516_IMG_20170804_133805--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359414/1359414_10314615_1533086395516_IMG_20170804_133805--rgov-800width.jpg" title="REU Participants received their posters"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359414/1359414_10314615_1533086395516_IMG_20170804_133805--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="REU Participants received their posters"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">REU 2017 Participants opened up their posters in the reserved REU classroom.
