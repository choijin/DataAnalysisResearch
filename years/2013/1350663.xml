<AbstractNarration>NONTECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award supports integrated theoretical research and education focused on the role of external driving forces, strong interactions among electrons, and defects and imperfections in topological states of electronic matter. Topological states are characterized by properties that in a fundamental sense have a geometric origin and are unchanged by small changes of the material, and are connected to states around the surface and edges of the material that can conduct electricity without dissipation, even when the bulk is insulating. The research thrusts are aimed at formulating concepts to advance understanding of topological states. They address specific questions of practical importance by virtue of studying realistic physical systems and their potential applications. This project may contribute to the foundations of new technologies such as quantum computation, precision metrology, energy conversion, and low-power electronic devices. The integrated education activities will bring recent scientific advances and new concepts to high school students of diverse socio-economic and ethnic backgrounds. Educational materials developed will be made publicly available. This effort will be informed by, and will contribute to, science education research and the nation's strategic education needs to meet the challenge of finding and utilizing the materials of future technologies. The Principle Investigator will also help improve the participation and diversity of students in science through existing efforts at Indiana University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award supports the Principle Investigator's (PI) integrated research, education and outreach activities focused on the role of non-equilibrium dynamics, correlations and disorder in topological states of matter, especially in topological insulators and superconductors, and their potential applications. These activities have three aims:&lt;br/&gt;1. To study the dynamical properties of topological states, in particular the realization, detection and manipulation of topological bound states, such as Majorana fermions, in periodically driven systems.&lt;br/&gt;2. To study disorder and fluctuations in dynamic and static topological states, especially their role in the realization of novel correlated topological states of matter, and the topological protection of quantum information and their applications.&lt;br/&gt;3. To institute an integrated and broad educational and outreach effort at K-12, undergraduate and graduate levels that fosters the students' understanding of organizational principles in condensed matter - including the role of topology, promotes the diversity of students in science, and prepares the next generation of scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will use analytical approaches and numerical simulations combining models of various levels sophistication to elucidate the conceptual framework as well as the physically relevant properties and phenomena of real systems. The educational and outreach activities include the project Forefronts of Research Education Modules to develop short, inquiry-based units that bring recent advances to high school physics classrooms as well as summer research experience for underrepresented students and a seminar series for undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
