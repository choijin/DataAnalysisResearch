<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for the Atlanta Lecture Series in Combinatorics and Graph Theory.  The series consists of three mini-conferences on Combinatorics and Graph Theory in Atlanta where Emory University, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Georgia State University are located. Three mini-conferences will be scheduled in November, February, and April, respectively. Each conference will feature one distinguished researcher with two one-hour lectures, four one-hour lectures by distinguished researchers mainly from the southeast region, and four thirty-minute talks by junior researchers and graduate students.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a continuation of the ongoing Atlanta Lecture Series in Combinatorics and Graph Theory started in 2010. The featured lectures and other invited talks have covered a variety of topics in graph theory and combinatorics.  The speaker pool not only has a good gender balance but also consists of a nice blend of senior, well-known researchers and young rising stars.  The series has become a major event for combinatorics community in the southeast region and beyond, providing opportunities to strengthen collaborations among researchers and institutes within the southeast region of the United States.</AbstractNarration>

The three featured speakers are Dhruv Mubayi, Alexander Schrijver, and Bruce Reed.   Dhruv Mubayi is a rising star in extremal graph theory,  Alexander Schrijver is obviously the world leading expert in Combinatorial Optimization, and Bruce Reed is one of best mathematicians in  combinatorics and graph theory.   Thus, as proposed, the mini-conference featured one of the top combinatorialists in the world and  other major researchers, as well as provided an opportunity for some young faculty and graduate students to present their research. As such, we met all our goals stated in the proposal.         Last Modified: 06/11/2015       Submitted by: Guantao Chen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
