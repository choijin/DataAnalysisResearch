<AbstractNarration>This action funds Daniel Brenner of the University of Arizona to conduct a research project in the Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing.  The project title is "Mandarin Tone Perception in Conversational and Read Speech." The host scientist is Dr. HU Fang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In Mandarin, words are distinguished not only by segments ([ba] 'to pull out' vs. [pa] 'to climb'), but also by tone, the pattern of vocal pitch overlaid on the syllable ([pa] with rising pitch, 'to climb'; [pa] with falling pitch, 'to fear'). This project describes the relationship between tones as produced in conversation to those in careful speech, and how those differences affect listeners' perception of tones in the two speech styles. In the first phase of the project, recordings are made of Mandarin speakers in conversation and  reading a list of words, and the acoustics of the two kinds of tone productions will be compared. In a second phase, Mandarin-speaking subjects perform a perception task on those words, either with full acoustic information, or with a filtered version that removes segmental detail from the recordings. In this way, a measurement of the contributions of tone and segmental information to the identification of words can be made.  Further understanding of tone and conversational speech enable developments in second language Mandarin pedagogy, where a great deal of emphasis is placed on learning to produce and detect tones, an endeavor that does not come easily to many American students. The details of tonal realizations are also vital for progress in human language technologies such as automatic speech recognition, where the ultimate goal is to program computers to understand naturally produced speech, as in conversation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, publication of the results following completion of the study will disseminate the findings widely to linguists and researchers in related fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mandarin Chinese has the largest native speaker population of any language in the world (http://www.ethnologue.com/statistics/size). It is a language in which the pitch of the voice is a necessary feature for identifying words; in other words, two words may be pronounced with identical segments, e.g. [wen], but be distinguished by the pattern of vocal pitch used while saying the words (Fromkin, 1978). In Mandarin, pronouncing [wen] with a falling pitch is associated with the meaning æto askÆ, while the same segments, [wen], with a dipping-then-rising pitch are associated with the meaning æto kissÆ. These patterns of pitch are called "tones", and Mandarin has five different tones (4 full tones, and 1 "neutral" tone which behaves somewhat differently from the others). The aim of this project was to describe how the pitch and other acoustic characteristics of Mandarin words are different in careful speech and in very casual conversation.  After recording several speakers of Mandarin in Beijing at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and measuring a number of acoustic properties of syllables spoken both in casual conversation and during a careful reading of a word list, I found that relative to the very careful speech in the word list, conversational Mandarin syllables are characterized by:   much shorter durations. flatter pitch patterns (more constant pitch rather than going higher or lower during the syllable). more variable pitch (i.e. the pitch during different words with the same tone may be very different). pitch centered on the middle of the speaker's pitch range (e.g. even syllables with the "high tone" tend to cluster around the center of a speaker's pitch range in conversation, rather than centering anywhere in the "high" area of the speaker's pitch range, as they do in careful speech). different groups of acoustic cues that distinguish one tone from another.   During the project, I visited the Laboratory of Phonetics and Speech Science at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing for a summer, where I recorded these data and presented the design of this production experiment and also of a perception counterpart which will utilize recordings from this project.  These results were presented at the Acoustical Society of America meeting in San Francisco, CA (6 December 2013).
