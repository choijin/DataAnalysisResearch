<AbstractNarration>Understanding how melts are generated and focused across hundreds of kilometers through the upper mantle to the narrow mid-ocean ridge (MOR) axis is fundamental to understanding how Earth's ocean crust is formed and how elements and heat are exchanged between the interior of our planet and its surface. Significant advancements have been made in the use of computer models to investigate mantle melting and melt transport. However, the lack of complementary geophysical and geochemical data from the same area is a critical information gap that needs to be filled before progress can be made in refining present models. This research entails a multidisciplinary geophysical and geochemical program to map, sample, and analyze samples from the 8Â°20'N Seamount Chain that extends 200 km westward from the East Pacific Rise Siqueiros ridge-transform intersection  in the Pacific Ocean.  Seamounts provide a unique opportunity to test hypotheses of melt distribution and source variation that occur away from spreading centers.  Melts that build these seamounts provide geochemical windows into the upper mantle. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research includes an oceanographic cruise to map and sample the targeted region. This will be followed by geophysical data processing and petrographic, petrologic, and geochemical analyses of samples collected by both using ALVIN, a manned deep submersible, and dredging.  Goals of the research are to develop new, integrated models for upper lithosphere structure, deformation, and melt distribution at a fast-spreading center and investigate the dynamics of off-axis melting. The approach is interdisciplinary and includes analysis of geophysical and geochemical data and geodynamic modeling. Rock samples will be analyzed for all major and trace elements and radiogenic isotopes of Nd, Sr, and Pb will also be analyzed. Broader impacts of the project include creation of a marine geology curricular unit targeted at the middle school level and compliant with Next Generation Sciences Standards that have currently been adopted by 45 states. The project involves working closely with teachers and administrators of Pipkin Middle School, a nationally ranked Title I school that serves 580 students in the low-income center-city of Springfield, MO (poverty index of 78%). The teachers will work closely with the reserachers and both parties will jointly create the educational materials. Emphasis will be placed on inquiry learning and connecting fundamental science processes with current research. The pilot implementation will coincide with the proposed field program. The developed unit will be made broadly available via the web on curricular resource sites.</AbstractNarration>

The field effort component of this research was successfully carried out on the AT37-05 cruise in Nov. 2016 on the RV Atlantis using the submersible Alvin and the autonomous vehicle (AUV) Sentry.  During our field and post-cruise analysis programs we accomplished the following objectives:   (1) We conducted a comprehensive suite of shipboard geophysical surveys and Alvin and Sentry dives resulting in a spatially dense geochemical and geophysical dataset from the EPR / Siqueiros RTI out to 200 km (~3.6 My lithosphere); the first data set of this kind.  (2) Using those data we developed geodynamic models of three-dimensional melt migration, and lithospheric evolution, including a statistical parameter estimation and sensitivity study.  (3) We used the observational, map-based Sentry data and photographic data collected by Alvin to make estimates of the volumes and morphology of monogenetic submarine volcanic eruptions that build seamounts and the ocean crust.   (4) During the cruise we developed a new Marine Geology curricular unit targeted at 7th and 8th graders, which was broadly exported to schools around the country via the worldwide web.
