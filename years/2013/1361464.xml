<AbstractNarration>The project "Boston University/Keio University Workshops," funded for June 2014 - June 2017, consists of three annual workshops at Boston University in areas of mathematical research common to Boston University and Keio University, Japan.  The workshop subjects are dynamical systems and applications, geometry and mathematical physics, and algebraic geometry.  These five-day workshops will consist of lectures by experts aimed at the graduate student level, as well as talks by advanced graduate students. Funds will be used to provide partial support for US graduate students from outside the Boston area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of the Boston University/Keio University workshops is to expose graduate students to areas of strong current research interest in pure and applied mathematics and statistics.  These workshops extend the previous smaller scale BU/Keio workshops, which graduate students found very beneficial. Each workshop is anticipated to host a total of 30-50 participants. Graduate students will hear lectures from leading experts in these fields, have the chance to present their own research results in a professional setting, and network with their peers and faculty members.  A website devoted to these workshops will make lecture notes available to a wide audience:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www.bu.edu/math/special-programs/bu-keiou-workshops/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this proposal was to invite advanced graduate students and recent PhDs from outside the Boston area to the annual Boston University/Keio University Workshops.  Over the course of the proposal, we held workshops in Dynamical Systems (2014); Number Theory (2015); and Probability and Statistics (2016).  These workshops featured lectures by senior mathematicians and statisticians in these fields on topics of strong current interest.  In addition, junior participants had the opportunity to present their own research results.    We supported the hotel and food expenses for a total of 19 graduate students and 8 postdocs.  Many of these participants gave short talks or presented posters, which gave them the opportunity to present their work in a professional yet low-stress setting.  Participants were able to meet both their peers and senior researchers in their fields, and to discuss their work with both groups.  These professional and personal  interactions help develop the next generation of mathematicians and statisticians, both through networking and the exposure to cutting edge lectures.  Anecdotal feedback from supported participants was very positive. Several of the participants used their talks as a way to develop and/or refine job talks.    Funded participants also contributed to the repository of lecture notes for two of the three workshops.  These can be found at http://math.bu.edu/keio2014/talks/talks.html for the Dynamical Systems workshop and at http://math.bu.edu/keio2016/abstracts.html for the Probability and Statistics workshop.  (For the 2015 workshop, the webpage http://math.bu.edu/keio2015/abstracts.html gives a complete list of abstracts.)
