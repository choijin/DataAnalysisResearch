<AbstractNarration>A Banach space is a collection of objects called vectors  which can be added together or multiplied by numbers to form other vectors. There is a concept of distance between vectors which is analogous to the familiar notion of  distance between the points in the three-dimensional world which we inhabit. Mathematicians have found that Banach spaces provide the correct framework in which to formulate major areas of mathematics such as Functional Analysis and Partial Differential Equations. Banach spaces are also used by scientists and engineers to model problems in applied areas such as fluid mechanics, signals processing, and finance. There are an infinite variety of Banach spaces which can be distinguished from each other by geometrical properties such as smoothness and convexity. An individual vector belonging to a Banach space is identified by an infinite string of numbers called coefficients. An important problem in data compression is to find a procedure, sometimes called a greedy algorithm, for selecting the most significant coefficients so that the resulting finite string vector is a short distance from, and hence a good approximation to, the original vector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This project will investigate fundamental problems in Banach space theory and  applications to other areas. The methods employed will be those of Functional Analysis together with new insights  specific to each particular problem. These problems include the Banach Rotation Problem which asks whether Hilbert space is the only separable infinite-dimensional Banach space with a transitive isometry group. The new notion of asymptotic midpoint convexity will also be investigated. An open question to be solved is whether the isomorphic version of this property is equivalent to the known concept of asymptotic uniform convexity. Another problem to be solved in the area of nonlinear Banach space theory is whether $p$-convexity is preserved under uniform quotient mappings. Applications to other areas to be investigated include open questions on the convergence of greedy algorithms in Banach spaces, including the important case of Lebesgue spaces, and  related open questions on unconditionality and greedy convergence,  including the open problems of the existence of quasi-greedy sequences in arbitrary Banach spaces and of the boundedness of the Elton constants. Other applications include improved  explicit constructions of matrices with the Restricted Isometry Property, and  coefficient quantization properties for bases and redundant systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  A Banach space is an important mathematical concept which generalizes the three-dimensional world we inhabit. The members of a Banach space are called `vectors'. Vectors can be added together and the `norm' of the Banach space measures the distance between vectors. Some of the Banach spaces studied in this project  have infinitely many spatial dimensions. The most famous and in a sense the most `symmetric' of these infinite-dimensional spaces is known as `Hilbert space'. Banach spaces are the natural setting  for many areas of applied mathematics including Partial Differential Equations and Signals Processing.   In Signals Processing a vector (or `signal') is represented by an infinite string of `coefficients' with respect to  some `coordinate system' or `basis'.  An important problem is to  find a method for   approximating  the signal by selecting a finite list of its coefficients. An obvious procedure for doing this is to be `greedy' and to select from among the largest coefficients of the signal, as these coefficients can be expected to be the most important ones and to carry the most information about the signal. This project discovered new `convergence' properties for these so-called `greedy algorithms'.    `Banach space theory' is the name given to the area of mathematics (part of a larger subject known as `Functional Analysis'), which investigates Banach spaces and their properties for their own intrinsic interest and importance.  Although this is a  central area of pure mathematics, it has frequently produced important applications in other areas. A good example of this is the so-called `Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma', which was  first obtained  to answer a question in Banach space theory, but later became very famous when it was used  as a key theoretical tool in the applied area of `Compressed Sensing'.     This project made numerous new discoveries in Banach space theory. These include  new  characterizations of Banach spaces which involve only   the distances between certain  configurations of vectors.  This area of  `nonlinear Banach space theory'  is  driven in part  by applications in theoretical computer science and `geometric group theory'.  One of the project's  main results in this direction  concerns the famous Kantorovich-Rubinstein metric which is  used   to compute  the minimum cost of transporting commodities between cities.
