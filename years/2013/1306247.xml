<AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program of the Division of Materials Research, the formation of solid solutions is explored as a means to tune the physical properties (e.g. thermal stability, solubility, hardness) of metastable molecular crystal phases.  Solid solutions of uric acid dihydrate (UAD) and assorted inorganic, molecular and polymeric components are prepared.  The physical properties of pure materials and solid solutions are analyzed using a battery of complementary techniques with the overall goal to establish structure-properties correlations. In situ AFM provides molecular-level insight into the growth mechanisms of solid solutions. Nanoindentation studies enable comparison of the mechanical properties of pure UAD, doped UAD and the more stable anhydrous uric acid phase. The application of solid solution strategies to a broader class of molecular components known to crystallize in both anhydrous and hydrated phases enables a fuller understanding of the true scope of property changes that can be achieved in organic systems through solid solution formation.  X-ray diffraction, thermal analysis, and microscopy methods are used to compare the physical properties of pure and doped crystalline materials. Vapor sorption experiments are used to compare the deliquescence behavior of pure and doped metastable anhydrous phases.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many industries such as pharmaceuticals, foods, agrochemicals and energetics rely on organic molecular crystals.  This research aims to increase our understanding of the relationship between physical properties (e.g. stability, solubility, water uptake or release, mechanical strength) and the 3D structure of the crystal.  Prof. Swift additionally establishes a collaboration with researchers at a National Lab facility.  This collaborative research provides valuable interdisciplinary training opportunities for graduate, undergraduate and high school students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Organic molecular crystals are critical to a wide variety of industries including pharmaceuticals, food, agrochemical and explosives.  In order for crystalline materials to serve their intended function, they must exhibit the right combination of material properties.  It is generally understood that the crystal structure and material properties are correlated.  However, for organic crystals which are noncovalent solids, it is difficult to rationally tune the properties without dramatically changing the lattice structure.   The major goal of this work was to systematically examine how the intentional inclusion of foreign molecules (a.k.a. dopants) in the crystal lattice affects the structural, thermal and mechanical properties of organic crystals while maintaining the same lattice.  The studies primarily focused on uric acid, which can crystallize in hydrated, anhydrous, and various salt forms.  Uric acid precipitates are found in many environments &ndash; they are typically associated with crystal deposition diseases such as kidney stone formation and gout, as well as in bird and lizard excrement, and as the white pigment of some butterfly species.  Through this work, we have developed guidelines for what types of dopants can be included in uric acid host crystals, and the maximum allowable concentration that can be included without changing the lattice.  The direct effects of doping on material properties manifest in various ways.  Doped uric acid crystals can have a different physical appearance, solubility, thermal stability, and mechanical strength.  The lessons learned from this work are currently being applied to other crystal systems.   Some of the experiments have relied on specialized instrumentation available at national laboratories and user facilities.  At least a dozen students (graduate, undergraduate and high school) have actively participated in this research project.
