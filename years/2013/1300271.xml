<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research project is to help scientists and practitioners understand how teams of engineers, architects and builders can design buildings that have better energy performance and are more habitable. Using a healthcare project as a test case, this research seeks to explain under what conditions engineers best translate technical analysis of potential energy performance to support decision making that leads to higher performance buildings. The research combines observation of design analytics and decision-making in one healthcare project, interviews with 50 experts, and assessment of 50 completed projects. Working with industry partners, via workshops, this project will disseminate best practices found in the research.  The project will also develop curriculum to foster underrepresented participation through problem based collaborative learning and train US engineering students in translation and synthesis so that they may become better industry leaders who are able to collaborate across engineering disciplines.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will advance our understanding of collaboration, especially in the new interdisciplinary and iterative design processes that use energy modeling software. This project will advance knowledge of human-software-organizational interaction and contribute to the fields of architecture, engineering design and management, communication, and organizational behavior. Healthcare infrastructure such as hospitals and clinics consumes more than 5 percent of the total energy used in the US.  Energy conserving buildings require integrated design, whereas today analysis is done separately by different engineering specialties. By better use of analytical modeling and organizational innovation, this project seeks to improve the building process and maximize the ecological efficiency of buildings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this research was to help scientists and practitioners understand how teams of engineers, architects and builders can design buildings that have better energy performance and are more habitable. Using healthcare projects as a test bed, this research found that the delivery of high performance buildings can not be outsourced, but requires the owner organization to be deeply engaged in the design decision making, as energy design connects to building users and operations and can not be designed in isolation from those who understand the building usage requirements and preferences.  In this way the project owner representative is pivotal as they broker the interaction between owner stakeholders and the design and construction team.  In both instances when the owner's goals were clear and when the goals were diffuse, teams used rhetoric in order to make sense of energy modeling analysis and the ramifications of the findings for design decision-making.  Contrary to popular ideas about data-driven decision-making, our research shows how data is often turned back into metaphor before being used for decisions and actions. We concluded that people make data meaningful and persuasive through these communication strategies that educate, inform and mediate value; without this semantic work, data-driven decision-making is not successful.  In other words, energy engineers became storytellers who translated the data-rich energy modeling analysis into a narrative about the building's intended use and the forecasted operational impact on day-to-day energy consumption.     In this research, our team conducted over 313 hours of observation with approximately 298,000 words of field notes of observations of energy modelers at work both in their offices and at consultant meetings and 12 interviews with people who were part of our field sites. We have also collected approximately 60 artifacts (e.g. project design documents, meeting minutes, powerpoint presentations) during our observations. Our observations cover 18 building projects, 15 of which were hospital projects and six of these projects were closely observed and followed over the course of the field observations.  In addition, we also interviewed 32 individuals representing architect, engineering, energy modeler and owner stakeholders for 8 highly successful recently completed hospital projects.  In this project we observed and reflected upon the practices of translation&mdash;the work engineers and architects do when communicating design ideas to others, and synthesis&mdash;the work teams do when developing design alternatives and assessing the pros and cons of each idea against the various disciplinary perspectives in the team.      Translation:  What became clear from this research is the important role the owner representatives play in the development of facilities.  They shape the project goals (either explicitly or implicitly) and they mediate knowledge exchange between owner stakeholder groups (such as board members, end users, and building maintenance staff) and the design and construction team members.  For these reasons, we found that for successful high-performance building design, the owner representative had technical expertise, understood the constructed nature of the energy modeling analysis, and pulled people into the modeling effort when they themselves could not represent the needed knowledge about users or building operations.  It is against the owner interface that the designers and energy modelers work to translate their specialized work to support project decisions and advocate for high-performance building design options. The narratives that energy engineers and architects created were in direct response to the owner's stated or implied goals for the project while advocating for energy efficiency either explicitly or via arguments around cost saving opportunities.           Synthesis:  Owner representatives, designers and builders integrate their work in three ways: first, by addressing gaps in their own knowledge that require information from others, second, by synthesizing design and construction issues holistically, (for example, evaluating alternatives against several criteria at once), and third, through integrating construction and design work practices, (by working together in tight iterations where design develops through conversation between disciplines).  As we looked at broader industry norms that shape energy modeling and synthesis in design, it became clear that the architect?s disciplinary vision, the energy engineer's passion for sustainability, and the team's project management styles were very influential over energy design accomplishment, while firm attitudes promoting high performance design had little effect on day-to-day decision making on projects. Better energy performance appears to be a function of personal conviction to the practice of architecture, engineering and construction and the aspirations of the building owner.  When these two align, the projects achieved significantly improved energy performance.            Last Modified: 10/28/2016       Submitted by: Carrie S Dossick]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
