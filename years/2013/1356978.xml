<AbstractNarration>Currently model predictions of beach erosion events are not very reliable because they do not account for all the complex physical processes that occur in the nearshore environment.  Further study of nearshore physics will lead to improvements in coastal models.  This study will investigate mechanisms that drive sediment transport across sand bars using a combination of laboratory experiments and numerical models. Previous studies have shown that movement of sediment in the surf zone is caused by breaking waves that stir up sediment on the seafloor and near-breaking waves that drive water near the bed offshore.  As this water moves offshore, it takes sediment with it. Further study is required to determine the relative importance of these mechanisms under various wave conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: This three-year project will investigate the detailed sediment transport processes associated with a surf-zone sand bar. Experiments will be conducted in a large-scale wave flume with a fixed beach form and two sand pits. Several novel sensors will be employed to measure velocity, pressure, and sediment concentration in the water. The combined laboratory and numerical experiments will lead to improvements in understanding and model prediction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project team will conduct two educational outreach efforts. The first effort will use a portable wave flume to demonstrate storm and sea level rise response of the beach profile to middle school students, impacting approximate 350 students per year. The second effort will involve developing a permanent educational display on coastal erosion for the general public at the Hatfield Marine Science Center. Three PhD students will be trained in state-of-the-art laboratory and numerical approaches to near-shore dynamics in this project, and two to three undergraduate students per year will gain hands-on research experience in conducting laboratory experiments. This project will foster international exchange by including two researchers from The Netherlands and Japan. Graduate students will be given the opportunity to visit laboratories in both countries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our research goals aim at answering the following scientific questions:   (1)  What is the dominant mode of sediment transport over a sand bar, bed load or suspended load? Does transport mode dominance vary significantly due to the degree of interactions between wave-breaking turbulence and the bottom boundary layer? What is the role of undertow?  (2)  How do wave-breaking induced turbulent coherent structures that reach the bed influence sediment pick-up?  How do we quantify the intermittency and sediment pickup under breaking waves?  (3)  What is the role of strong pressure gradient and injection of breaking wave turbulence onto the bed in determining wave-averaged net cross-shore transport rate across a sand bar?  Is a bottom-stress-based approach sufficient to model sediment transport rate and pick-up under steep near-breaking and breaking waves? Or, can a new parameterization be added to represent the turbulence injected through depth-limited wave breaking?  Through this project, we were able to observe, for the first time, the detailed processes of sediment suspension and transport and the changes in the pore pressure within the sea bed as steep waves passed over a sand bar.  Horizontal and vertical pressure gradients may be important physical mechanisms contributing to onshore sediment transport beneath steep, near-breaking waves in the surf zone.  We were able to do this using a large scale wave flume &ndash; the largest in the United States &ndash; and new instrumentation to measure at the scale of individual sand grains. A barred beach was constructed in a large-scale laboratory wave flume with a fixed profile containing a mobile sediment layer on the crest of the sandbar. Horizontal and vertical pore pressure gradients were obtained by finite-differences of measurements from an array of pressure transducers buried within the upper several centimeters of the bed.
