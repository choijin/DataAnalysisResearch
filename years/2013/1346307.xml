<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop efficient interband cascade lasers based on innovative hybrid waveguides using dielectric and metal layers. The hybrid-waveguide interband cascade lasers will be much less demanding in the growth of device structures and will have efficient continuous wave operation in a wide range of wavelengths, as well as more capabilities such as a wide tuning range and mode selection. Furthermore, hybrid-waveguide interband cascade lasers can have significantly enhanced thermal dissipation compared to current interband cascade lasers that use superlattices as cladding layers. The success of this research project will not only realize efficient hybrid-waveguide interband cascade lasers with low power consumption, it will advance the understanding of how hybrid waveguides can significantly improve the device performance of interband diode lasers. These efficient IC lasers, with such low power consumption, will greatly benefit many useful applications such as chemical sensing, especially where mid-infrared systems must be operated with batteries and energy cost/availability is a concern, including field applications with constraints on size and electric power. The availability of high-performance hybrid-waveguide interband cascade lasers will significantly enhance the capabilities of mid-infrared laser instruments and their applications in many areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will generate new cutting-edge knowledge toward improved design and understanding of quantum semiconductor structures and devices. The realization of energy-efficient interband cascade lasers in the entire mid-infrared wavelength region will have significant impact on many biomedical, industrial, earth science, space exploration, defense and homeland security applications. The availability of efficient mid-infrared interband cascade lasers will further stimulate the expansion of the commercial mid-infrared market and even help to create new applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[          In this project, energy-efficient interband cascade (IC) lasers were developed to operate in a wide spectrum of mid-infrared wavelengths (3-11 microns).  Such interband cascade lasers can provide benefits of low power consumption and energy savings in combination with high-performance photodetectors for practical applications such as chemical sensing with high sensitivity.  Other applications of these IC lasers inlcude environmental and chemical-warfare monitoring, medical diagnostics, Infrared lidar, free-space communications, infrared countermeasures (IRCM), IR illumination, gas/oil exploration, night vision, security and pipeline/refinery monitoring, industrial processing control, and area surveillance.  Specifically, InAs-based IC lasers were demonstrated with low threshold current density at a wavelength beyond 5 microns at room temperatures.  Also, IC lasers were demonstrated based on type-I quantum well active regions with continuous wave operation at room temperature, showing an alternative way to achieving efficient semiconductor mid-IR lasers. This research project has enriched cutting-edge knowledge in the design and understanding of quantum-engineered semiconductor structures and devices. Students and postdocs have been offered unique opportunities in pursuing education, training and research in inherently multidisciplinary topics (materials science, quantum engineering, photonics, and device fabrication).  This project has enhanced the infrastructure of Oklahoma for science and technology development. This project also helps the acceleration of technology transfer and development of useful products.                 Last Modified: 01/31/2015       Submitted by: Rui Yang]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
