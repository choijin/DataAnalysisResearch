<AbstractNarration>This project supports the efforts of the National Academy of Sciences Board on International Scientific Organizations (BISO) to advance U.S. international interests through the International Council for Science (ICSU) and the Pacific Science Association (PSA).  BISO works to strength U.S. participation in international scientific and engineering organizations and builds the capacity of these organizations to contribute to international scientific cooperation.  BISO accomplishes its work by organizing, managing, and evaluating activities of ICSU within the United States.  A key aspect of BISO?s mission is to provide oversight to more than 20 National Committees to ICSU member unions and interdisciplinary bodies, thus supporting and building the international infrastructure for science.  By working with the U.S. National Committees, BISO aims to provide a coordinated U.S. voice within the ICSU community. BISO also resolves issues related to the conduct of science and responds to opportunities to reduce barriers to international collaboration in scientific research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) serves the U.S. national member of the International Council for Science (ICSU) and the Pacific Science Association (PSA).  The work was carried out by the NASÆ Board in International Scientific Organizations (BISO).  The three goals of this project were to:  Fulfill member country responsibilities to ICSU and the PSA;  Further U.S. involvement in Future Earth (FE); and Through the International Visitors Office (IVO), assist U.S. meeting organizers and foreign scientists with visa-related questions and problems.   SCIENTIFIC MERIT  ICSU is a non-governmental organization created to advance, serve, and enable science throughout the world.  ICSUÆs membership provides a wide spectrum of scientific expertise, and enables members to address major international, interdisciplinary issues.  Issues addressed during this award period included climate change, open access, disaster risk and reduction, and scientific responsibility.  The PSA is an affiliate of ICSU.  It is a regional non-governmental, scholarly organization that advances interdisciplinary science, technology, and sustainable development in the Pacific region.  Membership duties in both these organizations involve paying the annual dues; actively participating in governance activities and organization initiatives; and promoting an engaged U.S. community.  Specific accomplishments in this area are as follows:     A 3-person delegation was sent to the ICSU General Assembly (GA) in New Zealand in August 2014.  Michael Clegg, the U.S. delegation chair, was elected ICSU vice president for external affairs.  This places him on the ICSU executive board for the 2014-2017 triennium, and gives the United States greater access to ICSU. Two of the major topics of discussion at the ICSU GA were open data and big data.  Michael Clegg participated in a panel discussion on the topic, and this led to ICSU preparing a plan on how ICSU might provide global leadership on this topic. The need for closer linkages with allied organizations, such as the InterAcademy Partnership, was emphasized.  The U.S. National Academy of Sciences has traditionally played a major leadership role within the IAP. A meeting of representatives from ICSU, the IAP, and TWAS was held in February 2014 at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics to identify ways for the organizations to work more closely together.   2.      Future Earth began as an ICSU initiative, but over the years has grown into a broader program involving several other international stakeholders.  During this award period, ICSU defined FEÆs programs and structures, and developed a new co-design approach where scientists and policymakers would work together to identify needs and priorities.  Accomplishments in this area are as follows:   BISO hosted and participated in an international FE Projects Meeting held in January 2014 at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, DC.  This meeting allowed members of the FE science and interim engagement committees, the leadership and staff of the FE interim Secretariat, and the leadership of ICSUÆs Global Environmental Change (GEC) core projects and programs to discuss the integration of GEC program and projects into FE.  The meeting facilitated the preparation of fast-track initiatives and cluster activities, and eight such projects were funded within several months of the meeting.  Participants also organized into seven task forces which also furthered FEÆs work. FE needs worldwide involvement of the science and policy communities, so it turned to several countries, including the United States, for advice on the establishment of FE national committees.  The BISO Director and Assistant Director were appointed to a small international committee tasked with formulating guidance on this subject.  The resulting report is currently being used by FE to help organize FE activity in ICSU member countries.   3.       The IVO has three major roles:  assist individual...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
