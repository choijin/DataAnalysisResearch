<AbstractNarration>The proposed project seeks financial support to students and young researchers to attend the 13th IEEE International Conference on Nanotechnology that will be held in Beijing, China, August 5 - 8, 2013. The budget will be used to support US student  (undergraduate and graduate) participants and presenters. The conference will bring  together researchers and educators focused on developing nanotechnologies and applying these technologies to space, electronic, magnetic, sensor, and photonic devices and systems. The requested support will be used to provide partial travel stipends for student participants at the conference, specifically student presenters in an organized session in the form of registration fees.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The outcomes of this grant award lies in the fact that it supported five (5) US graduate students and partially supported the PI (Wejinya) to attend and orally present at the 2013 IEEE Nanotechnology Conference in Beijing, China.      Intellectual Merit:  The grant was used to provide partial cost defrayment to US student participants and presenters that may otherwise have difficulty in finding funding to attend the annual flagship conference of IEEE Nanotechology Council, and increased the overall participation in the symposium. Specifically, the funding from NSFwas used to pay partial registration fees with a target on underrepresented groups.  Broader Impacts:  The broader impacts of the proposed program includes the involvement of  US graduate students in a technical conference run by a major professional society (IEEE).  In addition to technical exposure, this experience provided US graduate students the opportunity to interact with a broad range of researchers and educators involved in this field.  A number of oral and poster presentations by student participants were given. In addition, US student participants attended an invited symposium organized by the PI (Wejinya) where academic and industry leaders and experts examined (through a workshop) the future of nanotechnology and nanotechnology education&mdash;from physics to application areas such as healthcare, space, electronics, sensors, supercomputers, etc.       Last Modified: 06/24/2014       Submitted by: Uchechukwu C Wejinya]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
