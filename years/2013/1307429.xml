<AbstractNarration>The UWMLSC group will contribute several critical elements to create a low-latency streaming on-line search for transient gravitational waves, such as those produced during the coalescence of binary neutron stars or black holes, the most anticipated gravitational wave signal. Among the data analysis elements we will create are the streaming data calibration system, a low-latency system for determining data quality and glitch vetoing, and on-line searches for signals from inspiralling compact binaries and for generic unmodeled bursts. Such a system to rapidly identify signals will be an essential element of gravitational wave science in the Advanced Detector Era, and will enable multi-messenger astronomy in which observations of several kinds (gravitational waves; electromagnetic waves; high energy particles) are synthesized to obtain a detailed understanding of the sources of the most cataclysmic events in the universe. Gravitational wave astronomy will reveal the inner mechanism of the mysterious gamma ray bursts, will provide a means to measure the population of black holes and determine the channel by which massive black holes are grown, and will probe the fundamental nature of matter above nuclear densities. New ways of measuring cosmological parameters will become available, which will complement existing observations. Gravitational wave observations will also provide sensitive tests of Einstein's General Relativity in ways in which it has not yet been scrutinized. The opening of the gravitational wave window onto the universe can potentially evince exotic objects such as naked singularities, cosmic strings, or unexpected physics. We must be ready to address these scientific challenges as our new astronomical facilities come into operation. To this end, this award will support work that may result in the first gravitational wave discoveries of compact binary coalescence, provide rapid sky localization to facilitate electromagnetic follow-up efforts, yield fast turn-around targeted searches prompted by triggers generated by other observational facilities, obtain the the nuclear equation of state by measuring the tidal interactions of binary neutron stars just prior to their merger, observe black hole formation channels and probe fundamental properties of black holes through their quasi-normal modes of oscillation, scan the sky to find undiscovered rapidly rotating neutron stars and to learn about their properties, test cherished principles of gravitation such as the no-hair and cosmic-censorship conjectures, and seek new exotic and unexpected phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our work supports the creation of critical components of a system that will allow the rapid transmittal of gravitational wave observations to the entire community of astronomers, and facilitates the integration of gravitational wave science into the broader field of astrophysics. The group has a solid track record of educating new researchers; this project will have a broad impact by training a new generation of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty members in gravitational-wave astronomy, as well as conveying the excitement of this budding branch of astronomy to the community through outreach efforts such as the UWM Planetarium.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Gravitational waves are a fundamental prediction of Einstein's theory of general relativity. One century years after the theory was put forward these waves were directly detected by the Laser Inteferometric Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO).  This stunning achievement not only verified the critical prediction of Einstein's theory, it also gave us our first direct observation of black hole formation, and ushered in a new era of scientific discovery with gravitational wave observations.  LIGO scientists from the United States and around the world are now poised to make further discoveries, to find the imprint of gravitational waves from astrophysical sources such as black holes, neutron stars, and signals from the beginning of the universe.   Intellectual merit   This project supported research and development on several areas of gravitational physics, astrophysics, and data analysis challenges that were critical path to the success of LIGO and the detection of gravitational waves. The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) LIGO research group delivered several critical elements to the low-latency streaming search for compact binary mergers.  This search proved capable of detecting gravitational wave signals from binary black holes within seconds of the waves' arrival.  An offline version of the code was instrumental in confirming detected events, and UWM group members contributed to the offline searches, including the one that confirmed the first detection of gravitational waves.  The UWM group also developed a rapid scheme for parameter estimation, which was capable of unambiguously identifying the first detection as a binary black hole merger.  The UWM group delivered tools that yielded fast turn-around targeted searches prompted by triggers generated by other observational facilities.  The UWM group also contributed statistical and computational methods for inferring the rate of black hole mergers in the universe based on the LIGO detections. Beyond the searches for stellar mass binary black holes, the UWM group led searches for high mass and for low mass binary black holes, and for neutron star binaries.  The UWM group also made important contributions to efforts to obtain the nuclear equation of state by measuring the tidal interactions of binary neutron stars just prior to their merger. Other critical path components to LIGO data analysis produced in part by this project include the time-domain calibration of the detector's output, which is central to all LIGO observational activities.  Broader impacts   In addition, this project developed collaborative research tools and facilitated broad collaboration and involvement in gravitational-wave astronomy. The project had a broad impact in training a new generation of graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty members in gravitational wave astronomy. The excitement and promise of this new field of astrophysics has been spread locally and internationally through public outreach activities. With the detection of gravitational waves, an entirely new way to observe the universe has been created. This impacts not only scientists at the cutting edge of transient astronomy, but also the public at large who shared in the excitement of the first observations of binary black holes and the confirmation of one of Einstien's greatest predictions.
