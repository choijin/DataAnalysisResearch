<AbstractNarration>This award will support an NSF/CBMS Regional Research Conference to be held at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, June 16-20, 2014. The topic is Quantum Spin Systems. The distinguished lecturer will be Professor Bruno Nachtergaele from UC Davis. The lectures will address foundations, but also recent developments such as Lieb-Robinson bounds and their applications to statistical mechanics and quantum information theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NSF/CBMS program focuses on important and timely research, with 10 lectures delivered by a leading researcher. We will fund approximately 30 participants, especially including graduate students and young researchers. A critical aspect of the NSF/CBMS conference is the production of a monograph by the distinguished lecturer. Bruno Nachtergaele's notes on quantum spin systems will be very welcome both by students and practitioners in the field. One of the applications of the mathematical topic is quantum information theory, including quantum computation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF funded project consisted of an NSF/CBMS Research Conference on "Quantum Spin Systems" which was held at the University of Alabama at Birmingham from June 16 to 20, 2014. The conference took the format of a week-long summer school aimed mainly at exposing and introducing junior researchers and young scientists to the mathematical theory of quantum spin systems.  This is an interdisciplinary field of research motivated by a broad range of applications in theoretical physics and computer science-- in particular condensed matter physics and quantum information theory.   The main speaker, who held a series of ten lectures, was Bruno Nachtergaele from the University of California Davis, a distinguished mathematical physicist and leading expert who has made major contributions to the development of the mathematical theory of quantum spin systems. There were also talks by eight other leading experts in the mathematical theory of quantum spin systems, as well as a few shorter talks by junior researchers in the field.  In addition, as is the tradition of conferences funded by the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences (CBMS), lecture notes covering the ten main lectures by Professor Nachtergaele are currently being written for publication.  The necessity of a conference and lecture notes on the topic of quantum spin systems arose from rapid progress made in this field over the last decade, with many of the recent advances not yet being available in a form accessible to non-experts. The main impact of the conference lies in drawing new talent to investigate the many important remaining questions in the field of quantum spin systems and its applications to quantum information theory.
