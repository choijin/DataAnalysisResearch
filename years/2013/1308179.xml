<AbstractNarration>In symplectic topology, computation of Fukaya categories can be broken into two steps: (1) identify a collection of Lagrangians from which all others can be obtained by formal algebraic constructions; we say that this entails finding a generating subcategory, then (2) explicitly determine the product (and higher multiplications) for the generating subcategory. The PI proposes to study generalisations of a newly developed generation criterion to families of Lagrangian manifolds, and to the variants of Fukaya categories associated to Landau-Ginzburg models. This will enlarge the class of symplectic manifolds for which large parts of Floer theory can be explicitly described.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Symplectic manifolds give an abstract setting generalising the relationship between position and momentum in classical mechanics. The study of such manifolds has recently impacted areas as diverse as the study of knots (mathematically understood as embeddings of circles in space), and theoretical physics. This proposal will study algebraic invariants that appear in symplectic topology, with the goal of furthering our understanding of the subject and its applications.</AbstractNarration>

The study of such manifolds has recently impacted areas as diverse as the study of knots (mathematically understood as embeddings of circles in space), and theoretical physics. In particular, the study of string theory has led to a deep and still not fully understood conjecture relating symplectic manifolds to spaces associated to polynomials.  The PI developed new techniques for studying symplectic manifolds, generalising work of Floer and Fukaya to associate homology groups to families of Lagrangians, with the intended application of proving the mirror symmetry conjecture. He also continued the investigation of applications of these theories, including the the study of knots and to the study of Lagrangian embeddings. He thus proved that the knot invariant introduced by Khovanov can be constructed from the study of symplectic manifolds, and that there are obstructions to Lagrangian embeddings which arise from structures that are deeper than Floer homology.   Furthermore, he wrote a monograph, intended for graduate students and researchers outside the subject to alllow easier dissemination of the results, and of the author's earlier work on Floer theory.  These results are available to the public on the arXiv as follows:   arXiv:1603.05431  arXiv:1504.01230  arXiv:1408.6794  arXiv:1404.2659  arXiv:1312.3354   arXiv:1311.5535          Last Modified: 07/01/2016       Submitted by: Mohammed Abouzaid]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
