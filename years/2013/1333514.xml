<AbstractNarration>This project will create a Theoretical and Computational Astrophysics Network with major nodes at the University of Maryland, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and Yale University to advance the theory of formation, fueling, and feedback of supermassive black holes (SMBHs).  The project proposes to accomplish this task by linking computational codes simulating large-scale SMBH phenomena (i.e. cosmological gravitational collapse and AGN jets) to the small-scale phenomena (i.e. SMBH formation and feedback on galactic structure).  For the "formation stage", the project intends to answer the question of how the first black hole (BH) seeds formed within the early universe by numerically simulating the coupling of large-scale baryonic structures and dark-matter halos to small-scale collapse of primordial gas disks into massive BH seeds.  For the "fueling stage" the project aims to explore the growth of the BH seed into a SMBH from galaxy-scale accretion flows to SMBH mergers.  Finally, for the "feedback stage" the goal is to explore the mechanisms by which the SMBHs at the centers of active galactic nuclei (AGN) couple to the inter-cluster plasma on cosmological scales.  The network will contribute to scientific workforce development through the involvement of undergraduate students, graduate students and postdocs.  The project will communicate results to the public through development of a 3-D visualization taking the viewer on a journey to witness the birth and growth of a SMBH and its influence on the cosmological environment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award was given as part of a research network connecting astrophysicists at three universities: the University of Maryland (College Park), Georgia Tech (Atlanta) and Yale (New Haven).  The overall goal of the research in the network was to understand the formation, the growth, and the impact of massive black holes in the Universe. These are topics of great interest to the wider astrophysical community, in part because massive black holes are believed to be crucial in shaping the properties and evolution of galaxies.  This award, given to the University of Maryland, focused on assessing the impact that massive black holes have on the galactic-scale (and larger galaxy cluster scale) structures within which they are embedded. The goal of the research was to understand, in detail, exactly how the (tiny) black hole at the center of a galaxy can impact (and squelch star/planet formation) throughout a whole galaxy and beyond. The researchers constructed computer models that allowed detailed studies of the production of jets by black holes, and the interactions of these powerful jets with the gas in and beyond the galaxy.  It was also found that the precise properties of the hot gas in galaxy clusters were crucial for understanding these interactions. Consequently, the researchers used the tools of theoretical plasma physics (the same tools used to understand hot plasma in nuclear fusion reactors) to study this hot gas.  Finally, work was performed on the growth of black holes, especially assessing models for black hole growth through the destruction and swallowing of stars.  In total, this research led to the publication of 19 peer reviewed journal articles.  Beyond the scientific results, this award provided vital training and professional development opportunities for two University of Maryland undergraduates, one University of Maryland graduate (PhD) student, and one University of Maryland postdoctoral research associate.  These opportunities included technical training in the methods of theoretical fluid dynamics and plasma physics, as well as career development via travel to scientific conferences and workshops.  The senior researchers, who are also Professors at the University of Maryland, were inspired by this award to develop a new undergraduate non-major lecture course on "Black Holes" which has been extremely popular and successful.
