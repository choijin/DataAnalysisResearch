<AbstractNarration>This project will develop a programmable sensing and action platform that allows application developers to efficiently and continually capture human activity with minimal deployment cost in support of national priority projects such as energy-saving or health-at-home applications that need to monitor and predict user-activities.   The existing GENI-enabled Bismark Router the platform will be the starting point for developing a platform that addresses the large fraction of US citizens that already have a home network.   The platform extends the Bismark Router code base to serve as a programmable information fusion device for sensing and actuation.   Combined with smartphones and other sensing devices, the resulting system will allow construction of sophisticated applications that rely on continuous and pervasive sensing but which can also use GENI's 'slicing' (network and process isolation) capabilities to provide privacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The resulting applications platform will enable beneficial actions such as notifying medical emergency personnel, reducing unnecessary power usage, and providing for greater public safety.  The PI will disseminate the outcomes of the project via workshops, the first of which is planned for the 15th GENI Engineering Conference in October 2012.   In addition, the PI will engage in outreach to under-represented institutions and groups via "summer camps".   All source code produced as part of this project will be publicly available</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This exploratory project investigated how user behavior is reflected in network traffic patterns.  The intellectual merit of the work is rooted in understanding how human behavior is visible in network traffic, as a result of the activities that they perform on various devices.  As our lives become increasingly connected, network traffic can be used as an important signal for various types of human behavior, sometimes in place of expensive sensors.  We explored how network traffic reflects behavior in terms of mobile phone usage&mdash;through a publicly available, open source mobile application, MySpeedTest&mdash;as well as through network traffic collected inside home networks from consumer electronics and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.  Mobile Application and Data Usage. This work funded the development of the My Speed Test application which has been used for various usage monitoring and sensing projects.  My Speed Test is currently the leading application used for gathering data about network performance and usage from the networking community, and the application has gathered data that has supported numerous publications. It has been in the Google Play store for more than a year and has been installed nearly 10,000 times by users in about 30 countries to measure network performance and usage.  Behavior of Internet of Things Devices. In this exploratory grant, weinvestigated the behavior of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in home networks to determine whether we can characterize the behavior of these devices both when they are at rest, and when they are in use by humans.  In this part of the project, we are developing machine learning classifiers to identify normal and anomalous behavior in the home from IoT devices, and analyzing the resulting traffic patterns to identify specific human behaviors in the home.
