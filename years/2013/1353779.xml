<AbstractNarration>A lot of scientific effort is now being focused on how plants and animals will respond to a warming climate. This is critically important, but very difficult because there are many other global changes occurring at the same time. For example, humans have widely spread large amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus, which are important fertilizers.  But what effects excess nutrients that are deposited mainly on land but then wash into aquatic ecosystems will have as the world warms is not clear.  So studies are needed that examine how multiple global changes like these interact at the same time.  The goal of this research project is to explore how freshwater ecosystems respond to warming and nutrient enrichment simultaneously.  The research is important because nutrient enrichment may drastically alter the effects of warming on streams and rivers and so the results should be useful as society tries to adapt to warmer conditions.  Results will also inform ecological theory that attempts to use basic principles for understanding how species and ecosystems may respond to global change.  An education program will be an integral part of  this project and will include the development of  film documentaries, student podcasts, and the more traditional training of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as research technicians. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will be conducted in a geothermally active region of southwestern Iceland, where streams exhibit a wide range in ambient temperature without significant differences in background chemistry that would otherwise influence results. The research team will use the differences in natural temperature between streams to examine how nutrient supply and temperature together influence the ecology of streams and rivers. The first objective is to quantify effects of warming and nutrients on the origin and fate of carbon and nitrogen (e.g., ecosystem productivity, nutrient uptake, and nitrogen-fixation). The team will then combine ecosystem-scale nitrogen and phosphorus additions with controlled streamside channel experiments to examine how the influence of warming on the ecology of streams and rivers is affected by nutrient supply, and whether short-term responses to warming differ from those observed in natural ecosystems over longer periods.  Responses of these ecosystem-level processes should also shape how energy and materials flow through food webs from algae to trout. The second objective is to quantify the interactive effects of temperature and nutrients on the routes of energy and materials through river and stream food webs. Food web responses to nutrients between streams of varying temperatures will be tracked using a combination of stable (i.e., non-radioactive) isotope tracer additions, secondary production measurements, and flow food web analyses. This research will provide much needed information about how two dominant global change drivers, warming and nutrient enrichment, interact to influence biodiversity and ecosystem function in an important freshwater habitat.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Climate warming and eutrophication are two global drivers of environmental change.  Both influence physiological processes, species interactions, and nutrient cycling in ways that affect how ecosystems work; however, their synergistic effects are difficult to predict given the complexity of species responses to temperature and nutrient availability.  Individual species have key differences in physiology and modes of nutrient acquisition, as well as different optimal temperature ranges for growth, that influence how they interact and ultimately how ecosystems exchange materials between land, air, and water.  For example, nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria can obtain nitrogen from the atmosphere, while non-nitrogen-fixing microbes and algae may experience restricted growth due to a lack of available nitrogen in the surrounding environment. Nitrogen fixation is exceptionally sensitive to temperature, resulting in significantly higher rates of nitrogen transfer from the air to the ecosystem with small increases in temperature. Therefore, warming has important implications for the influx of nitrogen to an ecosystem and overall growth of cyanobacteria, especially in ecosystems where nitrogen is not readily available, such as the Arctic.  We evaluated the interactive effect of temperature and nutrient enrichment on the growth, metabolic rates, and nitrogen fixation rates in algae and cyanobacteria across a natural geothermal temperature gradient in springs located in the Hengill Valley of Iceland. This site provides a unique natural laboratory where spring ecosystems vary in temperature due to near surface geothermal heating, while water chemistry and other properties remain similar.  In addition, we experimentally warmed water from a cold spring to four levels of heating in artificial stream channels. Across both natural streams and the warming experiment, we added nitrogen and phosphorus at five different levels of enrichment, to assess the interactive effect of temperature and nutrient availability on the growth and activity of algae and cyanobacteria.   Nitrogen fixation rates, cyanobacteria growth, and biomass increased significantly with increasing temperature in both natural streams and the warming experiment. Warming also caused a significant increase in photosynthetic rates and respiration; rates of increase that were similar to that observed for nitrogen fixation.  While warming should cause an increase in these biological process rates, the magnitude of increase we observed, especially for photosynthesis, was surprising and suggests that the added nitrogen made available through nitrogen fixation provided cyanobacteria with an amplified capacity to grow and metabolize.  This result suggests that climate warming may facilitate enhanced growth of cyanobacteria, especially in nitrogen-poor ecosystems, which could lead to food web bottlenecks due to toxin production and the inedible nature of many cyanobacteria species.  While we observed little response to added phosphorus across the temperature gradient, added nitrogen caused a reduction in nitrogen fixation rates and cyanobacteria biomass in both natural streams and the warming experiment; however, other non-nitrogen-fixing species grew in their place. Temperature-nitrogen interactions resulted in various combinations of cyanobacteria, green algae, and diatoms. These results suggest that primary production and nitrogen fixation rates are not limited by the availability of phosphorus in these spring ecosystems and that lack of nitrogen plays a dominant role in controlling their growth and metabolism. They also suggest that various temperature-nitrogen enrichment scenarios have very different consequences for the community of algae that develops and therefore, which food sources are available for consumers.  Most importantly, our results indicate that the availability of nutrients is a critical factor in determining how an ecosystem will respond to warming and its capacity for carbon storage and release. The availability of many essential nutrients is dependent on temperature (e.g., nitrogen fixation), and therefore the response of primary producers to changes in nutrient supply with warming should be represented in climate change models.  This project has supported the professional development of two graduate students, nineteen undergraduate students, a digital communications student, and five research technicians; a group dominated by women in the early stages of their career development.
