<AbstractNarration>The conference "Workshop on High Dimensional Topology" will be held at the University of Notre Dame on December 7 and 8, 2012.  The core problem in high dimensional topology is the classification of manifolds through the technique of surgery theory.   This involves techniques from a wide spectrum of mathematics, including algebra, algebraic topology, differential geometry, analysis, and geometric group theory.    A key theme is topological rigidity, especially the Borel conjecture and related topics such as equivariant rigidity and the Farrell-Jones Conjecture.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will feature cutting-edge lectures from mathematicians in the field.   One of the talks in the conference will survey the work of Frank Connolly, one of the leading experts in the field.  There have been several conferences recently in Europe on high dimensional topology, but a conspicuous lack of domestic conferences.  The workshop will give the opportunity for professional mathematicians and graduate studies to discuss current developments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference website can be found at&lt;br/&gt;http://mypage.iu.edu/~qkhan/conference/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant funded the "Workshop on High Dimensional Topology" held at the University of Notre Dame on December 8 and 9, 2012.   The conference accomplished three goals: (1) to inform the mathematical community on the current results and the ongoing research of the invited speakers, (2) to provide an opportunity for researchers and students to interact, providing a catalyst for mathematical collaboration, and (3) to celebrate the mathematical achievements and career of Professor Frank Connolly of the University of Notre Dame.      The conference was well-attended by 48 mathematicians and students from throughout the United States, as well as Canada and China.   In particular the grant supported the attendance of 16 students.        The conference activities centered around seven lectures given, as well as the banquet in honor of Frank Connolly.   We now report on the lectures.      Larry Taylor (University of Notre Dame): "Mathematical work of Frank Connolly."  This was a survey talk unifying the work of this distinguished mathematician.     Tom Farrell (Binghamton University): "Fibered Isomorphism Conjecture (FIC) for solvable Baumslag&ndash;Solitar groups."   This reported on the solution to Farrell-Jones Conjecture using dynamics on graphs.   Ivonne Ortiz (Miami University): "The lower algebraic K-theory of three-dimensional crystallographic groups."   The speaker reported on many of the computations in her recent monograph.   Ian Hambleton (McMaster University): "More examples of co-compact discrete group actions on products of spheres and Euclidean space."  The talk elucidated fascinating examples of symmetries of these manifolds.    Qayum Khan (Indiana University):  "Rigidity of pseudo-free group actions on contractible manifolds"   A variety of techniques were introduced to settle a significant case of the equivariant rigidity problem.     Mike Davis (Ohio State University):  "Random graph products of finite groups are rational duality groups"   Random methods from probability theory are used to produce interesting examples in topology.     Shmuel Weinberger (University of Chicago):  "Lipschitz maps and isotopies"  This is a survey of the authorÃ†s recent work in quantitative geometry and topology.
