<AbstractNarration>This project involves laboratory investigations of homogeneous nucleation on sulfuric acid and its co-reactants water, ammonia and amines. The objectives are to: (1) measure the nucleation rate of particles formed from amines and sulfuric acid over a range of conditions with a bulk source flow reactor; (2) characterize the experimental flow reactor with a photo-chemical source for sulfuric acid and nucleation rate measurements for a few amines at low sulfuric acid concentrations, (3) develop and use computation fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations of the flow reactors, and (4) develop the use of amine sources and detection techniques. The laboratory results will be compared to CFD simulations that treat the cluster chemistry in detail, yielding thermodynamic information for the formation of acid-base clusters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nucleation is the driving force for new particle formation in the atmosphere. Newly formed particles can serve as cloud condensation nuclei, important for their role in the indirect effect of atmospheric aerosols on climate. The ultimate goal of this project is to test models for nucleation rates that can be incorporated into global climate models. Undergraduate students will participate in the construction of laboratory apparatuses, running experiments, developing mathematical models, analyzing data, and authoring publications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was focused on laboratory simulations of particle formation.  A major outcome was information on how fast particles can form and how it depends on experimental conditions.  This is important because new particles in the atmosphere can affect human health and also how clouds form.  We obtained information on how particle formation depends on the abundances of typical acids and bases found in the atmosphere.  A second outcome was the development of experiments and apparatus that helped us obtain this information.  A third outcome was the use of computer models to gain further information on the chemistry of very small particles.  A total of eighteen undergraduates conducted research with the support from this grant.  Of those who have graduated, several have taken technical career pathways, a few have gone on to become STEM educators, and two have gone on to doctoral study; one in chemistry and one in materials science.    The computer modeling effort supported by this project resulted in energies of formation of the small, molecular clusters that are nascent nano-particles (i.e. particles with diameters of a few nanometers.)  This process, whereby the experiments were modeled as well as how the model results were compared to experimental results, was a substantial outcome of the project which can likely be applied to other chemical systems.   A second flow reactor system for studying particle formation was developed with support from this project.  In this flow reactor, the atmospheric formation of sulfuric acid by photolytic processes is being mimicked, thus allowing for experimental conditions that are more like the atmosphere.
