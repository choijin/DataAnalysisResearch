<AbstractNarration>This study is the first to apply psychological theories about cognitive bias and information seeking to jury selection in actual trials.  It draws on archival data to analyze how the discourse of jury selection skews evaluations of jurors' fitness for service and contributes to racial disparities observed in earlier research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study analyzes conversations among attorneys, judges, and potential jurors in 12 capital murder cases from North Carolina.  It does so using a method for conversation analysis developed to analyze racial disparities in patient-doctor interactions.  This method provides a way to characterize in detail interactions occurring in a conversation.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Previous analysis of jury selection in capital murder trials in North Carolina documented stark racial disparities. In litigation based on this research, however, prosecutors responded that race never enters their minds when picking a jury.  Yet attorneys' preference for jurors of a certain race may operate in ways far more subtle than conscious bias.  Psychological evidence suggests that people harbor stereotypes about which demographic groups are more or less likely to convict and ultimately issue a death sentence, and these operate as starting hypotheses that inform how attorneys collect information during voir dire.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will contribute to the jury selection literature by clarifying the voir dire process, and provide insight on the source of the avowedly unintentional racial disparities that persist in jury selection.  It will also provide useful guidance to participants in the criminal justice system at all levels--policymakers, legislators, judges, prosecutors, and defense counsel--as they seek to eliminate the influence of race in this system.  Finally, this project will expose law students to these issues and make them more prepared to use research accurately in court and to implement meaningful reforms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This study of jury selection for 792 potential jurors across twelve randomly selected North Carolina capital cases examines the process that produces decisions about who serves on juries.  This method documents the conversational dynamics in the actual questioning that precedes the decision to seat or strike a juror, or to excuse her for cause.  Previous analysis of these cases formed the basis of claims for relief under the now-repealed North Carolina Racial Justice Act of 2009.  That research documented stark racial disparities, but prosecutors met each defendant?s case with earnest claims that race does not enter their minds when picking a jury.  These protestations may not represent their motivations fully.  Nonetheless, there are many reasons to think that attorneys? clear preference for jurors of a certain race also operates in ways far more subtle than overt, conscious racial bias.   Substantial social psychological evidence supports the possibility that people&mdash;including prosecutors, defense counsel, and judges&mdash;harbor stereotypes about race that bear on people?s attractiveness as jurors.  These stereotypes about which demographic groups are more or less likely to convict and ultimately sentence a defendant to death operate as a starting hypothesis that informs how they collect information during the voir dire process.  Jury selection is fundamentally an information-seeking exercise, and how the questioner approaches it is susceptible to whatever biases and stereotypes he or she brings to the task.  Thus, the process of jury selection is an ideal context in which to apply research about these phenomena to better understand how racial disparities persist.  This project adapted the Roter Interaction Analysis System (RIAS), a widely used framework for understanding the dynamics of patient-clinician communication during clinical encounters.  RIAS characterizes precisely the verbal interactions that occur in a conversation and the context in which they occur.  It analyzes each utterance of an interaction, that is, the smallest part of expression that can be meaningfully coded.  Coding categories are determined in advance and tailored to the specific type of exchange under analysis.       We adapted the RIAS codes to reflect the content and context of legal proceedings for the first time.  Our 46 mutually exclusive codes are informed by prior voir dire analysis, experimental work on stereotypes and information seeking, and the literature on conversation analysis.  Coders marked every utterance in each voir dire conversation for substance, tone, and format.  Coders were blind as to the race of the jurors, the research hypothesis, and the criteria we used to select jurors for inclusion.  Our first paper presented a detailed description of our methodology and basic descriptive findings.  Lawyers question prospective jurors in voir dire partly to identify a prospective juror?s possible prejudices.  Jury selection, however, suffers from a high level of what social scientists call demand characteristics.  Demand characteristics provide a respondent with clues about the expected response and interfere with effective information gathering.  Lawyers may deploy demand characteristics selectively and do so in a manner consistent with stereotypes and inconsistent with effective information gathering.  Our first analytical paper takes the first step toward analyzing that possibility by documenting the influence of demand characteristics on juror responses.  We used time-series analyses to examine the influence of demand characteristics in sequence.  We measured the completeness of responses by the average number of characters of speech and the percent of responsive turns that included an affective utterance.  We found that juror responses were longest and most likely to include an affective utterance when the demand characteristics were weaker, and that loquaciousness and emotional content fell at each step of the scale.  This initial research suggested that both question form (open vs. closed) and content (affect) systematically predict the length and content of voir dire.  A second analytical paper builds on our understanding of the dominance of closed questions in voir dire and the prevalence of conversations that would be characterized as having very high demand characteristics.  In particular, it seeks to understand better the rare use of aggressive questioning in jury selection.  We will continue to develop our understanding through these kinds of analysis.  As we continue to work, this project contributes to jury selection literature by increasing understanding of the process of voir dire.  It may clarify the source of the avowedly unintentional disparities that persist in jury selection.  Greater understanding may suggest avenues for reform that will decrease the impact of race and enhance the reliability of voir dire.  The project also has the potential to contribute unique data and analysis to the broader field of stereotyping and discrimination research in a manner that can highlight new avenues for research.  Finally, by adapting the RIAS to legal proceedings, we will facilitate its use by other researchers interested not only in jury selection, but court proceedings of all kinds.
