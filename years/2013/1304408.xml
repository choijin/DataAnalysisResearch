<AbstractNarration>The proposed research integrates studies in a range of disciplines (paleoecology, climate, biogeochemistry, geomorphology, geology) to understand the timing, magnitude, and overall contribution of northern cold-climate peatlands and lakes to rapid increases in atmospheric methane (CH4) concentrations (AMC) during the last deglaciation. The study will use comprehensive paleoecological records of northern peatland and lake development to document their past spatial and temporal patterns of CH4 emission. This will enable better prediction of future emissions from northern ecosystems, particularly as surface permafrost thaws under scenarios of climate warming. Specifically, the PIs propose to: &lt;br/&gt;(1) Synthesize new and existing peatland, thermokarst-lake, kettle-lake and other post-glacial lake initiation data, as well as compiling such data from regions that no longer support peatlands or permafrost, such as on formerly exposed continental shelf and along southern margins of ice sheets, to gain knowledge of timing of these AMC sources during the last deglaciation; &lt;br/&gt;(2) analyze new and existing peat macrofossil data to estimate past CH4 flux from northern high latitude peatland regions as they evolved from high- CH4 emitting fens to lower- CH4 emitting bogs during the Holocene; &lt;br/&gt;(3) use novel stable isotope approaches and 14C dating to constrain the magnitude and timing of permafrost-derived hydrogen and carbon in CH4 from northern peatlands and lakes that formed when ground ice melted; and &lt;br/&gt;(4) compare their bottom-up reconstructions of past CH4 emissions and their isotope values from peatlands and thermokarst lakes with top-down modeling of global atmospheric CH4 sources based on recent, higher resolution data of interhemispheric CH4 isotope (13C, D, 14C) gradients recorded in Greenland and Antarctic ice cores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Methane is a potent greenhouse gas.  Its global warming potential is many times that of carbon dioxide.  Therefore, in order to develop scenarios of future climate change, it is important to be able to estimate how much methane will be released to the atmosphere due to permafrost degradation.  This project will constrain that number.</AbstractNarration>

In order to achieve this goal, the first task included synthesizing new and existing peatland, thermokarst-lake, and kettle-lake and other post-glacial lake initiation data and carbon cycling data. Second, in order to get the most complete picture of the peatland/thermokarst-lake forcing on the modern climate, it is important to consider the currently inundated shelf area around the continents that was exposed during the last glacial maximum lowstand. This is done through a combination of spatial dataset analyses as well as compiling core data from published records. Once the emission scenarios are tabulated vs time, they were to be compared with ice core records of atmospheric CH4 and the interpolar CH4 gradient using an atmospheric model that accounts for sources, sinks and transport of CH4 throughout the atmosphere.     At Penn State, our primary mission was to work on establishing an accurate CH4 interpolar gradient (IPG) record from two cores covering the last 10,000 years.  One core was located in W. Antarctica (WAIS) providing a southern hemisphere end member for the IPG, and the newly drilled ReCAP core from E. Greenland was selected for the northern hemisphere endmember.  The results of the CH4 analyses from these two cores are illustrated in the attached Figure.  To our surprise, the continuous ReCAP CH4 record (light blue line) showed erratic CH4 fluctuations that had not been observed before.  It is important to note that the continuous CH4 record cannot be used to reconstruct the true paleoatmospheric levels due to solubility issues associated with the analytical technique.  It normally serves as a chronologic dating tool to to compare with other ice core CH4 records.  The origin of the ReCAP CH4 record is still being debated (probably meltlayers and/or in-situ microbial CH4 production).  We tried to select samples for discrete analyses that avoided the "spikes" in the continuous record.  Unfortunately, due to errors in the depth registration of the continuous CH4 record, we did not end up with a "spike free" discrete CH4 record.  Using the ReCAP CH4 data for IPG reconstruction was not possible.     Broader Impacts:  Over the course of this project, both graduate and undergraduate students were involved in all aspects of the work.  I trained four undergraduate students (two were from under represented ethnicities and two were female) to process ice core samples for CH4 determination.  This included work in the walk-in freezer as well as high vacuum gas chromatography instrumentation.  One student wrote his senior honors thesis on the topic and adapted an atmospheric box model to simulate the ice core data he generated.  The single PhD student is currently working to incorporate the continuous flow CH4 record from ReCAP into her PhD.
