<AbstractNarration>There are many randomly growing systems. Spreads of fire, the cavity of melting ice cube, and growth of bacterial colonies are some of the examples of this kind.  Such growth patterns have the common feature that if one location is already a part of the pattern, then its neighborhoods are also likely to a part of the pattern. In this project, we study some of the underlying fundamental mathematical properties for certain classes of such randomly growing systems. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The underlying fluctuations of some of randomly growing systems are governed by the random matrix theory. We plan to study the scope and the limitations of the universality of random matrices. By studying the random matrix models with rapidly changing potential for which the bulk universality is not expected to hold, we should gain more insights on the limitations of the universality. On the other hand, the analysis of the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process on a ring and directed polymers will improve out understanding of the universality class. We also plan to study the fundamental properties of the Airy process and the Tracy-Widom, and also the asymptotics of discrete Toeplitz determinants. In the projects, the integrable/solvable structure of the underlying system will place a key technical role.</AbstractNarration>
