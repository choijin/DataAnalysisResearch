<AbstractNarration>Program Director's Recommendation &lt;br/&gt;Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR) &lt;br/&gt;Proposal #1332046, 1332118, 1331395 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding for the Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR) located at Clarkson University, West Virginia University, and the University of Arizona. Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 11-570. The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this Fundamental Research proposal the PIs will explore the migration of biometric applications into a Cloud Computing environment. Using existing cloud hardware and software infrastructure at participating Universities, the PIs will design and demonstrate a multi-university, multi-domain, multi-dataset virtual biometric cloud - BioCloud. The PIs plan to analyze access control, privacy protection and data sharing policies and techniques. Selected solutions will then be used to develop the BioCloud prototype that will support Biometric Software (Identification) as a Service (B-SaaS), Biometric Data as a Service (B-DaaS), and Biometric Platform as a Service (B-PaaS). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposed work, the PIs will develop the catalog of requirements, futures and constraints that must be addressed in identity management applications. Verifiable protection policies and techniques that guard personally identifiable information in pervasive next generation government and commercial identity management cloud-based applications are the prerequisite for the improved public trust, which in turn allows for sustainable protection of security and civil liberties. The project will further improve the industry/ university collaboration in the field of biometrics, thus increasing the chances of speedy transition of best research ideas into practice. Undergraduate and graduate students will be included in the research and prototyping. BioCloud will create a platform for innovative undergraduate and graduate school projects at the three participating universities. Special attention will be given to the recruitment of minorities and students from traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM fields</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Cloud computing offers a long-term, scalable solution to a variety of emerging challenges. In biometrics, rapidly growing data volumes, unknown performance implications of large-scale human biometric identification, and costs associated with specialized hardware apply equally to operational large-scale biometric systems as well as to researchers, who try to assemble and process large biometric test sets to advance the science of automated human recognition.  Project goals included  the investigation of cloud computing models suitable for the next generation identity management applications,  the design a multi-university, multi-domain, multi-dataset virtual cloud, capable of supporting future joint research activities,  the design and implementation of programs that assist with the translation of biometric algorithms written for test and evaluation on desktop computers to cloud computing environments, and  the analysis of existing privacy protection approaches and the design of biometric-specific privacy enhancement algorithms.    We created Bio-Cloud, a computing cluster dedicated to collaborative biometric research.  Bio-Cloud serves as a test bed and stores large biometric data sets used for research. Bio-Cloud integrates a variety of technologies, including Hadoop and Accumulo.  They enable efficient parallel computation while adequately addressing data security and privacy concerns. Through experiments, we demonstrated that Bio-Cloud can serve as a trusted computational tool for multi-university, multi-domain, multi-dataset biometric research and data sharing.   Privacy concerns that accompany biometric research cloud are non-trivial.  Most biometric images reveal personally identifiable information (PII).  We developed several technical solutions that minimize identity theft concerns.  In the domain of face recognition, we developed a systematic approach for dividing a recognition operation and a bulk enrollment operation into multiple tasks, which can be executed in parallel on a set of cloud servers.  We showed how the results from each task can be combined and post-processed for face recognition or template database generation. We further explored the role of cancelable templates for privacy protection.  Cancelable templates, as the name implies, are codes that represent human faces.  They enable efficient matching but, unlike face images, can be replaced at any time.   We also studied privacy preservation in fingerprints.  The need of sharing fingerprint images in research data sets may raise concerns.  Even though fingerprints are not easily attributed to an individual, they offer secondary information, for example, they reveal age and gender.  Our research focused on de-identifying fingerprint images in order to obfuscate age and gender information.  We developed the algorithm to reduce the risk of gender prediction from fingerprints using ad-hoc image filtering.   Like with other computational sciences, we realize that the development of parallel programs which enable effective use of large clouds will be a slow, tedious and potentially costly task.  Most biometric algorithms are prototyped and shared between researchers in the form of MATLAB source files. We developed a Hadoop &ndash; based application able to execute the MATLAB biometric functions on different computing nodes. Our biometric data distribution algorithms and MATLAB function wrappers transform sequential programs for efficient execution in the cloud environment. We tested the approach through the development of a large multispectral face recognition system and conducted thorough performance evaluation, which confirms that the speed-up on Bio-Cloud is proportional to the number of processing units dedicated to this task.     We are currently incorporating the findings of this project into courses.  Several senior design projects as well as projects in graduate-level Biometrics and Pattern Recognition courses are now using Bio-Cloud.  Instead of sha...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
