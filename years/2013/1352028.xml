<AbstractNarration>Technical: This CAREER project is to study the synthesis of large-area, uniform, and high-quality two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals epitaxial heterostructures with controlled band structures. The 2D heterostructure consists of multiple monolayers of dissimilar transition metal dichalcogenide materials (TMDC) epitaxially stacked together. Unlike other approaches for the synthesis of 2D TMDC materials, this project explores a unique, self-limiting chemical vapor deposition process that the principal investigator has developed. The project involves synergistic efforts in the development of controlled scalable synthesis of 2D TMDC heterostructures and in the understanding of correlation between the physical features and band structures of the heterostructures. It starts with studies of the fundamentals of the self-limiting growth mechanism, followed by the development of techniques for the controlled scalable synthesis based on the fundamental understanding. It also involves the development of a Raman-based characterization metrology tool to provide high-throughput characterizations for the compositions and structures of the heterostructures. Additionally, the principal investigator plans to examine the correlation between the band structures and physical features of the heterostructures. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Non-technical: This project addresses fundamental challenges in an emerging cutting-edge area of materials science. The success of this project can provide capabilities to rationally design a new class of artificial materials with compositions and structures tuned at the atomic scale. It lays down the groundwork for the principal investigator to pursue his career goal that aims to investigate new physical phenomena of 2D heterostructures and to explore these materials for applications in the field of optoelectronics. The new material platform can open up unexplored opportunities for a wide range of fields including information technology, solar energy harvesting, light emission diodes, and flexible electronic/photonic devices. The research component of this project is integrated into multifaceted educational and outreach activities that aim to inspire students (high school, undergraduate, and graduate) to pursue careers in the STEM disciplines and aim to enhance the secondary school and university curricula in materials science. In addition to providing research training for students at both undergraduate and graduate levels, the education plan includes mentoring high-school students to participate in pre-college scientific competitions and guest lectures in high schools' AP chemistry classes.</AbstractNarration>

Other than that,  the project also involves 2 postdocs/research scientists and 5 graduate students from collaborator groups.  The postdocs and students involved have received well round training in a variety of fields, including synthesis, electrical/optical characterization, device fabrications, and also theoretical calculation.  The training well prepares them for career development in the STEM fields.   The research results have been widely disseminated.  This include:  Paper: 6 published papers at highly respected journals, 2 manuscripts under review, and 1 under preparation.   Patent: 1 provisional patent filed, 1 technical disclosure , and 1 provisional patent to be file.  Technical transfer: the patent filed has already been licensed to our industrial parter, Atomic Inc. Presentations: The results have been reported in conferences and seminars tens of times.  Dissertation: The results of this project consist of important parts of 4 PhD dissertations in my group.  Media coverage: Sour works have received media coverage from tens of professional and public media worldwide.           Last Modified: 01/25/2020       Submitted by: Linyou Cao]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
