<AbstractNarration>Funds are provided to obtain direct microstructure measurements to accurately constrain the turbulent heat and salt fluxes in the upper Arctic Ocean and to deploy a combination of moored and towed-body measurement devices to develop a dynamical understanding that relates those fluxes to local internal wave and mesoscale features. The proposed cruise will be bracketed at both ends by ¡­ 400 kilometer horizontal sections across the Beaufort Gyre (BG) with the towed body instrument, SWIMS. This will provide an unprecedented 0.5 km horizontal resolution snapshot of temperature, salinity, velocity, and scalar microstructure across the ice free Arctic. Time series at select locations with a tethered microstructure profiler will provide detailed and high frequency estimates of the turbulent mixing rate in relation to unfolding wave breaking events. Finally, a mooring placed in the center of the BG will provide temporal context to interpret other measurements. Analysis will focus on 1) quantifying mixing rates, 2) understanding how near-inertial internal wave propagation and breaking respond to variable forcing rates and refraction by mesoscale vorticity, and 3) evaluating several candidate dynamical relationships between the two with an eye towards parameterization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the project include support for the training of a graduate student and for an early career scientist.  Furthermore, the proposed development of a public lecture through the Birch Aquarium¡¯s Perspectives on Ocean Science series, with subsequent web-based delivery of the video has the potential to reach a large lay audience.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Arctic Ocean is logistically difficult and expensive to observe.  Thus, much of our detailed understanding of the Arctic Ocean and its variability is likely to be provided by models for the foreseeable future.  Our faith in the output of such models increases in proportion to our ability to include unresolved processes through parameterizations.  Mixing is one of the most important of these processes.  This project, if successful, will contribute to the accurate parameterization of mixing in these models, with consequent improvement of predictions of weather and climate, stratification in the ocean, the heat flux to the ocean surface, and primary production that drives the oceanic food chain.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The award revolves around better understanding and prediction of the changing Arctic Ocean.  Most oceans are `stratified? by temperature, meaning water density is controlled primarily by temperature. Most oceans have warm water near the surface and cold water at depth, because the cold water is denser and sinks.  The Arctic is unusual in that density is set primarily by salinity.  The near-surface water is often cold but fresh; the low salt content makes it quite light, despite its low temperature.  Below that there are several layers of water that are saltier (and hence denser), but can be significantly warmer than the surface.

In the Beaufort Sea, where this work was performed, there is often a layer of warm water between roughly 30 and 80 meters below the surface that is of Pacific origin; it has entered the Arctic through Bering Strait. Well below that (roughly 250-400 meters down) there is another warm layer coming from the Atlantic.  Historically, these sub-surface heat pockets were modest in temperature.  They were also fairly fairly stable as they were usually isolated from storms by a cover of sea ice, lurking for years beneath the surface and circulating around basins, only very gradually releasing their heat.      In the New Arctic, several things are changing. First, the warmth of the sub-surface layers is increasing. Our focus is primarily on the Pacific origin water, the warmest variety of which is called Pacific Summer Water (PSW).  Several decades ago most of this water was of order 1 ?C.  More recent observations (including ours funded by this grant) have seen a new type of PSW arriving which is much, much warmer, up to 6 ?C.  Second, the rate at which this heat is turbulently mixed upwards may be changing, as the Arctic in general becomes more energetic with increasingly ice-free conditions.  A better understanding of both the processes that set this sub-surface heat structure and those which may turbulently mix the heat upwards, is crucial for improved forecast abilities for both the sea ice melt rate and a variety of other physical and ecosystem consequences.     Our NSF funded work under this grant has made important strides on several facets of this problem.  The fieldwork took place in September 2015 onboard the Research Vessel Sikuliaq, centered around the summer sea ice minimum. We used a variety of custom-made instruments to survey the temperature and salinity structure, ocean currents, and the rate of turbulent mixing.     Analysis has proceeded on several fronts as described below.

Both the trapping and re-release of heat may be controlled by submesoscale instabilities, which can occur in the presence of strong lateral density gradients.     Last but far from least, we looked at two crucial places along the edges of the basin, where water properties may be altered much more rapidly.   Analysis of measurements collected in Bering Strait are focusing on the essential dynamical balances that set the rate of water transport into the Arctic, as well as the rate at which it is mixed along the way.  Other measurements in MacKenzie Canyon reveal coastal upwelling dynamics that may short circuit some of the slower mixing rates in the deep-water basin.     In sum, we have made significant progress on understanding the energetics, heat content and dynamics of the changing Arctic. We are grateful for the opportunity.
