<AbstractNarration>Cascades, also known as epidemic processes, are network phenomena where the activation of one node increases the likelihood of activation of its neighbors; this results in an event starting at one node eventually affecting a much larger part of the network via successive spread. Cascade processes serve as flexible yet coherent models for several phenomena: spread of viruses and malware in mobile phones, diseases in human society, opinions and actions in online social networks. This project focuses on using cascades as an inference and learning tool; the aim is to ascertain important network structure and properties, from partial and very noisy observations of cascade progressions on it. This runs counter to the vast majority of work on cascades, which is focused on the "forward" problem (of predicting how a cascade will spread given network properties). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop an analytical and algorithmic framework that achieves the following three aims: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Inferring Graph Structure: What graph best explains observed cascades? From noisy samples of multiple cascade progressions, the project will formulate graph-learning as non-parametric statistical inference, and propose an algorithmic approach that leverages recent break-throughs in regularized convex optimization and iterative (forward-backward) methods. Conversely, the project will develop lower-bounds on sample complexity using statistical minimax theory. Applications abound - for instance, learning the true Twitter interest graph from observation of cascades over the follower network. &lt;br/&gt; 2. Detecting and Identifying the Causative Network: Is it possible to detect if a cascade is progressing; if so which network is it evolving on? Interactions occur over multiple possible networks in many different domains (mobile forensics, epidemiology, online social networks), pointing to the broad applicability of this thrust.  &lt;br/&gt;3. Learning Node Opinions: Users often need to be active participate for cascades to progress (e.g., retweet on social media). By correlating user decisions with user actions, is it possible to learn individual user opinions?  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For validation the project will test the algorithms both on both synthetic data and real data. Public data sets to be leveraged include Texas hospital records along with online blog and search records (Spinn3r, Twitter, Google Flu Trends, infochimps).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cascade processes are widely prevalent in modern networks. The project's algorithms and understanding of inverse problems will further the state of the art in diverse fields including biological and human disease networks, societal networks of self-interested agents, and mobile and malware networks. In addition, this project will continue and broaden the PI's emphasis on recruiting and mentoring students from under-represented communities. The industrial affiliates program of the Wireless Networking and Communications Group at The University of Texas at Austin will facilitate technology transfer to industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This project studied statistical inverse problems in settings where there is typically graph structured relationships among nodes. Applications that the project focused on included detecting the presence of epidemics, learning opinions and/or context from observations where they are not explicitly revealed, learning good actions in a setting where the effects of an action (probabilistically) cascades through a graph, and inferring the presence of edges in the graph. Some of the key results that emerged from this project include:  1.     (Identifying Causation) When cascades are spreading, it is of interest to determine the causation model (e.g., which network is it spreading on / is there an epidemic spreading). We have developed algorithms for this learning task in a variety of settings (different graph structures, link heterogeneity, spread and measurement dynamics).  2.     (Learning Good Actions) We have studied inference problems in a setting where the effects of taking an action at a node (probabilistically) cascades through a graph, and is noisily observed downstream. Only the local graph structure at the node where actions are made is known, and the intermediate transformations downstream are not known (i.e. graph structure mostly unknown). In such a setting, we have developed algorithms that infer the best action to maximize downstream reward.  3.     (Learning from Sharing) Topic modeling refers to the task of inferring, using only un-labelled data like raw text documents, both the mix of topics in each text document, and the word frequency vector of each topic. Increasingly however, one would want to find topics in content which (a) does not have words (i.e. features directly indicative of topics), for example un-annotated videos and images, and (b) where users share and view content over a social network.  Using the fact that users are more likely to share/interact with content in topics of their interest, we have developed algorithm for inferring both the topics in which every user is interested, and thus also the topics corresponding to each content piece.  4.     (Learning Graph/Community Structure) We developed community search algorithms to find the nodes in a single community.  A small number of nodes from the target community are labeled and provided to the algorithm. Using this side-information, we have developed a variant of the method of moments that identifies nodes in the target more reliably, and with lower computation, than generic community detection methods that do not use side information and partition the entire graph.  Broader Impacts: The results from this project have been broadly shared with the community through presentations at conferences, papers at peer reviewed conferences and journals, and talks at universities and industry groups. The results have also been shared with industry participants through posters and discussions organized by the Industrial Affiliates Program of the Wireless Networking and Communications Group at UT Austin. Finally, the research has supported the Ph.D. research of graduate students who acquired expertise in statistical modeling and inference, and subsequently have joined leading industry labs.
