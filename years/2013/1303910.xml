<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2013 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Sean Li is "Metric Geometry." The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Chicago, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Marianna Csornyei.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Subriemannian geometry is the geometry of constrained motion.  It can be used, for example, in robotics as the robot may only be able to move in certain ways.  One of the results of this project is developing criteria for when sets of points in a simple model subriemannian space can be visited in finite time.  These ideas could have potential influence on motion planning algorithms in more complex subriemannian spaces.   Nowadays, there is a well developed calculus that exists in spaces that can be very non-Euclidean.  In such a space, one can very explicitly say what the derivative of a function is.  Until now, a precise reason for why certain spaces and not others have the calculus has been unclear.  We showed that this calculus exists if and only if the space contains many interweaving families of curves so that the calculus on lines learned in Calc I can be stitched together to get calculus on the entire space.   Rectifiability is a rough notion of a hypersurface and reflect the existence of lower dimensional structure in a potentially high dimensional space.  Detecting such behavior can be important as they allow one to reduce to a lower dimensional setting.  In this project, we showed that rectifiability is intricately linked to the growth of balls on small scales as well as the presence of calculus on the entire space.  This is the first such criterion for rectifiability in a non-Euclidean setting.  The ideas could help in future dimension reduction techniques.
