<AbstractNarration>We will soon enter the manycore era, in which systems will include&lt;br/&gt;hundreds of cores, large multi-level cache structures, sophisticated&lt;br/&gt;networks-on-chip, many memory controllers, and huge amounts of main&lt;br/&gt;memory.  These systems will also embody a rich array of power&lt;br/&gt;management mechanisms and will strive to achieve high performance&lt;br/&gt;under various power, energy, and thermal constraints.  Unfortunately,&lt;br/&gt;the uncoordinated power management of a system's components can&lt;br/&gt;produce oscillating behavior, higher power/energy/temperature, and/or&lt;br/&gt;excessive performance degradation.  Given their large number of&lt;br/&gt;hardware components and the wide spectrum of available mechanisms,&lt;br/&gt;manycore systems will have to coordinate the actions of their various&lt;br/&gt;power managers.  Moreover, to decide on a (coordinated) course of&lt;br/&gt;action, these systems will have to comprehensively and rigorously&lt;br/&gt;reason about various performance and power/energy/temperature&lt;br/&gt;tradeoffs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop global power coordination (GPC) to manage the&lt;br/&gt;combinatorial explosion of possible power management configurations in&lt;br/&gt;manycore systems.  GPC will be realized using an engine that analyzes&lt;br/&gt;the space of possible power state configurations for the entire&lt;br/&gt;system. It will then decide which configurations are most appropriate,&lt;br/&gt;and use per-component power managers to actuate the proper settings.&lt;br/&gt;To optimize the search for good configurations, GPC will consider&lt;br/&gt;greedy search heuristics that prune the space by relying on novel&lt;br/&gt;techniques that estimate the benefit of power state changes, group&lt;br/&gt;resources with similar power management hooks, and leverage prior&lt;br/&gt;observed behavior and a hierarchical organization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will broadly impact society in many ways.  First,&lt;br/&gt;addressing the power, energy, and temperature problems of manycore&lt;br/&gt;systems can greatly impact the datacenters that run our Internet&lt;br/&gt;services and the high-performance systems that advance our science.&lt;br/&gt;Second, tackling these problems will address one of the key&lt;br/&gt;technological barriers in the computing industry.  Third, the project&lt;br/&gt;will educate graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students, while&lt;br/&gt;broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in computer&lt;br/&gt;science.</AbstractNarration>
