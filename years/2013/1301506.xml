<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Jakob Magolan of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Idaho will develop a unique class of synthetic methods that rely on the merger of heterogeneous catalysts and reagents with one-pot multi-step approaches.  Some of these methods will utilize site-isolation, a unique property of insoluble reagents that enables the co-existence of seemingly incompatible reactive sites (such as acids and bases) in the same reaction mixture.  This strategy, which remains largely unexplored by the synthetic community, will be exploited to achieve unusual one-pot synthetic transformations.  New tandem concurrent heterogeneous catalysis strategies will be applied to a range of chemical transformations including reductive amination, aromatic amination, synthesis of 1,3-diketones, crossed aldols, and efficient preparation of several common heterocyclic motifs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One pot multistep reactions could have significant advantages in reducing waste generation and costs in chemical synthesis, as they minimize the number of isolation steps that are labor intensive and often generate a significant amount of waste solvents. Site isolation can also lead to reactivities that are difficult to achieve.  These strategies are broadly applicable for use in the synthesis of a wide variety of compounds that are of interests to the pharmaceutical, chemical, agricultural industries.  The development of green chemistry themed experiments utilizing heterogeneous tools for use in undergraduate teaching laboratories is also planned.  This project will provide excellent training of graduate and undergraduate students.  Undergraduate summer research students will be recruited from within the University of Idaho as well as various 4-year colleges across the state.  Efforts will be made to include students from minority groups that are underrepresented in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this research was to develop superior new chemical synthesis methods for the benefit of synthetic chemists engaged in pharmaceutical and agrochemical discovery research.  We employed heterogeneous (insoluble) reagents including clays, silicas, and aluminas to enhance the efficiency of synthetic procedures by simplifying the purification of reaction products.  During the course of this project our research team at the University of Idaho investigated fourteen new reaction methodology strategies that included all of the aims described in the original research proposal and several further aims that arose during the course of this work.   We found that our initial proposed strategy of concurrent heterogeneous site-isolated acid/base catalysis for one-pot sequential multi-step synthetic transformations proved to be generally plagued by problems of poor selectivity and product yields.   We were successful in the development of two heterogeneous reactions that are now published in peer-reviewed journals: 1) a new dehydroaromatization reaction enabled by vanadium pentoxide in the presence of silica gel, and 2) a new selective carbonyl reaction made possible by the use of rehydrated alumina.  The latter was the first example of alumina rehydration as a strategy to modulate the regioselectivity of a synthetic process.  Several projects initiated by this program are ongoing in our laboratory with publications forthcoming.  These include: alumina-mediated alkylation of heterocycles with enones, alumina-mediated olefin epoxidation, and a series of transformations enabled by a new synthetic iron-rich clay.  This NSF grant also directly, and indirectly, supported an extensive training program in our laboratory that exposed many University of Idaho students to a vibrant and inspirational synthetic organic chemistry research environment.  These students included two graduate students who both completed their Ph.D. degrees and eight undergraduate students whose training in our lab enabled them to subsequently join strong graduate programs in chemistry across the United where they continue to grow as skilled and knowledgeable researchers dedicated to the pursuit of impactful science.
