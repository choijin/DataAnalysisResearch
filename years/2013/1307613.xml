<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;Centrioles are conserved microtubule-based organelles that play essential roles in numerous cellular functions and in an organism's development.  A cell requires exactly two centrioles in order to normally divide and function.  Thus, it is important that centriole number is precisely regulated.  However, in many animals, it appears that the unfertilized oocyte lacks any centrioles and it inherits only one centriole from the sperm.  As a fertilized oocyte has two centrioles, it acquires the second centriole via an unidentified mechanism.  The goal of this project is to better understand how the second centriole is acquired using Drosophila melanogaster as a model system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;As well as answering basic Developmental and Cell Biology questions, this project will provide many developing and novice scientists (e.g., undergraduate and high school students) an opportunity to experience laboratory research at a top tier institution.  Over the past five years, the Avidor-Reiss laboratory has developed and executed a student outreach program that provides students from Boston-area high schools and colleges with short term (2 - 3 month) or long-term (2 - 3 year) laboratory internships where they can gain direct training and exposure to research in the biological sciences. This is an exceptional and ideal opportunity for a young person who is considering a career in science.  In conclusion, the proposed research will help educate and inspire the next generation of researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Centrioles are conserved microtubule-based subcellular organelles with 9-fold symmetry that duplicate precisely for proper cell division and function.  However, how animals inherit their first centrioles during reproduction is not clear.  Here, we test the hypothesis that a new unique type of centriolar structure, the PCL, is mediating centriole inheritance.  We came up with this hypothesis after unexpectedly discovering the PCL in Drosophila sperm.     With the NSF funding we now have support for the PCL role in mediating centriole inheritance:    1)    We identified, in Drosophila melanogaster spermatids (differentiating haploid sperm cells), a second centriolar structure and named it the proximal centriole-like (PCL).   2)    The PCL is similar to a centriole, sharing many of the same proteins including: Asl, Ana1, Ana2, Bld10, Sas-6, and Sas-4.    3)    PCL formation is dependent upon the same proteins that are involved in the initiation of centriole formation, such as: Plk4, Sas-6, and Asl.  4)    Unlike in centrioles, Sas-4 and Bld10, which are essential for centriole microtubule formation and stability, are not essential for PCL formation.  5)    The PCL ultrastructure lacks microtubules and resembles a centriole precursor.  6)    The sperm PCL becomes the zygoteÃ†s second centriole by recruiting PCM, forming an aster, and serving as a template to form a daughter centriole.
