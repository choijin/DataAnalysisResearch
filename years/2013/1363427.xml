<AbstractNarration>1363427&lt;br/&gt;Miller&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The recent floods in and around Boulder, Colorado resulted in at least 4000 damaged residents.  One of the side effects of flooded basements or homes is the growth of fungi and bacteria.  The growth of these organisms can increase the risk of exposure and possibly have adverse health outcomes.  The research team has already obtained a control samples from a set of pre-flood homes.  This research project will enable them to conduct similar sample collections post-flood.  They will then evaluate the use of full-room disinfection of flooded homes.  They intend to use ultraviolet germicidal lights (UV lights) to disinfect the rooms.  The results will be presented at the Healthy Buildings 2015 Regional Conference for the Americas and a research paper will be submitted to Indoor Air or related journal. Recommendations for the use of UVGI in flood remediation will be communicated to the appropriate groups (e.g. FEMA, IICRC, NFIP).  Through the Discovery Learning Apprentice program in the College of Engineering and Applied Science undergraduate and graduate students will assist in every aspect of this study.</AbstractNarration>
