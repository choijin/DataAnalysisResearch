<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation for the R/V Hugh R Sharp, a 146 foot Regional research vessel operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The R/V Hugh R Sharp is a state-of-the-art, coastal research vessel that is owned and operated by the University of Delaware. The vessel can carry fourteen to twenty scientists on cruises up to eighteen days in duration, and supports projects from all disciplines of oceanography. The vessel is a regional asset, serving researchers from many institutions throughout the mid-Atlantic. The vessel typically operates in the coastal waters from Long Island, New York, to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, as well as the Delaware and Chesapeake Bays. Projects occasionally require the vessel to work as far north as the Gulf of Maine, as far south as Florida, and as far offshore as Bermuda. In 2012, the R/V Hugh R Sharp completed 204 days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 37% of the total sailing schedule. In 2013, R/V Hugh R Sharp is scheduled for 216 days with NSF days accounting for 35% of the total sailing schedule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oceanographic instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; 1) Chirp 3260 Dual Channel Echo Sounder $63,200 &lt;br/&gt; 2) Scanfish Upgrade  $66,000 &lt;br/&gt; Total $129,200 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two of the Proposal Guidelines. They provide infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Outcome Report         Intellectual Merit: The awarded equipment will help support scientific operations and data collection in the mid-Atlantic region.  The intellectual merit of these individual projects is determined by peer review at NSF.  The scientific questions posed must be meritorious enough to warrant the funding, and only those few will be fortunate enough to go to sea.           Broader Impacts:  The number of missions supported averages around thirty per year for a vessel in the coastal zone.  The science support equipment project herein will enhance the infrastructure needed for research and education on the vast majority of those cruises.          Award number OCE1318660, "Oceanographic Instrumentation" was awarded for $50,000 in April 2013. These funds were identified to purchase a replacement Knudsen Chirp 3260 Echo Sounder for science use aboard the R/V HUGH R. SHARP.          The Knudsen Chirp 3260 Echo Sounder system has entered service and will be deployed with the start of the CY2014 sailing season. The following NSF supported science research projects will make use of this system during the CY2014 sailing season:         Dr. Campbell (OCE 123371) Funded    Project is two 7-day cruises. Shipboard systems used will be CTD, SMS, lab grade water maker, and ADCP. Both an isotope and general purpose van will be required. Science will be studying microbial activity and biomass in the surface waters of the Delaware coastal, the Delaware Bay and estuary and bay of the Chesapeake. One technician will sail and provide support.         Dr. Luther (113110) Funded    Project is one 8-day cruise and one 2-day cruise. Shipboard systems used will be CTD, SMS, ADCP, and fiber-optical capable trawl winch. One clean and one general purpose van will be required. Science will be developing a sensor system for in-situ real-time measurement of Manganese cycling. One technician will sail and provide support.         Dr. Mulholland (1260574)    Project is one 22-day cruise. Shipboard systems used will be CTD, SMS, ADCP, and bow deck for air sampling deployment. The goal is to determine the impacts of wet deposition of nutrients on coastal biogeochemistry, particularly primary productivity.  One technician will sail and provide support.         Dr. Summerfield (1325102) Funded    Project is two 4-day cruises. Shipboard systems used will be CTD, SMS, ADCP, and back-deck. Cruise will involve oceanographic mooring work in the Hudson River and Delaware Bay. One or two technicians will sail and provide support.              This completes award number OCE1318660, titled "Oceanographic Instrumentation".          Last Modified: 04/15/2014       Submitted by: Timothy W Deering]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
