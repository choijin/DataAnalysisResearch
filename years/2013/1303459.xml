<AbstractNarration>This award will provide participant support for early career scientists and graduate students to participate in the "7th Huntsville Gamma-ray Burst Symposium" hosted by the University of Alabama in Huntsville and the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. It will be located at the Hotel Hutton in Nashville, TN, from April 14-18, 2013. The Swift and Fermi teams will organize this international conference on Gamma-Ray Bursts studies, covering topics relevant to the field, including, but not limited to, the results provided by these two missions. Gamma-Ray Bursts are among the brightest known sources in the gamma-ray sky, visible at larger distances than the furthest galaxies observed, and thought to be the most powerful natural particle accelerators. A prompt, variable phase bright in the keV to GeV energy ranges is followed by an afterglow phase, more typically observed from radio up to X-rays.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;For Broader Impacts, it has a particular focus on early career researchers. Contributions in the form of posters are strongly encouraged. The workshop will feature a public lecture on a topic related to this field of research. This event will be organized in collaboration with the Barnard-Seyfert Astronomical Society, that hosts a free public lecture in each of their monthly meetings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PI; co-Is: Veronique Pelassa; Valerie Connaughton, Michael S. Briggs   Intellectual merit and context Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRB) are among the brightest known sources in the &gamma;-ray sky, visible at larger distances than the furthest galaxies observed, and thought to be the most powerful natural particle accelerators. A prompt, variable phase bright in the keV to GeV energy ranges is followed by an afterglow phase, more typically observed from radio up to X-rays. New observations are necessary to probe and constrain available models. In particular, NASA's Swift and Fermi space telescopes currently allow for most observations and studies, which have brought new insights on both the prompt and afterglow emissions of GRB.    An international conference on Gamma-Ray Bursts studies organized jointly by the Swift and Fermi teams took place on April 14 &ndash; 18, 2013 in Nashville, TN. It covered various topics relevant to the field, including, but not limited to, the results provided by these two missions, and a discussion on the future of GRB observations. This was the 7th in a series of GRB conferences hosted by the University of Alabama in Huntsville and the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, which started with BATSE GRB conferences in the 1990Æs, and the 2d of these co-organized by the Swift and Fermi teams. Talks were given in plenary sessions only, to maximize the audience and exchange on each participation, while posters were accessible all week long.    The full program with abstracts and presentations can be found at the following address : http://huntsvilleinnashville.uah.edu/   Broader impacts &ndash; Purpose and result of the awarded project The NSF funding helped us to maximize the number of different teams, countries, and institutions represented (115 participants from 18 countries) so as to optimize the exchange of ideas during the meeting, and to provide our early-career colleagues with an opportunity to learn more about their field and develop collaborations. The funding granted by the NSF ($10,000 total) was used to provide financial support to early-career researchers (graduate students and young postdoctoral researchers) to participate to the 7th &laquo; Huntsville GRB Symposium &raquo;. This support was provided as a partial reimbursement of travel costs, for an amount not to exceed $1200 for each awardee, based on receipts sent by the awardees after the end of the conference. Nine attendees were chosen to receive this financial support : 6 graduate students and 3 postdocs &ndash; among them one woman &ndash; from institutions of 6 countries (including the United States). All were required to attend the conference and contribute either a poster of an oral presentation.   A press conference was held, on the topic of ultra-long gamma-ray bursts, a special class of sources which were the focus of a special session durting the conference. Articles can be found for example at the following addresses : http://www.universetoday.com/101486/new-kind-of-gamma-ray-burst-is-ultra-long-lasting/ http://www.ineffableisland.com/2013/04/dying-supergiant-stars-implicated-in.html http://www.irap.omp.eu/en/actualites/actu_gamma   We took the oppportunity of this gathering of specialists to ask a senior scientist to present our field to non-scientists in a free public lecture, organized in collaboration with the Barnard-Seyfert Astronomical Society of Nashville. The lecture was very well received by the amateur astronomers. A workshop for middle- and high-school teachers was also organized in collaboration with the Vanderbilt Dyer observatory, on the topic of black holes and gamma-ray bursts. After the workshop the participants were invited to visit the Observatory's facilities.           Last Modified: 04/21/2014       Submitted by: Veronique Pelassa]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
