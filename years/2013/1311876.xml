<AbstractNarration>Memphis Virtual STEM Academy at East High School&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Memphis Virtual STEM Academy at East High School project investigates the implementation of a virtual STEM curriculum that utilizes self-paced modules, face-to-face STEM laboratory projects, and field experiences designed to help students (grades 9-12) understand pre-engineering concepts and principles as well as develop an interest in and motivation to pursue STEM and ICT careers. The four project objectives are to:  1) increase Virtual STEM Academy students' use and integration of technology into their learning experiences; 2) increase Virtual STEM Academy students' STEM learning as compared to students in other district STEM-focused programs; 3) decrease gaps in achievement and technical skills among student populations by gender, racial/ethnic background, and economic level; and 4) increase the Virtual STEM Academy students' STEM career awareness and interest. The Academy establishes a single site, centrally located in the district, which provides a state-of-the-art laboratory facility and well-trained teachers with engineering degrees.  Students from the district's more than 40 high schools are able to access high quality lab facilities and teachers not typically available to local high schools. Approximately 100 freshmen will enroll in the Academy each year, selected on the basis of qualifying scores on the ACT Explore assessment, completion of a statement of interest for engineering or engineering technology, and a letter of parental support. Primary partners in the project are Shelby County Schools (formerly Memphis City Schools) and the Herff College of Engineering at the University of Memphis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project design is a hybrid model that permits students to remain at their geographically assigned school for a program of study that incorporates Internet-based curriculum intended for flexible use based upon national best practice implementation and integration strategies.  All students will take Introduction to Engineering and Principles of Engineering, providing students with the opportunity to link content and apply it to solve real-world problems. Students then choose an elective track from the focus areas of civil engineering &amp; architecture, biotechnology, manufacturing or energy and participate in corresponding laboratory exercises and projects as they attend the lab facility during the evenings or on Saturday. ITEST strategies to enhance student interest include student support, teacher support, STEM interest development, and partnership development. Capacity-building includes training of STEM teachers at home schools, tutoring from engineering undergraduates, and engagement of local industries for site visits and internships. The evaluation plan utilizes a quasi-experimental design with formative and summative analyses of data sources that include enrollment and retention figures, student performance (GPA, ACT, AP, End of Course Tests, observation, interest inventories, graduation rates), and professional development participation. The method of analysis will include both descriptive statistics and inferential tests, including associated effect sizes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project deliverables and products will include a detailed description of the model and the implementation plan as well as research articles, reports, and presentations regarding the effectiveness of the project model and its impact on improving student interest, identity, and persistence in STEM. Approximately, 400 students (in grades 9 - 12) and 70 STEM teachers will be directly targeted during the project period.  However, the project will also reach and serve middle school students who express initial interest in STEM careers.  The Virtual STEM Academy is designed to create broader impacts locally, regionally, and nationally in K-12 and higher education environments by addressing some of the challenges faced by large, urban school districts in their efforts to offer STEM programs of study with limited resources (human and fiscal) and/or student interest at one particular school.  The model developed will demonstrate how an innovative approach that leverages existing resources can be used to create a unique learning opportunity for students without having them transfer to a magnet school.  The findings from this project will not only support the efforts of large, urban districts but may also be relevant to small, rural school districts that face similar challenges.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Memphis Virtual STEM Academy at East High School Project Outcomes Report  The Memphis Virtual STEM Academy (MVSA) project investigated the implementation of a virtual STEM curriculum that provided students with self-paced modules, face-to-face STEM laboratory projects, and field experiences designed to help students understand pre-engineering concepts and principles. This strategy provided high quality STEM educational opportunities to diverse populations of students attending high schools that were unable to offer an equivalent program of study due to inadequate laboratory facilities and/or the absence of high-quality STEM teachers. The project also included STEM outreach activities for middle school students, professional development and community building for STEM teachers, and development of undergraduate STEM majors as teaching assistants and activity facilitators.  The MVSA program was implemented by Shelby County Schools (SCS), using state of the art lab space developed by the district at East High School.  Students from any school in the district were able to participate, with the MVSA program being additional to the courses the students took at their regular school.  The goal of the project was to design, implement, and evaluate a program that supports student engagement in real-world, relevant experiences that reflect the skills, knowledge, and practices represented in the STEM workforce and motivate students to pursue STEM career pathways. Our objectives included increasing students? use of technology in learning experiences, overall STEM learning, and STEM career awareness and decreasing gaps in achievement and technical skills among diverse student populations.  Findings from this project indicate that the Memphis Virtual STEM Academy was successful in recruiting a diverse population of students. The enrollment data revealed that students enrolled in the MVSA consistently represented a wide breadth of race, gender, and economic backgrounds. The Memphis Virtual STEM Academy has been able to recruit from populations that are historically underrepresented in STEM programs such as female and African-American participants; approximately 40% of the students enrolled in the program during this project were female and the majority of enrolled students were African American (nearly 80%). Additionally, Hispanic students accounted for almost 10% of program participants. Furthermore, economically disadvantaged students made up a sizeable portion (37%) of the students participating in the MVSA. The MVSA program was successful in meeting project objectives, with MVSA students outperforming their peers at other STEM schools on end of course tests in math and science and graduating at a 100% rate. It should be noted that students participating in the MVSA were doing so in addition to their regular school programs. This means that students in the program may have been more motivated and/or dedicated to STEM learning because of the extra time they chose to commit.  Primary challenges with this project were with the MVSA model itself. The program offered online STEM courses to students in any school within the district.  Students were then required to attend weekly laboratory sessions after school or on weekends.  This proved to be a challenge both in terms of consistent participation by students and interest of teachers in staffing the program.  Another challenge faced was that of assigning grades for STEM courses to the students in MVSA, who were students at a multitude of schools across the district. District grade reporting was not set up to allow grades to be transferred to a students? report card from multiple schools, so grade reporting had to be done manually for MVSA.  This resulted in a lengthy time for grade processing and frustration on the part of students and parents.  Intellectual merit  The MVSA project team implemented, evaluated, and refined a model for delivering STEM courses, including hands-on experiences, to students across an entire district.  The lessons learned from this process will be particularly useful for others considering implementation of a similar virtual program.  Broader impacts  An important broader impact of this project was development of a strong culture of STEM teaching and learning throughout the district because of the focused professional development provided to teachers, and recognition of the program components that are successful for attracting and motivating diverse students.  The project resulted in a culture of collaboration and continuous professional development for STEM teachers in the district.  Additionally, undergraduate STEM students involved in this project as teaching assistants reported strong positive outcomes. Importantly, 100% believed they made a positive impact on a student or students through serving in the role of Ambassador. In addition, 100% indicated the program helped them understand how they could make an impact in their community, reported better communication skills as a result of this program, and believe they gained valuable knowledge and insight they would otherwise not have been able to obtain without this program.
