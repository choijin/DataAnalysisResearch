<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This travel grant supports student researchers from US institutions to attend the 2013 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS 2013) that was held in Berlin, Germany, from November 4 to 8, 2013.  It supported 10 students from 10 US institutions, with $1000 travel grant to each.   As CCS provides an environment to conduct intellectual discussions and exchange ideas that are instrumental in shaping the future of computer and communications security, one highlight and proud tradition of CCS is its vibrant participation of graduate students.  Graduate students are critical ingredients of research endeavours in most universities and some research labs. Many ongoing research cannot be successful without contributions from students. Research leaders in this field tomorrow will mostly come from the graduate students conducting high quality research today.  By supporting students from US to attend CCS, this grant helped expose them to the dynamic intellectual environment of CCS, and helped improve the atmosphere of the conference as well.   A stringent criteria was established and applied for selecting eligible students to receive the travel grant, including that the student must be enrolled in a university in U.S., must be conducting active research on topics interesting to CCS attendants, must have a strong endorsement from their home department, and must have a financial need. Particular consideration was given to applicants who are underrepresented.          Last Modified: 12/10/2014       Submitted by: Jun Li]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
