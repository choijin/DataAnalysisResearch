<AbstractNarration>Nanotechnology is at the center of much of the emerging scientific breakthroughs of our time.&lt;br/&gt;The ability to manipulate matter at the almost atomic scale enables a wide range of scientific and&lt;br/&gt;engineering discoveries. Key to the realization of many breakthroughs is the ability to rapidly&lt;br/&gt;fabricate and test devices and concepts at the nanoscale. This proposal seeks to bring together a&lt;br/&gt;diverse body of experts to examine and move forward the state-of-the art of nanomanufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Objective: The main objective of this workshop is to bring together industry, government and academic leaders in manufacturing and nanotechnology for a two day interactive discussion on prototyping of emerging devices enabled by precisely integrating nano-scale structures and materials. The goal of this workshop is to explore ways to take the techniques and methods developed in the lab and translate them into nanomanufacturing systems on a scale and cost that allows them to be widely adopted by organizations, large and small.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Nanotechnology is at the center of much of the emerging scientific breakthroughs of our time. The ability to manipulate matter at the almost atomic scale enables a wide range of scientific and engineering discoveries. Key to the realization of many breakthroughs is the ability to rapidly&lt;br/&gt;fabricate and test devices and concepts at the nanoscale. This proposal seeks to bring together a&lt;br/&gt;diverse body of experts to examine and move forward the state-of-the art of nanomanufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: While transformative in the lab, nanotechnology has not made its way into the every-day tool set of aspiring companies. Key to their ability to innovate is the development of rapid prototypes of nanoscale devices, sensors and structures. This workshop will bring together experts to enable collaborations and also cross pollination of ideas. Furthermore, the workshops directive is to develop a roadmap and action plan for accelerating the development of nanomanufacturing infrastructure. The workshop will present a report on its findings and will archive the discussions and paper proceedings for world-wide distribution.</AbstractNarration>
