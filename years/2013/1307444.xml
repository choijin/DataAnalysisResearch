<AbstractNarration>In the recent work,  the universality  conjecture for the local spectral  statistics was solved for both Winger ensembles and beta ensembles. The goal of this proposal is to extend this  understanding  to large classes of  random matrices. The objective is  to understand the grand vision of Wigner,   which asserts   that local spectral statistics of large correlated  quantum systems are universal. Specifically, the following projects are proposed: &lt;br/&gt;1.  The spectral properties  of  Wigner matrices   with random potentials. These are toy models for &lt;br/&gt;random Schrodinger operators on lattice. &lt;br/&gt;2. The statistics of both eigenvalues and eigenvectors in  band  and sparse matrices.   In addition to these two projects,  local statistics at the level of individual eigenvalues will also be studied. More specifically, the intention is to look into the following problems:  &lt;br/&gt;3. The single gap universality, i.e., identify the probability distribution of a single  gap in random matrices. &lt;br/&gt;4. The universality of local statistics at a fixed energy. &lt;br/&gt;5. Identify the Gaussian fluctuations of a single eigenvalue in  Wigner matrices, i.e., extending  Gustavsson's result for GUE  to all Wigner matrices. &lt;br/&gt;6. Establish the edge universality via  Dyson's Brownian motion. &lt;br/&gt;These problems will be approached  using the Helffer and Sjostrand representation of correlation functions and the parabolic regularity  in the work of Caffarelli, Chan and Vasseur. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Eugene Wigner's grand vision asserts that local spectral statistics of large correlated quantum systems are universal. In our recent work, we solved the universality conjecture for the local spectral statistics for both Wigner ensembles and beta ensembles. The goal of this proposal is to extend these findings to large classes of random matrices and expand our understanding of Wigner's vision.</AbstractNarration>
