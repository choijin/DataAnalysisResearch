<AbstractNarration>Kirigami (from the Japanese kiru, which means to cut) offers a previously unattainable level of design, dynamics, and deployability to self-folding and self-unfolding materials from the molecular to the architectural scale. "The art of structure is how and where to put holes," said structural engineer and architect, Le Ricolais. The objective of this research project is to take this principle to the next level: buildable, bendable, and biological stuctures.  To achieve this, DNA-polymer hybrids are being cut and joined to build on the nanoscale. The project also uses three-dimensional printing and modeling to study and prototype geometries that utilize origami and kirigami designs on the macroscopic scale.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will introduce new motifs, portability, and design to form intricate chemical, biological, and architectural materials all from a common language.  New tools will be developed to visualize folding and optimization of two- and three-dimensional structures.  These tools will generate new hybrid building blocks at the nano- and human-scale, creating new principles of architecture, materials synthesis, and biological structures. New technologies will be developed supporting metamaterials, sensors, stealth aircrafts, and adaptive and sustainable buildings.  Like the opening and closing of flowers, satellites, and even greeting cards, this research will offer a rich and diverse set of intricate surprises, problems, and challenges for students at all levels, and broaden their interest and awareness of emerging science and engineering. It will also create a significant opportunity to excite the general public, thus, complementing and enhancing our impact on science, art, and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the National Science Foundation and the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Oral medication has to be absorbed through the digenstive system.  Because ot the time cycle of the digestive process, this precludes extended delivery over weeks, days, or even hours.  We have worked on "gastroretentive" dosing that can last over a day by adhering or otherwise lingering in the gastroinstestinal (GI) tract.  The platform that we will develop is drug independent and offers a promising new formulation that could potentially enable extended delivery of drugs with limited colonic absorption.  Moreover, drugs are destroyed in the GI tract due to unwanted food-drug interactions and interactions with the intestinal wall. Despite the attempts made in the last few decades to prolong the gastric retention time of medication beyond a few hours, success has been limited. We estabilished a partnership between researchers at Penn and Merck USA (Merck, Sharpe &amp; Dohme) to  to accelerate the translation of our kirigami research into ultra-long lasting oral drug delivery: by encapsulating drugs in slowly unfolding "wrappers" that can temporarily attach themselves to the gastrointestinal tract, we hope to prolong dosing time for oral medications. Kirigami is closely related to origami with the only difference being the addition of cuts and holes in the paper or other "wrapper."  Compactly folded in a gel capsule, the kirigami structures will release, unfold, and deploy into the digestive tract.  The team is evaluating designs that must necessarily not interfere with regular digestion and which, in the case of a dosing error, can be easily flushed from the system.  Thus this work combines geometry and assembly, materials, and biochemistry.          Last Modified: 08/03/2020       Submitted by: Randall D Kamien]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
