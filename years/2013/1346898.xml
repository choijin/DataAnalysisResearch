<AbstractNarration>This award will catalyze a synergistic international collaboration to enable new international cooperative research on in situ molecular polymer composites with researchers from the University of Southern Mississippi and University of Lyon. The research will be jointly conducted in the European Synchrotron Radiation Facilities in Grenoble (near Lyon), providing opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students to enrich their research and education with international collaborative activities. The uniqueness of the research lies in the potential ability to structure the molecular polymer composites in situ using flow and deformation-induced orientation of the dispersed phosphate glass phase which offers a distinctive transformative alternative to conventional composites materials processing and use. The research will benefit from the individual expertise and the facilities available at the U.S. and the French collaborators' institutions, providing students with a critical and unique suite of complementary research capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research has far reaching societal benefits, potentially creating a new class of advanced materials that may find uses in a number of high-end applications including biomedical parts (e.g., rebuilding teeth and bones), optoelectronic components, and automotive parts. The educational broader impact of the international collaborative research is achieved via an exchange of broad-based research knowledge and opportunities for students at the graduate and undergraduate levels to experience collaborative research in highly advanced facilities focused on each area of expertise. The international experience will be extended to students at the individual institutions through presentations led by the participants and it will integrate research and education through enhancement of infrastructure for research &amp; education, and international student exchanges, providing students with the capabilities for future international collaborative success.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit : This one-year catalyzing new international collaboration travel grant award provided support for three months summer visits by the PI and his graduate students to go to France to catalyze a new international cooperative research on in situ molecular polymer composites reinforced with in situ low-Tg phosphate glass fibers with Drs. Ren&eacute; Fulchiron and coworkers at the University of Lyon. The international collaboration integrated research and education through enhancement of infrastructure for research &amp; education, participation of underrepresented groups, and international student exchanges, making significant impact on development of new advanced materials with superior properties. Potential uses of the proposed materials are in a number of high-end application areas including biomedical parts (e.g. rebuilding teeth and bones), optoelectronics components and automotive parts. One archival journal publication and one NSF research proposal resulted from this project.      Broader Impact : The project provided an excellent opportunity for U.S. students to gain professional experience beyond the nationÆs borders early in their career and opened new scientific research direction for the project participants that formed the intellectual and broader impact basis of a recent NSF proposal that was submitted to both NSF.
