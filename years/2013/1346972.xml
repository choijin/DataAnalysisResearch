<AbstractNarration>The National Academy of Sciences is awarded a grant to support a study to assess the importance of and make suggestions for field stations, marine laboratories, and natural reserves (FSMLNRs) to advance science, education, and public outreach in a financially sustainable manner. The National Research Council will convene an independent, expert committee to review current contributions to determine the types of research, training, and public engagement efforts commonly undertaken; examine the infrastructure, logistical, and financial needs to advance science, education, and public outreach endeavors; and develop a range of long-term strategies to enhance financial stability and effectiveness of FSMLNR activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;FSMLNRs serve three broad, functions: research and innovation, education, and public engagement in science. Recent publications describe key investments needed in infrastructure, education, and public outreach to maximize the unique value and function of FSMLNRs. FSMLNRs are poised to benefit also from input on how to adapt to changing scientific capabilities or societal needs, develop collaborations and partnerships, and incorporate financially sustainable strategies to support FSMLNR needs and roles. The proposed activity will help build the research, education, and public outreach infrastructure needed to advance technologies, address national and global challenges, and prepare citizens and future workforce to engage in environmental science, conservation biology, sustainability, and other FSMLNR-related science and engineering topics.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ At the request of the National Science Foundation, the National Academies of Sciences convened an expert committee to review and assess the roles field stations play in supporting research, education, and public outreach. The committee's final report,  Enhancing the Value and Sustainability of Field Stations and Marine Laboratories in the 21st Century, outlines strategies to harness the power and potential of field stations to address complex challenges as follows:  Science for an Unpredictable world  Field stations are national assets formed by the unique merger of natural capital, intellectual capital, social fabric, and infrastructure that leads to the important scientific endeavors required if we are to understand our rapidly changing natural world.   Recommendation: Field station leaders should identify and support the development of scientific and educational assets that harness their stationsÃ† unique qualities to address local, regional, national, and global challenges by bringing together scientists from a number of disciplines, including the social sciences, through what is now called convergence.      Preparing the Next Generation of Scientists  Field stations enable hands-on, discovery-based learning for students of all ages and backgrounds. Early research experiences in the field help students build skills such as asking relevant questions, posing them in tractable form, and gathering data to answer them.   Recommendation: Universities should seek to expand opportunities for student participation in research and active learning programs at field stations, which could boost student interest in science and the environment, and encourage their persistence in STEM fields.  Empowerment Through Public Engagement  Public understanding and participation in science is important in increasing human connectedness to the natural world and empowers citizen decision-making and involvement in public policy.   Recommendation: Field stations should continue to explore a wide-range of approaches to engage the public in science, but select and tailor their activities in a manner that best leverages a field stationÃ†s location, personnel, infrastructure, and other available resources. Empirically-based approaches in science communication and informal education should be used to guide the development and assessment of engagement activities to promote public understanding of science effectively.    Networking for Discovery and Innovation  Most field stations operate independently of one another. Greater networking with other field stations and with research centers would help them leverage resources to facilitate discovery and spark innovation.   Recommendation:   Field stations should seek opportunities for networking that make scientific, educational, and business sense. Universities and funding organizations should provide incentives for networking of field stations that meet those criteria. NSF and other funding agencies could encourage networking of field stations through the request-for-proposal process by giving preference to proposals that link multiple field stations.   Modern Infrastructure for a Networked World  Field stations vary in scope, size, and purpose; each contributes to the global portfolio in distinct ways. There is no single array of infrastructure that applies to all field stations, although there are some similar needs across field stations of differing sizes and complexity.   Recommendation: Because of their wide variety in purpose size, and scope, each field station should assess and define its own infrastructure needs. However, internet connectivity and cyberinfrastructure should be included in all infrastructure-management plans to allow field stations to facilitate collaborative research and participate in broader networking efforts. The process of archiving dark data into digitally accessible formats is critical, and should begin with the most recent datasets and progress back in time so that field station...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
