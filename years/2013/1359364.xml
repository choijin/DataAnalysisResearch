<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the College of William and Mary provides twelve undergraduate students each summer the opportunity to participate in research on topics in  atomic, molecular, and optical physics, condensed matter physics, nuclear and particle physics, theoretical physics, applied physics, and non-destructive evaluation. In addition to participating in research with an experienced mentor, the REU students will engage in weekly activities to ensure not only that their research stays on track but that they have an engaging collegial and scholarly experience. By the end of the program, every student will have shared highlights of the research through a weekly public blog, given two research presentations, one of which is either a talk at the end of the program or a poster presentation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site will have a number of broader impacts with its focus on providing research opportunities to undergraduates to help prepare them for future science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers. The site has a strong plan to recruit undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in physics. The project plans to be informed by an on-going evaluation, which examines clear goals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Physics Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at the College of William &amp; Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia is a part of the Physics department?s commitment of educating the new generation of physicists.  Through this REU program we are committed to provide a meaningful research experiences and training to the undergraduate students from broad range of institutions and social groups. The strength of our program is its ability to offer  a wide variety of topics in theoretical, computational and experimental physics at William &amp; Mary, as well as nearby research facilities: NASA Langley Research Center and Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab).  In the past three years we received over 600 applications from non&shy;William &amp; Mary students.  Our focus in the admission decisions was based on the preparation and motivation of individual student (judged from the academic performance and recommendation letters), on the availability of research experiences at the student's home institution, and on increasing the participation of underrepresented minority in physics (in particular women, black or african american students, hispanic or latino students, LGBT students, first&shy;generation students and students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds).  This resulted in a cohort of 5 women and 9 men in the first year, including 3 students from underrepresented minorities, 5 women and 9 men in the second year, including 3 students from underrepresented minorities, and  6 women and 7 men in the third year, including 1 student from underrepresented minorities These students were joined each year by about 20 William &amp; Mary students who were supported by faculty research grants, individual NSF supplements, and private funds through the department and alumni (but not  this award).  The entire group of students participated as a seamless cohort in all activities of the REU program.  The inclusion of William &amp; Mary students allowed us to diversify group even further, and ensured that non&shy;William &amp; Mary students have peers to turn to with practical questions in their first weeks.  The main objectives for the REU program are to provide all the students with meaningful research experience in the area of their scientific interests, to broaden their understanding of scientific career opportunities, to offer training in wide range of science-relevant skills, and to plug them into the bigger network of scientists. Throughout the summer we developed many activities to accomplish these ambitious goals. For example, any interested student had an opportunity to participate in a 7-week machine shop course where they learned drilling, milling and grinding techniques to produce a miniature copy of operational colonial cannon. In addition to their research project, students attended weekly summer research seminars, where they interacted with scientists from broad range of research areas. In addition, four excursions to local scientific installations were organized each summer: NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton University Proton Therapy Institute, Jefferson Lab, and the Surrey Nuclear Power Station.

Each participant was required to give three types of presentations: a 1&shy;minute "elevator pitch" in the first week, a 10&shy;minute "work in progress" presentation midway through the summer, and a 30&shy;minute final presentation or poster on the last day.  In addition, student were required to write up a 10-&shy;page final report, and see it through a complete peer-review process, in which two other participants provided anonymous feedback.  After the program several participants participated in national conferences, for example the American Physical Society's Division of Nuclear Physics annual meeting and the Council on Undergraduate Research's REU Symposium.  In the evaluation of the program by the participants, they indicated a consistently high satisfaction with the program.  In follow&shy;up questionnaires one year later (for the first year) this satisfaction was confirmed, and they indicated that they gained a better understanding of the research environment and that the experience informed their career choices with respect to graduate school.
