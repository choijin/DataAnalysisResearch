<AbstractNarration>The structure and evolution of the Eastern North America margin are the focus of this GeoPRISMS community seismic experiment. The data obtained will form a fundamental framework to address several aspects of the Program's Rift Initiation and Evolution initiative: how tectonic, magmatic, erosional and depositional processes interact; the role of mantle dynamics in ongoing deformation along this passive margin; the impact of ancient regional structure on long-term evolution that shapes present-day distribution of geologic activity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A year-long ocean bottom seismometer array (OBSIP- 30 instruments) will extend onshore station coverage (EarthScope Transportable Array, ~30 sites relevant) across Cape Hatteras. Additional transects of densely-spaced seismometers will record seismic waves that travel across the coastline, documenting more detailed structure from the continental slope through the coastal plain. Multi-channel seismic reflection data will be openly available upon completion of a training workshop that will conduct basic processing. Similarly, seismic refraction data will be distributed for a second training workshop. Data for investigations using natural seismic events will also be openly available via the IRIS Data Management Center. Station spacing and array aperture target crust and upper mantle imaging.  The experiment design builds on existing data to address current scientific questions, emphasizing both deeper structure, which will illuminate driving forces for ongoing evolution, and modernizing shallow structural constraints, to better document surface response records and their relationship to the history of glacial, sea level, depositional, and magmatic loading.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ How do continents break apart?  Does magmatism and partial melting induce weakening and subsequent rifting?  Or do ancient pre-existing fault zones nucleate rupture?  How do these processes control the subsequent evolution of continental margins?  These questions are central the initiative on Rift Initiation and Evolution, within NSF?s GeoPRISMS program.  The US scientific community selected the Eastern North American Margin as an ideal location for studying the history of continental breakup and continued active processes.  The community also articulated the need for a comprehensive new data-collection effort, and to facilitate the greatest possible impact for those data, we conducted a Community Seismic Experiment that collected, and made immediately available, a full suite of on-shore / off-shore, active- and passive-source seismic data.   Specific datasets include crustal-scale seismic reflection and refraction data collected offshore with the R/V Marcus G. Langseth and ocean-bottom seismographs (OBS); and onshore explosion-source refraction experiment; and a temporary (one-year) passive broadband seismic deployment utilizing three onshore coastal stations and 30 offshore OBS stations.  The broadband deployment merges seamlessly with the stations of EarthScope?s Transportable Array, which was in the region during the experiment.  All components of the field effort were remarkably successful.  They included three cruises on the R/V Endeavor to deploy and/or recover OBS, the MCS/refraction cruise on R/V Langesth, the deployment and recovery of broadband and short period seismic stations onshore, and an onshore refraction program.  All passive-source seismic data is available to the broader community at the IRIS Data Management Center, and the active-source data can be obtained through IRIS and the Marine Geoscience Data System.         The intellectual merit of these activities is that the integrated onshore-offshore data represent a rare and valuable resource that are now openly available to researchers for exploring major questions of earth structure and dynamics.   These include an unprecedented perspective on rifted margin structure and evolution that represents the specific target of the experiment.  The experiment extends from the oceanic lithosphere to well into the continental interior, and a depth range that spans recent sedimentary processes to the base of the mantle lithosphere.  They also include geoscience targets that are not specific to the GeoPRISMS program, many of which can be addressed anew using this relatively rare collection of seafloor data.   The broader impacts of this project are numerous.  First, the community nature of the experiment offered an excellent opportunity to train young scientists in data collection and processing, particularly at sea.  Approximately 80 young scientists participated in the data-collection cruises, and/or data processing workshops that followed them.  The focus site off the eastern US includes several locations of past submarine landslides, providing new opportunities for the sources of potential tsunami hazards in the Atlantic basin.  More generally, seafloor seismic observations of earthquakes and tsunami are in their infancy, and this experiment provides an excellent demonstration of the quality of seafloor observations and their utility for science and hazard reduction.
