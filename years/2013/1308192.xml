<AbstractNarration>Research Objectives and Approaches&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to achieve dynamic optimization of micro grid components, especially power converters, which provide important new opportunities for high bandwidth intelligent control.  With this innovation, cost and reliability can be optimized with minimal use of fossil fuels.  The approach for this research project relies on adding global positioning type capability to the control of renewable energy sources which will transform the way in which they operate and make them amiable to dynamic optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The future electric power grid will contain a greater degree of renewable and alternative energy components (solar panels, wind generators, fuel cells, hybrid vehicles, etc.).  All of these components contain controllers which are highly capable controllers but, ironically, are uncoordinated and merely performing necessary control functions.  This project aims at fully utilizing the control capability as well as adding global positioning circuitry for time-stamping and coordinating power flow.  In this way, the overall power system becomes more intelligent and optimally controlled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project is the more-ready incorporation and control of renewable energy sources and energy storage into the power grid.  Furthermore, dynamic optimization ensures that these energy sources are utilized to their fullest capacity.  This will lead to a significant reduction in the use of fossil based fuels.  The social impact of reducing fossil fuel use tends to attract women and minorities and this factor will be exploited to increase participation from these groups.  The dissemination of the results will be such as to educate future engineers and allow adoption of the methods by other researchers.</AbstractNarration>
