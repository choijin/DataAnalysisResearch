<AbstractNarration>Project Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2011, the National Science Foundation (NSF) created the Innovation Corps (I-Corps) program to train NSF-funded researchers to evaluate their scientific discoveries for commercial potential. This project extends the reach of the I-Corps program by establishing a National Innovation Network (NIN) that is connected and coordinated by the National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance (NCIIA). The NIN is comprised of the I-Corps regional Nodes and I-Corps Sites, which work cooperatively to establish, utilize and sustain an innovation ecosystem that enhances the development of technologies, products and processes that benefit society. The I-Corps Nodes include a diverse set of research agendas, resources, tools, capabilities, and geographic locations. NCIIA is facilitating the sharing of knowledge and collaboration to maximize the impact of the overall I-Corps program and helping to maintain the consistency and quality of I-Corps training at the various Node regions. NCIIA is working in collaboration with the I-Corps Nodes to create and implement tools that support innovation, through monitoring, analyzing and utilizing data gathered from I-Corps Team participants; while propagating effective innovation practices on a national scale. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Significance of the Project &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The NIN leverages NCIIA's mission to support technology innovation and entrepreneurship in higher education and to create experiential learning opportunities for students and successful, socially beneficial innovations and businesses. NCIIA is coordinating a geographically diverse network of I-Corps Nodes and Sites to help enable innovators and entrepreneurs across the nation bring their concepts to commercialization. NCIIA's NIN activities are encouraging and enabling the dissemination of knowledge and expertise among the I-Corps Nodes and Sites so they can more effectively accelerate the commercialization of NSF-funded research, create new business opportunities and create innovations that can lead to new economic opportunity and benefits for U.S. citizens.</AbstractNarration>
