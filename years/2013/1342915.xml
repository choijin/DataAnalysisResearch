<AbstractNarration>The IEEE International Symposium on Workload Characterization (IISWC) is a premier forum for presenting, discussing and debating new and innovative ideas and techniques for the characterization of computing system workloads. This symposium brings together researchers in fields related to processor architecture, compilers, operating systems, and languages. This award will provide travel support for students in order to defray the costs of attending and participating in the IISWC conference in September, 2013 in Portland, Oregon, USA. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. Broader impacts include training the next generation of researchers in this important research area.</AbstractNarration>
