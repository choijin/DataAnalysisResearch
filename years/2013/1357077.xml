<AbstractNarration>Overview: With this award the investigators will explore a habitat-scale oceanographic process that has the potential to integrate studies of larval delivery with an understanding of how larvae respond to substrate-associated cues. This work will build on published and preliminary data indicating that turbulent shear characteristic of high-energy near shore environments primes larvae to initiate settlement and to transform into the juvenile stage. These prior findings suggest that: 1) Because turbulence intensity varies predictably as a function of the strength of wave breaking and other factors, turbulence could operate as an indicator for larvae of their approach to suitable habitat, providing a link between larger-scale dispersal phenomena, and near-bottom search and selection behaviors; and. 2) The larval response to turbulence acts in an unprecedented fashion. In contrast to typical cues, turbulence does not induce settlement directly, but rather spurs otherwise "pre-competent" larvae that are refractory to chemical cues to become "competent", thereby causing them to acquire responsiveness to such cues and undergo settlement. The interdisciplinary team has combined expertise in larval biology, sensory ecology, and organism-flow interactions necessary to address this topic. They will employ a phylogenetically robust approach to explore the scope and adaptive significance of the turbulence response in a widespread and ecologically important class of organisms (echinoids; sea urchins and their relatives), and will determine whether the response is aligned with environmental conditions characteristic of these organisms' adult habitat. They will also test for ecologically important functional consequences of precocious, turbulence-induced settlement. This work will provide a detailed look at an entirely new class of settlement inducer, one with strong potential for changing current conceptualizations of dispersing larval stages, their ability to detect signatures of habitat across multiple scales, and the ways in which organism-level traits might influence population connectivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit : How organisms with dispersing life stages find their way back to adult habitat is a fundamental question in marine ecology. Considerable research has explored links between transport, delivery, settlement, and recruitment, with important advances in knowledge. However, a complete understanding of the larval recruitment process remains elusive. Standard tools for estimating dispersal (e.g., numerical circulation models) have limited spatial resolution, which prevents them from predicting at scales below a few hundred meters how larvae will interact with the shore. Studies investigating larval attachment have focused on chemical, tactile, or near-bottom hydrodynamic cues active across microns to centimeters. The novelty of the present project is that it will focus on processes at habitat scales -- between transport and settlement -- where there is a gap in the understanding of processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project will provide a framework for integrating key concepts of propagule dispersal and settlement, two fundamental but largely disjunct themes in marine science. The understanding that will come from this study will provide key information for ecosystem based management of coastal marine resources. The findings of the study will be communicated via publications and conference presentations.  There will also be a robust education and public outreach effort.  The investigators will develop a "Surfing to Settlement" virtual lab activity based on their research that will be incorporated into the VirtualUrchin web platform, a widely exploited educational resource at Stanford that gets thousands of unique users per month. Through connections to the San Francisco Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve, they will integrate the "Surfing to Settlement" activity into one of NERRs professional development workshops for central California educators, thus disseminating this resource to and gaining valuable feedback from dozens of teachers and thousands of students. The project will also continue an existing partnership with a local community college (Santa Rosa Community College) that provides a means for undergraduates who would otherwise get little exposure to the research enterprise to receive training and mentorship in the scientific process via extended internships. In addition, the investigators will expand development of a high-quality video/photo resource that documents early development, larval morphology and behavior in a phylogenetically broad array of animal phyla, and will disseminate this resource to the public via an existing collaboration with the internationally known Monterey Bay Aquarium.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF AWARD OCE-1357077  TURBULENCE-SPURRED SETTLEMENT: DECIPHERING A NEWLY RECOGNIZED CLASS OF LARVAL RESPONSE  PROJECT OUTCOMES   A dominant majority of shoreline-dwelling animals in the ocean produce microscopic offspring that live for days to months in the plankton, drifting in waters offshore of the coast. These tiny larval stages often look completely different in form compared to the juveniles and adults that they grow into, and which inhabit the rocky shores and beaches with which most people interface. The transition between these two stages is therefore one of the most notable and crucial steps in the life cycles of organisms in the sea.  In the research conducted by means of this grant, our team explored the transition that tiny larvae take in moving from the plankton to the shore, focusing in particular on sea urchins and their kin.  Our efforts were directed at understanding details of a recent discovery that we made just before the grant was awarded.  We found that the attainment of ?competency,? the ability of larvae to respond to chemical cues indicative of suitable habitat on the shore, can be triggered by physical attributes of the environment.  More specifically, we determined that exposure of sea urchin larvae to intense turbulence characteristic of wave-exposed coasts preferred by adults could cause the larvae to precociously enter the competent state.  Previously it had been thought that the timing of competency was determined simply by a hard-wired and therefore largely immutable developmental program. Learning that larvae at this key life transition are notably sensitive to a range of environmental experiences has important implications.  For example, knowledge concerning potential triggers of competency could substantially modify our  understanding of how populations of ecologically and commercially valuable species like sea urchins -- one of several invertebrates fished for human food -- are maintained.  We highlight here several novel findings that originated from this grant.  First, we documented through laboratory experiments that the turbulence response exhibited by a particular type of sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, the purple sea urchin) is not unique to just that species.  Other types of sea urchins, as well as a more distantly related invertebrate, the Pacific sand dollar, show a similar reaction to turbulence, in that the progression to competency is accelerated as a result of just a few minutes of exposure to intense turbulence.  This early shift to competency can shorten the minimum time spent in the water column by 20%.  Interestingly, the response is not universal in sea urchins nor is it limited to only urchins.  Several urchin species that we have tested whose adults dwell in deeper habitats where turbulence is weaker do not show any acceleration in competency in response to turbulence.  On the other hand, turbulence does appear to influence the manifestation of competency in more distantly related species, including a brittle star and marine snail.  Second, we demonstrated that the level of responsiveness of larvae to turbulence, and thus their propensity to become competent following such an environmental stimulus, increases as they get older.  This phenomenon includes a tendency for larvae to become less choosy about habitat.  At the same time, larvae that transition early to shoreline habitat bear a cost in that they are smaller and thus more vulnerable to physical stressors and predators.  A third finding of our research is that the response of larvae to turbulence can be long-lasting.  Larvae that experience intense turbulence, but which then are placed back into quiescent waters, do not regress to their original condition; rather, they remain competent.  This result suggests a physiological change that is not readily reversible.  Fourth, we have indications of population-level genetic variation in the turbulence response.  The project additionally contributed to the advancement of several graduate students who were supported by the grant, led to results covered by the popular media, and funded a freely-accessible web-based educational module on the VirtualUrchin platform (http://virtualurchin.org) that serves hundreds of thousands of secondary school students yearly.  Specifically, we produced a new interactive educational game for VirtualUrchin based upon our research called 'Surfing to Settlement', where the student controls a larval avatar that needs to find food and grow and ultimately locate a safe place to settle near to its kin, while avoiding planktonic predators and excessive offshore drift.  Together these research efforts have advanced our understanding of one of the most important life cycle transitions characterizing marine species, including a number that people rely on for food.
