<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to establish a new design and control method for highly maneuverable underwater robots to perform inspection of underwater structures. Compact, egg-shaped robots will allow us to bring inspection instruments to those complex underwater structures that have seldom been inspected. Those include reactor internals of nuclear power plants and the equipment of hydro-dams, both of which require access to dangerous sites for inspection and monitoring. Furthermore, the highly maneuverable robot can be applied to port security, offshore facility monitoring, and cable network maintenance. Collaborations with energy industries and others will be sought for disseminating the new design method.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will study egg-shaped robots, having no rudders and appendages. The compact and smooth body shape allows the robot to access complex underwater structures with multi-axis jets. The spheroidal vehicle, however, is hydro-dynamically unstable and thereby not appropriate from the traditional submarine design viewpoint. This project will argue that the vehicle instability can be exploited for quick turning and agile movements, a design concept similar to Control-Configured Vehicles in aeronautics, and how such vehicles can be designed optimally from the dynamics and control viewpoint. The project aims to stabilize the vehicle, yet maximize the maneuvering capability, through the design of high-speed water valves, effective configuration of multi-axis jets, optimization of the vehicle body shape, and control synthesis.</AbstractNarration>

Harry Asada, PI<br />Massachusetts Institute of Technology<br /><br />Outcome<br />This project has made three major accomplishments. One is to open up a new field of technology for underwater inspection of complex structures using a highly maneuverable compact vehicle. The existing technology of underwater vehicles focuses on efficient traveling over a long distance, while inspection, exploration, and repair in a confined, cluttered space are increasingly important in recent years. We have established novel technology for maneuvering through complex underwater structures. A unique egg-shaped robot, which is hydro-dynamically unstable, is very quick to turn and, thereby, suitable for inspection of complex underwater structures. Second, we have developed a multi-axis jet propulsion system with special high speed valves and control algorithms. This technology allows the robot to maneuver swiftly through complex underwater environment. The jet propulsion system is also effective for pushing the robot back and forth as well as precisely moving at a slow speed. Third, we have discovered that the vehicle can keep a constant gap between its inspection sensor head and the surface of the underwater structure by exploiting so-called ground effects. A jet impinging on the structure surface creates a type of cushion that can stably hold the vehicle at a constant distance from the surface. This is especially useful for examining the integrity of underwater structures.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These results have been published in leading journals and presented at premier conferences of the field. A series of patents have been filed, and some of them have been licensed to multiple companies through MIT&rsquo;s Technology Licensing Office. Two doctoral students were supported by this project. One is now a faculty member at a leading engineering school, and the other has established a start-up company based on this project.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/03/2017<br>      Modified by: H.
