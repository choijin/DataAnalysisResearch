<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to Hampton University to continue a program that aims to increase the number of students, particularly under-represented minority students, electing careers in aquatic sciences.  The program recruits minority students and REU students, faculty and professionals interested in aquatic sciences, as well as faculty working at Historically Minority Colleges and Universities (HMCU).  Participants received a free membership in the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) and support to attend the annual meetings and special pre-meeting workshops that focus on current oceanographic or limnology research and on career advancement in the sciences.  The present proposal will cultivate the development of past participants and incorporate new cohorts of students.</AbstractNarration>
