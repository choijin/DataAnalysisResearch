<AbstractNarration>The proposed research project develops an understanding of collective mobilization and civic policy by examining community responses to extreme weather events. This project assesses how these extreme weather events may impact public awareness, community action, and civic response to issues of climate change. By undertaking a systematic comparative case analysis of communities in the United States which recently experienced extreme weather events, we will seek to understand under what conditions and via what mechanisms communities undertake significant climate-related actions following an extreme weather event. Through this study, we mean to bring the insights of two distinct literatures to bear on the question of variable community response: the general literature on social movements and the more specialized scholarship on climate change awareness and action from the fields of environmental sociology and psychology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will employ fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis and a variety of data collection techniques, including data from newspapers, site visits and interviews, and community to surveys. The PIs will employ both graduate and undergraduate students in its implementation. Its interdisciplinary nature, which combines both sociological and technical expertise, will provide a unique opportunity for teaching, training and learning for these students. The research also has important implications beyond the academy. Scholars, civic leaders, and the public are paying increasing attention to the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. A host of real world actors are eager to understand the dynamic processes that mediate between awareness and action. By learning more about the factors and processes that convert awareness into action, stakeholders would be in a much better position to serve as agents helping to address critical challenges. Progress on this front can turn the teachable moments that arise with extreme weather events into lessons that can be applied in practical contexts.</AbstractNarration>

ACADEMIC IMPACT OR INFLUENCE OF THE PROJECT  We will contribute to the theoretical frameworks in environmental sociology and the study of social movements that seek to increase our understanding of the links between awareness and action (Gamson 1992, Stern et al. 1999, Stern 2000). From a policy perspective, we believe that the practical implications of our findings will help both policymakers and nongovernmental organizations to better frame and implement adaptation and mitigation strategies in the aftermath of an extreme weather event.  What is the impact on other disciplines?  Our work fills an important gap in the literature on climate change engagement by illuminating contextual factors and mechanisms that either facilitate, or impede, climate-related action in the wake of an extreme weather event (Spence et al. 2011, Zahran et al. 2006, Zahran et al. 2008).  What is the impact on the development of human resources?  The project has employed both graduate and undergraduate students in its implementation. Its interdisciplinary nature, which combines both sociological and technical expertise with a relatively new methodology, provides a unique opportunity for teaching, training and learning for these students.  One of the undergraduates who worked extensively on the project will be attending Pennsylvania State University's Rural Sociology PhD program this fall. Two of the graduating Master's students are now employed, using skills they learned on the project, at the Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board and OSU. Another graduate student has been fully engaged in converting her master's essay into a publication, which we recently submitted for review.
