<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop and implement interactive Web-based games, apps, and corresponding investigative laboratory modules. These labs are created to effectively teach statistical thinking and the process of scientific inquiry to undergraduate students. These materials will consist of one- or two-day activities designed for high school and introductory college courses as well as more complex projects geared toward more advanced courses. The intellectual merit of this proposal is to contribute to the scholarship of statistics education by being among the first to fully utilize technology to develop interactive, inquiry-based, and interdisciplinary materials designed for students with strong quantitative skills and interests. This project will develop a new model of educational material that deepens the statistical knowledge of students by providing realistic research problems that encourage students to follow a complete process of statistical analysis at multiple stages of their academic career. By training students how to properly collect data, determine an appropriate technique for analysis, use technology, perform the analysis, make inferences, interpret and present the results. This project will encourage students early in their studies to experience the role of a research scientist and to understand how the field of statistics helps advance scientific knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this proposal will be the creation of new educational models that could dramatically impact the direction of statistics education. These game-based labs can allow for individualized research questions and just-in-time feedback that students recognize as directly related to the goals within their game. Unlike standard class activities where all students are working to get the same answer, through technology these interactive games easily allow students to choose what factors to evaluate and have input in the research design. Thus students conduct research in which the outcome is not known (even to the course instructor). These labs will include detailed instructor resources and will easily fit into existing high school and undergraduate statistics and science courses. By making students grapple with intriguing real-world problems that demonstrate the intellectual content and broad applicability of statistics as a disciple, these materials encourage students to consider a career in statistics or to incorporate statistical thinking into any career.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Playing with Statistics project involves building a set of games to be used to teach statistics. The project goal is to make statistical methods transparent to allow the student a better understanding and appreciation of the power of statistics.  Games produced in the project allow educators to change scenarios that will present the student with a laboratory environment for statistics which is measurable and easily modified.  The developers of this project feel the need for education reform so that statistical thinking becomes a central focus among statistics educators. It is also a focus for Common Core in high school level classes. We must find new ways to present students with situations which will create and improve the statistical thinking they need to prosper in the continually more complex data rich environment where they live.  These changes in statistics as a discipline have influenced successful reforms of the traditional introductory statistics course. While definitions of statistical thinking vary in the literature, they essentially agree on the following concepts:  A)    Statistics must be viewed as a whole  B)    Skepticism of data  C)    Variation is everywhere contexts.  D)    Assessment of genuine data      Games have been used in a variety of disciplines and statistics educators have begun to use interactive Web-based applications to teach statistical concepts. The idea of incorporating Web-based games into the classroom is new to statistics education. We developed game-based labs that follow accepted guidelines and bridge the gap between short, focused homework problems and the open-ended nature of a research project. These game-based labs are appropriate for use in high school and collegiate level introductory statistics courses.  During this project, we created two games ready for use.  We produced game-based labs and details of our proposed new game labs that would be developed in a Phase II environment.  The two game systems involve working with the statistics of a serious disease spreading through an urban environment (Epidemic) and a field study involving game wardens trying to take a census of Siberian Tigers (TigerSampling).  Epidemic allows the student to act as the epidemiologist in a city school district. An illness is spreading through the schools and the player must choose between two treatments to slow the epidemic. One drug is more expensive than the other, and drug efficacy is not known to the players.  The goal is to contain the disease, but cost considerations impact player decisions.  Understanding and interpreting the treatment data is key to effectively addressing the epidemic.  TigerSampling presents the student with the problem of collecting data from tigers to build models and determine the age distribution of tigers in order to sustain the population of an endangered species. Students learn about the difficulty of collecting representative samples, and variability in samples, as they move around regions of a preserve to tranquilize tigers and collect data from them.  The work performed in this project consisted primarily of creating these on-line games.  While these games have an appearance of generally available games, they are unique in their ability to be modified to fit individual research questions. These games allow students to conduct simulation studies in order to better understand the logic behind situations where data is used in decision making. In addition to the games, we are developing accompanying instructional materials. These materials create new pedagogical models that are potentially transformative to the area of statistics education.  We used accepted educational strategies to create materials that fully engage "Digital Natives" (students who have grown up immersed in technology) in statistical thinking and scientific inquiry.  We are currently evaluating the new game-based labs, Epidemic and TigerSampling. The games are being used in classrooms at various uni...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
