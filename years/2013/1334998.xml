<AbstractNarration>This research is about design of microstructures in superalloy structures that exhibit superior mechanical properties through grain boundary engineering. The approach of this research will be to develop and link process models, capable of producing microstructures with distinct grain boundary characteristics, with behavior models, capable of determining the fatigue life based on the microstructure. Through physics-based approaches, a process map will relate the hot deformation parameters for Nickel-based superalloys to the formation of distinct grain boundaries and microstructures. Microstructures that produce superior properties will be identified through inverse fatigue modeling and fabricated in bulk components. The validation of desired mechanical properties and mechanisms for achieving strengthening at distinct boundaries will be identified through novel in situ loading experiments coupled with strain field measurements and orientation mapping. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the benefits of this research will include the design of microstructures in bulk engineering materials that exhibit superior and tailorable mechanical properties, thus producing an increase in safety, performance, and energy efficiency of components for gas turbine engine applications. More generally, the fundamental science will enable: (a) an identification of the types of microstructures that produce advances in fatigue life, (b) an understanding of the strengthening mechanisms of these distinct grain boundaries, and (c) process maps to achieve such structures. Each of the aforementioned items will enable designs of microstructures in a wide class of materials and components that exhibit superior mechanical behavior. The broader impact of this research is four-fold: (i.) a materials camp for high school science teachers, (ii.) inclusion of women and underrepresented groups, (iii.) open and wide-spread dissemination through HUB technology, and (iv.) industrial interaction including technology transfer.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Superalloys are critical structural materials that have served to enable the design and development of ultra-efficient gas turbines for aerospace propulsion and power generation.  Although many of the characteristics of superalloys can be attributed to the underlying alloy chemistry, optimization of the underlying microstructure through novel manufacturing processes can serve to further extend the capabilities of these materials.  Especially as advanced gas turbine engines now operate at temperatures approaching the limits of existing superalloy capabilities, the ability to improve the properties of these materials and impart a higher degree of damage tolerance becomes increasingly important.  This award has supported a collaborative research program between Illinois Institute of Technology, Purdue University and Rolls-Royce Corporation to understand how to design, optimize and engineer superalloy microstructures that exhibit enhanced durability.  Intellectual Merit: An integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) framework was adopted to enhance the fatigue performance of a Ni-based superalloy, RR1000.  The microstructure explicit fatigue model developed at Purdue University was used to identify key microstructural features that contribute to fatigue crack nucleation and provide guidance for an optimized microstructure.  To realize these optimized microstructures, activities at Illinois Institute of Technology focused on the development of a predictive physics-based process model that relates how the resulting grain boundary character distributions are affected by the thermo-mechanical processing parameters.  The process model was then applied to identify processing parameters that would minimize the formation of undesirable microstructural features, thereby prolonging the fatigue life of the material. The framework was validated using small-scale forgings of RR1000 that were produced and heat-treated to attain a range of conventional and optimized microstructures. The various microstructures were then subject to in situ deformation studies using high-resolution digital image correlation to generate strain maps relative to the microstructural features.  As predicted, the high density of twin boundaries were confirmed to inhibit the length of slip bands, which is directly attributed to extended fatigue life.  Thus, this collaborative study demonstrated the successful role of models, both process and performance, in the design and manufacture of Ni-based superalloy disc forgings. From the activities at IIT, a total of 6 peer reviewed manuscripts (5 journal articles and 1 conference proceeding) have been published.  Broader Impact: The broader impact of this research is that advances in manufacturing of high temperature alloys has the potential to revolutionize the design of gas turbine systems and lead to significant improvements in performance and energy efficiency.?Combined with economic and environmental benefits, such as the reduced fuel consumption, minimization of CO2 and NOX emissions, there exists a strategic need for the U.S. to maintain a technological advantage in this field due to the importance of advanced gas turbine technologies for power generation, space exploration, aerospace/marine propulsion, and various other defense related applications.  The research program has served to train and educate graduate students at Purdue and Illinois Institute of Technology.  Additionally, the funding has enabled the PI at IIT to continue to work with inner-city Chicago-area high school teachers and students to promote educational outreach activities that enhance the middle/high school curricula and raise the students? awareness and knowledge of STEM.
