<AbstractNarration>The goal of this collaborative project is to explore the relationship between gas metallicity and star formation rate.  It will use the VISTA Magellanic Clouds (VMC) near IR survey photometry to extend a catalog of young stellar objects (YSOs) to solar masses. The program will measure the amount of molecular gas present as a test of recent star formation theories and will ascertain the effects on the structure and formation of dense pre-stellar cores.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoc in the use of ALMA, and release of GPIPS survey results and software to the astronomical community. The Baltimore-based postdoc and graduate students of Dr. Meixner will participate in Project ASTRO, which reaches out to the Baltimore City School system, while Co-I Dr. Indebetouw and his students will create new multi-wavelength components for K-12 teacher workshops.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Stars form from the densest regions of gas in a galaxy. Fundamental questions in astronomy include: how dense does the gas have to be to collapse and form stars?  Are the physical conditions in dense regions of galaxies all the same or do they differ from galaxy to galaxy, and region to region?  This project studied several aspects of those questions, and in particular, whether the physics of star formation is different in a galaxy that has a lower concentration of heavy elements than our Milky Way.  Galaxies in the early universe, for example, had such lower concentrations, because there had not been as much time since the Big Bang for stars to create the heavy elements.  The Atacama Large Millimeter Array is an incredibly powerful new telescope that has given us the ability to study for the first time the detailed structure of dense gas in galaxies outside of the Milky Way.  In particular, gas clumps smaller than a few light years in size, which will form one or a few stars if they collapse, were nearly impossible to study before ALMA.  The Magellanic Clouds are two small neighbor galaxies to the Milky Way, both of which fortuitously have reduced concentrations of heavy elements similar to galaxies in the early We have studied more than a dozen regions in the Magellanic Clouds with ALMA, and determined the sizes, masses, shapes, and internal motions of small clumps of dense gas in those regions.  We find that the basic process by which gravity pulls a cloud of gas together, causing it collapse and form stars, is not dramatically different in an environment that has a low concentration of heavy elements.  This was not a foregone conclusion, because for example, those heavy elements can dominate the rate at which a cloud can cool down, and by lowering its temperature and pressure, allow it to collapse.  We found that different regions have different properties, apparently mostly due to large-scale influences in their galaxy, for example one of the Magellanic Clouds is colliding with the far outer reaches of our own Milky Way, and that disturbance has changed the amount of dense gas on that side of the galaxy.  We also found that the observations that astronomers can make are affected by the concentration of heavy metals - in particular, one of the most commonly used tools is measurement of emission from carbon monoxide (CO), and if there is less carbon and oxygen, there is less CO, and it is more difficult to observe with a telescope.  Figure 1 shows a region N11B, with warm dust in red imaged by the Spitzer Space Telescope, hot gas in green traced by emission from ionized hydrogen, and emission from CO in dense gas in white contours, observed with ALMA.  The concentration of young stars about the same mass as our sun, extracted from Hubble Space Telescope images, is shown in blue, and individual young stars much more massive than our Sun are marked with red circles. In this region, dense clumps of gas observed with ALMA contain massive stars in the process of forming, but there is a large concentration of solar-mass stars to the south of existing dense clumps, indicating that there was once gas there as well, which has all collapsed to make those stars.
