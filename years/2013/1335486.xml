<AbstractNarration>Thomas Miller and Zhen-Gang Wang of the California Institute of Technology, Nitash Balsara of the University of California - Berkeley, and Geoffrey Coates of Cornell University are supported by an award from the Chemistry Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) program in the Chemistry division for a collaborative research effort aimed at advancing the development and discovery of high-performance, non-flammable, solid polymer electrolytes for rechargeable lithium batteries.  The project integrates expertise in theory and simulation of materials, materials synthesis, and the characterization of polymer electrolyte materials.   The project involves a tightly coupled research approach in which state-of-the-art theoretical and coarse-graining methods drive the screening and design of new polymer electrolytes, as well as the detailed understanding of ion diffusion mechanisms; promising polymer electrolyte candidates are synthesized in the laboratory, and their ion transport characteristics are measured and tested in full cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research effort is providing fundamental and essential knowledge to enable the development of battery technologies that are critical for transportation and other large-scale energy storage applications.  The development and deployment of safe, low-cost, high-performance batteries is of great societal need for affordable and reliable energy storage.  A key strength of the research effort is the tight integration and synergy between simulation, theory, synthesis, characterization, and cell assembly.  Guidance from experimentally verified theoretical constructs allows the focused design of new polymer electrolytes. Synthesis of these materials, preselected using theory, allows for more rapid production of materials with superior properties. Measurement of material properties is then used to validate and further guide theory and modeling.  Pursuit of this integrated research effort will lead to a significant progress towards the goal of rational materials design for polymer systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The development of solid polymer electrolytes for lithium battery applications is a challenge of profound technological significance.  We have established a collaboration with the aim of understanding and designing improved polymer electrolytes that combines theoretical modeling, polymer synthesis, and experimental characterization.  By studying diverse polymer chemistries, we have discovered that ion-solvation-site connectivity is an important feature of polymer electrolytes that is necessary for high lithium-ion conductance. We are employing this insight to search for improved polymer electrolytes, with promising early-stage results.     Our DMREF project led to a collaborative research program (Figure 1) that tightly couples experimental synthetic and characterization efforts to computational and theoretical studies of the candidate polymer electrolyte materials, thus yielding three key advantages: (1) the theoretical research component provides detailed, mechanistic insights into the molecular processes that govern the polymer electrolyte material properties, thus allowing for the rational (and more efficient) exploration of parameter space of the polymer electrolyte materials; (2) the theoretical research components allow for the explicit screening of candidate polymer electrolyte materials, further reducing the number of polymer electrolyte materials that need to be experimentally synthesized and characterized and further reducing the time and cost of finding new polymer materials with desirable properties; (3) the experimental research components provide explicit tests of the theoretical predictions and methodologies, thus leading to better simulation approaches, improved understanding of lithium diffusion of polymer electrolytes, and physical realizations of polymer materials with improved and well-characterized conduction properties.
