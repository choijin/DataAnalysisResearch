<AbstractNarration>This Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) grant provides funding for a synergistic program of combinatorial experiments, molecular simulations, and theoretical modeling aimed at making advances in the design of pervaporation membrane materials.   Pervaporation is an energy-friendly process for separation of liquid mixtures that works by preferentially transporting one of the liquid components across a selective membrane into the vapor phase on the other side.   Molecular insights regarding structure-function relationships in membrane materials will be obtained by studying water-alcohol separation as the model application.  The work will focus on crosslinked polyacrylate copolymer membranes that offer a high degree of tunability in chemical composition compared to traditional silicone-based membranes.   High-throughput experimental screening methods consisting of matrix-based sample preparation and testing of membrane properties will be combined with molecular simulations of water and alcohol diffusion rates to quantify membrane performance.   Through data-driven validation, a novel theoretical framework for membrane performance will be developed, providing predictive capabilities for rapid design of pervaporation membranes for separation applications.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Pervaporation provides a cost effective alternative to the traditional energy-intensive, multi-stage distillation processes that are used for the purification of biofuels and fuel additives. This research could significantly reduce the production costs of fuels derived from renewable resources.  The rapid prototyping methods to be developed will also be applicable to the design of materials for other important pervaporation applications such as desalination of water, dehydration of fuels, and removal of organics from wastewater streams.  In addition to these societal benefits, the project will also have broad educational benefits through K-12 outreach activities, training of undergraduate and graduate researchers from diverse backgrounds, as well as database development for public dissemination of research findings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit       A key challenge in the production of renewable, liquid biofuels (ethanol, n-butanol) is energy-efficient separation of the fuel from the large amounts of water and other components present in industrial fermentation processes.  Pervaporation is an energy-friendly, membrane-based separation process that could potentially lower the energy cost of purifying biofuels, thereby facilitating economical production thereof.  Improved membrane materials that offer both high selectivity for the alcohol and a high rate of transport (flux) of the alcohol are needed in order to realize a significant reduction in biofuel production costs, however.  Fabrication and testing of membranes is a complex and labor-intensive process, limiting the number of materials that have been designed and tested.  The goal of this project was therefore to develop a synergistic suite of experiments, predictive theoretical models, and molecular simulations to accelerate design of polymeric pervaporation membranes with improved performance characteristics.       This project produced an iterative materials design paradigm to expedite discovery of improved membranes for alcohol-water separations without requiring testing on a membrane-by membrane basis.  The design paradigm begins with high-throughput, combinatorial screening experiments, whereby a large matrix of polymeric materials candidates is rapidly synthesized and subjected to high-throughput property screening.  Alcohol selectivity in each membrane is obtained from swelling experiments, whereas diffusion coefficients of water and alcohol in the membrane are measured by gravimetric sorption experiments.  The library of data generated via screening experiments serves as a critical input to a newly developed multi-component thermodynamic model that predicts the concentrations of water and alcohol inside the membrane at equilibrium.  The thermodynamic theory is a key component of a sorption-diffusion desorption (SDD) model that predicts the key performance metrics of the membranes.  SDD model predictions allow the sample matrix to be reduced in size by identifying the most promising materials candidates.  A small number of membranes are fabricated and tested from the most promising materials in order to obtain direct measurements of selectivity and alcohol flux.  Molecular simulations are applied in order to elucidate the molecular basis for the observed performance characteristics.  Using the data and insights gained from experiments, theoretical predictions, and simulations, the test matrix is reformulated, and the next iteration of screening is conducted.        Key experimental outcomes of the project include new screening metrologies for rapid preparation and characterization of a large number of membrane materials candidates.  Rather than requiring fabrication of numerous membranes, the methodology relies on high-throughput preparation of bulk polymer samples, which are used to rapidly identify the most promising materials.  In the area of thermodynamic theory, a critical development was our extension of classical Flory-Rehner theory to describe multi-component swelling equilibria.  The multi-component thermodynamic model we developed can describe swelling equilibrium for crosslinked polymers containing one or more repeat units in a mixture of two or more solvents, providing a framework to describe the membrane-liquid equilibrium boundary conditions.  This work addressed a critical need by providing a thermodynamic model that only requires simple, rapid measurements as inputs.  In the area of novel material development, our work highlighted the potential of polyacrylates to serve as membrane materials for alcohol-water separations.  Previous studies focused on polysiloxanes and a handful of other polymers, but our work revealed for the first time that polyacrylates have the potential to provide membranes with exceptionally high alcohol flux.  Molecular simulations yielded insights regarding molecular structure and the hydrogen bonding interactions in swollen polyacrylate networks.  Simulations suggest that strong hydrogen bonding interactions between water and polyacrylates lead to dynamic coupling between water and polymer segments, whereas such coupling is not exhibited by alcohol. These observations suggest that tuning polymer segment mobility by changing its chemical structure (e.g. addition of side chains) can provide a mechanism for altering selectivity of the polymer membranes for separating alcohol-water mixtures.  Thus critical insights gained from molecular simulations facilitate design of improved membranes by highlighting the key molecular characteristics underlying desirable performance characteristics.  Broader Impacts      Our work has been disseminated through numerous presentations at professional meetings, a newly developed database, and three peer-reviewed publications, with a fourth submitted and several more in preparation.  Training and professional development was provided to eight graduate students and thirteen undergraduate researchers, who gained experience with experiments, theoretical modeling, molecular simulations, laboratory safety, and research ethics by participation in the project.  The results of this project are impacting efforts to develop novel separation processes for energy-efficient production of biofuels, while providing valuable training opportunities for students who will enter a workforce that is increasingly focused on meeting future energy needs.
