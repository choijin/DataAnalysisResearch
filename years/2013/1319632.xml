<AbstractNarration>This project will tackle quantifier elimination by using group analysis. Quantifier elimination is a problem of taking a complex formula (with quantifiers) and producing an equivalent but simpler formula (without quantifiers). Numerous non-trivial and important problems in science and engineering can be reduced to quantifier elimination problems. Hence any progress in quantifier elimination can have significant and broad impact on science and engineering. Group analysis is an approach of applying group theory to simplify or elucidate a difficult problem, as manifested in algebraic and differential Galois theories, theories of Lie groups and Lie algebras, among many others. In particular, the group analysis significantly extended the practical solvability of various differential equations arising in science and engineering.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to make further progress in quantifier elimination by using group analysis.  The main idea is to simplify a quantified formula via group analysis before carrying quantifier elimination. Preliminary investigation shows that group analysis could provide dramatic speed-up, when there is a hidden group structure in the problem (which is often the case due to various intrinsic symmetries in the nature).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific goal of the project is to develop theory, algorithms, and software packages that will be used by scientists and engineers for solving ever more non-trivial problems. The educational goal of the project is to train future researchers (PhD students) and to inspire undergraduate students via REU programs and independent studies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Numerous non-trivial and important problems in mathematics, science and engineering can be reduced to the quantifier elimination problem. Over last 40 years, there have been significant progress. However, there are still many large size problems which are way beyond the current computational capabilities.  The project proposed to tackle the challenge of improving quantifier elimination by using group analysis.  The major task was discovering group structures hidden in given quantified formulas.  After intensive analysis, it was found that, in many cases, this can be done by computing algebraic moving frames for univariate polynomial vectors.  Thus, the PIs concentrated on the solution of this and related problems.   The project outcomes include the development of new theory and algorithms for computing various important geometric and algebraic objects, such as optimal-degree algebraic moving frames for rational curves; group-equivariant algebraic moving frames; special bases (called &mu;-bases) for syzygy modules; minimal-degree Bezout vectors. The PIs discovered some hidden structures in quantifier elimination formulas arising in various applications and exploited these structures to speed up computations.  These results have potential applications in various areas of mathematics, computer science and engineering, such as computational algebra and algebraic geometry, computer aided geometric design, computer vision, cryptography, weather and climate study. The theoretical results were disseminated through refereed publications in scientific journals, preprint servers, and by presentations on major scientific conferences, as well as on research seminars and colloquiums. The implementation of the algorithms is posted on PIs websites.  The project created an opportunity to hire and train three graduate students and one undergraduate students.
