<AbstractNarration>Vicol&lt;br/&gt;DMS-1211828&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The investigator analyzes several nonlinear nonlocal partial differential equations that arise in mathematical fluid mechanics.  The goal is to develop new mathematical tools towards progress on various open problems, such as the global regularity versus finite time blow-up of classical solutions, the behaviour of solutions in singular limit regimes, and other qualitative properties.  The first part of the project is devoted to studying the regularity of active scalar equations.  The work is mostly geared towards the analysis of the inviscid and the supercritically-dissipative surface quasi-geostrophic equation, porous media equation, and the magneto-geostrophic equation.  For all these models the a priori controlled quantities are too weak to guarantee the global existence of smooth solutions.  The investigator and collaborators seek to identify analytic and geometric mechanisms that preclude the possible formation of singularities.  The regularity of supercritical drift-diffusion equations is also considered.  The second part of the project addresses the inviscid limit of the Navier-Stokes equations on a bounded domain.  The goal is to establish new well-posedness results for the Prandtl boundary layer equations under weak matching conditions at the top of the boundary layer, and analyze the inviscid limit of the Navier-Stokes equations in these regimes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     The equations describing incompressible Newtonian fluids, such as the Euler and the Navier-Stokes equations, account for interactions between a very broad range of space and time scales, in a highly nonlinear fashion.  Due to this intrinsic complexity, the accuracy needed to fully resolve the underlying phenomena via numerical computations is out of reach for the foreseeable future.  This project seeks to further advance the rigorous analysis of these equations, which is vital to a finer understanding and validation of the models, and to an accurate interpretation of numerical simulations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    While the equations describing the motion of incompressible fluids have been around for more than two centuries, the underlying mathematics is still not very well understood.      In view of the broad range of space and time scales observed in a fully developed turbulent flow the accuracy needed to fully resolve the solutions via numerical computations is out of reach for the foreseeable future. Mathematical insights are thus imperative, as they give a direction to focus the computational power.      When attempting to give rigorous answers to some of the fundamental questions we are faced with new frontiers in mathematical analysis, and new ideas are needed to understand the underlying phenomena, even if we consider very specific asymptotic regimes.        The result of the PIÃ†s effort is the development of a series of new robust analytic tools, such as the nonlinear maximum principle for linear nonlocal operators, aimed at analyzing nonlocal interactions and the effects of nonlocal dissipation in nonlinear PDEs. In turn, these tools have been used to address some of the outstanding open problems in fluid mechanics, such as questions related to global existence, the development of singularities, stability, observability, the long-time behavior, and the behavior in singular limit regimes of solutions to the Navier-Stokes, Euler, and related equations.    The PI has disseminated the results obtained through papers, the participation and organization of workshops, conferences, and seminars. Among these, the PI has served as a co-organizer of the Princeton University "Analysis of Fluids and Related Topics" seminar, and the lead organizer of the MSRI summer school on Incompressible Fluid Flow at High Reynolds Number.
