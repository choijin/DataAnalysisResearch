<AbstractNarration>We plan to study universal linear pro-p groups, that is pro-p groups generated by generic matrices.  The aim is to use recent advances in the theory of PI-algebras to show that certain relative verbal widths are finite. This will imply that free pro-p groups, and hence Golod-Shafarevich groups, are not linear.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expected results will affect several branches of Algebra and shed light on infinite algebraic objects that feature quite prominently in Algebraic Number Theory.  The PI intends to involve three graduate students that he currently advises in the work on the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ I worked on basic algebraic problems that lie at the intersection of several mathematical disciplines : group theory, Lie Theory, associative algebras.  Many of them have grown out of The Burnside Problem : What makes a group finite ?, which has been one of the pivotal problems in Algebra for more than a century. In 1991 I solved the Restricted Burnside Problem. One of the outcomes of the project was a far going generalization of this work, that has already been used in other researcher's papers.  Another finding was a proper construction of wreath product of algebras. This construction was crucial in solution of some long standing embedding problems into finitely generated algebras. The recent developments indicate that it will also play central role determination of possible growth types of infite dimensional algebras and infinite monoids.  The results are likely to find applications in Abstract Algebra, Number Theoiry and Theoretical Computer Science (complexity problems). Some of the results have already been included in graduate courses taught at the Unievrsity of California - San Diego.  Lectures based on this work were delivered at numerous conferences with substantial participations of graduate students. Moreover, I gave special courses for students from mathematically developing countries (Senegal and Uzbekistan).       Last Modified: 08/30/2018       Submitted by: Efim Zelmanov]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
