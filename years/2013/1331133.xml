<AbstractNarration>This project is funded as part of the United States-Israel Collaboration in Computer Science (USICCS) program.  Through this program, NSF and the United States - Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF) jointly support collaborations among US-based researchers and Israel-based researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative reserach project between Duke University and Tel Aviv University aims to study several topics in geometric optimization and related problems that arise in the processing of geometric data in a variety of application areas, such as sensor networks, imaging, surveillance, navigation, geographic information systems, modeling and animation, meshing, computer graphics and vision, bioinformatics, robotics and manufacturing.  Processing geometric data in these applications is challenging, because this data is typically huge, measured with uncertainty, obtained in a distributed manner (e.g., in sensor networks), or in an online manner (e.g., in streaming applications), and may involve moving points (e.g., in imaging, animation and modeling).  All these traits make the processing a rather demanding task, and call for the design of novel algorithmic techniques for handling it efficiently.  For many of these problems, exact algorithms, even polynomial in the input size, are impractical, and approximation algorithms are needed. Even then, making these algorithms depend efficiently on the error parameter is often a difficult and challenging task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses the above challenges by developing general algorithmic techniques such as computing geometric summaries (including coresets and random samples), handling noisy geometric data under various probabilistic models of uncertainty, handling online data, and handling kinetic data (involving moving objects). Some of the specific problems that are targeted include shape matching, clustering, and geometric searching. Each of these topics raises interesting algorithmic questions, both theoretical and practical, and the project will address as many of them as possible.</AbstractNarration>

In addition, combinatorial complexity of various geometric structures such as union of shapes and Voronoi diagrams were analyzed.  Multiple graduate students were partially supported by this project, and many more students and postdoctoral fellows were engaged in this project. The PI co-organized a workshop on ?Polynomial Method in Discrete and Computational Geometry? in 2019.  The main technical contributions include the following:  Geometric structures:  The  efficiency  of many geometric algorithms and data structures depends on the combinatorial complexity of certain underlying geometric and topological structures. As such, complexity of some basic structures, e.g.,  union of a set of simple objects and Voronoi diagrams under different metrics, were analyzed. A main theme of this project was to go beyond the worst-case analysis and analyze the complexity when the underlying geometric structures were drawn from some stochastic process.  Shape analysis: This project led to new efficient algorithms for matching many kinds of geometric objects using some of the well-known similarity measures such as dynamic time warping for matching a pair of trajectories, transportation map for matching two sets of points, and Gromov-Hausdorff distance for matching a pair of metric spaces. The goal was to develop fast approximation algorithms and to simplify and improve the algorithms further if input is well behaved.  Clustering: The project showed how noisy GPS trajectory data can still be used in large collections to construct pathlet dictionaries for trajectory compression and planning, how to exploit the wisdom of the collection to map individual GPS trajectories to an underlying map, and ultimately to how to reconstruct such a map directly from the trajectories. In another line of work, fast algorithms were developed for computing optimal clustering in low-dimensional space assuming input points are stable under perturbation, in the sense that the optimal clustering does not change under small perturbations of points.  Query processing: Range-aggregation and nearest-neighbor queries are two of the most basic geometric queries and many efficient algorithms are known. This project developed fast data structures for both range and nearest-neighbor searching when the input data is noisy and there is uncertainty in the locations of input points. Algorithms were also developed for computing an approximate nearest neighbor of a query point among a set of lines, or more broadly a set of k-flats, in d-dimensional space.
