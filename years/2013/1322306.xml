<AbstractNarration>This full-scale project addresses the need for more youth, especially girls, to pursue an interest in engineering and eventually fill a critical workforce need. The project leverages museum-based exhibits, girls' activity groups, and social media to enhance participants' engineering-related interests and identities. The project includes the following bilingual deliverables: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Creative Solutions programming will engage girls in group oriented engineering activities at partner community-based organizations, where the activities highlight altruistic, personally relevant, and social aspects of engineering. Existing community groups will use the activities in their regular meeting structure. Visits to the museum exhibits, titled Design Your World will reinforce messages. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Design Your World Exhibits will serve as a community hub at two ISE institutions (Oregon Museum of Science and Industry and the Hatfield Marine Science Center).  They will leverage existing NSF-funded Engineer It! (DRL-9803989) exhibits redesigned to attract, engage, and mobilize a more diverse population by showcasing altruistic, personally relevant, and social aspects of engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Digital engagement through targeted use of social media will complement program and exhibit content and be an online portal for groups engaged in the project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. A community action group (CAG) will provide professional development opportunities to stakeholders interested in girls' STEM identity (e.g. parents, STEM-based business professionals) to promote effective engineering messaging throughout the community and engage them in supporting project participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;5. Longitudinal research will explore how girls construct and negotiate engineering-related identities through discourse across the project activities and over time.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of Designing Our World (DOW) was to empower and promote youths?, especially girls?, pursuit of engineering careers by cultivating networks of community stakeholders and engaging girls with experiences that illuminated the social, personally relevant, and altruistic nature of engineering to support girls? engineering identity formation, showing girls and their peers the various ways in which the engineering process relates to their lives and to potential careers.
