<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to further the research of the principal investigator (PI) in harmonic analysis, a branch of mathematics that is an area of active research and also one that is very important for its applications to a wide variety of problems in physics and engineering.  The research will be conducted a Trinity College, a liberal arts college that focuses on undergraduate education but requires its faculty to maintain active research programs.  This project will further the development of mathematical research at Trinity. Undergraduate students will be given the opportunity to participate in the project. This will help Trinity expand its undergraduate research programs to include mathematics.  Undergraduate research enhances the quality of undergraduate education and better prepares students for advanced work in science, mathematics, and engineering.  In particular, the PI (himself a Mexican-American) hopes to recruit women and members of underrepresented minority groups to participate in the research project, thereby increasing diversity in mathematics and the sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project the PI will study weighted norm inequalities in harmonic analysis.  The goal is to further the recent work of the PI in three closely related areas: Rubio de Francia extrapolation, sharp constant estimates, and two-weight norm inequalities.    Recent work by a number of mathematicians, including the PI, on sharp constant estimates with Muckenhoupt weights and extrapolation theory has yielded new results and a number of techniques that should be applicable to additional problems, including endpoint estimates for functions of bounded mean oscillation and extrapolation estimates for matrix weights.  These results in turn will yield applications to regularity estimates for degenerate partial differential equations and to the study of variable Lebesgue spaces.   The PI will also work on two-weight estimates, particularly on the separated bump conjecture for singular integrals and Riesz potentials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was in the general area of harmonic analysis.  This is a branch of mathematics which is concerned with the study of the mathematical tools that arose in the study of a number of physical phenomena, including vibrating strings and membranes (like a drum) and the distribution of heat in a cooling body.   It is part of pure mathematics, meaning that it is concerned with the mathematical tools themselves, and not with their applications to real world problems.  However, results in the field continue to find new and powerful applications.  The research in this project focused on weighted Lebesgue spaces:  that is, spaces of functions whose size is controlled (in some way) by the area under the graph.  They are "weighted" in the sense that some regions are assumed to have greater density than others (think of a piece of metal which is denser in some places than in others).   Much work has gone into understanding the weights, represented as functions, which allow classical results to be proved in this more general setting.  In our work we further developed the theory of "extrapolation" which allows results proved in one weighted space to be transfered to another space without additional work.  These results are very important because many of the tools of harmonic analysis only work in certain settings (e.g., in a so-called Hilbert space, which is like an infinite dimensional version of ordinary 3 dimensional space).  Using extrapolation, results proved in these settings can be lifted to other, more complicated spaces that do not have such nice properties.  Extrapolation was first studied by the Spanish mathematician Rubio de Francia, but in the past two decades there has been a great deal of additional work in this area.  In our work we developed versions of extrapolation that could be applied to prove results in new spaces and with larger families of weights.  We applied these to prove a number of applications in harmonic analysis and partial differential equations.  Our work contributed in a fundamental way to the study of harmonic analysis and provided new tools for future work.  During the project these results were disseminated at a number of conferences.  In particular, we taught a number of short courses for graduate students, helping to train the next generation of mathematicians working in harmonic analysis.  During the project we also worked directly with two graduate students, leading to their publication of several papers.  Finally, funding from the project supported eight undergraduate students at an undergraduate institution (Trinity College, Hartford), to participate in undergraduate research in analysis.  Such research experiences are important in exposing students to the frontiers of mathematics and encouraging them to pursue advanced degrees in math or other STEM fields.
