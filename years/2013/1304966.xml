<AbstractNarration>Valencia College in Orlando, FL on behalf of the Central Florida STEM Alliance (CFSA) is seeking funding under the LSAMP B2B program to double the number of underrepresented minority (URM) STEM students (from 321 to 642) transferring from three community colleges to the University of Central Florida (UCF) and other universities. The target population for this project is African Americans and Hispanic students. The community colleges within the Alliance are: Valencia College, a designated Hispanic Serving Institution, fiscal agent and project lead, (VC), Lake-Sumter State College (LSSC), and Seminole State College of Florida (SSC). This project will expand and focus efforts toward building a system and infrastructure for URM students in STEM majors. This project will focus efforts to increase the transfer rate of underrepresented minorities through focused efforts including: 1) providing clear and targeted advising; 2) providing information about STEM fields and career opportunities; 3) encouraging their projective identity as a STEM professional; and 4) increasing opportunities for students to conduct research.</AbstractNarration>

Significant Results  LSAMP Program Enrollment &ndash; CFSA partners enrolled more than 2,300   students, with most students identifying as Black/African American and   Hispanic. The level of student engagement varied, with large numbers of   students participating in a few discrete activities for a few hours to a   smaller number of students participating in more intensive, longer-term   experiences.

Key Accomplishments  Dedicated STEM Advising &ndash; CFSA established and institutionalized   three positions for dedicated advisors to support the associate degree   completion and transfer readiness of URM students in STEM majors. Peer Learning Support &ndash; Alliance colleges expanded, or implemented   for the first time, the supplemental learning (supplemental instruction) model   for peer-tutoring.
