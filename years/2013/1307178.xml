<AbstractNarration>Manifold-valued data appear frequently in shape and image analysis, computer vision, biomechanics and many others. Medical imaging data in studies of the variability of human organ shapes lie on a fairly high dimensional nonlinear manifolds, where the challenge is two-fold: high dimensionality with a low sample size (data are expensive to gather) and naturally imposed non-Euclidean geometry. The proposed research aims to answer scientific questions arising in object shape analysis and to provide solid mathematical basis for more complex problems. First, the investigator takes and extends the strategy of backward dimension reduction with regularization framework. Sparse representation of shape and directional data are proposed and their properties are studied. In the regression context, polynomial regression for manifold-valued response to model and test non-geodesic trends is proposed. An extension of local polynomial modeling is also considered. The investigator also explores efficient computational methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of object shape is crucial for understanding the population of human anatomical objects and revealing the interplay between biomarkers/clinical outcomes and object shape variations. Due to the advanced technology, the modern object shape data become big and complex, but conventional methods lack considerations on the special geometric structure of the data types. This research project aims to provide new statistical methodologies for exploratory and confirmatory analysis of the large-scale non-standard data types, including the object shapes. The project will also produce statistical tools, which may be applied in many fields including biomechanics, computer vision, medical studies and biological sciences.</AbstractNarration>

In particular, we developed methods to reveal main patterns among populations of 2D and 3D shapes, objects and images. At the data exploration stage of analysis, the main patterns are usually revealed by various means of dimension reduction.  We created a new family of probability distributions to model rotational deformations of 3D shapes that enable testing of geometric hypotheses regarding human movement and internal organ shapes.

The new models are related to a family of dimension-reduction models for high-dimensional directional data, which also indicates a potential model-based dimension reduction of data sets of 2D shapes.  For interpretable analysis of diffusion tensor images, a measure of brain functionality, we extend the rotation-scaling framework and carefully laid out mathematical and geometrical foundations for statistics.
