<AbstractNarration>This action funds Heather Harper-Lovelady of the University of South Florida to conduct a research project in the Mathematics and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at Laboratory of Bio-Solid State Science, Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan.  The project title is "Characterizing Environmental Effects on the Physical Properties of Collagen." The host scientist is Professor Toru Asahi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many tissues in the body such as ligament, bone, and cornea, derive much of their structural and mechanical properties from type I collagen.  All of these tissues have drastically different physical properties but they are all constructed using the same collagen molecule.  How the same molecule can be responsible for such a range of tissues is of great importance in the fields of tissue engineering, bio-technology, and more.  Previous research has demonstrated that ionic environment plays a key role in the physical properties of individual collagen molecules.  For collagen to form a tissue, such as cornea, it has to be assembled in a specific pattern to create a sheet.  It remains unknown how the physical properties of individual molecules affect a larger scale collagen sheet.  This project investigates the physical properties of collagen sheets and relates them to previous research on collagen molecules.  Comparing the physical properties of collagen on these different scales will provide valuable knowledge for engineering collagen based tissues in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, outreach activities are being performed to introduce high school students to opportunities in international study and collaboration through scientific research.  Both before and after the internship, local high school students will be introduced to the EAPSI program, NSF, and the Fellow's research through an interactive web-based blog in written and video format. The goal of this outreach is to educate, inspire, and encourage students to pursue education and careers in the STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>
