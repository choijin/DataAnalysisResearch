<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Janet Braddock-Wilking of the University of Missouri-St. Louis is developing synthetic strategies for the preparation of fluorescent molecules containing silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge).  These molecules have structural features that promote strong light emission in the solid state.  Modification of the structure of these compounds allows for the development of air-stable molecules that emit blue, green, or red light for solid-state applications, for example, as components for screen displays (organic light emitting diodes) and solar cells.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the synthetic pathways for the preparation of cyclic compounds containing silicon and germanium centers incorporated into five- and six-membered carbon-based ring structures of Si and Ge derivatives of metallaloles, dibenzometalloles, and fluorescein.   The unique optoelectronic properties of the molecules are associated with their structures and are fine-tuned by incorporating a variety of conjugated peripheral groups attached to the ring structure.  The new molecules are being characterized by multinuclear NMR and IR spectroscopies, mass spectrometry, UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopies, elemental analysis, cyclic voltammetry, and X-ray crystallography, when possible.  Professor Braddock-Wilking continues to devote efforts to train and mentor female undergraduate and graduate students.  In addition, she is currently the co-chair of the St. Louis ACS Section Women Chemists Committee.  The broader impacts of this work include societal benefits resulting from the discovery of stable and efficient luminescent compounds for components in electroluminescent solid-state applications as well as the training of undergraduate and graduate students on the synthetic and characteristic techniques utilized in the preparation of the luminescent silicon- and germanium-containing cyclic compounds.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A series of strongly luminescent compounds containing a fused three-ring system incorporating carbon atoms and a silicon or germanium center have been synthesized and characterized.  These ring compounds, known as silafluorenes and germafluorenes, absorb light in the ultraviolet-visible region and exhibit intense blue to blue-green fluorescence in solution and in the solid-state.  These compounds show high thermal stability and may be excellent candidates for emitting layers in electronic devices and as chemical or biological sensors.  In addition, a modified synthetic method was developed to make the precursor compounds and resulted in shortened reaction times and overall better yields.   The project involved the training of graduate and undergraduate students, as well as summer high school students, on the preparation and characterization of the compounds during the award period.  The students learned valuable synthetic and characterization techniques with the new compounds.  Some of the techniques used include nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), X-ray crystallography, mass spectrometry, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and, in several cases, quantum yield determinations.  A recent collaboration has been established for the use of these compounds as probes of biological hydrophobic surfaces, including applications in confocal microscopy.  Results of this research has been presented at regional, national and international meetings and published in scientific peer-reviewed journals.
