<AbstractNarration>PROGRAM DIRECTOR'S RECOMMENDATION &lt;br/&gt;1338925 George Mason University; Chaowei Yang &lt;br/&gt;1338914 Harvard University; Peter Bol &lt;br/&gt;1338902 University of California-Santa Barbara; Keith Clarke &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;George Mason University (GMU) as the lead institution, Harvard University (HU), and the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) are proposing to establish a center for spatiotemporal thinking, computing and applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal seeks to establish an I/UCRC for spatiotemporal thinking, computing and applications as a collaborative platform among industry, university, government agencies, and other organizations to advance this domain of knowledge. The proposed center will be established based upon the previous successes at each of the three sites including: a) the Center for Intelligent Spatial Computing (CISC) at GMU for spatiotemporal computing/software development; b) the Center for Spatial Studies (CSS) at UCSB for spatial thinking and analyses; and c) the Center for Geographic Analysis (CGA) at Harvard for spatiotemporal applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mission of the new Center would be to integrate these technologies into a comprehensive spatiotemporal theory and applications. Research results and success stories will be disseminated through publications in relevant spatiotemporal venues as well as among the center member sites for adoption and outreach. The PIs plan to use their established relationship with leading organizations to broadcast the research results and recruit new members through the organization channels. The PIs plan to develop new curriculum within existing degree programs at the three sites, and to continue their diversity traditions to include minorities and other underrepresented groups in center activities.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We live in a four-dimensional world (3D in space and 1D in time). A systematic and integrative understanding of the four dimensions can empower us to address many scientific and engineering challenges. The Spatiotemporal I/UCRC (a.k.a NSF Spatiotemporal Innovation Center) was established in 2013 as a collaboration among George Mason University (led by Chaowei Yang), University of California at Santa Barbara (led by Keith Clarke), and Harvard University (led by Peter Bol, Jason Ur, and Wendy Guan) to build such an enabling national and international spatiotemporal infrastructure. The phase I (2013-2019) investigation has been focusing on understanding the importance of spatiotemporal thinking, computing and applications in different domains and as a core to computer science and software engineering. This is achieved through the joint efforts of the three sites and our 15+ members as well as many other collaborative organizations. The success of Phase I demonstrated the possibility of building the spatiotemporal infrastructure with 10+ faculty placed at top departments in the US, 4 startups created, 200+ papers published, and 5000+ audiences directly engaged. The outcome also enabled many high-profiled applications from planetary defense (saving our home planet from potential asteroid threat) to secondary cities (building data infrastructure in hotspot cities) using the latest spatiotemporal tools and technologies. The outcome examples include</p> <ol> <li>10+ books edited and published with some translated into other languages for international impact. For example, a) The&nbsp;<em>spatial cloud computing</em>&nbsp;book published in 2013 (funded by NASA Goddard and USGS) was translated into Chinese and was sold out in one week after the first print came out; b) The&nbsp;<em>Introduction to GIS Programming </em>book (consolidated from a number of center projects&rsquo; development experience) is being evaluated by ~100 universities as text worldwide.</li> <li>10+ Ph.D. students and postdocs funded by center membership projects placed as tenure line US faculty and we also placed 20+ faculty internationally in China, Africa, and UK. Such universities include, e.g., Univ. of Wisconsin-Madison, Penn State University, Arizona State University, and Wuhan University.&nbsp;</li> <li>200+ papers with an average of 30+ papers per year including papers published in highly respected journals, ~6 of them are among the most cited and/or most read papers of the publishing journal, e.g., a) the cloud computing and big data paper became the #1 read paper (reached 40k to set a milestone) of the International Journal of Digital Earth (IJDE); b) the geospatial cyberinfrastructure paper published with Computers, Environment, and Urban Systems (CEUS) became a top 5 cited paper of CEUS in its history.</li> <li>A computing infrastructure of 500 nodes (~$4M) built as the largest cloud facility of its kind in GIS domain and shared among the 3 sites.</li> <li>Four startup companies created and one obtained over $200M venture capital, one has contracts valued over $2M; two became members of the center and the third is considering become a member;</li> <li>Support planetary defense effort for spatiotemporal understanding and the simulation of asteroids to mitigate NEO impact for saving our home planet; this research is highlighted in several news media;</li> <li>Computational Components are being integrated with the NASA Center for Climate Simulations to manage petabytes of datasets (~1/3 of the global climate data) for future IPCC report.</li> <li>Flooding algorithms and analytics integrated with NOAA operations and disaster response solutions to produce hourly flood maps for first responders to saving lives (e.g., &lt;100 life losses in&nbsp;Hurricane Harvey comparing&nbsp;to ~3000 life losses in Hurricane Katrina).</li> </ol> <p>While the phase I investigation demonstrated the power of a systematic understanding of our 4D world, the 2nd phase investigation will expand the engaging sites, memberships, and participants to continue establishing the national and international spatiotemporal infrastructure.
