<AbstractNarration>The Washington Internship for Native Students, established under the auspices of The American University's Washington Semester Program, was developed in response to the White House Initiative to help American Indian, Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian (AI/NA/HN) students develop knowledge and leadership skills necessary to enhance their potential to contribute to their tribal communities, and the nation.  Having access to a significant pool of  AI/NA/HN students, the program focuses on experiential learning by coupling internships with coursework and ensuring that traditional values and practices of sovereign nations and tribes are incorporated in the program.  WINS will continue to collaborate with the National Science Foundation to provide internship placements for AI/NA/HN students, a group sorely under-represented in the STEM workforce. It is anticipated as a result of this effort, the NSF will serve as a conduit to broaden participation of this under-represented group, and diversify the future STEM enterprise, needed to keep the US competitive in a global environment.</AbstractNarration>
