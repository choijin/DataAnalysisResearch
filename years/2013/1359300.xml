<AbstractNarration>The Illinois State University REU for Pre-service and In-service Secondary Mathematics Teachers (ISU REU) will offer projects in discrete mathematics during the summers of 2014, 2015, and 2016. The ISU REU is an eight-week summer research experience for 8 pre-service and 4 in-service secondary mathematics teachers. Participants explore research topics in discrete mathematics with emphasis on experimentation, formulation of researchable questions, careful reasoning and justification, and clear, precise reporting. Most of the investigated topics are the areas of graph designs, affine and projective designs, graph decompositions and labelings, graph coloring, and vector space partitions. An added emphasis of the project is on the development and implementation, by the REU participants, of a one-week Mathematics Research Camp for 12 high school students from the Chicago Public School (CPS) district. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REU participants work in teams of three undergraduates, one practicing teacher, and a faculty mentor on one or more problems with a common theme. The participants are on campus for 30 hours each week with a faculty member available at all times. The main objective of the project is to provide a genuine research opportunity for the participants, helping them to become highly qualified teachers who can meet the national demands for increased student proficiency and adapt to the changing needs of our technological society. Providing teachers an authentic mathematics research experience develops in them the habits of mind of a mathematician that can then be encouraged and fostered in their future students.  The math camp for CPS students is held during the sixth week of the REU and is intended to give the REU participants an opportunity to apply what they learned during the REU in a high school classroom setting. In the final week of the site, the project teams devote the bulk of their energy to preparation of results for dissemination, which includes presentations at the Joint Mathematics Meetings and other venues. Each REU project generally produces one or more conference presentations, and many also produce papers published in undergraduate or professional journals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main objective of the Illinois State University (ISU) REU project as proposed is to:   provide research opportunities for prospective and practicing secondary mathematics teachers, helping them become highly qualified mathematics teachers who have an understanding of what mathematics is and how it is discovered and communicated. The PIs believe that such a research experience will help instill mathematical confidence and enable the participants to help their future students understand, think about, reason with, and engage with rich mathematical ideas.    Additional objectives include:  Showcasing positive teaching role models through exceptional teacher mentors and by teaming experienced secondary teachers with prospective teachers in researching discrete mathematics topics; and  Guiding participants at both levels in the creation of lesson plans promoting deep understanding and critical reasoning in the exploration of mathematical topics that can be suitable for high school classrooms.   The expected outcomes of the ISU REU as proposed are detailed below. The first two outcomes relate specifically to the main objective of the project (providing research opportunities for pre-service and in-service teachers), and the next two outcomes relate to the additional objectives listed above. The expected outcomes include:  The development of "teacher-scholars"&mdash; pre-service and in-service teachers and prospective teachers who have experienced scholarship in mathematics in an exciting setting that emphasizes the interconnections among theory, procedures, and applications, and who "develop habits of mind of a mathematical thinker". A number of research publications authored jointly by the undergraduate pre-service teachers, the in-service teachers, and the faculty involved in the project. Lesson plans developed by the "teacher-scholars" that (a) reflect a pedagogical emphasis on deep mathematical thinking; (b) demonstrate how advanced mathematics topics in discrete mathematics are reflected in or may become part of the high school curriculum; and (c) provide an opportunity for high school students to experience "doing" mathematics. Partnerships between university researchers and high school mathematics teachers that entail common goals (e.g., better motivated and prepared high school and undergraduate students, and continuing dialogue about mathematics research).    Each of the cohorts of the 2014-2016 ISU REU worked on 3 to 5 research projects in combinatorics (total of 12 projects). These projects resulted in 9 research articles that have either been published or are accepted for publication without conditions. The participants gave a total of 14 research presentations over the 3 year period.

The PIs sought to expand the participants' views of mathematics as a dynamic endeavor, to provide opportunities for mathematical discovery, and to enhance their content knowledge and their pedagogical content knowledge. Specifically, as they delved into new discrete mathematics topics through exploration, conjecturing, reasoning and communicating, the participants:  Worked in groups and experienced learning that occurs through the sharing of ideas; Used technology to assist in the exploration of mathematics (e.g., C++ and Java programs) and to typeset their assignments and results (e.g., LaTeX and Beamer); Developed teaching lessons that can allow them to bring fresh ideas into the high school classroom and allow high school students to encounter mathematics in a more active way; Investigated how high school students develop generalizations; and Reflected on their experiences and on how these might translate to a high school setting.
