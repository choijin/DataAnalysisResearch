<AbstractNarration>Two Alvin dives on the flank of the East Pacific Rise near 9Â°50'N will investigate the seafloor overlying the two largest crustal magma lenses detected by 3D multichannel seismic studies. At a distance of 5-7 km from the spreading axis, the results will document any recent faulting, flow, hydrothermal and associated biological activity across each hill. Changes as plate age increases, or along the faults bounding each hill will also be determined at each site. This information will be used to evaluate the role of off-axis magma  in powering volcanic and hydrothermal activity. Post-cruise analysis will reconstruct the tectonic and volcanic history of the site using visual estimates of relative lava age and geologic contacts, radiometric dating of lava and sediment analysis for microbial activity.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The discovery of shallow, crust-level magma lenses on the ridge flanks at fast and intermediate spreading-rate ridges is one of the most unexpected and interesting results in the last decade of research on seafloor spreading.

Prior to these dives, CTD tow-yo casts were run over areas with a high likelihood of hosting hydrothermal vents.

So what do we know? First, we know now that there are neither extensive nor ubiquitous areas of present volcanism or hydrothermal venting overlying the off-axis melt lenses. This is news because no one has looked previously in the specific locations of the magma bodies. Second, we know that the small volcanic cones clearly overprint the seafloor fabric built at the ridge axis and are fairly young (100-1000 yrs) judging from sediment thickness and glass weathering on the lava. Therefore, off-axis melt lenses are likely to drive more short-term or episodic volcanism along with associated hydrothermal venting and biological communities. Third, since we know that low-T hydrothermal systems develop on the ridge flanks and abyssal hills of the EPR, these features are likely to be more permeability (fracture) controlled than heat-limited.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/22/2015<br>      Modified by: Scott&nbsp;M&nbsp;White</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1357726/1357726_10285348_1450803678193_AT16-53divesites--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1357726/1357726_10285348_1450803678193_AT16-53divesites--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Dive sites"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1357726/1357726_10285348_1450803678193_AT16-53divesites--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Dive sites"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Locations of dives exploring off-axis melt lens manifestions.
