<AbstractNarration>Literature reviews, whether systematic or ad hoc, are an integral part of the research process. By enabling the execution of systematic literature reviews, this infrastructure helps ensure that researchers identify a complete and unbiased set of candidate papers when performing such a review. In addition, this project lowers the barrier for performing SLRs allowing a larger portion of the SE community to conduct SLRs. This work is especially helpful for PhD students who much perform a literature review as part of their thesis work. Because SLRs are often publishable as stand-alone articles, this infrastructure will also help increase students? publication rate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project conducts planning activities in preparation for the creation of an infrastructure to support the SLR process. The community targeted by this project comprises SE researchers who already conduct SLRs, as well as SE researchers who will be more likely to conduct SLRs if the barriers to adoption are removed. The primary objectives of this are to: evolve an understanding of community needs and the proposed infrastructure; and create a detailed plan for the development and deployment of the infrastructure</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Systematic Literature Review (SLR) is a practice for methodically searching, identifying, and synthesizing research results reported in the scientific literature. The SLR practice is beneficial to both the research and practitioner community because it allows researchers to systematically and unbiasedly gather all extant information related to a research question. The researcher can then analyze all of this information to provide a comprehensive understanding to inform research and practice. SLR is a useful practice in many disciplines including Evidence-Based Medicine.     Recently the Software Engineering (SE) discipline has adopted the SLR practice into our methodology toolbox. While the SLR approach is beneficial, there are significant shortcomings, primarily due to the deficiencies in the current support infrastructure. The goal of this project was to articulate and prioritize the current barriers and SLR-support infrastructure requirements. To accomplish this goal we interacted with members of the SE community through a survey and conducting two community workshops at SE conferences. In the first workshop, we identified a list of barriers community members faced when performing SLRs. In the second workshop, we identified and prioritized a list of specific features that the community members desired to see in any SLR support infrastructure.   As a result of the community interactions and our own experiences, as having conducted SLRs, we developed a list of SLR infrastructure requirements. The important requirements, grouped by phase, include:   Project Initiation and Management   Assistance with developing research questions and a detailed protocol   Validation of protocol   Data interchange (i.e. allowing multiple tools to exchange data in a common format)     Search - i.e. searching databases to identify potentially relevant papers   Federated search of multiple paper repositories   Support for query/keyword construction   Automated download of articles   Support for collaboration     Selection - i.e. choosing the right papers from the results of the search process   Support for performing selection based on inclusion/exclusion criteria   Support for collaboration in resolving conflict with study selection   Collection, storage, analysis, reporting, and exporting of study results and bibliographic information     Documentation - i.e. recording and tracking important information about the SLR   Document the planned and executed protocols   Keep track of meta-information about included studies   Record conclusions and findings of the SLR     Quality Assurance - i.e. ensuring that the studies included in the SLR are of high-quality   Support for developing a quality assurance plan, including reuse of existing plans   Metrics for qualitative and quantitative analysis   Comparing results from multiple reviewers and resolving discrepancies     Data Extraction - i.e. extracting important information from each reviewed study   Automated extraction of evidence   Coding of data   Collaboration of multiple authors to support conflict resolution       The results of this work have established a starting point upon which a SLR support infrastructure can be built. We have detailed descriptions of all of the requirements listed above. We have also begun implementing prototypes for some of the required functionality. Researchers who are interested in building tools to support the SLR process can also make use of our results to guide their efforts. Finally, because many other disciplines, like Evidence Based Medicine, also conduct SLR (and, interestingly, have some of the same problems), the resulting infrastructure can also be of use beyond the discipline of SE.
