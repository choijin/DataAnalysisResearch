<AbstractNarration>An essential issue in the movement sciences is to understand how people maintain upright posture and balance. In everyday life, people often simultaneously turn and reach to pick up objects or to place objects.  Such movements are typically accurate and seem virtually effortless. However, when an arm movement is made during ongoing trunk rotation large inertial forces are generated on the reaching arm.  These forces are so large that huge errors in reaching and destabilization of posture would occur if the central nervous system (CNS) did not take them into account. In this program of research, two series of experiments will examine the interaction of the control of self-rotation and of arm-torso dynamics. Series 1 will evaluate the kinematics of reaching and turning, postural sway, arm joint torques, and ground reaction forces at the feet.  Series 2 will assess these variables in tasks involving active and passive torso rotation and reaching. The results will indicate whether the CNS control of trunk rotation and arm reaching are a) parallel and independent, b) hierarchical with information about intended trunk rotation contributing to separate control of torso and arm movements, or c) distributed with a single internal model for reaching and turning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Falling in the elderly is a major health problem. Neurological diseases that affect torso and or limb movement control (e.g., Parkinson's disease) also increase the likelihood of falls. This research should provide a scientific basis for developing rehabilitation strategies that compensate for trunk-generated forces on the limbs and minimize the likelihood of falling.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Since the beginning of the project we have completed all four objectives.   Goal 1 &ndash; Compare compensations for rightward Coriolis forces generated by right hand reaching movements during voluntary leftward body rotation on a stationary platform.   We have found that during voluntary turn and reach movements extremely large Coriolis forces are generated on the reaching arm. During such movements, high torso rotation velocities (200&deg;/sec) and arm movement velocities (&gt;1000mm/sec) are generated and their peak velocities occur within 80 msec of one another. This means that Coriolis forces are maximized on the reaching arm. Nevertheless, the movements to targets are straight and accurate. Movements remain straight and accurate when a weight is held during the movements. We have proven that compensation for self-generated Coriolis forces has to be a feedforward rather than a reactive compensation.   Goal 2 -  Evaluate initial reactions and adaptation to novel Coriolis forces in reaching movements during passive, counterclockwise constant velocity rotation and the transfer of adaptation acquired during passive rotation to voluntary turn and reach movements.   We have found that when reaching movements are made during passive rotation the path and endpoint of the movements are deflected but with repeated movements, even without visual feedback about movement trajectory and endpoint, straight and accurate movements are soon regained, circa 30 movements. The Coriolis forces generated during passive rotation at 10rpm are only about 30% of the magnitude of those generated during voluntary turn and reach movements which by contrast are straight and accurate. After subjects are adapted to reaching movements during exposure to passive rotation, turn and reach movements made post-rotation are initially deflected and miss their targets. Re-adaptation to the stationary environment occurs within 30 reaches.   Goal 3 - Evaluate how the accuracy of vestibular estimate of self-rotation affects reaching movements.   We have found that subjects passively exposed to naturalistic torso velocity profiles (mimicking those made during turn and reach movements) while making reaching movements make smaller reaching errors than when exposed to passive constant velocity rotation. This pattern means that the vestibular stimulation evoked during the passive, naturalistic torso rotation profiles enables some compensation for the Coriolis forces generated during passive rotation to take place. We have also found that people without labyrinthine function who make turn and reach movements do so by first rotating their torso and then extending their arm. By so doing they avoid Coriolis forces on the arm due to trunk rotation. These results suggest that vestibular stimulation is involved in the updating of torso rotation calibration for calculating the Coriolis forces that will be generated by forthcoming turn and reach movements.   Goal 4 - Evaluate transfer of adaptation of active torso rotation movements (with no reaching movements) to simple reaching without torso rotation and simultaneous turn and reach movements.   We have found that when control of the torso is adaptively remapped on a servo-controlled rotating platform on which the subject stands so that when the subject makes a torso-foot relative displacement of 60&deg; but a torso-external space displacement of 30&deg; (because the platform rotates 30&deg; opposite to that of the torso rotation) reaching errors result. Post-adaptation when the subjects stand on the laboratory floor and make a turn and reach movement they will make a torso rotation of 30&deg; (when attempting to turn 60&deg;) and their arm will be displaced past the target in the direction of the torso rotation. This pattern indicates that the subjects? CNSs are generating compensations for Coriolis forces that are much larger than those actually generated. Together the findings indicate that compensations for self-generated Coriolis forces are planned in a space-based rather than egocentric reference frame. Outcomes As part of studying torso and arm movement control in a rotating environment, we also needed to evaluate the adaptation of torso movements to adaptive rotation. When a person is making fore-aft swaying movements during constant velocity rotation, Coriolis forces are generated on the moving body. During forward sway the body center of mass is deflected in the direction opposite that of the rotating environment, during backwards sway the deflection is the same direction as that of rotation. With repeated sway movements adaptation occurs and straight fore-aft sway paths are soon regained. The adaptation was driven by asymmetric control of the two legs and is incompatible with existing models of inverted pendulum body sway, which are parallel-leg models in which the two legs are controlled in a conjoint unitary way. We have now developed a non-parallel two-leg model that explains our present findings and also accounts for previous observations we made on fore-aft sway in a 2-g background force level during parabolic flight maneuvers.
