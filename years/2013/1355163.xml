<AbstractNarration>When an individual animal interacts with another individual, it has a physiological response.  The researchers are trying to understand how physiological responses can influence current and future behavior. Other studies have shown that hormones, such as testosterone, can increase after a social interaction. An important question is whether this hormone release can influence future behavior. Because some hormones can result in a positive, rewarding response, a preference for a location can form in response to the release of a hormone such as testosterone. Thus, any male-male or male-female interaction that results in the release of testosterone may induce an individual to seek out that location repeatedly. Hormone release may therefore influence how individuals use space through the development of preferences for specific locations. This research investigates, for the first time, the natural function of the reward-like properties of testosterone related to the development of preferences for specific locations.  This research may reveal a new mechanism, testosterone pulses, for responding rapidly to adapt to changing social conditions associated with specific locations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers use conditioned place preference development in response to testosterone injections to provide insight into the mechanisms balancing the different social demands of a monogamous and territorial species, the biparental California mouse. The hypothesis is that testosterone pulses induce spatial distributions appropriate for the social demands of the environment and, in turn, alter context appropriate behaviors in the form of paternal and territorial behavior, pair bond maintenance, mate advertisement and mate-attendance. The testosterone-induced spatial distribution may influence behavior only through location or may further amplify and alter social interactions. Within this framework, the researchers test questions in both simple and complex environments. They examine complex aspects of testosterone-modified social interactions by assessing acoustic communication in the field and laboratory. The researchers propose to examine three aims to address the function of T pulses and resulting effects on conditioned place preferences and social behavior for focal pair-bonded males and their mates (Aim 1a), focal male interactions with pups (Aim 1b), focal male interactions with a female intruder (Aim 2), and focal male interactions with a male intruder (Aim 3). This research will create a stimulating and collaborative student-training environment with unique experiences that integrate behavioral endocrinology studies in the field and laboratory. The collaboration between a midwestern R1 and small southern research institution with fieldwork conducted at the Hastings Natural History Reserve in California, will facilitate wide dissemination of expertise across researchers and students, including STEM URM students. The project will be integrated with a successful 10-year old outreach program called "Bats and Mice in Your Backyard." Two software packages are being developed to automate the analysis of ultrasonic vocalizations and mouse behavior from thermal videos collected in the field and will be made available under an open source license</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual merit</strong>: Males of many vertebrate species, including humans, can release a surge of testosterone (T) after an encounter with another male or female of the same species such as in a competitive encounter. What is the function of that T surge and does the surge function the same way in complex environments? We sought to answer this question by studying males of the monogamous California mouse. We found that surges of T are rewarding and condition males to spend more time in the location in which they received the surge. We also found that the rewarding effect of the T surge is seen under both controlled laboratory settings and complex settings in the wild. In the laboratory, the ability of T surges to create a conditioned place preference (CPP), or location preference, depends on a male&rsquo;s past experience such as whether he is with familiar individuals, at home or away from home, bonded with a female mate, or dispersed from his parent&rsquo;s territory. In the field the T surge creates a CPP if the male is near his nest and is independent of other factors such as whether he is raising young with his mate. The rewarding value of a drug therefore may depend on physiological, social, and location contexts. Moreover, we demonstrate potential natural functions for the formation of CPPs. We also asked whether T surges result in behavioral changes beyond the CPP. These mice use different types of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) to communicate &nbsp;and we studied how these USVs changed with T surges. In the lab we found that males who shared a pair bond with a mate did not use USVs for courtship with other females after a T surge and this means that the T surge mediates behaviors that enforce fidelity. On the other hand, T surges can increase competitition between males in the lab and &nbsp;alter the structure of USVs in the wild. Our study also sheds light on the function of the different types of mouse USVs. We found that USV types involved in forming a bond between a male and female change as that bond develops, and how they use USVs is important to the resiliency of the pair in response to infidelity and how successful they will be in raising young. The complexity of USVs and their functions suggests that more information is conveyed than simply affiliative versus aversive states. Our work shows that rodents are an excellent mammalian model for research on the neurobiology of communication and associated disorders in both controlled lab environments and complex, real life situations in nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong>Our research reveals that testosterone surges can impact behavior such as location preference and social communication even in the face of natural competing demands in the wild such as other social interactions, predation risks,&nbsp;and other ecological challenges.

Multiple outreach activities associated with this project were presented to the broader public.  Trainees developed scientific communication skills via community engagement and exposed the community to cutting edge science that intersected field and laboratory biology.  Not only did the outreach describe the science supported by this grant but also the conservation value of the California mouse and other sympatric species, as well as the critical role that rodents play in terrestrial ecosystems. In Wisconsin, we incorporated this work into a UW Madison PREP program and the UW "Expanding Your Horizons" for middle school girls exploring STEM careers. In North Carolina and California, we incorporated our field and laboratory work into our successful outreach program entitled "Bats and Mice In Your Backyard", that disseminates research to the broader public across all ages.  All outreach work was disseminated to the broader public at over 50 venues to over 5000 members of the public.
