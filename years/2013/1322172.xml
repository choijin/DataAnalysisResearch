<AbstractNarration>CBET - 1322172&lt;br/&gt;Yinlun Huang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sustainability science and engineering has become a very active area of research in various disciplines of engineering, natural and social sciences. Sustainability theories and sustainability assessment, analysis, design and decision making methodologies as well as tools have been developed, many of which are used to tackle real-world problems in collaboration with industries.  The Third International Congress on Sustainability Science and Engineering will address broader issues of sustainability science and engineering, facilitate discussions on scientific and technological development, and share research and practice experiences in industrial sustainability, a group of scientists, educators, and engineers, and governmental officers. The congress will be held in Cincinnati, Ohio, August 11-15, 2013.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The travel support to the US academic researchers, educators, and students should help them learn the cutting-age research in various fields of sustainability, share their experience with the world-class leaders and other colleagues, and identify international collaboration opportunities in strengthening sustainable engineering research and education. Junior faculty members, young researchers, graduate and undergraduate students, especially those minorities underrepresented in science and engineering will be strongly encouraged to participate. Student poster paper competitions will provide an opportunity for them to present their research activities and receive advice from leading experts from different countries. It is planned that selected papers will be published in three technical journals.</AbstractNarration>
