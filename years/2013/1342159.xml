<AbstractNarration>This EAGER project advances knowledge to evaluate the implementation of a transmedia game that includes social media, video, email, computer games, and photography designed to support STEM learning. The game is situated within the Chicago Summer of Learning (CSOL) a city-wide activity designed to interest African American and Latino students in STEM activities and careers. The study examines students' STEM knowledge and noncognitive skills such as creativity, communication and collaboration. The evaluation includes both randomized controlled experiments using econometric technicques and qualitative measures. In addition, indicators from the Chicago public schools will be provided (grades, attendance, and behavior reports). The proposal is high risk as how students learn and what they learn through such games is still largely untested.</AbstractNarration>
