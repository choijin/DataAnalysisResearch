<AbstractNarration>This research program will use ultracold atoms to emulate, with precise experimental control, the behavior of electrons in graphene, a technologically interesting allotrope of carbon, and that of fundamental particles (e.g. quarks or leptons) governed by the laws of special relativity and quantum mechanics.  In doing so, this program can elucidate open questions regarding the equilibrium and dynamical behaviors of such systems when comprised of many particles that strongly interact.  To achieve this, ultracold lithium-6 atoms will be confined in an optical lattice potential formed from interfering laser fields which produce a honeycomb intensity pattern through which the atoms move.  This lattice potential mimics that experienced by electrons in graphene which move through a honeycomb lattice of carbon ions.  At a particular filling fraction of the lattice sites, the low-energy excitations of the system are governed by the laws of relativistic quantum mechanics but with an effective speed of light that is orders of magnitude smaller, making the direct observation of relativistic quantum dynamics experimentally feasible.  Phenomena to be studied include Klein tunneling, Veselago lensing, chiral symmetry breaking, and the effect of interactions and disorder on particle mobility.  These phenomena are relevant both for understanding electron transport in graphene and elucidating fundamental predictions of relativistic quantum mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigations of transport (including the role that interactions and disorder play) and mechanisms for opening a bandgap in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice can potentially aid the development of nanoelectronic devices based on graphene such as ultra-high speed transistors and novel electron optics devices. The opening of a bandgap due to interactions will also provide insight into chiral symmetry breaking and mass generation in quantum chromo-dynamics.   In carrying out this research, undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researcher associates will be trained in the use of modern technology, analytical thinking, scientific writing and giving clear oral presentations. This research program will continue to recruit students from demographic groups underrepresented in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed various tools and techniques for studying ultracold Bose and Fermi gases in two-dimensional (2D) honeycomb lattice potentials.  The honeycomb lattice potential is of interest as it has the same crystalline lattice structure as graphene and carbon nanotubes through which electrons move.  However, the study of ultracold atoms in such a system is advantageous as many experimental parameters including the strength and even the sign of interactions between the atoms are readily controllable.  Thus, phenomena normally associated with electron transport in graphene and carbon nanotubes can be systematically and precisely studied in the atomic system.  What is particularly remarkable about the transport properties in these systems is that particles with crystal momenta near the so-called Dirac points in the band structure behave as relativistic Dirac particles in two spatial dimensions.  Thus, phenomena normally associated with relativistic particle physics can strongly influence transport properties.  Specifically, during this research grant, an ultracold gas of fermionic lithium atoms, cooled to near absolute zero temperature, was confined in a 2D lattice potential formed from the interference pattern of three laser beams.  Further, a novel technique was demonstrated for rapidly controlling elastic and inelastic interactions between the atoms.  Such control will permit new methods for probing the many-body state of atoms in the lattice.  A unique honeycomb lattice was implemented that had lattice spacing sufficiently large for individual lattice sites to be spatially resolved.  Though individual atoms have not yet been imaged, as a deep, short-period, pinning lattice is required, a solid-state laser suitable for providing such a pinning lattice was constructed.  A further unique feature of the honeycomb lattice we implemented is that it can be dynamically adjusted to either (1) introduce an energy imbalance between the two triangular sub-lattices that comprise the honeycomb lattice or (2) adiabatically transform the lattice from triangular to honeycomb.  The first case is useful for introducing a controllable energy gap at the Dirac points so that particles with crystal momentum near the Dirac points would behave as massive relativistic particles.  The second case can potentially be used for adiabatic state preparation of low entropy superfluid or anti-ferromagnetic insulator phases in the honeycomb lattice starting from a band insulator in the triangular lattice.  The systems described above were concerned with two-component (i.e. spin-1/2) Fermi gases in the 2D lattice.  However, fermionic lithium gases also permit the study of three state mixtures with strong, attractive interactions between each pairwise combination.  This is of interest since an analog of color superfluidity, predicted to occur for quark matter in neutron stars, can potentially be observed -- with three different Cooper pairs forming.  However, the three-component gas is unstable to molecule formation enhanced by the existence of Efimov trimer molecules near the disassociation threshold.  We provided a high precision measurement of the binding energy and width of the most weakly bound Efimov trimer state which completely determines the stability of the three-component Fermi gas.  This represents the most accurate measurement to date of the three-body parameters for an Efimov state and challenges recently discovered theoretical predictions regarding a universal dependence of the three-body parameters on long-range two-body interactions.  Potentially due to the light mass of lithium, the three-body parameters show a small but statistically significant deviation from this universal prediction.  Finally, we investigated how one could create and study relativistic vortices in a Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a honeycomb lattice.  A BEC confined in a honeycomb lattice can be described by a four component spinor wavefunction which satisfies the Dirac equation provided that the BEC is condensed at the Dirac points.  Further, if the condensate is interacting, the dynamics will be governed by a non-linear Dirac equation.  The non-linear Dirac equation supports a variety of exotic vortices that have long been of interest in relativistic field theory.  We proposed experimental methods to excite various relativistic vortices in a BEC and predicted the lifetime of these vortices showing that they should be sufficiently long to allow for their observation.
