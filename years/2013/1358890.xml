<AbstractNarration>The Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the University of Texas Marine Science Institute (UTMSI) is located at the UT campus in Port Aransas, Texas. The common theme of student research projects is the interplay between natural variability and anthropogenic drivers of change in coastal ecosystems. Specific REU projects to date have focused on pressing research questions that have global implications, including impacts of land use and freshwater demand on coastal nutrient dynamics, effects of oil spills and hydrocarbons on organismal functioning, harmful algal blooms, hypoxia, spatiotemporal community interactions, and population dynamics of mobile macrofauna. South Texas experiences extremes of environmental conditions, making it an excellent natural laboratory for studying coastal dynamics in a changing environment. UTMSI faculty research spans the biological, chemical and physical processes that occur in coastal habitats, and the laboratories and research fleet are well equipped for such studies. The program is designed to raise student awareness of the conduct of science and the importance of coastal change issues, thereby preparing students to make informed decisions about their subsequent career paths. Specific activities provide exposure to the breadth of marine science, increase knowledge of ethical conduct of research, and develop crucial scientific communication skills for targeting both specialist and generalist audiences. This program will support research experiences and career training for a total of forty undergraduates over five years. Co-funding for this program will be provided by the Directorate of Biological Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
