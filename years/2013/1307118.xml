<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Sankaran Thayumanavan of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst will develop methods for assembling organic nanoparticles through polymer self-assembly.  The research will involve three components.  In the first part, the project will focus on the development of organic nanoparticles with well-defined surface characteristics.  In the second part, polymer-nanoparticle complexes will be generated using the well-defined surface functional groups of the nanoparticle and the complementary functional groups present in the polymer.  The final part will involve development of strategies for eliciting fluorescence changes in the polymer-nanoparticle complexes due to the presence of large analyte molecules.   The broader impacts of this project will involve interdisciplinary training of undergraduate and graduate students by cross-training the students not only across the sub-disciplines of chemistry, but also across other scientific disciplines that will see the impacts of this project.  The project will also assist in broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM research via participation in the Northeast Alliance for Graduate Education and Professoriate program.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanotechnology's impact in diverse areas of present day technology starts with the ability to synthesize well-defined nanometer-sized objects (nanoparticles) with well-defined surfaces.  This research project seeks to develop fundamentally new ways of synthesizing functional nanoparticles that can bind with proteins to form complex materials or to generate observable signals.  Such nanoparticles could lead to versatile sensing technologies that could impact biotechnology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The key elements of the project involve polymeric nanoassemblies that can be predictably manipulated in the presence of an external trigger.  The manipulations could involve causing the nanoassembly to releasse guest molecules that otherwise do not interact with its surroundings, or causing the nanoassembly to actuate another process, or exhibit a change in its surface properties.  Such capabilities can impact a variety of applications, including drug delivery, sensing, diagnostics and catalysis.  We have utilized combinations of non-covalent interactions such as electrostatics and dative interactions, in combination with covalent assemblies to generate nanoscale structures that are responsive to specific input signals.  As an illustrative example, we have encapsulated enzymes within nanoassemblies, which causes these catalytic macromolecules to be silenced.  In the presence of a specific stimulus, we were able to reactivate these enzymes, suggesting potential for cryptic catalysis and signal amplification.     This project represents an interdisciplinary approach to developing design guidelines for responsive nanoscale materials at the interface of chemistry, materials, and biology.  Therefore, this project has served to train a diverse workforce.  The diversity in training is not only based on gender and race, but also based on the education level of the students.  In addition to graduate and undergraduate students, high school students were also involved in this project.  Many of these students pursue higher education in sciences or already in the workforce.  Thus this project served as a useful tool to encourage the next generation of advanced workforce.            Last Modified: 12/09/2016       Submitted by: Sankaran Thayumanavan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
