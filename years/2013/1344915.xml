<AbstractNarration>This grant addresses the technical and policy barriers confronted by the semiconductor industry in creating next generation memory devices. The objectives of the grant are to: (I) enable high-volume manufacturing of atomically-precise, defect-free patterns made from synthetic DNA, (II) self-report defects using an in-line optical technique to monitor the quality control of patterns during high-volume production, and (III) create a policy framework that guides public-private collaborations in scalable nanomanufacturing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, solving these industrial challenges will help: (A) validate molecular self-assembly as a cost-effective manufacturing process for scalable nanomanufacturing, (B) establish novel process techniques for scalable nanomanufacturing, (C) overcome critical roadblocks in semiconductor device fabrication at the nanoscale, and (D) address societal implications of the large-scale production and use of DNA as an engineered nanomaterial. The research will also advance the discovery, innovation, and overall knowledge-based prosperity of science and engineering in Idaho, an EPSCoR State.</AbstractNarration>
