<AbstractNarration>This proposal provides support for the 2013 Workshop on the Economics of Information Security (WEIS) and a one-day follow-on workshop. WEIS fosters cross-disciplinary, cross-sector (i.e., academia, industry, nonprofit, and government), and cross-national discussion on information security. The focus on the economics of information security was chosen not only because of its intrinsic importance, but also because of its basis for bringing together social, computer, and information scientists and engineers to share knowledge, information and methods from their respective domains. WEIS covers issues that are core to the NSF's Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, and spans both the Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) and Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE) Directorates within the Foundation. The one-day follow-on workshop focuses on incentive-related issues to cybersecurity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds for this grant are from NSF for student travel support, and via inter-agency transfer from DHS Science &amp; Technology for sponsorship of the follow-on workshop.</AbstractNarration>
