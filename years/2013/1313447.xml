<AbstractNarration>Clusters of galaxies are the largest gravitationally bound objects in the Universe and provide excellent sensitivity for determining cosmological parameters.  In particular, cosmological simulations predict an approximately universal form for cluster dark matter mass profiles.  This project proposes to do a modeling analysis of a sample of galaxy clusters.  This analysis would provide three-dimensional shapes and alignments of the gas and dark matter in these clusters and thus allow for the physical properties of these clusters to be more accurately estimated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will use a three-dimensional triaxial X-ray, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ), and lensing analysis of the 25 clusters in the Cluster Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) sample.  The analysis will exploit the different line-of-sight dependences of the X-ray and SZ signals to constrain the three-dimensional morphologies of the clusters with the ultimate goal of testing predictions of Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmological models in the context of large-scale structure formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educationally, the investigators will make regular classroom visits with primarily low-income, local high school students of diverse backgrounds to inform and inspire these students about science.  In addition, the investigators will sponsor multi-week summer research programs with high school students and teachers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The intellectual merit of our project was directed towards the study of galaxy clusters, which are the largest objects in the universe. We developed an analysis package to simultaneously constrain detailed models of the baryonic and dark matter components of the Hubble CLASH sample of galaxy clusters using state-of-the-art X-ray, millimeter-wave, weak lensing, and strong lensing data. We applied this analysis package to a sub-sample of six CLASH objects, highlighted by the following results. First, using multiple datasets significantly improved the total mass measurements compared to using any single dataset. This result is of importance to the wide range of galaxy cluster studies that are currently limited by uncertainties related to mass determination. In addition, our multi-wavelength analysis was able to place tight constraints on the amount of non-thermal motion present in the gaseous intra-cluster medium. Galaxy cluster growth is expected to result in significant non-thermal motions in the outer cluster regions, but our results place strong upper limits well below the theoretical predictions. While the unique characteristics of the galaxy clusters in our sample may be the primary cause of this result, it does suggest that the theoretical predictions may need to be updated with new physics.
