<AbstractNarration>This AON project will support a comprehensive observationally-based measurement scheme for the Bering Strait, which will combine in situ observations with traditional knowledge from the Bering Strait communities and results from a 4km resolution ice-ocean model, ECCO2 (Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean phase II).  Temperature, salinity and velocity data from the Bering Strait and data products of oceanic fluxes will be measured to meet the needs of numerous scientific, climate and industrial (e.g., oil/gas exploration, shipping) studies in the region. Via a "one-stop" website (with permanent archiving at national archives), the project will provide these data and data products to all interested parties. It will develop a two-way exchange of information with native communities, drawing on results from a separately funded project (led by the native corporation Kawerak, Inc) documenting traditional knowledge of ocean currents and change in the Bering Strait region. Furthermore, bridging the traditional gap between observationalists and modelers, it will undertake a pilot study for future AON observational strategies which must surely combine observations and high quality modeling.  The effort continues and expands upon decades of measurements in the Bering Strait region and constitutes an NSF contribution to the interagency Russian-American Long-term Census of the Arctic (RUSALCA) partnership.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Bering Strait - narrow (about 50 miles wide) and shallow (about 150ft deep) - is the only sea route between the Pacific and the Arctic Oceans.  The waters (Pacific waters) that flow northward through the strait carry vital nutrients for Arctic ecosystems and heat which is partly responsible for the dramatic Arctic sea-ice retreat of recent decades.  In over half the Arctic, the response of the upper (600ft) of the ocean to this ice loss is influenced by the properties (heat and saltiness) of the Pacific inflow.   It is clear that to understand the Arctic, how it is changing, and how that change affects the rest of the world, we need to know how much water moves from the Pacific into the Arctic, what its properties are, and how (and why) both the amount of water and its properties are changing.     The flow is far from constant seasonally and even daily.  Thus since 1990, we have used annually-serviced instrumentation moored to the sea floor within the strait to give us hourly measurements, all year-round,  of  the waters that flow through into the Arctic.  This program, the longest oceanic Arctic measurement record, has found significantly increasing northward flow.      This NSF project supported these measurements from 2014 to 2018, and funded our research to quantify the important properties of the throughflow, and their impacts on the Arctic and beyond. We have found the flow has continued to increase and to warm and to become fresher (Woodgate, et al., 2015; Woodgate 2018).   - The increased flow means that the time taken for waters to cross from the Bering Strait into the Arctic has reduced from 7.5 months in 2001 to 4.5 months in 2014, a dramatic change for the rich ecosystems of the region.  - The increased temperatures drive earlier sea ice retreat.  With collaborators, we have shown that the oceanic heat coming through the strait is the best predictor of sea ice retreat date in the region (Serreze et al., 2019). Earlier sea ice retreat impacts the peoples who live in the area (as earlier ice loss means spring storms can erode more of the coastline) and is important for shipping through the Arctic.   - The freshening of the waters in the strait likely influences where Pacific water (and its nutrients and heat) end up in the Arctic, and can also affect ocean circulation as far as the Atlantic.   With other studies from around the Arctic, we have shown this is the only oceanic gateway to the Arctic Ocean which is showing significant change (Osterhus et al., 2019).     Our research has also provided the first real progress in 60 years towards the question of what drives the flow through the Bering Strait.  With colleagues, we considered how the flow is driven by storms south of the strait (Danielson et al., 2014).  By comparing relationships between our measurements in the strait and satellite measurements of sea levels in the northern Pacific and the Arctic, we discovered that westward winds within the Arctic could draw water northward though the strait (Peralta-Ferriz and Woodgate, 2017).  This study suggested that, contrary to the long accepted view that the flow was driven from the south, the Arctic to the north is the primary driver of changes in the flow.  With state-of-the-art global ocean modeling we confirmed this (Nguyen et al., 2020) and quantified the influence of winds in different regions of the northern hemisphere on the Bering Strait flow.  Questions still remain about the average flow, but our use of modern tools (data and models) has made large advances in understanding of the important drivers of change in this region.     We have  worked with others, studying relationships between Fin Whales in the region and changing water properties (Escajeda et al, 2020), and considered the role of the flow through the strait on juvenile fish in the area (Levine et al., 2020).  The latter study suggests the Bering Strait flow is the primary driver of interannual variability in fish population in the area.      Our work has trained University of Washington (UW) graduate students in the study of the physics of the ocean, including a Master?s degree for a USCG officer (Morris, 2019).  Woodgate teaches UW undergraduate students about Arctic Change, and ?everything everyone should know about the Arctic in our world today?.  Peralta-Ferriz has developed a ?4-year journey in science? program to convey the importance of the Arctic and the reality of a career in science to diverse (culturally and economically) schools with large populations of Hispanic heritage.  Through an annual weekend dedicated to Polar Science at Seattle?s main science museum, we bring the excitement of Arctic oceanography to the general public and school parties, and have shared knowledge with local community meetings in Alaska and at national and international climate events.
