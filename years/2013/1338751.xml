<AbstractNarration>The Northeast Ethics Education Partnership (NEEP) program, managed by Brown University's Center for Environmental Studies, provides training to graduate students in research ethics, cultural relativity, and community-based approaches.  NEEP offers this training through semester-long courses and student/faculty mentoring, as well as through an extensive training database of slide presentations on 30 topics in research ethics, cultural competence and community-based research.  Through this award, the project team is expanding NEEP training from its current partnership (Brown University and SUNY-ESF) to include Northeastern University and UMASS-Dartmouth.  One goal of this expansion is to conduct short/long courses with their engineering schools, and environmental studies and marine science departments. National dissemination of the NEEP website training materials is being promoted and a research survey to identify research ethical/cultural relativity issues of concern in environmental field research is being conducted with environmental studies researchers,  environmental anthropologists/sociologists and engineers. Ethics training is being provided to a diverse community of minority and underserved students and women scientists through the large, racially-diverse populations being served by UMASS and Northeastern University programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A.     Successful Completion of the NEEP Survey on Using Ethical Principles in Environmental Field Research with Place-based Communities   NEEP successfully designed a survey on the use of bioethical principles for groups/communities in environmental field research; recruited 73- 189 respondents for filling out survey questions, compiled, analyzed and reported these findings in an upcoming publication, NEEP Survey on Using Ethical Principles in Environmental Field Research with Place-based Communities.   The survey provides a training tool for graduate students with a compilation of field evidence for using bioethical principles in a field practice with place-based communities across the world. The exploratory survey provides baseline data for the development of curriculum resources for training graduate students in the ethical challenges of environmental field research. It identifies many  training topics that can be developed into the writing of field reports, written/video narratives, and potential textbooks and applied bioethics perspectives/deliberation on field research challenges.     B.     Course Development and Implementation of Research Ethics/Integrity,  Cultural Competence and Community-based Approaches with Graduate/Undergraduate Students in Marine Sciences and Engineering at Several Universities   NEEP recruited Northeastern University?s Marine and Environmental Sciences (MES) and its College of Engineering to develop more ethics training opportunities for students. Also, we recruited UMASS-Dartmouth?s Bioengineering Dept. and School for Marine Science and Technology (SMAST) for new course development in engineering and marine science ethics.  At UMASS-Dartmouth, new courses were developed and taught with Ethics for Engineers for three years (2014, 2015, 2016) (one credit blended course) and Marine Science Policy and Ethics (2014 , 2015, winter 2015) (three credits blended for 2014, 2015). 55 students total completed these courses.  With NEU-MES, NEEP developed Marine Science Ethics and Policy (three credits, in-classroom) taught by NEEP PI, Prof. Quigley, for two semesters, Spring 2016, Spring 2017, (12 students completed training). NEEP supported the development of another 3 credit course at the NEU Three Seas Program, for Ocean and Coastal Sustainability, which contained NEEP ethics training materials and promoted ethical approaches to marine science research being taught by Prof. Quigley, for three semesters (Fall 2016, Spring 2017, 37 students , in-classroom course, with  upcoming Fall 2017 course scheduled). Self-paced Blackboard and Canvas course sites were developed and implemented at NEU and Brown University for 35 students combined.  C.     Successful Dissemination of Research Ethics/Cultural Competence Training Materials through NEEP National/International Website and New Development of Marine Ethics Training Slides      NEEP?s national and international website has been available to the public for course syllabi for all NEEP-developed courses; annotated bibliographies on research ethics, cultural competence and community-based research topics and 30 PowerPoint training slide shows that provide academic teaching resources to environmental studies and other academic departments/non-profit organizations (300 users downloaded these). NEEP employed 12 graduate research assistants from Brown University, SUNY-ESF, NEU and UMASS-Dartmouth in this grant period to help with materials development/dissemination, survey recruitment/data analysis and with evaluation analysis.
