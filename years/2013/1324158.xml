<AbstractNarration>One of social science's greatest theoretical puzzles is "What factors lead individuals to join together collectively to protect a public good, when all face temptations to act opportunistically?"  We examine this question in a study of poor, rural, indigenous communities to understand how they overcome socioeconomic and geographic barriers to launch new forms of social movements relying on Western science and international collaboration.  In contrast to arguments that environmental issues concern only the relatively affluent, we argue that immediate threats to community livelihoods may provide material incentives for poor communities to come together to mitigate environmental impacts.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project evaluates determinants of collective action at the individual, community, and transnational levels through analysis of survey, interview, and archival data.  Understanding changes in indigenous movement strategies - from confrontation to cooperation with government authorities and scientists - should help communities and policymakers better cope with environmental threats.  The project will also help us understand how indigenous leaders draw attention to scarcities they face, while using the climate change frame to help pressure international organizations and governments regarding one of the most vital issues of our time.  The project explains how small and apparently powerless groups largely outside of the Western system of justice can leverage judicial institutions to challenge powerful global energy interests.  Finally, the project will train graduate students and disseminate findings among academics and practitioners.</AbstractNarration>

But the source of  their enthusiasm for environmental protection is more complex than mere  ascriptive traits or whether they speak native languages. What&rsquo;s more,  in a development that should be worrying to environmentalists, exposure  to the negative effects of extractive industries appears to have a  degrading effect on that enthusiasm.&nbsp; We address this below, in a report taken mostly from a blog written to translate the findings into broader terms for the Wilson Center's New Security Blog  (https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2017/03/ecuador-indigenous-environmental-attitudes-affected-proximity-oil-extraction/).</p> <p>Beginning  in 2014, we conducted a 1,740-person nationwide survey in Ecuador with  the aim of understanding why some respondents prioritize environmental  protection while others do not.

Much of this report was blogged at the Wilson Center's New Security Blog (https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2017/03/ecuador-indigenous-environmental-attitudes-affected-proximity-oil-extraction/).</p> <p>In  the first of the two articles specifically referenced above and already published, we found that Ecuador&rsquo;s indigenous people in the  southern Amazon region feel more strongly about environmental protection  than those in the country&rsquo;s northern Amazon region. This may be partly  explained by their proximity to oil drilling and a grueling history of  resistance and setbacks.</p> <p>Indigenous groups in the north live on  the nation&rsquo;s extractive frontier. In 2013, oil spills and resulting  public health risks in the area prompted communities to pursue a  landmark legal case against Chevron (formerly Texaco).

The  Kichwa cosmovison contributes to indigenous support for efforts to  combat climate change, acting as a compliment to Western scientific  arguments, we found in our second analysis, in <a href="http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/GLEP_a_00389"><em>Global Environmental Politics</em></a>.</div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>CONAIE National President Jorge  Herrera, a Kichwa resident from Ecuador&rsquo;s central mountains, said the  Ecuadorian government&rsquo;s clientelist manipulation &ndash; giving resources to  some while depriving them from others &ndash; focused residents&rsquo; interests on  materialism and away from the <em>Buen Vivir</em> sacred bond.&nbsp; Indigenous activists interviewed argued that concern for the  environment had not diminished in post-extraction areas.  Rather, the survey had picked up their demoralized attitudes concerning  public health risks, economic hardship, and migration. &nbsp;</p> <p>These  results argue two points.

"Where the environment is destroyed, our  identity is destroyed, as this interrupts the relationship between  nature and our people," said Romulo Akachu, vice president of Ecuador?s  national indigenous federation, called CONAIE, and representative of the  Shuar Nation, where there is currently no oil drilling.  These findings imply that mobilizations for popular support of environmental protections may have better success before widespread degradation and contamination from oil drilling.

In addition to generating several articles and a book manuscript (under review at Oxford University Press), the findings have generated further questions on extractivism and environmental protection, for which Eisenstadt and two other researchers have submitted a subsequent NSF proposal.
