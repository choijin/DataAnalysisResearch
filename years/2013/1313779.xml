<AbstractNarration>The NMC 2013 Workshop will disseminate international research and catalyze innovation in micro and nanotechnology for chemical, biological and physical applications with long term benefit for homeland security and health to materials research for computing and energy systems. The Workshop will provide a forum for discussing results, techniques, and devices while simultaneously promoting commercialization in the field. This Workshop will allow attendees to network within the multidisciplinary nanomechanical sensing community including electrical and mechanical engineers as well as chemists, physicists, and material scientists. Additionally, this forum will address the needs for commercialization of novel technologies and standardization through the interaction with entrepreneurial specialists, industry members, and NIST. The Workshop is open to both U.S. and international attendees.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Through the 3-day program of sessions and social events, the Nanomechanical Sensing Conference (NMC) successfully promoted interaction among researchers in the micro and nano sensing and device community who are interested in addressing some of the high-impact issues in chemical, biological and physical detection e.g. with applications from homeland security and health to materials research for computing and energy systems. The conference participants hailed from major universities and research facilities throughout the United States and the world. The registered Workshop attendance of 223 participants included 75 postdocs and students, 162 attendees hailed from North America (153 U.S., 9 Canada), 45 from Europe and 16 from Asia. At least one author per accepted contributed paper attended. Many of the contributed papers had student or postdoctoral trainee authors in attendance.      Students and postdoctoral associates are the future of this economically and scientifically vital field, and the interdisciplinary connections fostered by this Workshop are the basis for the fieldÆs future progress. This NSF travel grant provided registration fees for 36 U.S. graduate students and postdoctoral associates to attend all days and events of the NMC meeting.   Intellectual Merit: The NMC 2013 Workshop disseminated international research and catalyzed innovation in micro and nanotechnology for chemical, biological and physical applications with long term benefit for homeland security and health to materials research for computing and energy systems. The Workshop provided a forum for discussing results, techniques, and devices while simultaneously promoting commercialization in the field. This Workshop also allowed attendees to network within the multidisciplinary nanomechanical sensing community including electrical and mechanical engineers as well as chemists, physicists, and material scientists. Additionally, this forum addressed the needs for commercialization of novel technologies and standardization through the interaction with entrepreneurial specialists, industry members, and NIST.   Broader Impact: The WorkshopÆs topics addressed topics having broader impact, e.g., advances in micro and nano-enabled technologies offer significant potential for monitoring water, air, and food quality, improved biomedical detection, and fundamental studies of materials  to enable next generation computing and energy storage and production,  all key topics for the future for the U.S. and internationally.  Attendance by young researchers at this meeting has positioned them to  contribute to this vital, highly interdisciplinary field.
