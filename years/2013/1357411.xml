<AbstractNarration>Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) is optically measured material in the oceans resulting from the degradation of organic matter. While the importance of CDOM in the optical properties and biogeochemistry of marine waters has been well established over the last several decades, the source and structure of this material within the ocean basins remains unclear. Some studies indicate that CDOM is produced primarily in situ from either the chemical or biological processing of marine materials, while others have provided evidence that CDOM is primarily a remnant of terrestrial matter that has been diluted and modified during transit to and within the oceans. In this study, researchers from the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Studies will use complete spectral absorption and emission properties combined with chemical and mass spectral tests on samples from the North Pacific Ocean to determine the source and structure of CDOM. The results will be compared with those previously acquired, or to be acquired, from the Delaware Bay, the Middle Atlantic Bight, and the Equatorial Atlantic. By employing this multifaceted approach, the researchers will significantly advance our knowledge of CDOM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project will provide support for graduate and undergraduate student training, and results will be broadly disseminated through peer-reviewed research publications and presentations at national meetings, where student-led presentations will be emphasized.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of this project was to better understand the source(s) and the structural origin(s) of the optical properties of marine chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) within the ocean basins, focusing on North Pacific waters (Station Aloha).    The importance of CDOM to environmental and biogeochemical processes is widely recognized. However, the source of CDOM and structural origins of its optical properties are still highly debated for offshore marine waters. While some authors have proposed in situ production of CDOM from marine dissolved or particulate organic matter for offshore marine locales based on correlations between absorption or fluorescence (at a few wavelengths) and apparent oxygen utilization (AOU) without additional chemical tests of structure or sources, others have suggested that offshore marine waters contain a significant "humic-like" terrestrial component based on complete optical measurements and chemical tests.  Our prior work in the Equatorial Atlantic Ocean (EAO) which combined acquisition of complete absorption and emission spectra with additional chemical tests (C18 extraction and borohydride reduction), provided strong evidence for a major terrestrial CDOM component that absorbs in the UV and visible but emits in the visible, along with marine CDOM components that absorb and emit primarily in the UV. In this project, the EOA work was extended to the North Pacific Ocean (NPO) (Station ALOHA) to probe very different water masses and examine how the CDOM might vary with water mass origin in particular the North Pacific Intermediate Waters, where past studies have provided potentially conflicting evidence concerning the possible source of the CDOM, ie. terrestrial vs. marine in situ production. As in the EAO, our results suggest the presence of a substantial terrestrial "humic-like" component throughout the water column, along with structurally-dissimilar marine CDOM components that primarily absorb and emit in the ultraviolet.  To gain further information on the molecular composition of DOM, high resolution mass spectra obtained with electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR MS) of untreated and reduced DOM from the EAO and NPO were compared to those of riverine and coastal waters from the Middle Atlantic Bight (MAB) and to reference material from IHSS (SRFA and PLFA).
