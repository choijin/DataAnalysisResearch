<AbstractNarration>Technical description of the project&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  This project addresses certain basic aspects of the electroweak and&lt;br/&gt;  strong interactions reflected in the properties of mesons and&lt;br/&gt;  nucleons (particles found inside atomic nuclei) and their&lt;br/&gt;  interactions at low energies.  The strong and weak interactions are&lt;br/&gt;  responsible for the structure of matter at the smallest known&lt;br/&gt;  scale, a femtometer (size of the hydrogen atom nucleus) or less.&lt;br/&gt;  The research is motivated by the fact that the present&lt;br/&gt;  comprehensive theory -- the Standard Model (SM) -- is known to be&lt;br/&gt;  incomplete.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  The rare "pi(e2)" decay of the pi-meson (pion) into an electron and&lt;br/&gt;  a neutrino, occurring once in about 10,000 ordinary pion decays,&lt;br/&gt;  provides a theoretically extraordinarily clean window to certain&lt;br/&gt;  possible extensions of the SM, at a very large mass scale not&lt;br/&gt;  directly accessible at any existing or planned accelerators.  The&lt;br/&gt;  PEN experiment, with measurements carried out at the Paul Scherrer&lt;br/&gt;  Institute (PSI), Switzerland, by an international collaboration of&lt;br/&gt;  7 institutions led by the University of Virginia (UVa) group, aims&lt;br/&gt;  to improve the current pi(e2) branching ratio result by about an&lt;br/&gt;  order of magnitude.  The data analysis is planned to be largely&lt;br/&gt;  completed during the current 3-year award period.  Plans for a&lt;br/&gt;  possible follow-up measurement will be evaluated at that time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  A new project of precise measurement of neutron beta decay&lt;br/&gt;  parameters has been initiated at the Spallation Neutron Source&lt;br/&gt;  (SNS) at the Oak Ridge National Lab, TN.  The first phase, Nab,&lt;br/&gt;  will focus on a precise measurement of the electron-neutrino&lt;br/&gt;  correlation parameter "a" and Fierz interference term, "b."  Nab&lt;br/&gt;  should contribute (along with improved neutron lifetime&lt;br/&gt;  measurements) to a final resolution of a longstanding problem in&lt;br/&gt;  the determination of the ratio of axial and vector nucleon form&lt;br/&gt;  factors, G_A/G_V, and a nuclear model independent determination of&lt;br/&gt;  the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa u-d quark mixing.  Through their&lt;br/&gt;  precision, these experiments will explore interesting possible&lt;br/&gt;  extensions to the SM.  It is planned that during the current 3-year&lt;br/&gt;  award period, Nab apparatus will be constructed and initially&lt;br/&gt;  tested.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  As the work on PEN concludes, the group will tranisition to the&lt;br/&gt;  Muon g-2 experiment (E989) at Fermilab.  The UVa group has&lt;br/&gt;  contributed to the detector design through Monte Carlo simulations,&lt;br/&gt;  is leading the Calorimeter Bias Voltage (CBV) project, and plans to&lt;br/&gt;  play a significant role in the data analysis.  The CBV system is&lt;br/&gt;  planned to be completed during the 3-year award period, with&lt;br/&gt;  instrument installation to follow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Broader significance and impact of the project&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  Common to PEN, Nab and Muon g-2, the three main experiments in this&lt;br/&gt;  research project, is the search for signals of new physics, not&lt;br/&gt;  included in the Standard Model of particles and fields.  Each uses&lt;br/&gt;  its unique sensitivities to probe a hitherto unexplored region of&lt;br/&gt;  fundamental physics, and in doing so contributes to the overall&lt;br/&gt;  advancement of understanding of our universe at the most basic&lt;br/&gt;  level.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  In addition to the basic science impact, there is the impact on&lt;br/&gt;  education of young scientists: a number of undergraduate and&lt;br/&gt;  graduate students have gained, and will continue to gain state of&lt;br/&gt;  the art training in research.  Seven PhD and one MS degrees were&lt;br/&gt;  earned on this project during the past decade at UVa alone; a dozen&lt;br/&gt;  or more undergraduate students got extensive hands-on research&lt;br/&gt;  training, and have gone on to engaging careers.  Several of these&lt;br/&gt;  students have been members of underrepresented groups in science&lt;br/&gt;  (women and minorities).</AbstractNarration>

Design, construction and testing of a prototype Bias Voltage System for the SiPM photodetectors in Fermilab experiment E989 has been completed.  A final design has been chosen and implemented.  E989, the Muon (g-2) experiment, aims to measure "g &ndash; 2",the gyromagnetic ratio of the muon to the precision of ~150 ppb.  This represents one of the most stringent and sensitive tests of the predictions of the SM, and its possible extensions.
