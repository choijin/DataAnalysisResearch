<AbstractNarration>This project develops a comprehensive Bayesian methodology for mathematical modeling, which integrates across diverse data types, accounts for model uncertainty, and incorporates existing prior knowledge about the biological system.  The Bayesian models integrate two well-established modeling paradigms: (1) deterministic mathematical models of cellular metabolism and (2) causal graphical models of phenotypes and genotypes.  These modeling paradigms are widely used, but suffer major limitations: deterministic models do not reflect the individual variation in fluxes that result from allelic variation of enzymes, and graphical modeling techniques currently ignore all prior information about the biochemical pathway.  This project overcomes these limitations by incorporating diverse forms of data and variables, which span the genome, transcriptome, metabolome, and clinical phenotypes.  Applications focus on genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of breast and skin cancer cell metabolism to search out novel molecular targeted therapies, side-effects, and unravel the complex mechanisms underlying the disease.  The methodology will be implemented in a publicly available software package, which is designed for users with a minimal background in mathematics and statistics.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Understanding how genetics influences metabolic and regulatory function is important for the prevention and treatment of disease.  Genetics explains in part why some people are more responsive to drug treatments, while others have no response or may experience deadly side effects.  Advances in high-throughput phenotyping technologies have made large-scale measurements of molecular traits possible.  Mathematical models are widely used to elucidate networks of molecular traits from high-throughput data, and have become important tools for systems biology.  Despite this progress, integrating diverse types of data remains a major challenge that has limited our ability to take full advantage of the wealth of post-genomics data for knowledge and discovery.  This project addresses this challenge and represents a bold new direction in systems biology, which can be generalized to model different biological systems.  A broader impact of this project is the software development, which aims to bridge the gap between computational and experimental biology by putting accessible tools in the hands of the biologist.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has led to advances in the general area of complex networks of biological systems.  Networks have been widely as a computational/analytical approach to modeling biological systems, and have even been used to perform computational "experiments" such as network perturbations (e.g., different diets, exercise, and drug treatments).   There are several limitations that arise from the modeling assumptions required, especially when the network inferred has directed edges. This award addressed a major limitation that arises from the interpretation of network structures. Specifically, we found that the structural information in the network represents a very premature, and often misleading, endpoint to the network analyses. With the support of this award, we have extended this endpoint, and examined the unexplored problem of predicting the system-wide response network perturbations.  The approach developed does rely solely on network structure, but instead utilizes probabilistic reasoning to predict characteristics and responses of the biological variables in the network under perturbation. Recasting genotype-phenotype networks as computational predictive model represents a completely new direction in this field. The predictive capabilities have important implications for model interpretation, hypotheses generation and the design of future experiments. This project also led methodology development in networks that are undirected and large scale. Novel methods for the detection of ?clusters? (aka modules or communities) in a network were developed.  These networks have nodes with attributes (e.g., clinical or omics data).  The methods developed with this award borrow fundamental ideas from the area of social networks that concern concepts of homophily (birds of a feather flock together). Applications of novel methodologies have been used for protein-protein interaction networks, metabolic pathways and gene networks.  The broader impacts include the development of three software packages to support the network analysis developed in this project. The packages "BayesNetBP", "geneNetBP" and "wfg" have been developed as open-source and are available on the Comprehensive R Archive (CRAN). Open source software development will enable investigators to utilize our methods in their own applications, and provide flexibility to further build on these techniques.
