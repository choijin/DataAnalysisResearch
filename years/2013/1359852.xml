<AbstractNarration>Soil erosion remains the principal cause of soil degradation worldwide, and soil loss continues to be a critical concern for the sustainable management of agricultural resources.  Furthermore, off-site sedimentation from upland sources severely affects water quality and ecology.  Areas of intense, localized erosion, such as rills and gullies, often are the primary cause of soil loss and are the dominant source of sediment removed from these landscapes.  This collaborative research project will examine the fundamental mechanics of soil erosion and landscape degradation by rill development.  The investigators also will analyze the fundamental topographic organization and evolution of these systems under laboratory and natural conditions.  The project will enhance basic understanding of the fundamental mechanics of soil erosion and landscape degradation by rill development as well as the fundamental topographic organization.  The project will increase the recognition and understanding of geopatterns and the initiation, development, and evolution of surface water drainage networks at various time and space scales.  The project will improve capabilities for predicting soil loss before any erosion takes place, which will help improve watershed and agricultural-management tools, thereby reducing the further degradation of soil resources in the U.S. and elsewhere.  The project also will provide special education and training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will combine laboratory, analytic, and field investigation to focus on the emergence, evolution, and resiliency of rill networks on soil-mantled landscapes at the field-plot scale.  The investigators hypothesize that rill networks display rapid pattern-emergent characteristics and long-term resiliency on hillslopes and that the location, organization, and dimensions of these rills can be predicted before any erosion takes place.  Full-scale soil erosion experiments will be conducted during which terrain analysis will be combined with state-of-the-art physical models and analytical formulations for soil erosion processes.  The theoretical framework and terrain analysis tools developed in the experimental landscape then will be applied to a field experiment, where erosion plots will be created to replicate the in-house experiments and monitored over time.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Soil erosion is the principal cause of soil degradation in agricultural watersheds in the U.S. and the impacts of sedimentation can severely affect downstream water quality, ecology, and ecological habitat.  This study performed field and laboratory experiments to identify soil and landscape degradation before it occurs and to disaggregate soil erosion into distinct geomorphic regimes.  Indoor and outdoor experimental landscapes were packed with soil and subjected to simulated and natural rain, which caused rill networks to form and evolve in time and space.  Methods were developed to capture the evolution of these key landscape features using photogrammetric and laser-based technologies with unprecedented resolution.  These same methods were employed to objectively determine the variation in gully width during active erosion, thereby increasing the accuracy and frequency of these measurements.  As rills grew and evolved in another indoor experiment, the ratio of rill basin length-to-width remained constant (self-similar), but the location of the rill networks were strongly conditioned by surface drainage patterns prior to any significant soil erosion, which were accurately delineated through terrain analysis.  Temporal and spatial variations of erosional regimes were estimated using novel topographic analyses and clustering algorithms applied to an indoor experiment to identify the dominant erosion regimes during landscape evolution: raindrop impact, sheetflow, rill, and gully.  These results showed that erosion regimes varied in areal coverage and relative erosion rate during the experiment, and that sheetflow and rill erosion regimes dominated the contributions to total soil loss from the degrading landscape.  Efforts also focused on using impinging jets to assess the erodibility of soils, which showed that these jet-induced erosive forces are highly sensitive to the boundary conditions of the experimental apparatus employed.  These collective efforts improved the fundamental understanding of erosion processes on soil-mantled landscapes and have developed improved remote sensing methodologies for soil erosion measurement and monitoring.  On-going collaborations with the U.S. Department of Agriculture are seeking to improve the accuracy and utility of soil erosion prediction technology for improved natural resource management nationwide.
