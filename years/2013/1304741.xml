<AbstractNarration>Laser-driven collisions of electrons and atoms--so-called "recollisions"-- are a key process in ultrastrong lasers. Understanding their role in various laser field configurations is potentially very rewarding for tracking the motion of giant molecules by taking their snapshots in real time. A mechanism which accounts for the rich physics in these strong laser fields is urgently needed. In particular, the impact of recolliding electrons "hitching rides" on special orbits on their way to and from the atom will be researched using mechanical models.        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mechanical treatments of atoms are the perfect physics education and training tool because they allow many atomic properties to be understood pictorially and with comparatively little effort. In addition to graduate student training,  undergraduate research projects on classical dynamics will be a component of this research program, as will advising mathematics and science teachers at high schools and technical colleges on pedagogical aspects of atoms. This research is often viewed as a valuable source for applications by mathematicians, and a source of new insights by chemists and therefore serves to strengthen the research infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Imagine all the insights into disease prevention and treatment if we could take snapshots of biomolecules moving in real time! Realizing this dream will require unprecedented new light sources, and the laser physics community is hard at work on these sources.  They find that the best way to construct such sources is to first remove electrons from molecules using ultrastrong, ultrashort laser pulses, then energize them using lasers and finally hurl the energetic electrons onto their parent molecules. The hitch is that most of these electrons drift far from their parent molecules in a strong laser field and are therefore lost to us.  However, a few --very few-- find their way back to their parent molecule, and bring with them the energy they absorbed from the laser, and thereby become sources of energy for the light sources physicists are after.  That's why predicting which ionized electrons will return to their parent molecule and which will not matters greatly.  These researchers  are in a position to do just that thanks to their work of the last six years which shows, very surprisingly,  that resonances of the molecule-field system, determine the conditions that will lead to a ``recollision'', which is shorthand for these rare, but significant return processes.
