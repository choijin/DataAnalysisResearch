<AbstractNarration>This project addresses the national need to increase the preparation of US citizens, especially groups underrepresented in STEM, for jobs in the biotechnology industry and academia. Local workforce needs are addressed by focusing on biotechnology, one of the growing industries in northern Alabama.  The goal of the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) - Hudson Alpha Outreach Partnership (UHOP) program is to improve recruitment, retention and graduation rates of academically-talented, financially-needy undergraduate students interested in careers in biotechnology by providing them with financial support, mentorships, experiential activities, and undergraduate biotechnology research opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UHOP partnership will provide students with a traditional academic-based curriculum enhanced by a practical industrial based component. The project is expected to influence student academic aspiration, motivation and career success and to provide a ready workforce for fostering the local and state-wide biotechnology industry. This program, combined with an existing Joint Undergraduate Master's Program, is designed to motivate students to complete a master's degree, leading to increased employment and higher salary opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evaluation of the UHOP program will be performed by an external evaluator.  Components of the evaluation plan include comparing retention, academic performance, and graduation rates of UHOP scholars with those of other majors.  Student success after graduation will be tracked and evaluated using using social media such as Facebook. An external review board composed of educators within and external to UAH and Hudson Alpha provides recommendations for the UHOP program on an ongoing basis.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Our NSF UHOP project (UAH HudsonAlpha Outreach Program) addressed a problem that often puts students in academic trouble before the end of their first year, that is&nbsp; the need to work while attending classes to pay for school. Tuition and housing costs along with increasing textbook prices can result in some students working 40 hours per week while trying to take a full load of classes. This is not sustainable and typically results in subpar grades. Thus, we set out to identify students who were interested in careers in biology and especially biotechnology who had good grades and academic potential, but who were not receiving sufficient scholarship or grant support to cover all their first year expenses. Over the course of 5 years we were able to provide scholarships for 48 students to assist with tuition, housing and/or books for their freshman year. &nbsp;While all freshman classes have some students who leave, drop out for academic reasons or change majors, the students in our program persisted into their sophomore year at percentages higher than the general population with strong grade point averages. During their sophomore year nearly all the students in the program took two courses aimed at giving them an understanding of and experience in biological research.&nbsp; These courses served to enhance their desire to continue towards a career in biotechnology and to give them the confidence that they could succeed.&nbsp; The retention rate from their sophomore year into their junior year was well above that for the general university population and for all biology majors here. &nbsp;Many of the students then pursued research projects with faculty to further their experiences. Presently, of the 19 students who persisted from the total of the first two cohorts of 25 students, all 19 will have graduated by the end of 2020!

Our preliminary data indicates that the activities and experiences that students had in our program are ways to help fill that need.
