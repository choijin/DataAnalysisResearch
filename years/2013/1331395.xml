<AbstractNarration>Program Director's Recommendation &lt;br/&gt;Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR) &lt;br/&gt;Proposal #1332046, 1332118, 1331395 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding for the Center for Identification Technology Research (CITeR) located at Clarkson University, West Virginia University, and the University of Arizona. Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 11-570. The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this Fundamental Research proposal the PIs will explore the migration of biometric applications into a Cloud Computing environment. Using existing cloud hardware and software infrastructure at participating Universities, the PIs will design and demonstrate a multi-university, multi-domain, multi-dataset virtual biometric cloud - BioCloud. The PIs plan to analyze access control, privacy protection and data sharing policies and techniques. Selected solutions will then be used to develop the BioCloud prototype that will support Biometric Software (Identification) as a Service (B-SaaS), Biometric Data as a Service (B-DaaS), and Biometric Platform as a Service (B-PaaS). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this proposed work, the PIs will develop the catalog of requirements, futures and constraints that must be addressed in identity management applications. Verifiable protection policies and techniques that guard personally identifiable information in pervasive next generation government and commercial identity management cloud-based applications are the prerequisite for the improved public trust, which in turn allows for sustainable protection of security and civil liberties. The project will further improve the industry/ university collaboration in the field of biometrics, thus increasing the chances of speedy transition of best research ideas into practice. Undergraduate and graduate students will be included in the research and prototyping. BioCloud will create a platform for innovative undergraduate and graduate school projects at the three participating universities. Special attention will be given to the recruitment of minorities and students from traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM fields</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to conduct basic research to determine how to best create a cloud-hosted database to collect and manage multimodal biometric data from multiple research centers. Cloud computing is bringing about a fundamental shift in the way modern organizations deploy services, access and share information, and conceptualize their IT infrastructure. It is inevitable that cloud technology will also facilitate more cost-effective high performance computing for research while simultaneously enabling centralized management of data for researchers around the globe. This approach for managing data also provides significant benefits for stakeholders and projects that span multiple universities by facilitating collaboration and cross-validation thus helping to advance research more quickly.  Further, this approach promotes the development of standards for representing different types of research data, leading to studies that are easier to replicate and validate. Collaboration efforts across research teams will also facilitate more effective fusion of datasets from multiple sensors into standard representations, easing follow up studies and meta-analysis.    There are, however, challenges to deploying scientific data into a cloud environment, including data access and ownership issues, converging on standard data formats, identifying appropriate hardware and software platforms and determining what types of data sets are best suited to this type of storage, data sharing and analysis. In this research we take initial steps to answer some of these questions in order to facilitate a future of collaborative, cloud-based research in our CITeR Federated Biometric Portal and Cloud (Figure 1).   [Insert Figure 1: Conceptual design of CITeR BioCloud]   This research project is a collaboration between The University of Arizona, West Virginia University and Clarkson University. Each partner has contributed from their unique skillset to bring this project to fruition. West Virginia University has allocated existing commodity hardware resources to construct a proof of concept cloud infrastructure. Additionally, their research has integrated Java wrappers for MatLab to facilitate the use of MatLab for analysis in a Hadoop environment. ClarksonÆs research has adapted and ported their existing iris recognition processes and algorithms to IntelÆs Single-chip Cloud Computer (SCC) platform, demonstrating an advantageous performance/power relationship (Figure 2).   [Insert Figure 2: Power/performance relationship with Intel SSC platform]   The University of Arizona has worked to create data standards for biometric cloud datasets and has integrated existing datasets consisting of multiple streams of hard biometrics, soft biometrics, self-report data and survey measures. Leveraging a recent CITeR sponsored research project &ndash; a mock data-theft experiment with over 100 participants &ndash; biometric data including fingerprints, voice, kinesics, eye tracking, pupil dilation, blinks, eye saccades, mouse movement and typing behavior have been entered into the BioCloud system. Integration of a real and useful dataset demonstrates the efficacy of a cloud-based biometrics data management platform.  Overall the findings of this project to date include:  &bull; There is significant potential benefit to researchers, government entities, and the general public in finding better ways to facilitate collaborative research via a cloud-based environment.  &bull; It is feasible to port many existing analysis tools and techniques into a cloud environment, which presents favorable power and performance for data coding and analysis.  &bull; Existing data sets may be incorporated into such an environment, potentially bringing new life into and deriving greater value from data collections that have already been completed.
