<AbstractNarration>The theory of Antagonistic Pleiotropy postulates that aging is a consequence of inverse correlation between age and selection pressure. Under this theory, positive selection of mechanisms with early-life beneficial effects occurs, in spite of late-life detrimental effects. Understanding when and how such mechanisms become detrimental is crucial for understanding the principles directing the evolution of aging and the aging process itself.  However, our understanding of the molecular underpinnings of antagonistic pleiotropy is lacking. This award will support investigation of a novel mechanism involving the conserved C. elegans JNK protein homolog KGB-I to provide relevant information about the molecular mechanisms of antagonistic pleiotropy and aging.  KGB-1 provides protection against heavy metals and protein folding stress during development but reverses its contribution and becomes detrimental during early adulthood, sensitizing animals to stress and shortening their lifespan. The project seeks to understand what causes the switch in KGB-1's effect and the general implications of the switch for aging. The project aims will be achieved by dissecting, genetically and biochemically, age-dependent interactions of KGB-1. Specific studies will be conducted to: 1) Characterize age-dependent and tissue-specific interactions between KGB-1 and other proteins; 2) Examine contribution of genes induced in a KGB-1-, and age-dependent manner to downstream phenotypes; 3) Identify proteins physically interacting with KGB-1 in different ages to characterize shifts in KGB-1's network of interactions. Mutant, RNAi knock-down animals, or transgenic strains will be used in these studies to examine genetic and physical interactions between KGB-1 and its mediators. Additional strains will be used to characterize tissue specificity in the contribution of KGB-1 to stress-resistance phenotypes and in its interactions with its mediators.  The research will provide information on a fundamental feature of the evolution of aging and provide a better understanding of the aging process itself.  Undergraduate and graduate students, including individuals from underrepresented groups, will be trained in scientific research, participate in research and scientific meetings, and publish their results during the project. In addition, science enrichment outreach to local elementary schools will be conducted.  All microarray data generated as part of the study will be uploaded upon publication to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) database repository. Molecular biology reagents (i.e. plasmids, bacterial clones) generated as part of this work will be available to members of the scientific community upon request.  Transgenic C. elegans strains generated by this project will be available immediately after publication to members of the scientific community and will be deposited in the C. elegans Genetics Center at the University of Minnesota (http://www.cgc.cbs.umn.edu/) for wider distribution. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals, preferably open access ones, and presented at research conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of the project was to characterize an age-dependent switch that we identified in the contribution of the&nbsp;<em>C. elegans</em>stress-activated signaling protein&nbsp;KGB-1.Activation of KGB-1 during larval development provides protection from heavy metals and protein folding stress, but its activation in young adults reduces resistance to the same stressors and further shortens lifespan. The identified switch represents a rare example of antagonistic pleiotropy &ndash; a gene with early-life beneficial contributions but late-life detrimental ones. Positive selection of such gene/gene variants for their early-life fitness advantage is believed to underlie the evolution of aging and ultimately is responsible for the manifestation of aging symptoms. Better understanding of the KGB-1 switch could thus advance our understanding of aging. Work performed as part of the funded project identified two transcription factors mediating the downstream effects of KGB-1. Genomic analyses identified gene targets of KGB-1 (data deposited in public databases) and showed that FOS-1 regulated a significant number of them, but in an age-invariant manner; this was published in a&nbsp;<em>Cellular Signaling</em>2017 paper. In contrast, the longevity-associated transcription factor, DAF-16, was found to be regulated by KGB-1 (particularly in the intestine) in an age-dependent and antagonistic manner &ndash; positively regulated in larvae, but attenuated in young adults, and was shown to be required for many of the age-dependent phenotypes affected by KGB-1 activation, as published in&nbsp;<em>Aging Cell</em>in 2012. Following up on that, we found that intestinal DAF-16 regulation by KGB-1 was mostly exerted from tissues outside of the intestine, especially from neurons, demonstrating a role for KGB-1 in integrating stress signals (for better or for worse, depending on age) at the level of the entire organism; this was described in a&nbsp;<em>Genetics</em>2018 paper. Lately, we have found that microRNA processing, known to be important for regulation of protein translation, was essential for the effects of KGB-1, and identified the microRNA gene&nbsp;<em>mir-71</em>as a target for KGB-1-exerted age-dependent antagonistic regulation. Mir-71 was shown to regulate signaling through the insulin pathway, a central DAF-16 regulator, thus this finding suggest a link between KGB-1 and DAF-16. We hope to publish these results within the coming year. Our results expand considerably the understanding of KGB-1 and its roles in animal physiology, and consequently advance the understanding of the function of KGB-1&rsquo;s conserved human homologs.
