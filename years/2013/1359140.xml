<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in New Orleans, LA will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2014-16. Training will focus on research fields including genetics, microbiology, biochemistry, neurosciences, physiology, and pharmacology. Sample projects include: the study of proteins involved in DNA repair, cell cycle, and signal transduction; the regulation of transcription factors through phosphorylation; and the analysis of the platelet-activating factor (PAF) signaling in interneuronal rearrangements. The program will provide students with one-on-one mentoring on hypothesis development, experimental design, research methods, and scientific presentation skills.  Students will learn how research is conducted and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences.  Interactive workshops will include topics such as resume writing for graduate school applications, responsible conduct in research, and discussions of career pathways with faculty members from the LSUHSC Basic Sciences Departments and Centers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will be selected for participation based on academic record, research interest, and plans for a career in scientific research.  Students attending Historically Black Colleges and Universities and from schools with limited research opportunities are encouraged to apply.  The program is targeting undergraduates from diverse social and educational backgrounds, especially from the New Orleans area. REU program alumni will be recruited to volunteer at partnering K-12 New Orleans schools during the academic year where they will explain biology and genetics to science classes and serve as role models to younger generations of potential scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Assessment of the program is by qualitative and quantitative participant surveys, mentor evaluations, and by the BIO/REU common assessment tool. Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting http://www.medschool.lsuhsc.edu/genetics/reu.aspx or by contacting the PI (Dr. Fern Tsien at fmille@lsuhsc.edu).</AbstractNarration>

Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this Report are those of the PI and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation; NSF has not approved or endorsed its content.  The Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center REU (LSUHSC-REU) Program in New Orleans provided research training to underserved or underrepresented minority (URM) undergraduates for 10 weeks during the summers of 2017-2019. The program was aimed at students interested in graduate school and in researching genetic and biochemical mechanisms.

In addition to these hard skills essential for scientific researchers, we provided training for soft skills that have been documented to be essential to research success: time management, teamwork, how to evaluate the politics of the workplace, how to explain science to a lay audience, and how to overcome adversity in the research community.

The program also provided professional development resources to aid in graduate school applications to transition somewhat dependent interns into independent researchers.  Summary of participants and outcomes:  Over three summers, we accepted 31 undergraduates, two high school students, and one high school teacher. Of the 31 undergraduates, 74% self-reported as Black/African American, 23% as Hispanic/Latino, and 3% as Mixed race/Other.  Sixty-four (64)% of the undergraduates were female and 36% male.  Of the 31 undergraduate interns, one student had a disability and one was non-traditional (57years old). Fifteen (15) of the 31 undergraduate interns were the first generation college students.  Fifty-nine (59)% of the accepted students were from Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other institutions in the New Orleans area; the remaining 41% attended HBCUs and other schools outside of New Orleans.    Thus far, four (4) of the 31 undergraduates have been accepted to graduate programs. Two (2) have been accepted to STEM related advanced degree programs. The remaining students are completing their undergraduate degree.  This program to date has yielded a significant number of research products, including more than 42 platform and poster presentations at local, national, and international conferences and five (5) publications currently in preparation and/or under peer review.  A few comments from LSUHSC REU alumni:  "Without the research experience and support from the LSUHSC REU I would have never gotten the opportunity to present my research at the NSF-REU Symposium or have been accepted to a prestigious PhD program."  "This program gave me the laboratory, presentation, and communication skills that I continue to apply throughout my academic career."  "The REU internship provided invaluable experiences that allowed me to continuously succeed in my education and to pursue my goal of becoming a research scientist."
