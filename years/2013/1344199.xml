<AbstractNarration>The Interdisciplinary Mathematics Preparation and Career Training (IMPACT) Postdoctoral Program in the School of Mathematics at Georgia Tech (GT Math) addresses the critical transition from graduate student to tenure-track faculty.  In terms of research expectations, teaching responsibilities, and professional commitments, the postgraduate years are one of the most crucial junctures in the academic career path.  The IMPACT Program addresses these challenges through clearly-defined objectives and well-structured activities to expand research horizons, enhance teaching effectiveness, and advance professional development.  A key component uniting all three goals is an interdisciplinary summer REU program with local partner institutions Spelman, Morehouse, and Agnes Scott Colleges and Georgia State University. A critical mass of postdoctoral fellows is an essential prerequisite, precluding any sense of research isolation and providing significant opportunities for group and peer as well as individual mentoring. Hence, 8 IMPACT Fellows will be recruited in 3 cohort groups centered around the following "Math+X" research themes: (1) Applied &amp; Computational Mathematics plus Computational Science &amp; Engineering (2014 - 2017); (2) Discrete Mathematics plus Molecular Biology (2015 - 2018); and (3) Analysis plus Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering (2016 - 2019). Through this innovative interdisciplinary research cohort model, and with the support of mentored career training, IMPACT Fellows will be well-prepared for the challenges faced by new faculty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GT Math IMPACT Postdoctoral Program has two innovative features: (1) an interdisciplinary focus on formal research mentoring and (2) highly structured career mentoring and professional development. Preparing new mathematics PhD's for an interdisciplinary research career aligns with increasing recognition of the value in engaging with other STEM disciplines.  The interdisciplinary research program will broaden the intellectual horizons of cohort postdocs, GT Math faculty and graduate students, and Math+X REU participants.  The complementary career training brings best practices for STEM postdoctoral mentoring and new faculty development into action in mathematics, adapting them to the unique circumstances of the field.  The formal structures developed will serve as a national model for the mathematics community. In this way, the IMPACT Program will have a profound "ripple effect" on local and national scales.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With support from an NSF Mentoring Through Critical Transition Points (MCTP) award, a postdoctoral program focused on interdisciplinary mathematics preparation and career training (IMPACT) was developed and implemented in the School of Mathematics at the Georgia Institute of Technology.  The goals of the program were to better prepare new mathematics PhDs to transition to independent STEM careers through (i) an interdisciplinary focus in formal research training and (ii) structured career mentoring to enhance teaching effectiveness and advance professional development.  IMPACT was highly successful in terms of launching the postdoctoral scholars' careers; all moved on to long-term positions, 50% as tenure-track mathematics faculty and 50% as staff scientist in business/industry/government.  The independent evaluation conducted yearly by the assessment consultant confirmed that the postdocs felt "well prepared" for the next step in their career. Moreover, efforts to recruit a diverse pool of talent were also highly successful; 75% of the IMPACT postdocs came from groups underrepresented in STEM.  A key feature of the IMPACT program was its emphasis on expanding mathematics research horizons by fostering interactions with other STEM fields. In program evaluations, the postdocs consistently expressed their appreciation for the applied nature of the research project developed, and the opportunities to broaden and deepen their research interests. This was achieved through a "Math+X" research theme for each of the three postdoctoral cohorts under the direction of IMPACT Senior Personnel with an associated Distinguished Lecture Series, regular Working Seminar, and summer REU program. The three REU programs were a particular success since a diverse group of undergraduate participants were recruited from local partner institutions (Morehouse, Spelman, Agnes Scott, and Georgia State). Through the assessments, these students communicated that they specifically enjoyed working closely with the IMPACT postdocs and GT Math graduate research assistants, learning about research and developing their technical skills from working on the projects.  The other critical component of the IMPACT program was its focus on structured career training.  The activities developed to enhance teaching effectiveness have been institutionalized by the GT Math department, including a comprehensive orientation program and on-going activities throughout the first semester of teaching overseen by the Director of Postdoctoral Teaching Effectiveness.  As part of the professional development, a yearly postdoctoral evaluation procedure was instituted which incorporates crucial aspects of an individual development plan (IDP).  In this way, best practices for STEM postdoctoral mentoring and new faculty development were brought into action in mathematics, adapting them to the unique circumstances of the field.
