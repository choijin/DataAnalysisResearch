<AbstractNarration>In the oceans, the amount of organic nitrogen is in great part controlled by the balance between two microbially-controlled pathways: Denitrification, the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas, and nitrogen fixation, the reduction of nitrogen gas to ammonium. Because the large spatial variability of nitrogen fixation is difficult to resolve with current measurements, the development of new methods for high resolution measurements is highly desirable. In order to characterize the geographical distribution of oceanic nitrogen fixation rates and ultimately yield better estimates of new nitrogen, researchers at Duke University will develop a novel method for in situ measurements of nitrogen fixation. By providing insights into the biogeography of oceanic nitrogen fixation rates, this method and ensuing observations will fill a gap in the current state of knowledge of the mechanisms governing the biogeochemistry of new nitrogen in oceanic environments, and ultimately aid in the refinement of oceanic ecosystem models for current and future climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Through a partnership with the Museum of Life and Science, the project will provide a platform to foster climate and climate change literacy well beyond the duration of the proposed work. In addition, Informal Science Education educators will participate in research to further their scientific knowledge, and educate student researchers on effective strategies to communicate science. Finally, the study will provide opportunities for mentoring of undergraduate students, graduate student support, and teaching material for undergraduate and graduate courses at Duke University.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Nitrogen fixation, catalyzed by a select group of microorganisms called diazotrophs, converts nitrogen gas (N<sub>2</sub>) into bioavailable nitrogen. By supplying new nitrogen to ecosystems, marine N<sub>2</sub> fixation affects primary production, the uptake of carbon dioxide and ultimately the global climate. The spatial variability in marine N<sub>2</sub> fixation is difficult to resolve based on current methods which rely on discrete sampling. &#65279; The main objective of this project &#65279;was the development of a new method for high-resolution estimates of N<sub>2</sub> fixation. This goal has been achieved by developing a ship-based underway method to estimate N<sub>2</sub> fixation at high spatial and temporal resolution (~0.5-1.5 hr) through monitoring of acetylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>) reduction to ethylene (C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>).</p> <p>The newly developed measurement system is called "Flow-through incubation Acetylene Reduction Assays by Cavity ring down laser Absorption Spectroscopy", or "FARACAS" (Cassar et al., 2018). FARACAS consists of: 1) a dual channel peristaltic pump for precise and continuous admixing of high-purity dissolved C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> with seawater, 2) a constant-volume continuous flow stirred tank reactor (CSTR) for the flow-through incubation where the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> reduction to C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> takes place, 3) a bubble column multiphase reactor for the C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> gas stripping, and 4) continuous measurements of the flow-through C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> by wavelength scanned Cavity Ring-Down laser Absorption Spectroscopy (CRDS). FARACAS provides high-frequency underway N<sub>2</sub> fixation measurements, and shows good agreement with the benchmark method (discrete <sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub> addition incubations) with equivalent or better sensitivity.</p> <p>FARACAS has been successfully deployed across a wide range of marine environments (e.g., North Atlantic, including North Carolina coastal waters, and Palmer Station in Antarctica). N<sub>2</sub> fixation rates were estimated by FARACAS over large swaths of the western North Atlantic Ocean in the summers of 2015, 2016, and 2017, covering over 10,000 km (Tang et al., 2019; Tang et al., 2020, Wang et al. 2021). This extensive survey showed enhanced N<sub>2</sub> fixation rates when phosphorus, Fe, and &nbsp;chlorophyll-<em>a</em> concentrations increased across the Gulf Stream into the subpolar waters. We also identified hotspots of N<sub>2</sub> fixation in the coastal waters of the mid-Atlantic Bight. In addition to the spatial distribution of N<sub>2</sub> fixation, we also captured a shift in diazotrophs from <em>Trichodesmium</em> in the oligotrophic warm (25-29 degrees C) subtropical Sargasso Sea to UCYN-A in the relatively nutrient-enriched cold (13-24 degrees C) coastal waters. By coupling FARACAS with underway estimates of net community production (NCP) derived from dissolved O<sub>2</sub>/Ar measurements, we revealed the heterogeneous contribution of N<sub>2</sub> fixation to NCP, with a surprisingly large contribution in coastal waters. Significant N<sub>2</sub> fixation was also detected in North Carolina's coastal waters at Duke University's Marine Lab where the diel pattern in N<sub>2</sub> fixation was studied.</p> <p>In addition to the development and application of FARACAS, this project has supported other studies, including 1) Machine learning (random forest and support vector regression) estimates of marine N<sub>2</sub> fixation and diazotroph abundance in the global ocean (Tang et al., 2019; Tang &amp; Cassar, 2019), 2) Investigation of the relations between net community production, N<sub>2</sub> fixation and microbial community structure in the western North Atlantic (Wang et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2021), 3) Study of the distinct responses and nutrient-uptake strategies among eukaryotic phytoplankton in the North Atlantic Subtropical Gyre (Lampe et al., 2019), and 4) Assessment of the inorganic and organic carbon and nitrogen uptake strategies of picoplankton groups in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean (Berthelot et al., in review).</p> <p>The science from this project has been disseminated to the general public through a collaboration with the Museum of Life and Science (MLS) in Durham. Two educators joined the research team on the <em>RV Atlantic Explorer </em>in 2015 and 2016 cruises to learn about "research at sea" and capture video footage for new science activities at the Museum. MLS expanded STEM Days field trip experiences to include both fourth and fifth grade students and teachers. MLS facilitated ocean science-themed programs in the hands-on exhibit, <em>The Lab</em>, and provided virtual reality experience using 360 videos from the research cruises. In one of the hands-on activities, visitors and students simulated an environment with excess carbon dioxide in its atmosphere and measured the effect it had on the water and marine organisms using pH indicators. Over 1,000 visitors annually participated in these outreach events during the course of this project. Several graduate students and postdocs from the Cassar lab and from the Division of Earth and Ocean Sciences at Duke University attended these events and facilitated the activities of the Museum educators.</p> <p>Overall, this project has significantly improved our understanding of the biogeography and ecophysiology of N<sub>2</sub> fixation and diazotrophs through the development of a technique for high-frequency underway N<sub>2</sub> fixation measurements. The outcome of this project has been delivered to the general public through a partnership with the Museum of Life and Science in Durham, NC.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/10/2021<br>      Modified by: Nicolas&nbsp;Cassar</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1350710/1350710_10294092_1615392152853_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1350710/1350710_10294092_1615392152853_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1350710/1350710_10294092_1615392152853_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Schematic diagram of FARACAS and deployment of FARACAS in the field</div> <div class="imageCredit">Figure taken from Cassar et al., 2018</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Nicolas&nbsp;Cassar</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1350710/1350710_10294092_1615392209604_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1350710/1350710_10294092_1615392209604_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1350710/1350710_10294092_1615392209604_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">N2 fixation rates estimated by FARACAS (black bars) and 15N2 addition method (red bars) during 2015, 2016 and 2017 Bermuda cruises overlaid on satellite estimates of chlorophyll-a concentration.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Figure modified from Tang et al., 2019 and Tang et al., 2020.</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Nicolas&nbsp;Cassar</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1350710/1350710_10294092_1615392329178_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1350710/1350710_10294092_1615392329178_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1350710/1350710_10294092_1615392329178_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Diazotrophic community during 2017 Bermuda cruise.
