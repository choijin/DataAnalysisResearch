<AbstractNarration>This project will develop new techniques for observing atmospheres of extrasolar planets with at the terrestrial planet boundary, the so-called Super-Earths (mass less than 10 Earth masses).  The investigators will also observe exoplanets with much higher masses, including those which are near enough to the host star that much of their atmospheres is escaping.   They will conduct broadband (low spectral resolution) observations of Rayleigh scattering using multi-object or integral-field instruments, and high-spectral resolution transmission spectroscopy of H-alpha lines in exoplanet targets.  They will use various optical and infrared observatories, such as the Keck, WIYN and Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rayleigh scattering is the dominant atmospheric signature of terrestrial planets in the optical, and is considered critical to evaluating infrared observations.  The measurements of the emission from two hydrogen lines would provide fundamental physical and morphological measurements that would help explain the mass loss characteristics of some exoplanets. Broader impacts include a public outreach program at McDonald Observatory, and annual teacher professional development workshops in Texas, which incorporate the research and conform to National Science Education Standards. Undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoctoral scholar will also receive research training on this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As our ability to detect planets orbiting other, nearby stars, continues to improve, it becomes critical to develop techniques that are capable of measuring the properties of the atmospheres of these planets. We have had success in probing the atmospheres of giant exoplanets, but atmospheres of terrestrial planets present a major challenge, not only because of the reduction in size, but also because the properties (and therefore the observational signatures) of terrestrial planet atmospheres are dramatically different than those of giants. Despite the difficulty, an elemental inventory of a terrestrial planet atmospheres provides information about the planet's formation, interior structure, geological evolution, and (as is the case for Earth) biological evolution. While atmospheric characterization of a true Earth analog is perhaps some time away, it is currently possible to do so for exoplanets at the terrestrial planet boundary, the so-called Super-Earths.       We have developed new observational techniques and accomplished important milestones in the observations of giant and Super-Earth exoplanet atmospheres.  In particular, using high-resolution transmission spectroscopy of tracers of extended planetary atmospheres (e.g., H-alpha), we have been able to detect the exospheres of several exoplanets. We have also identified several other elements that trace the extended atmospheres of planets, and detected them outside of the planetary transit.

We obtained observations to look for Rayleigh scattering in the broadband observations of exoplanets, but found that the instruments were not sufficiently stable to allow for such detections. We utilized various ground-based telescopes in this work.     The study of exoplanets in general, and their atmospheres in particular, has a tremendous level of public appeal, as we try to put our own planet into a cosmic context.  This research area appeals to students of all ages and can be used to facilitate science education in the broader community.  We created a new series of annual workshops, designed for fifteen secondary school teachers to be selected from a nationwide applicant pool.  These workshops explored the scientific issues related to exoplanets, their atmospheres, and the spectra used to study them.  Such workshops are a powerful experience for secondary school teachers, and provide an opportunity to share the astrophysical research experience, as well as equip them with classroom activities which conform to National Science Education Standards which ultimately impacted thousands of students nationwide.
