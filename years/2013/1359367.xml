<AbstractNarration>-------------&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This is an international REU Site to provide eight undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds an opportunity to conduct interdisciplinary research on the cultural, economic and ecological roles of church forests in Ethiopia. Under the proposed eight-week REU students receive training at Colby College in social survey research, spatial analysis using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), ecological field methods, and written and oral communication. They then travel to South Gondar, Ethiopia where they work closely with mentors from Colby College, North Carolina State University, and local institutions to conduct and share their original research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Church forests are patches of Afromontane forest surrounding Ethiopian Orthodox churches. Preserved by church leaders and communities as religious sanctuaries, church forests are, in many parts of Ethiopia, the only indigenous forests left. From an institutional perspective, church forests show how non-state actors such as religious institutions can play major roles in conservation. From an ecological perspective, church forests are crucial reserves for Ethiopia's vanishing biodiversity. "Outsiders" are rarely allowed into church forests, but after years of outreach efforts in Ethiopia, Dr. Meg Lowman of the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences has a Memorandum of Understanding for access to the church forests and cooperation with church leaders. Working closely with faculty mentors and Ethiopian collaborator Dr. Alemayehu Wassie, students at the proposed REU Site actively contribute to the design and implementation of original research including GIS analyses and community surveys examining cultural and economic values of church forests; and ecological studies of human impacts on church forest biodiversity and ecosystem services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The leadership of the U.S. is critical to the success of global efforts to reverse environmental degradation in low-income countries. The proposed REU Site is designed to spark global interest in the conservation of tropical forests, but also to learn from and strengthen existing conservation institutions in Ethiopia. Study results will be shared within Ethiopia through meetings of academic and church community stakeholders, and internationally through a website, publication of student work in economics, ecology and interdisciplinary journals, and student attendance at conferences. In addition, the program exposes students to a unique cultural and educational experience, while providing them an opportunity to conduct cutting-edge social and ecological research in a safe and supportive REU setting. With a focus on community college students, women, low-income students and under-represented groups, this REU Site establishes the foundations for a more diverse and informed body of scholars and leaders able to think critically and compassionately about real-world problems from multiple perspectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is co-funded by the International Science and Engineering (ISE) organization and also the Office of Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) at the NSF. In addition, it is designated as an RUI (Research in Undergraduate Institutions) project.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Through a collaborative effort by the Colby College Environmental Studies Program, the Colby College Biology Department The California Academy of Sciences, the nonprofit <a href="http://treefoundation.org/" target="_blank">TREE Foundation</a>, and Ethiopia's Debre Tabor University, each summer from 2015-2017 this REU Site provided 8 American undergraduate students from diverse academic backgrounds an opportunity to conduct interdisciplinary research on "church forests" - patches of indigenous Afromontane forest vegetation conserved by Ethiopian Orthodox Church communities - in northern Ethiopia. Under the eight-week summer REU program students received training at Colby College in social survey research design and methods, spatial analysis using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), ecological field sampling methods looking at species diversity and water quality, and written and oral communication. They then worked with mentors from Colby College, the California Academy of Sciences, and Ethiopian academic and government institutions to conduct research into the cultural, economic and ecological values of church forests.</p> <p>Intellectual Merit:</p> <p>All 24 REU Site Participants completed independent research projects, as well as contributing to interdisciplinary "framework projects' with group data collection spanning multiple years. Working closely with REU faculty mentors and Ethiopian student and faculty partners, REU Site Participants actively engaged in the design and implementation of studies including:</p> <p><strong><em>Social and economic studies</em></strong> consisting of designing, collecting and analyzing household and priest interview and survey&nbsp;data exploring the cultural benefits church forests provide, including qualitative inquiries into church forest lore, uses of church forest spaces, and rites surrounding sacred springs, as well as more quantitative survey studies of the economic and ecological benefits priests and farmers derive from church forests (e.g., firewood and construction wood use, honey production, fruits, medicinal plants, perceived soil and rainfall impacts, etc.);</p> <p><strong><em>Ecological studies</em></strong> focusing on church forest biodiversity (identifying and quantifying diversity of plants, terrestrial insects, and aquatic macroinvertebrates) and measurement of ecosystem services flows (including vegetation productivity, water quality, pollination, and pest-control); and</p> <p><strong><em>Geospatial analyses</em></strong><strong> </strong>including measurement and analysis of church forest size, species composition, and distribution across degraded agricultural landscapes and watersheds in northern Ethiopia using open-source Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools and diverse data sources ranging from historical spy-plane photographs, to recent United States Geological Survey satellite imagery, to survey-based World Bank Living Standards Measurement Study (LSMS) agricultural productivity data. All GIS-related studies also involved either a social or an ecological science component, and oftentimes both.</p> <p>All 24 REU Site Participants delivered at least one oral or poster presentation at a local, regional, national, or international conference through the program. In total 31 oral or poster presentations were accepted and presented by REU students at national or international conferences from 2015-2018, in addition to other presentations at student conferences, public presentations to community partners, and results sharing in Ethiopia at Debre Tabor University and Bata Church (Bahir Dar), and in the U.S. through public talks and workshops on the main floor of the California Academy of Sciences.</p> <p>Four undergraduate theses emerged from work initiated under the REU, and four papers were published in peer-reviewed journals with REU students and Ethiopian collaborators as lead- or co-authors, including the cover article of the January 2017 issue of <em>Ecography.</em></p> <p>Broader Impacts:</p> <p>The REU site successfully recruited and expanded participation among traditionally underrepresented groups in the STEM fields; of the 24 REU Site Participants, over half were from underrepresented groups, over half self-identified as female, and at least one student each year was from a community college (all have since transferred to four-year programs). Exit interviews and continuing correspondence suggest the training and fieldwork program ignited a passion for research in several students, especially among those with limited prior access to research opportunities or international travel experience. The program also helped develop a broad research network for REU Site Participants, including a community across REU Site cohorts, with former REU students returning to Colby College to share their projects and their experiences with the new incoming cohort each year. Surveys and independent evaluations of the program repeatedly highlighted such opportunities for peer-mentoring - in addition to the extraordinary opportunity to engage in data collection and analysis in collaboration with student, faculty, and community partners in Ethiopia - as key strengths of the program.&nbsp;More broadly, the student research undertaken through this REU has provided additional evidence in support of ongoing church forest conservation efforts - drawing further attention to potential threats to church forests and associated ecosystem services in northern Ethiopia, and also highlighting the need for interdisciplinary approaches to better understand, and better support, community-based institutions for natural resource governance.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/30/2019<br>      Modified by: Travis&nbsp;W&nbsp;Reynolds</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1359367/1359367_10297435_1556645205116_DebresenaChurch--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1359367/1359367_10297435_1556645205116_DebresenaChurch--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Debresena Church Near Debre Tabor, Ethiopia"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1359367/1359367_10297435_1556645205116_DebresenaChurch--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Debresena Church Near Debre Tabor, Ethiopia"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewhido Church has a unique cultural tradition of preserving small patches of indigenous Afromontane forests, called "Debr" (or "church forests"), that can cover tens or even hundreds of hectares around church buildings.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Google Earth</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Travis&nbsp;W&nbsp;Reynolds</div> <div class="imageTitle">Debresena Church Near Debre Tabor, Ethiopia</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1359367/1359367_10297435_1556645346845_PriestMeeting--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1359367/1359367_10297435_1556645346845_PriestMeeting--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Priest Meeting at Dedim Church"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1359367/1359367_10297435_1556645346845_PriestMeeting--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Priest Meeting at Dedim Church"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Though church forests are usually off-limits to "outsiders", Co-PI Dr. Meg Lowman has established a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Ethiopian Orthodox Church granting us access to the church forests and surrounding communities.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Travis Reynolds</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Travis&nbsp;W&nbsp;Reynolds</div> <div class="imageTitle">Priest Meeting at Dedim Church</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1359367/1359367_10297435_1556646193976_EcographyCoverJanuary2017--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1359367/1359367_10297435_1556646193976_EcographyCoverJanuary2017--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Cover Issue of Ecography (January 2017)"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1359367/1359367_10297435_1556646193976_EcographyCoverJanuary2017--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Cover Issue of Ecography (January 2017)"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Reynolds, T.
