<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Gregory K. Friestad of the University of Iowa is establishing a series of new carbon-carbon bond construction reactions for synthesizing biologically active compounds.  This effort involves fundamental reactivity studies in reactions which proceed via both radical and polar reactions, so-called "radical-polar crossover reactions," and their application to prepare complex nitrogen-containing compounds.  A broader impact of this work is the application of free radical reactions to many subdisciplines of chemistry.  The types of compounds that can be prepared through the new reactions have broader impacts on health sciences research, particularly in drug discovery, thereby improving the well-being of individuals in society.  Combining radical and ionic transformations into one operation saves time, energy, and materials, with broader impact upon sustainability of chemical synthesis.  The project is also developing more diverse personnel resources, which assists in the economic growth of industries dependent upon science and technology education and training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is expanding the versatility of stereoselective radical additions to imino compounds, so that heterocyclic groups may be present in the precursors, producing structures bearing chiral amines in combination with heterocycles.  These developments are being used in synthesis of biologically active compounds of importance in medicinal chemistry.  Additional studies are developing reactions in which the oxygen- or nitrogen-containing heterocyclic structural units are formed during the new reactions, using combinations of radical and ionic bond constructions in a single operation.  Professor Friestad is also developing approaches to increase outreach between the university and neighboring communities with significant populations of minorities, which are traditionally underrepresented in physical sciences with the goal of building science interests and experiences among people of more diverse backgrounds.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The Project Outcomes from CHE-1362111 are found in two general areas, educational outcomes and research outcomes.  Educational outcomes: During the funding period of CHE-1362111 the major educational outcomes are in the broader impacts in human resources development that accompany the training of graduate and undergraduate students to become independent scientists. The training includes creating experiences and providing advising on experimental design and execution, techniques of the organic synthesis laboratory, and professional communications such as manuscript preparation and oral presentations.  Specifically, the experimental activities are directed toward expanding the scope of radical reactions in organic synthesis, focusing on asymmetric amine synthesis methods based on radical addition to C=N bonds and radical-polar crossover coupling reactions of enamides and enol ethers, with applications in natural product synthesis.  These research projects provide an excellent foundation for contributions of synthetic expertise in future careers in biomedical, materials science, and agricultural research; they have also proven to be strong preparation for academic career tracks.  Additionally, a consistent effort has been devoted to expanding training opportunities for Latinx students to increase the representation of these important contributors among the personnel resources engaged in the scientific enterprise. Research outcomes under CHE-1362111 focus upon the intellectual merit associated with synthetic organic chemistry methodology directed toward chiral amines, radical polar crossover reactions in tandem processes, and applications in total synthesis of biologically active compounds.  Chiral alpha-branched amines are found in many biologically active synthetic targets, including natural products and designed pharmaceuticals.
