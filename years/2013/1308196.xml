<AbstractNarration>The first main theme of the proposed research is further exploration of the Principal Investigators (PI) re-normalized Reshetikhin-Turaev 3-manifold invariants.  In particular, the PI will draw connections with these re-normalized invariants and other topological objects including Reidemeister torsion, Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs) and mapping class group representations.  The proposed research will also focus on continuing the PI's development and research of generalized Kashaev quantum 3-manifold invariants.  These invariants are modeled on Kashaev's foundational work that led to the original formulation of the Volume Conjecture.  The final topic of the proposed research is to generalize his re-normalized Reshetikhin-Turaev invariants by defining 3-manifold invariants via surgery presentations of links with flat connections in their complements.  This work is both geometric and physical in nature and related to Chern-Simons theory.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the fundamental ways mathematics arises in nature is through geometry and more generally topology.  In particular, geometric objects called manifolds are used to model space and time in general relativity.  Surprisingly, several features of manifolds can be studied via their underlying topology.  The discovery of the Jones polynomial by V. Jones in 1984 and its 3-dimensional quantum field theory interpretation by E. Witten in 1989 have opened the door for the use of new algebraic techniques to study topology.  These developments led to a new branch of mathematics known as "quantum topology."  This area has connections to theoretical physics, including quantum gravity, topological quantum field theory and quantum computing.  Many established techniques in quantum topology become zero when quantum dimensions vanish.  This project focuses on developing and studying new systematic strategies to re-normalize topological invariants when quantum dimensions are zero.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As a pure mathematician, I am often asked the following questions about my work:    I thought all mathematics was understood, what kind of research is there to do in mathematics?  Are your research papers just really big equations?  The answers to these questions are surprising to most people.  First, there is a huge beautiful world of unknown mathematics waiting to be discovered or created.  Second, the world of pure mathematics is rooted in words and ideas rather than numbers and algebraic equations.  At first glance these words and ideas seem foreign and unrelated to the natural world.  However, pure mathematics is the language of modern physics.  This relationship is a miracle that is not well understood, but is productively used.  My research is centered in this context.  In particular, I am creating new mathematics with the aim of understanding physical phenomena.  One of the fundamental ways mathematics arises in nature is through geometry and more generally topology.  In particular, geometric objects called manifolds are used to model space and time in general relativity.  Surprisingly, manifolds can be studied by knots and more generally links.  Knots appear in many places ranging from everyday items such as tied shoe laces to string theory and protein folding.  In mathematics, knots and links are fundamental basic objects in topology.  Knots as mathematical objects have been studied since the 19th century.  More recently, with the influx of quantum field theory into topology, the past two decades have seen the emergence of a revolutionary point of view in the theory of links and 3-manifold invariants.  The discovery of the Jones polynomial by V. Jones in 1984 and its 3-dimensional quantum field theory interpretation by E. Witten in 1989 have opened the door for the use of new algebraic techniques to study topology.  These developments led to a new branch of mathematics known as "quantum topology.''  This area has connections to theoretical physics, including quantum gravity, topological quantum field theory and quantum computing.    A principal feature of quantum topology is its interplay between topology and representation theory (or more generally abstract algebra).  The work of NSF grant DMS-1308196 is centered around this interplay.  The productive interplay between quantum topology and quantum algebra has been used extensively.  Within this context the Principal Investigator and his collaborators have given new systematic strategies to define re-normalized quantum invariants.  These strategies produce non-trivial invariants when the standard approaches fail.  The work of this grant focused on developing an infrastructure containing a general theory of re-normalized invariants and use the unique properties of such a theory to gain new information about well-known problems and objects in low-dimensional topology.
