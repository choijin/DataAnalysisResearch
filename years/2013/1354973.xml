<AbstractNarration>New generations of multicellular animals arise primarily through the biological process known as embryonic development. This project addresses fundamental mechanisms that control animal development. It focuses on the connections between two kinds of dynamic, molecular networks that define the properties and behaviors of embryonic cells: 1) networks that are controlled by extrinsic signals (cell signaling networks) and 2) networks that control programs of gene expression (gene regulatory networks). Understanding the connections between such networks is a central problem in the emerging field of systems developmental biology. This study leverages a well-understood developmental gene regulatory network - one that controls skeletal development in sea urchin embryos- and examines the mechanisms and developmental consequences of its regulation by extracellular cues. The broader impacts of this work include: 1) continued support for a highly successful program of undergraduate research in the PI's laboratory, and 2) the maintenance and enhancement of the 'Virtual Urchin' web project, a unique resource that provides science instructors with educational tools for teaching students of all levels (elementary school to college) about early embryonic development.</AbstractNarration>

At the heart of the genetic program for development is differential gene expression, the activation of distinct suites of genes in the various cells of the embryo, a process that creates distinct cell types.  Increasingly, biologists appreciate that differential gene expression involves the activation of complex networks of genes that influence each other?s expression (gene regulatory networks).
