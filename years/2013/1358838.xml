<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the University of Vermont (UVM), located in Burlington, VT, will support the training of 10 undergraduate students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2014-2016. This REU program is supported by the Directorates for Biological Sciences (BIO) and Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE). The program is focused on the ecological and socioeconomic impacts of habitat fragmentation, eutrophication, and invasive species on the Lake Champlain ecosystem. While participating in the program, students will work with the UVM and Saint Michael's College faculty on projects ranging from fish ecology to the impact of harmful algal blooms on human health and property values. To promote cross-disciplinary thinking, students will work in pairs, serving as assistants to each other in their respective, but distinct, research projects. In addition to research, students will attend workshops, seminars, and symposia on topics such as experimental design, basic statistics, effective communication, the ethical and responsible conduct of research, and careers in science. Students will be mentored on how to present research at conferences and how to write manuscripts for scientific journals. At the end of the summer, students will present their research results at a poster session. In addition, students will present a talk  that ties their individual project into an over-arching view of the interactions among human activities, societal structures, and the lake ecosystem. The program will be evaluated using the REU common assessment tool. Applicants will be selected based on academic record, two letters of reference, and an essay that explains why the student is interested in the program and how it will advance his/her career. Rising first and second year undergraduates, members of under-represented groups, and students from institutions with limited research opportunities are encouraged to apply. The program will provide stipends, housing, and travel funds to and from the site.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The team-based approach of this REU will foster interdisciplinary thinking and encourage collaborative problem solving in students at early stages of their career. This will enhance their capacity for deeper and broader critical thinking as they mature into independent investigators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting http://www.uvm.edu/~ecolab/, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Jason Stockwell at jason.stockwell@uvm.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The University of Vermont REU site received funding to host 10 students for 10 weeks each summer from 2014-2016 to develop the students&rsquo; intellectual capacity to conduct integrated research on the Lake Champlain ecosystem. The research theme and organizational structure were interdisciplinary, challenging students to stretch their thinking beyond any single discipline. Each student worked with a faculty sponsor and often a graduate student while conducting their research, and also worked as part of teams to assist their peers and learn about other research disciplines. Students participated in a rigorous weekly professional development program. All students reported their research findings during a poster presentation at the end of each summer, and communicated their science to the general public through presentations at a local public science center and aquarium and science art projects presented in a local park. Each cohort worked as a team to develop and present a group project on inter-disciplinary research connections.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Intellectual Merit: All 30 students completed their independent research projects, including poster presentations and presentation to the general public. Projects ranged from impacts of cyanobacteria blooms on fish health to 3-D modeling of nutrient transport to public valuation of clean water. Students gained appreciation and hands-on experiences in multiple disciplines ranging from, for example, watershed sciences to public surveys. Each cohort used a different medium to make inter-disciplinary connections among research projects, including a video, a zine, and a board game. All students received nearly 40 hours of professional training, seminars, and workshops during the 10-week program. Topics included: critical reading, collaborative and interdisciplinary research, information literacy, social sciences survey design, weekly scientific writing workshops, weekly career pathways seminar, ethics training, weekly journal club, how to give effective talks, leadership and mentoring, how to present data, the publication process, and how to write effective cover letters and resumes. Ten presentations were made by REU students at national or international conferences, and five papers were published in peer-reviewed journal with REU students as lead- or as co-author.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Broader Impacts: The REU site was successful in increasing the participation of traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM fields.

Almost three-quarters of participants self-identified as female, and almost one-quarter were rising 1<sup>st</sup> or 2<sup>nd</sup> year students. Students expressed a great deal of satisfaction with the program through surveys and exit interviews. The program ignited excitement about research, especially for the participants who had not previously experienced life as a scientist.
