<AbstractNarration>This project will establish an Alaska in-state capability for hyper-spectral (HS) imaging by acquiring a state-of-the-art, yet cost-effective, visible to shortwave infrared HS imaging system that will be deployed for airborne and ground-based&lt;br/&gt;remote sensing. The project will integrate, commission, and deploy the system over selected Alaskan study sites and will build the necessary maintenance and operations infrastructure to support the provision of high quality HS data products for Alaskan science&lt;br/&gt;and applications. This will support basic and applied research, research training, and educational&lt;br/&gt;activities. The imaging system will be key  for both repeat monitoring and rapid response deployments that could lead to important scientific insight, as well as a number of more pragmatic benefits such as wildfire response and assessment, mineral resource exploration, and mapping of contaminated sediments.&lt;br/&gt;Beside specific courses that will make use of the new imaging system, there will be a number of graduate students and post-docs that will be trained using this facility.The project also proposes STEM and K-12 outreach activities.  The images acquired through this MRI will be broadly distributed, as carefully detailed in the management plan, and favoring interdisciplinary research on the effects of climate change on high-latitude environments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcomes:  Hyperspectral imaging, also known as imaging spectroscopy, is an advanced remote sensing technology that helps researchers to ?measure? rather than simply ?observe? from a distance. The technology uses sophisticated sensors that can scan and generate hundreds of images of any target material on the surface of the Earth. These images can be used together to reconstruct the unique pattern in which the material reflects energy, thereby accurately identifying the target. The National Science Foundation granted a Major Research Instrumentation award to the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) for "Acquisition of a hyperspectral imaging system to support scientific research, applied studies, and education in the State of Alaska". Through this award and matching funds from UAF, our team established the first Hyperspectral Imaging Laboratory (HyLab) in the State.

We also established a data processing system so that data collected from the airborne campaigns can be converted to map products that the researchers and general public can use. Intellectual Merit: This project has helped to define the potential contributions of relatively low-cost hyperspectral imaging systems mounted on small aircrafts in advancing resource exploration and ecosystem research, especially in high-latitudes. We have successfully demonstrated the advantage of hyperspectral imaging for mineral exploration and geologic mapping. Our new datasets will be applied for mapping wetlands, tundra vegetation, wildfires, black carbon in snow, and the changing characteristics of coastal waters.
