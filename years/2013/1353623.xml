<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project proposal refines and scales the project's initial platform for improving mathematics problem solving. Math classrooms today spend most of their time practicing procedures and rarely spend time engaged in deep study of mathematical concepts. In addition, by the time students reach middle school, a number of them have either developed math anxiety or are not adequately challenged. This mobile collaborative platform supports process-driven, student led solutions. Students can create, curate and evaluate multimedia vignettes of their own thinking process. In Phase 2, the team will continue to refine the product, targeting students in Grade 5-12. It will also build a multi-faceted dashboard to help educators customize content, create learning pathways and determine student strengths and weaknesses. In addition, the company intends to extend the product to support English Language Learners and students with learning difficulties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project offers tremendous promise for changing math education and engagement both in and out of the classroom. This platform will help students develop confidence and skills in solving complex problems, refine their math communication and improve their meta-cognition through the review of other students' work and equip teachers with tangible data about growth measures.  This enables the company to address multiple markets starting with the $1.6 billion 5-12 market segment and subsequently addressing several adjacent market segments that are growing rapidly. The team brings a strong and diverse mix of educational, technical and business skills that will be critical to successful commercialization of the proposed math education innovation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This NSF Phase II grant enabled us to develop and commercialize the CueThink&trade; application and reach thousands of students across the country. Our product innovation comes from building a platform that is both a tool and a pedagogy to improve critical thinking skills and math collaboration for students in grades 2-12. CueThink&rsquo;s methodology is based on renowned mathematician George P&oacute;lya&rsquo;s four phases of problem solving. CueThink provides a consistent language and problem solving structure across grades for students to excel on new performance-based assessments. Within the application, teachers can flexibly implement rigorous mathematical tasks from a curated Problem Bank or district curriculum to differentiate instruction. Our team built this tablet and web-based tool to capture and presents the thinking process and cognition. Students create "thinklets" or video vignettes of their solutions using whiteboard and audio recording tools. Once their work is published to the gallery, students obtain timely, high quality feedback that strengthens their problem solving and content knowledge. Individual student solutions become part of the learners&rsquo; digital portfolio, showcasing growth and change over time. Additionally, we recognized the importance of &ldquo;fidelity of implementation&rdquo; and now employ a team of professional math educators who train teachers on effective implementation of rigorous tasks and review of student work to improve problem solving pedagogy.</p> <p>In this NSF Phase II research study, we used a mixed methodology to collect and evaluate evidence to determine if CueThink use improves elementary and secondary school students&rsquo; math problem solving and communication skills. The study was conducted with 200 students across 3 school sites. Teachers were trained to use CueThink with online tutorials and webinars and instructed to use it regularly with students in the experimental group. Periodic classroom site visits, both live and virtual, allowed us to confirm CueThink was being used as designed by both teachers and students. Control groups were established for the 4th and 8th grade sites. The 4th grade students produced nine &ldquo;thinklets&rdquo;, and the 8th grade students, ten &ldquo;thinklets&rdquo;. Their corresponding control classrooms used traditional media (paper-and-pencil and/or personal whiteboards) while problem solving. The 4th and 8th grade teachers administered and scored their own open-response math test to students at the beginning of the study, and administered the same test again at the conclusion of the study. The 4th grade test consisted of five open-response questions on a common theme, with each response scored as correct or incorrect. The 8th grade test consisted of a single constructed response Problem of the Week from the Math Forum at Drexel University. Students were encouraged to show their work, and their responses were scored according to a four-part rubric evaluating the quality of completeness, evidence, explanation/communication, and accuracy, each according to a three- or four-point scale.</p> <p>Based on pre-post test score comparisons, we found that students who used CueThink improved in their mathematical problem solving skills compared with their control group peers, with results reaching statistical significance in grade four and trending toward significance in grade eight. When the differences between students&rsquo; pre- and post-pilot test scores for the 4th graders were analyzed, we found that students in the CueThink group experienced significantly higher growth in scores than those in the control group (p&lt;0.01), with an effect size of 0.42&sigma;. &nbsp;In the 8<sup>th</sup> grade classroom, in all five cases, CueThink students demonstrated greater score increases than the non-CueThink students. For the explanation/communication sub score, the difference between CueThink and non-CueThink students trended toward significance with p=0.08 and a very large effect size of 1.29&sigma;. This latter finding is consistent with CueThink&rsquo;s focus on developing students&rsquo; math communication skills. Thus by year-end CueThink allowed these general math students to outperform their Algebra I peers in this critical mathematical skill, and to lessen the gap in all other math skills.</p> <p>Student survey results indicate that students, especially those in 8th and 10th grade, benefitted from CueThink&rsquo;s supports for planning and organizing their problem solving. The following quotes illustrate this: "<em>I like that you can organize your thinking. And if you figure out your plan isn't working, you can go back, change it. Then re-work. For someone like me if I did this all on paper I wouldn't realize I am doing something wrong and I'd be stuck" </em>and <em>"</em><em>I enjoy using CueThink because it allows you to plan out how you are going to solve a problem and if you are confused on something you can look at how others solved the same problem".&nbsp;</em>Qualitative results from student focus groups and teacher surveys and interviews provided strong evidence that CueThink supports students during math problem solving, improves their understanding of mathematical concepts as well as their ability to communicate their thinking. More efficacy and user design studies are planned as we continue to refine our product and research goals.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/13/2016<br>      Modified by: Sheela&nbsp;Sethuraman</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1353623/1353623_10295475_1471023814133_ClassroomImage--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1353623/1353623_10295475_1471023814133_ClassroomImage--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student using CueThink"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1353623/1353623_10295475_1471023814133_ClassroomImage--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student using CueThink"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Student solving a problem using CueThink</div> <div class="imageCredit">CueThink</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sheela&nbsp;Sethuraman</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student using CueThink</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1353623/1353623_10295475_1471023873594_PlanImage--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1353623/1353623_10295475_1471023873594_PlanImage--rgov-800width.jpg" title="CueThink Plan Phase"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1353623/1353623_10295475_1471023873594_PlanImage--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="CueThink Plan Phase"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The second phase of the problem solving process where students outline a plan</div> <div class="imageCredit">CueThink</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sheela&nbsp;Sethuraman</div> <div class="imageTitle">CueThink Plan Phase</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1353623/1353623_10295475_1471025194660_SolveImage--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1353623/1353623_10295475_1471025194660_SolveImage--rgov-800width.jpg" title="CueThink Solve Phase"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1353623/1353623_10295475_1471025194660_SolveImage--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="CueThink Solve Phase"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The third phase of the problem solving process where a student creates a "thinklet", showing and explaining the solution</div> <div class="imageCredit">CueThink</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sheela&nbsp;Sethuraman</div> <div class="imageTitle">CueThink Solve Phase</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1353623/1353623_10295475_1471025518373_AnnotationImage--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1353623/1353623_10295475_1471025518373_AnnotationImage--rgov-800width.jpg" title="CueThink's Student Annotations"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1353623/1353623_10295475_1471025518373_AnnotationImage--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="CueThink's Student Annotations"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students viewing thinklet solutions and giving feedback, enabling them to build digital citizenry</div> <div class="imageCredit">CueThink</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sheela&nbsp;Sethuraman</div> <div class="imageTitle">CueThink's Student Annotations</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
