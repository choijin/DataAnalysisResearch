<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to provide important experimental information on the fundamental structure of both free protons and neutrons (nucleons) and those bound inside the atomic nucleus.  When scattering leptons from nucleons with large momentum transfer the process can be described within perturbative QCD in which the scattering takes place on an asymptotically free quark with a well defined longitudinal momentum distribution.  On the other hand, the quarks are confined inside mesons and baryons, and at low momentum transfer it is these composite particles which are the effective degrees of freedom.  One focus of this research is on better understanding the transition between these regimes.  In particular, this grant will support work on a precision determination of the magnetic elastic form factor of the proton to large momentum transfer to study the transition to perturbative scaling, in addition to a measurement of the F_2 structure function of the proton and deuteron at large Bjorken-x, for which most of the nucleon momentum is carried by a single valence quark.  The former experiment will be performed in Jefferson Lab experimental Hall A and the latter in Hall C. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, this research will study the modification of the nucleons in the nuclear medium, for which no generally accepted physics model currently exists.  While many studies of the ratio of structure functions measured in nuclei to those on the deuteron have been performed in electron and muon scattering, practically no experimental data exists for neutrino scattering.  Such data would provide important tests of models of medium modifications and will be the focus of the upcoming MINERvA medium energy beam run, while the continuing analysis of the successfully concluded low energy run is primarily focused on elastic scattering and resonance production.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;From a broader perspective, this project aims to further elucidate the structure of the nuclear constituents of ordinary matter via new experimental data.  While, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) has been accepted as the theory of the strong interaction, which is responsible for confining the constituent quarks and gluons into the composite hadrons which make up ordinary matter, many questions of the resulting structure still remain.These studies will be performed with complementary probes via the electromagnetic interaction, utilizing the electron beam at Jefferson Lab, and the weak interaction, utilizing a neutrino beam in the MINERvA experiment at Fermilab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both Jefferson Lab experiments are expected to be among the first performed after the energy upgrade of the accelerator.  This will leverage the significant expertise of this group to the commissioning of both Hall A and Hall C in support of these experiments, which will also broadly support the larger Jefferson Lab nuclear physics program.  It is expected that this research program will also address a critical need in the training of the next generation of researchers in physics, where African-Americans and women are both significantly under-represented.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This grant provided support for experimental research into the fundamental structure of the building blocks of ordinary matter; both the free protons and neutrons (nucleons) and those bound inside atomic nuclei.  Understanding this structure is a prerequisite for a full understanding of the world in which we live.  The objective of this research was to provide important new experimental information on the fundamental structure of the nucleons and to investigate how the structure of free nucleons is affected by their close proximity when they are bound inside the atomic nucleus by the strong nuclear force.  This was accomplished through scattering experiments utilizing beams of both charged electrons and charge-less neutrinos at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) and the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab), respectively.   The protons and neutrons are known to be composed of the fundamental charged quarks, which are bound within the nucleons by the Strong force.  Scattering measurements test our understanding of this structure in terms of the well established underlying theory of the strong interaction, Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).  However, many questions remain regarding this underlying structure.  This is due to the fundamental nature of QCD which makes answering such questions via mathematical solutions to QCD exceeding difficult.  While computational techniques for studying QCD structure with supercomputers have been steadily improving, such results must be confronted with experimental data where possible.  This project had two major goals, both of which were successfully accomplished.  The first goal was the commissioning of Experimental Hall A  at Jefferson Lab following the completion of the upgrade project to double the energy of the CEBAF electron accelerator, as well as preparation for experiment E12-07-108.  This experiment will measure the proton magnetic form factor, which encodes how the structure of the proton differs from that of a point particle.  This grant provided support allowing for both the principle investigator and a Hampton University graduate student to take leading roles in these activities, including responsibility for critical beam diagnostic equipment.  This experiment is on track to take final data during early 2016.  The second major goal was to further elucidate the nature of the modifications of nucleons in various nuclei utilizing data from the MINERvA neutrino scattering experiment.  This funding supported significant contributions by this research group to this experiment that has thus far resulted in a number of publications in peer reviewed journals.     One of the broader impacts of this grant was the development of future scientists from historically underrepresented groups, such as African-Americans and women.  This award provided support for two women finishing advanced degrees in Physics at Hampton University working on research related to the MINERvA experiment, including one Ph.D (African American) and one Master of Science.  Additionally, his grant also helped to provide exposure to cutting edge research in nuclear physics to minority undergraduate students at Hampton University, which is an Historically Black College or University.
