<AbstractNarration>The Particle and Nuclear Physics group at James Madison University aims to be a key contributor to state of the art research in Intermediate Energy Nuclear Physics while providing an outstanding educational experience for undergraduate students. The three faculty members and their students focus on research designed to explore the structure of nucleons (neutrons and protons) which are the basic building blocks of any atomic nucleus. While it is understood that nucleons are composed of three interacting (via gluon exchange) quarks (viewed as fundamental particles)  the picture of the mechanisms that give rise and govern the evolution of multi-quark systems (protons, neutrons, nuclei) is not yet complete. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group participates in studies aimed at clarifying this picture by charting the structure of nuclei and nucleons using electron, muon, and photon probes. Group members are deeply involved in the efforts of building the hardware (detector development), software, as well as the organizational infrastructure needed to carry out this research program. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently the group is actively involved in ongoing research at Jefferson Lab in experimental Halls A, B, and C (inclusive electron scattering off the nucleon, duality studies, strangeness production) and Fermilab (the muon gyromagnetic constant, g-2). Additionally, the JMU-PNP group members are key participants in detector and software development (Hall C: scintillator hodoscope detector, ROOT/C++ data analysis code; Hall B: forward tagger, preshower calorimeter) that is part of the 12 GeV energy upgrade at Jefferson Lab and are principal investigators on experiments that will take advantage of this upgrade. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group's success can be measured through the number of publications, signaling the deepening of our understanding of subnuclear matter. Equally as important success can be gauged also through the number of undergraduate students that gain invaluable experience by pursuing research in our group.</AbstractNarration>

Three  JMU undergraduates joined Dr. Niculescu for the final assembly effort  on the Hall C floor and subsequent testing on the SHMS detector frame.  Advancing the frontiers of science in terms of uncovering the underlying structure of matter has been the principle goal of particle and nuclear physics.  Recently a hint of "new physics" was uncovered in an experiment that measured the magnetic character of a muon.  The muon is considered to be a fundamental particle and, as such, there is a very precise prediction of what magnetic properties it should exhibit.  The new g-2 experiment at Fermilab is seeking to explore this anomolous behavior and verify by a very exact measurement of the muons magnetic moment that our accepted model of matter is not complete.  This would be a very exciting result and one anticapted by many theorists.To date the first successful step in this endeavor has been acheived.  The experiment has been built and been able to record the first data. Over the next few years there will be a major effort to complete the measurement and reach the proposed goals so as to test the validity of our current theories.    After many years of design, testing, construction and installation the CLAS12 detector of Jefferson Lab is prepared to go online and record its first data.  The complex system of elements is capable of measuring the interaction of a high energy electron with a nuclear target.  Trajectories, energy, momentum, and charge of the particles involved in these interaction will provide insight into the structure of nucleon and nuclei. The next few years promise an exciting look into the way quarks and gluons interact.  The experiments should provide a testing ground for theories, resolve and clear up ambigutites and perhaps find evidence for new forms of matter.
