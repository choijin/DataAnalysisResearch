<AbstractNarration>This Postdoctoral Research Fellowship award to Dr. Mark A. Kaemingk is supported by both the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Office of International Science and Engineering at the National Science Foundation. During the 24-month fellowship, Dr. Kaemingk will work on a project titled, "Recruitment Dynamics of Galaxias maculatus in the Oceanic Phase: Addressing the 'Uncharted' Patterns of Larval Dispersal" under the sponsorship of Dr. Jeffrey Shima at Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Galaxias maculatus, a fish species of cultural and economic importance to the people of New Zealand, are experiencing declining populations. Much of the current knowledge of this fish pertains to its freshwater life stage. There is limited information during the 2-3 months when the fish larvae and juveniles inhabit the ocean.  This research aims to enhance the understanding of the early life stages by investigating mortality rates, growth rates, and potential factors influencing the dispersal patterns during the marine life stage.  The fish species will be sampled as larvae as they exit the rivers and streams into the ocean, and as juveniles when they return from the ocean and re-enter the rivers and streams.  Otoliths, or ear stones, will be removed from both larval and juvenile fish and examined to determine important parameters (e.g., age, growth, mortality, duration of ocean life stage, natal stream or river) that will provide a better understanding of this fish species' life history in a marine environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; As part of this research, Maori and Pacific undergraduate students (under-represented groups within New Zealand) will be trained on this project. Research results on G. maculatus population dynamics will also be shared within the local Maori groups through informational presentations.  The results from this research has the potential of improving the care and management of this important fish species. There is also a potential that knowledge gained from this research can be used to inform the management of similar fish species (like salmon found in the Northwest).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; This award provides a unique opportunity for a US scientist to collaborate with foreign scientists, and utilize the unique facilities, expertise and experimental conditions available abroad.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Galaxias maculatus or inanga, a fish species of cultural and economic importance to the people of New Zealand, are experiencing declining populations. Much of the current knowledge of this fish pertains to its freshwater life stage.  The results of this study provided valuable information concerning the marine life stage, which represents the early life stages &ndash; often the most critical and highest mortality period for fishes.  Project outcomes challenged previous ideas and concepts about why this species has a marine dependency, especially during such an important developmental stage. The ability for this species to disperse across the ocean and recolonize isolated islands, as larvae, was previously deemed one of the most important attributes.  This research supports that retention, or larvae that were produced locally may return to local rivers, could be equally as important for this species.  Study findings indicate that ocean returning inanga collected from rivers in close proximity are very different from each other, suggesting that they spent much of their pelagic larval duration in different environments.  Inanga migrating to nearby embayment watersheds are smaller, older, exhibit slower growth, experience lower mortalities, and are isotopically different relative to fish recruiting to nearby open coast watersheds.  These distinct developmental histories for inanga, provide evidence that harbors (e.g. embayments, estuaries) may provide substantial retention (or entrainment) of larvae. Furthermore, larval behavior and growth during the marine life stage suggests that fresh water may be preferred and beneficial immediately upon hatch.  This challenges previous thinking that the marine environment was required for the survival of this species.  Collectively, future conservation and management efforts should consider these new insights and outline specific strategies that incorporate spatially diverse populations and divergent migration strategies.     As part of this research, several students gained experience with the scientific process and developed professional skills for their future careers.  In particular, five New Zealand students acquired knowledge and experience through this research that allowed eventual placement within a graduate program where they continue to develop their skills and training.  These students also presented findings from this research at an international marine science conference.  The information was also shared at several public outreach events, which included Maori, fisherman, local landowners, school groups (K-12), and others interested in learning more about inanga.  Learning modules and case studies are being developed from the results of this study to train future scientists so they are equipped to address complex social-ecological problems.  The results from this research will also improve the care and management of this important and threatened fish species.  Knowledge gained from this research can be used to inform the management of similar migratory fish species, which represent a broad group of fishes worldwide.
