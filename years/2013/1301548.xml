<AbstractNarration>The project is about connections of combinatorics and geometry with the rest of mathematics. There are three main phenomena that the PI plans to investigate. The first is the appearance of rigid geometric structures as answers (or conjectured answers) to Tur√°n- and Ramsey-type problems. Here, the goal is to understand why these structures appear, and to find a systematic way to go from a combinatorial problem to such a structure. The second phenomenon arises in the problems of approximation of large point sets. Here, the two sides of the problem lead to two different areas: the lower bounds to algebraic topology, and the upper bounds to logic. The PI will work on extending the existing techniques, with a goal of perfecting them to the point of eliminating the guesswork that they currently require. The final phenomenon concerns geometric incidence problems. The PI will try to generalize the existing topological approaches to finite field setting. The motivation here is the superficial similarity between the proofs in Euclidean space, such as the resolution of the distinct distance problem, and the proofs of sum-product-type results for dense sets in the finite field setting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to strengthen the ties of combinatorics with areas of mathematics that are not commonly linked with combinatorics.  Besides the immediate benefit of making progress on concrete combinatorial problems, the aim is to create bridges that will allow specialists in different fields to share insights. Furthermore, geometry is able to appeal to our imagination directly, and consequently can serve as a catalyst in combinatorial education.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main results of the project fall into two areas: subsequences in words, and the role of algebraic constructions in combinatorial mathematics.     Sequences of symbols are ubiqutious in sciences, from DNA to communication codes. One often needs to understand the results of deleting and inserting symbols in such sequences. In the case of DNA, this could be the result of mutations, whereas in the case of communication codes it could be result of a faulty transmission.  A need to understand sequences also comes from within mathematics. For instance, our interest in subsequences was originally motivated by an application to discrete geometry, an area whose primary applications are to computational problems, such as those in geoinformation systems.     The work on subsequences consisted of three papers. Most notably, we constructed new error-correcting codes. These codes can sucessfully transmit information in presence of more transmission failures that any previous code1. We also solved the discrete geometric problem that was the catalyst of our work.     The second contribution related to algebraic and geometric constructions in combinatorics. Combinatorics studies very unstructured objects such as graphs (=networks) and finite sets. Algebra and geometry, on the other hand, study highly structured, usually very symmetric objects. It is thus surprising that quite a few results and constructions in combinatorics are algebraic.     Five publications in this project dealt with understanding this problem. The main contribution here is a combinatorial explanation of the appearance of geometric constructions in the problem of finding large graphs not containing a given subgraph.     Among other works in this project,  of particular appeal is the work on equiangular lines. This problems asks for the maximum number of lines passing through the same point such that any two meet at the same angle. In the plane the maximum is 3, whereas in the 3-space it is 6. The analogous problem in higher dimensions is interesting because of the connections to spectral graph theory. The version of this question for complex numbers is of relevance in quantum information theory. We showed that in the largest configuration of equiangular lines in a high-dimensional space, the lines must be almost perpendicular to each other!     Footnote:  1Technically, the 'transmission failures' here refer to deletions, i.e., the situation when some parts of the message are not received, and the recepient does not know which parts are absent. There are other kinds of communication failures, such as noise (parts of message are altered) and erasures (whereby the receipient knows which parts got lost). Our work treats only deletions.
