<AbstractNarration>This REU site will actively involve students in all phases of exciting, applied geophysical research using modern field equipment and computer processing/interpretation tools.  The program will begin with learning some advanced geophysical theory and applications through lectures, discussions and demonstrations, and scientific research practices.  These activities will be followed by data collection in the field, data analysis/processing, and modeling/interpretation. Students will work with faculty, teaching assistants, and industry experts in geophysical surveys such as seismic reflection and refraction, gravity, magnetics, temperature logging (geothermal studies), and electromagnetics.  Each student will also complete data processing, interpretation and modeling of a selected geophysical data set and makes reports (oral and written) on their research and results.  Additional research experience is included in a follow-up workshop in January.  Typically, more than half of the REU students will also supported, for professional development, to attend a scientific to present their results in a poster or oral presentation. The REU site will engage up to 12 rising seniors in a 4-week field research experience, followed by a 1-week data modeling effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The geophysical research for this year will include our basin-scale studies of the Rio Grande rift (RGR) area and archaeological geophysics studies of the San Marcos Pueblo site where we have been collecting and interpreting data for several years.  The basin-scale geophysical work in 2014 will extend an existing SAGE RGR transect to the West into the deepest part of the Santo Domingo basin of the RGR.  The profile is just west of the Santo Domingo Pueblo.  We will be working on Pueblo land and will have some Santo Domingo Pueblo students (and most likely some Cochiti Pueblo students - for a total of six Pueblo students) participating in seven days of the REU program to provide them with and introduction to the geology of the RGR and New Mexico and introduce them to geophysical and geological field work and methods.  The 2014 field area and geophysical research will also target geothermal exploration through temperature logging and analysis.  Our profile is in an area of thick tertiary sediments that are likely to have low thermal conductivity that could cause temperature anomalies.  The profile is also immediately adjacent to an area of young volcanic centers so we will have some interesting geothermal data to interpret and compare with our other geophysical results. This project is supported in collaboration with the Department of Energy, Office of Geothermal Technologies Program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ SAGE (Summer of Applied Geophysical Experience) is a summer research and education program that has been operating since 1983.  The four week, intensive, summer program is based in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and involves students in learning geophysical theory and applications; collection of geophysical field data in the northern Rio Grande Rift area; data processing, modeling and interpretation; and presentation (oral and written) of results of each student?s research results. Students (undergraduates, graduates and professionals) and SAGE faculty are together on a school campus for the 4-week, intensive summer program. Successful strategies (developed over the years) of the program include teamwork experience, mentoring of undergraduate students (by faculty and more senior students), cultural interchange due to students from many campuses across the U.S. and international graduate students, including industry visitors who work with the students and provide networking, a capstone experience of the summer program that includes all students making a "professional-meeting" style presentation of their research and submitting a written report, a follow-up workshop for the undergraduate students to enhance and broaden their experience, and providing professional development for the students through oral or poster presentations and attendance at a professional meeting.  Twenty-five students (16 NSF/REU undergraduate students, five graduate students, two international undergraduate students, one international graduate student, and one geosciences professional) participated in SAGE 2015 in the Rio Grande rift area of New Mexico.  Geophysical field work (2 days of near-surface geophysics at an archaeological site and 6 days of basin-scale geophysics in the Santo Domingo basin and the Buckman area of the Espa&ntilde;ola basin northwest of Santa Fe) provided significant new seismic refraction and reflection, electromagnetic, ground penetrating radar, temperature logging, magnetic and gravity data.  All students gained experience with the theory and principles of applied geophysical techniques and with all of the geophysics field equipment and methods as well as surveying for accurate gravity station locations using differential GPS.  SAGE 2015 also included three days of geology field trips, one day of seismic basin analysis (a short course presented by Orla McLaughlin and Tonya Brami of ExxonMobil) and five days of data processing, modeling, interpretation, and written and oral report preparation.  The last two days of the program were devoted to student presentations of their research results.  Each student selected at least one geophysical technique and data set for a research project.  The students were also organized into teams (each of the five teams included the various geophysical methods) and presented their individual and integrated interpretations of the SAGE 2015 data.  Three abstracts and poster presentations by SAGE students and faculty co-authors, reporting the 2015 research results, were presented at the Fall 2015 American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco, CA.  Results of the 2015 geophysical surveys include improved imaging of the San Francisco fault and gravity and seismic determination that the depth of the Santo Domingo basin is approximately 6 km.  In addition, SAGE faculty published a paper in The Leading Edge on the SAGE program and training of future geoscientists.
