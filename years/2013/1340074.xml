<AbstractNarration>Through this capacity building project Fort Berthold Community College (FBCC) is developing the infrastructure to support future Noyce Scholars to serve the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation, located in northwestern North Dakota.  The goal is to establish the capacity to produce K-12 STEM teachers who complete a Master of Science in Science Education (MSSE) degree and serve the high-needs reservation schools of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara (MHA) Nation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project integrates an MHA culture context into its activities, and thus potentially transforms the way STEM teachers are prepared to teach Native populations.  Specifically, the project activities include: 1) conducting a needs assessment to increase the pool of MSSE applicants, 2) developing a recruitment plan for future Noyce Scholars serving in high-needs, K-12 reservation schools, 3) conducting research regarding an MHA traditional environmental knowledge and educational pedagogy in K-12 science, 4) creating and pilot testing a culturally rich MHA K-12 science curriculum, 5) expanding the existing FBCC Teacher Education Program to enable individuals with at least a STEM Bachelors degree to meet K-12 teacher licensure requirements in North Dakota, 6) creating a bridge to support graduate level and distance learning challenges for future Noyce Scholars seeking an MSEE, and 7) establishing procedures at Montana State University (MSU) and FBCC to monitor compliance with required coursework completion and teaching commitment required for a Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses the need for well-prepared STEM teachers at reservation schools. Ten potential Noyce Scholars from the region participate in a four-week internship to pilot test a culturally based, hands-on science curriculum.  Additionally, a collaborative team of stakeholders that includes FBCC and MSU faculty, MHA Elders, and teachers from local school districts (New Town, Parshall, Mandaree, White Shields, and Twin Buttes) are engaged in project activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nueta Hidatsa Sahnish College, formerly Fort Berthold Community College, recieved a NOYCE Capacity Building grant entitled "Fort Berthold Bridge to Master of Science in Science Education (FBB-MSSE) Project" effective October 1, 2013.  The project was originally intended to be two years, but the insitution received a one year no-cost extension for the completion date of August 31, 2016.    The primary objective of the planning grant was to establish a collaborative Master's Degree in Education for STEM undergraduate majors or career changers to become secondary high school teachers.  The original collaboration was with Montana State University, but was changed to a collaboration with North Dakota State University because of better local access and cooperation.    Achievements of the project include:   A large advisory committee consisting of local tribal elders, K-12 administrators and teachers, and NHSC undergraduate STEM and education students was created and remained active for the duration of the program to advise on cultural and educational matters. An extensive database of K-12 Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara culturally related educational materials.  This database is now avaialble at all local K-12 Fort Berthold schools and the NHSC Singing Springs Library. A survey was conducted of interested STEM graduates, STEM professionals, STEM undergraduates, and education majors to create a pool of potential NOYCE scholarship applicants.   A relationship was developed with the North Dakota State University Education Department, including the retention of a department administrator to assist the planning grant with the Master's Degree process.  Results of this collaboration included recruitment, acceptance, and transfer processes for future students, as well as the creation of a Master's of Education degree plan that included three MHA culturally relevant Teacher Education STEM courses.   As part of the proposed Master's Degree in Education, three MHA culturally relevant courses were developed including: The Biological Sciences of the MHA Nation, The Physical Sciences of the MHA Nation, and The History of the Three Affiliated Tribes for Teachers.   NHSC plans to continue the majority of educationally related activities that were initiated by the NOYCE planning grant.  The culturally relevant classes and modules of them will be incorporated into existing NHSC courses.  The History of the Three Affiliated Tribes for Teachers will be offered every semester for local new teachers hired in Fort Berthold K-12 schools.  In addition, NHSC will continue to assist local STEM graduates in pursuing Master's Degrees in secondary education.
