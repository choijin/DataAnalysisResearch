<AbstractNarration>Sleep is essential for health, daily functioning, and development.  Yet, nearly 80% of 9th- and 97% of 12th-grade adolescents are chronically sleep-deprived.  The adverse effects of sleep disturbance are especially pronounced for racial/ethnic minorities who consistently report poorer sleep hygiene. Hence, sleep can be added to a long list of areas in which racial/ethnic minorities suffer from disparities. Sleep disturbance may be a major cause of health and academic disparities among racial/ethnic minority adolescents.  Sleep disturbance, health, and academic outcomes are also correlated with experiences of racial/ethnic discrimination, particularly among African American and Hispanic/Latino youth.  This study explores whether sleep disturbance influences the relationships among racial discrimination, health and academic outcomes in this high-risk population.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Are youth with greater sleep disturbance more likely to exhibit a negative impact of discrimination on health and achievement?  This 4-year study will follow adolescents through high school to understand the ways that social and sleep-related factors influence the associations among racial/ethnic discrimination, health and academic outcomes.  By collecting daily reports of discrimination, actigraphy (wristband monitor) measures of sleep, tri-annual reports of health and academic outcomes, and an index of school racial/ethnic diversity, the study investigates: (a) the effects of racial/ethnic discrimination on health and academic outcomes, (b) if sleep disturbance explains the link between racial discrimination and health and academic outcomes, (c) whether having a positive racial/ethnic identity influences how racial discrimination is related to sleep disturbance, and (d) how school ethnic/racial diversity is related to health and academic outcomes.  Today, ethnic minorities already comprise 53% of Americans under age 18 and this number is projected to grow.  The fact that historically minority groups are experiencing numerical majority status has the potential to redefine race relations.  This study explores whether sleep may help protect minority adolescents against the negative effects of racial discrimination and stress.</AbstractNarration>

The study led to several novel outcomes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>First, the study documented where Black, Latinx adolescents suffer sleep disparities. Compared to Latinx youth, Black youth slept an average of over 30 minutes less each night (Figure 1) and reported the worst quality sleep (Figure 2). However, compared to Black adolescents, Latinx youth reported the highest levels of sleep disturbance (Figure 3). Second, the data suggest that daily experiences of racial/ethnic discrimination were associated with same-day compromises in sleep duration and quality such as more sleep disturbance, more next-day daytime dysfunction, and higher levels of next-day sleepiness (Figure 4). Further, compromised sleep duration and quality were associated with subsequent levels of elevated anxiety, depressive symptoms, and somatic symptoms. &nbsp;In other words, the study suggests that sleep disturbances serve as an explanatory pathway linking the stress of unfair treatment and discrimination to daily health challenges through sleep disturbances. Over time, the data suggest that the stronger the association between discrimination and sleep, the more likely adolescents were to suffer from lower levels of positive mood, and higher levels of negative mood, anxiety and depressive symptoms one year later.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></p> <p>The broader impacts of this study contribute to NSF's mission in several ways. First, the study underscores the importance of sleep for adolescent populations. There is growing national concern over declining sleep duration and quality during adolescence, and the current study links these declines to social experiences of racial/ethnic discrimination. Second, at a time when race relations are especially salient in the United States, this study highlights the very damaging impact of discrimination for Black and Latinx youth, both on a daily basis, and for their subsequent development. In addition, the research provides an evidence base for informing interventions aimed to mitigate health and academic disparities. Specifically, by identifying the importance of sleep disturbance as an intermediary link between discrimination and developmental outcomes, the data suggest that interventions targeting sleep and sleep behaviors may help to interrupt pathways between discrimination stress and youth development. Finally, the project provided a fertile and one-of-a-kind training opportunity for students ranging from high school juniors to early career scholars, through engaging with data collection, data analysis and presentations, and publications.
