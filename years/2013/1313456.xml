<AbstractNarration>The long-standing question of how our Solar System reached its current configuration can be addressed by a range of theoretical models, each of which makes predictions about the origins of the small bodies of the outer Solar System. The compositions of those small bodies, which are indicators of their origins, are usually studied using either broadband photometry, which has low diagnostic power, or spectroscopy, which is highly diagnostic but expensive. The Principal Investigator (PI) and his team will use a novel technique of ultra-low resolution spectroscopy to measure the icy surface compositions of outer Solar System objects. In this technique the ultra-low resolution spectra are heavily binned into custom "pseudo-filters," allowing for rapid diagnostic measurements. The team will conduct a large-scale survey, using telescopes in Hawaii, Chile, and South Africa, to determine the surface compositions of some 250 outer Solar System bodies-- the largest such survey to date. The results will place strong constraints on the evolution of the outer Solar System and the dynamical flow of material within and from the Kuiper Belt. Broader impacts include the commissioning of new observing modes on several telescopes; visits by the PI to schools in South Africa during his sabbatical in Year 2 of the project; and efforts to establish cross-cultural connections between South African schools and US counterparts in Arizona.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The scientific goals of this project were to measure the compositions of faint bodies in the outer Solar System with a new observational technique. We used telescopes in Hawai`i, Chile, and South Africa to obtain data at very low signal-to-noise ratio. We demonstrated that this low fidelity data is sufficient for broad-brush compositional characterization. Although in this project we were hampered by instrument failures and poor weather, we nevertheless observed more than 50 objects. A paper presenting our results is in preparation and will be published after the performance period of this project is over. The intellectual merit of this project is the creation of a composition map of the outer Solar System that probes to smaller bodies than are typically observed. These compositions can be used to constrain models of the history of the Solar System. The broader impact of this project has two aspects. First, we have demonstrated the successful use of a new technique, and thus open the possibility that researchers in other fields could use this technique for a range of research projects and observe targets that would otherwise be too faint. Second, during the time that the PI was on sabbatical in Cape Town, South Africa, and working on this project, he established a cross-cultural connection by helping primary school students in South Africa and in Flagstaff, Arizona, to create and exchange a series of video postcards.
