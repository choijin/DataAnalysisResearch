<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;PI: Ramprasad, Ramamurthy&lt;br/&gt;Proposal number: 1338421&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Connecticut&lt;br/&gt;Title: EAGER: Accelerating catalyst discovery using systematic first principles chemical space explorations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vision underlying this project is to create an integrated paradigm based on high throughput&lt;br/&gt;first principles density functional theory computations to accelerate the discovery and design&lt;br/&gt;of next-generation oxide catalysts for chemical reactions involving oxygen chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;The PI will focus on chemical modifications of ceria through doping with elements across the Periodic Table&lt;br/&gt;(45 in all, including K-As, Rb-Sb, and Cs-Bi), assess the stability of the dopants in ceria,&lt;br/&gt;and interrogate the propensity of the dopant to alter chemical reactions involving H2O, CO,&lt;br/&gt;CO2, O2 and H2. In other words, the intent is to rapidly screen for dopants in ceria that&lt;br/&gt;can significantly enhance the water-gas shift reaction (WGS: CO + H2O -&gt; CO2 + H2).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WGS is an integral unit operation in industrial chemical processes to manufacture ammonia,&lt;br/&gt;methanol, hydrocarbons, and hydrogen. The reaction is slightly exothermic (enthalpy of reaction&lt;br/&gt;= -41.1 kJ/mol) and the equilibrium favors product formation at low temperature. However,&lt;br/&gt;the kinetics on typical catalysts are slow at low temperature. The currently employed Cu-based&lt;br/&gt;ceria-supported WGS catalysts are cheap. However, they have a number of disadvantages in terms&lt;br/&gt;of operation, stability and propensity for deactivation due to S and Cl. As a result, rigorous&lt;br/&gt;(and expensive) operator training has become inevitable to prolong the life of the commercial&lt;br/&gt;WGS catalysts. In contrast, the relatively expensive noble metal catalysts, such as Pt, Pd,&lt;br/&gt;Rh, Ru, have high intrinsic activity. High cost has hindered their implementation in industrial-scale&lt;br/&gt;WGS processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an attempt to identify many more promising WGS catalyst systems,&lt;br/&gt;the PI will use first principles density functional theory (DFT), performed in a "high-throughput"&lt;br/&gt;manner to allow him to rapidly consider an array of metallic dopant elements in ceria&lt;br/&gt;spanning the Periotic Table (45 in all, including K-As, Rb-Sb, and Cs-Bi). This is the first&lt;br/&gt;step in a hierarchy of screening procedures before a detailed assessment can be made on a few selected cases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts :&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aside from enhancing the fundamental understanding of WGS, the project will provide a knowledge base&lt;br/&gt;to tackle complex chemistry interactions that could lead to breakthroughs in optimum catalyst&lt;br/&gt;development, even for well-established and well-known chemical processes. In the long-term,&lt;br/&gt;this investigation could aid in the fundamental understanding of informatics-based rational&lt;br/&gt;catalyst design for enhanced stability and performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Industrial experience of the PI will enhance the engineering education of students and will&lt;br/&gt;aid in broadening student exposure beyond the academic environment. The PI will integrate&lt;br/&gt;quantum mechanical modeling techniques, and their applications in catalysis, into multiple courses.</AbstractNarration>
