<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Levi M. Stanley of Iowa State University is developing new catalytic methods for the synthesis and functionalization of heterocyclic compounds.  The research involves the development of metal-catalyzed alkene hydroacylation reactions and additions of aldehydes across alkenes, to enable the synthesis and functionalization of nitrogen heterocycles.  This research program encompasses the identification and development of transition-metal catalysts that control regioselectivity and enantioselectivity of the alkene hydroacylation reactions.  This award is supporting educational programs led by Professor Stanley to expand the Chemistry Learning Community for upper-level chemistry students to improve retention, achievement, and engagement among chemistry students at Iowa State University and the implementation of an authentic research experience with practical applications through an experimental organic chemistry laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on the establishment of alkene hydroacylation reactions as a platform to synthesize, and further functionalize, classes of medicinally important nitrogen heterocycles.  The broader impacts of this work include potential societal benefits from the discovery of heterocyclic compounds with new and/or improved properties and the identification of catalyst design principles leading to more stable and selective catalyst structures.  The project provides opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to gain experience in modern synthetic organic and organometallic chemistry research while improving retention, achievement, and engagement through expansion of the Chemistry Learning Community at Iowa State University.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Realization of the research goals in this proposal provided a vareity of tangible benefits to the scientific community and general public.  First, the studies enabled rapid access to a variety of new molecular architectures, many of which have not been synthesized, and whose biological effects have not been explored.  Second, the pursuit of the research goals led to new catalyst design parameters that overcome previous limitations and establish new reactivity and selectivity patterns for alkene functionalization reactions.  These discoveries led to the synthesis of a number of classes of important nitrogen and oygen heterocycles. Furthermore, the knowledge gained from these studies enabled the development of new reaction types, including novel alkene difunctionalization reactions, that provide new tools for the scientific community to generate important compounds. Finally, pursuit of the research goals provided graduate and undergraduate students with the opportunity to develop advanced skills in the areas of organic synthesis, catalysis, and molecular analysis that will be critical as they mature into independent scientists destined for academic, industrial, and governmental positions.   This project led to the identification and development transition metal catalysts for alkene hydroacylation reactions.  The reactions developed generate chiral polycyclic heterocycles that can be further elaborated into biologically and medicinally important compounds.  The completed studies impacted the development of alkene functionalization reactions by generating knowledge and catalyst design principles that 1) lowered the loadings of expensive catalysts necessary for the key alkene functionalization reactions, 2) eliminated the need for ancillary functionality to stabilize the metal catalysts, 3) enabled the expansion of the alkene reactions a variety of heterocyclic compounds, and 4) served as a bridge to the development of new alkene difunctionalization reactions catalyzed by nickel.  Each of these contributions represents significant advances in the area of alkene functionalization and for the greater synthetic chemistry community.  The educational component of this project comprised two parts.  The first part of the education activities established and grew a new learning community that improved retention and achievement by fostering engagement and community among sophomore-to-senior chemistry students through academic activities, research activities, and outreach activities in the Iowa State community and outside of the campus structure. The second part of the educational activities led to the incorporation of an authentic research experience into the undergraduate organic curriculum that provides a springboard for students to access research opportunities at Iowa State University and beyond.
