<AbstractNarration>The overarching goal of the project is to understand the power and limitations of algebraic computation, and the main foci are the problems of showing lower bounds for arithmetic circuits and polynomial identity testing. These problems have played a central role in various areas of Theoretical Computer Science, and they form the algebraic analog of the P vs NP question. This project will develop several new approaches and techniques for advancing our understanding of both questions. Algebraic techniques have also seen several unexpected connections in pseudorandomness and coding theory. The potential of these methods is still far from understood. In this project the PI will develop these methods, in particular the method of multiplicities and partial derivatives, to give more powerful lower bounds, and new strengthened constructions of pseudorandom objects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research direction proposed in this project brings together ideas and tools from a broad array of disciplines and witnesses a lot of fruitful interaction between mathematics, computational complexity, as well as practical applications to information storage and retrieval. The PI will disseminate research findings by giving lectures, talks and developing new courses and making the material available online. The PI will be actively involved in mentoring young researchers, including high school students and minorities, who want to pursue research in Theoretical Computer Science. The PI will also organize a specialized workshop for women in Theoretical Computer Science, which will bring together women researchers from all over the world.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This project attempted to understand the power and limitations of algebraic computation. By developing new techniques, several results were obtained related to showing lower bounds for arithmetic circuits  and the intimately related problems of polynomial identity testing, polynomial factoring and polynomial reconstruction. Algebraic techniques developed also led to new and efficient constructions of error correcting codes.   One of the most significant contributions of this project was the first superpolynomial and then the first exponential lower bound for homogenous depth 4 arithmetic circuits over all fields. Via depth reduction results, it is known that any improvement in the exponent for these lower bounds would suffice in proving super polynomial lower bounds for general arithmetic circuits, and hence resolve the arithmetic analog of the P vs NP question.  Another important highlight was the construction of efficient high rate locally correctable and locally testable codes. These are codes which allow for representation of the data in an error resistant format, with low redundancy, and at the same time enable extremely efficient sublinear time access to the data even in the presence of errors.   Some other highlights were the first efficient deterministic algorithm for factoring sparse polynomials with any constant bounded individual degree, and the first efficient reconstruction algorithm for depth 4 multilinear circuits of any constant top fanin.   This project has enabled the PI to mentor 4 graduate students, 3 of who have graduated and have obtained positions in academia, and one who is continuing his PhD. The PI has also  co-organized a specialized workshop for women in Theoretical Computer Science every two years,which brings together women researchers from all over the world. The research results developed as part of this project have been presented at workshops, conferences and seminars and have appearing in peer reviewed journals.
