<AbstractNarration>In this Award from the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability Fellows (SEES Fellows Program), Dr. Chinmay Soman from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will investigate how the soil microbiome is influenced by different kinds of agricultural practices.  This award has support from: the Directorate for Biological Sciences, the Directorate for Geological Sciences, and the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will combine modern genetic measurements of the soil microbiomes of agricultural land subject to a variety of agricultural practices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of studies like that proposed in this work is to help inform efforts to develop methods for sustainable agriculture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Soman will be working with collaborators Prof. Angela Kent of the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign as well as Prof. Zhili He, Associate Director of the Institute for Environmental Genomics at the University of Oklahoma.  The work will also include the efforts of: Prof. Amy Ando with the Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics; Prof. Richard Mulvaney with the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences; and Prof. Luis Rodriguez with the Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, all at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported under the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability Fellows (SEES Fellows) program, with the goal of helping to enable discoveries needed to inform actions that lead to environmental, energy and societal sustainability while creating the necessary workforce to address these challenges. With SEES Fellows support, this project will enable a promising early career researcher to establish themselves in an independent research career related to sustainability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship enabled the principle investigator (PI) - Dr. Chinmay Soman - to develop new methods for studying how microbiomes -- the complex communities of bacteria, fungi, and archaea -- that surround plant roots and reside in farm soils can interact with agricultural plants such as corn. Using these methods, we have demonstrated that it is possible to study the effects of agricultural management practices on the plant interactive functional capabilities of agricultural microbiomes and that they can be different from the effects found with traditional community composition methods such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In other words, this research demonstrates that it is important to directly examine what microbial communities can do, not just which microbes they are composed of, to understand and optmize the potential benefits of microbiomes to agriculture.  The PI received invaluable support and mentoring from Prof. Angela Kent at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign to successfully carry out the research and professional development objectives of the project as well as technical support from Prof Zhili He at University of Oklahoma.  Microbial communities are an integral part of agriculture - with both significant beneficial and harmful effects possible - but are very poorly understood. Optimizing the benefits of microbiomes to agriculture could substantially improve their contribution to enhancing agricultural productivity, profitability, and sustainability.  We expanded the GeoChip functional gene microarray to enable quantification of the diversity and abundance of a broad range of microbial genes potentially involved in plant beneficial functions - including those that can promote plant growth, impart resistance to diseases, improve stress tolerance, help with nutrient acquisition, or are involved in plant-bacterial interaction.  Characterizing microbial communities around corn roots using the enhanced GeoChip microarray, we found that the potential functions of microbial communities - as measured by the diversity and abundance of genes driving various functions - can vary independently of the composition of the community, when subject to crop rotation, fertilization, or time. This implies that in order to optimize the benefits of microbial communities to agriculture, it is important to study their functional gene composition since it may not always be inferred directly from the comunity composition. In other words, in order to improve the benefits of microbiomes to agriculture, it is important to directly examine what the microbial communities can do, not just which microbes they are composed of.   These scientific results and improved tools will enable academic and industrial scientists to investigate how agricultural microbial communities can be optimized - for example by changing fertilization and crop rotation treatments - for improving agricultural sustainability and profitability.  In addition to the research objectives, the project also funded postdoctoral professional development training for the PI in new research techniques, knowledge of microbial community ecology, grant writing, and scientific communication to experts and to people outside the field. As a result, the PI is well equipped to conduct cutting edge research to help improve agricultural sustainability.  For example, the PI, in collboration with Prof. Angela Kent has invented a novel method for identifying plant genetic traits that enables plants to recruite and manitain beneficial communities of microbes. We are currently carrying out preliminary work with support from the University of Illinois. We aim to develop this technology for licensing by seed companies.  Finally, the PI, collaborating with Prof Posy Busby -another NSF SEES Postdoctoral Fellow - and with additional funding from NSF, organized a meeting of experts in the field of plant microbiomes. This meeting has served to strengthen professional networks and established high-priority research directions for improving the benefits of microbiomes to agriculture.  Dr Soman is now the co-founder and CEO of EarthSense, Inc. which is creating advanced technologies using machine learning and robotics for improving crop breeding, agricultural productivity, and sustainability.
