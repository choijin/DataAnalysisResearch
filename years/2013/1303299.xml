<AbstractNarration>This project is developing Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) Core Competencies as a foundation for developing multidisciplinary cybersecurity leadership education learning objectives and curricula guidelines.  The project is leveraging these guidelines towards the development of online cybersecurity leadership education modules, certificates and a blended online cybersecurity leadership master's degree for delivery nationwide in partnership with other universities.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal is to address the cybersecurity leadership gap in the U.S. as cybersecurity leadership expertise is limited to a small number of university graduate level cybersecurity leadership programs that bridge the technical and management skills required for cybersecurity leadership. Formally, we are exploring the following questions:  What cybersecurity leader core competencies are critical to cybersecurity leadership effectiveness?; and what organizational dimensions are factors in cybersecurity leadership success?   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is bringing together private sector, government and academic cybersecurity, IT and other executives in focus groups, workshops, forums, and online collaboration for the development of the Core Competencies, learning objectives and curricula guidelines.   The approach builds upon the U.S. Government's success in collaborating with academia and private sector in the development of CIO Core Competencies.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Finally, this project is developing a Cybersecurity Leadership Education Forum and associated board with the goal of ongoing project sustainability and for ongoing updating of the Core Competencies, learning objectives and curricula guidelines.  As a direct outcome of this project, universities in partnership with government organizations and the private sector have a set of best practices for developing cybersecurity leadership programs and measurable outcomes to compare with.</AbstractNarration>

The Core Competencies then serve as a basis to:   Develop learning objectives and curricula guidelines      for multidisciplinary cybersecurity leadership education programs; and Standardize the process of identifying, evaluating and      promoting the skills and responsibilities of a CISO.   We modeled the project on the development of CIO Core Competencies and their subsequent use, adoption and impact both in the development of CIO educational programs and also in  strengthening the role of the CIO position and elevating CIO leadership to an executive role.

To organize the competencies, we adopted a perspectives approach similar to that utilized last year by the International Academy of CIO for CIO Core Competencies.  With five perspectives, the CISO core competencies are grouped by "Individual/Personal" focusing on skills exercised on an individual basis; "Department/Team" on capabilities utilized when leading a cybersecurity team or department; "Organization" on competencies demonstrated on an organizational wide level; "Industry" on knowledge and expertise outside one?s own organization; and lastly "Technology" on skills and capabilities necessary to manage the technical aspect of a CISO?s job.   Please see below for a diagrammatic representation of the CISO Core Competencies.   The Core Competencies are being promoted for use in the development of cybersecurity leadership education programs in the U.S. and internationally and for enhancing cybersecurity leadership and governance and the consideration of cybersecurity best practices in industry and government.   We utilized the Core Competencies as a basis for developing seven cybersecurity leadership and governance workshops.  These workshops are targeted for a range of audiences including government and private sector CISOs, managers and cybersecurity practitioners, as well as non-cybersecurity and IT government and private sector executives.  In addition, we have developed a quarterly video series "Cybersecurity Leadership Shorts" which are two to three minute video interviews with cybersecurity executives highlighting aspects of cybersecurity leadership and governance.    Working with industry, government and academia, we are planning to update the CISO Core Competencies in the fourth quarter of 2017.
