<AbstractNarration>This project proposes to investigate the dynamics of silica generation and transport across a series of stream catchments within the NSF Critical Zone Observatory Network (CZO).  Solute concentrations and chemical compositions vary with stream discharge in complex ways.  In some cases, solute load varies only slightly with stream discharge.  In others, solute concentrations drop as discharge increases, showing effects of dilution, but even in these systems dilution is only partial.  If stream discharge increases while solute concentration remains near constant, then the total solute load most also increase.   An important question in hydrogeochemistry is where does this increase in solute flux come from?  Do streams simply sample "more of the same", or are new sources and pathways activated at high flow? In other words, how does water quality vary with discharge, and why? Silica (Si) is well suited for addressing this question as it is primarily sourced from rock and soil weathering reactions, and has a long history of use as a hydrologic tracer.  Investigator has previously shown that germanium/silicon ratios can be used to identify specific sources of Si in a catchment, and substantially improve the utility of Si as a tracer. Preliminary data indicate that increased in Si flux associated with high discharge activate new sources of Si.  This study will use a series of catchments at CZO sites that have similar rock type but different climate, vegetation, and hydrochemical response patterns in order to learn more about the fundamental controls on solute sources and water quality.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will provide new constraints on the geochemical and hydrological processes that control Si fluxes from granitoid weathering in the critical zone.  It will address the causes of different concentration-discharge patterns in streams, providing insight into the coupling of weathering and hydrologic processes, and providing an improved basis for hydrograph separation/flow path modeling.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will use novel geochemical tracers and the network of Critical Zone Observatories to understand some of the major controls on soil and ground water flow paths and water quality in stream catchments.  Silica is not only a useful tracer of hydrologic pathways and solute sources, but also an important buffer of stream chemistry, an important nutrient for both aquatic and terrestrial algae and plants, and is tied to the long term weathering sink of carbon dioxide.  An improved understanding of both the short term controls on water flow paths and solute loads, and the longer term controls on weathering fluxes is of broad interest. The project includes working with students and researchers from several CZOs, and will train students from other CZO teams in the measurement and use of Ge/Si as a hydrogeochemical tracer. It is expected that this will help increase the understanding and use of Ge/Si and other hydrogeochemical tracers among the Critical Zone science community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project backgroun and questions:  The ways that stream chemistry changes (or does not change) with stream flow pose a set of interesting and important questions for hydrologists and geochemists.  The dissolved substances in the stream come from interactions of precipitation as water passes through the Critical Zone, the region of interaction near the Earth surface that comprises vegetation, soils, altered and fresh bedrock, and groundwater.  Water can take many pathways through the Critical Zone (CZ), and the type of path and its duration leave chemical fingerprints in the water as it exits via streams.  Silicon is derived from weathering of rocks in the CZ, and so carries the signature of chemical weathering reactions. The element germanium behaves much like silicon, but with subtle differences that depend on the type of weathering reactions and the mineralogy of weathering.  Germanium-silicon ratios (Ge/Si) can therefore be an effective tracer for water pathways and water-rock reactions.  Stream flow can vary by more than an order of magnitude in response to precipitation, but stream chemistry generally varies less so, so when discharge increases, so do silica fluxes. Where does this increased Si flux come from, and are the sources of Si constant or do they vary with the hydrologic status of the system?  In this project we obtained geochemical and hydrologic data from a series of streams sampled by the NSF Critical Zone Observatories program and a Canadian partner, as well as an experimental ?watershed? at the Biosphere 2 Land Evolution Observatory (LEO).  We used the data to identify the sources of dissolved silica in streams, and the reactions that produce it.  Selected scientific outcomes:  One set of findings from several sites shows us that much more silica is transported as a colloidal phase than had been previously recognized.  Colloidal material consists of small particles or complexes &lt; 200 nanometers in diameter, and so it not removed by ordinary filtration techniques.  Yet it is not truly ?dissolved?, and so can have unusual behavior.  Most geochemists and hydrologists think of silica as transported either in larger particulates or in the dissolved form.  Yet we found that colloidal transport at higher flows could explain why silica concentrations varied little with discharge.  Because this nanoparticulate material is particularly reactive it is potentially important for biogeochemistry.  We also found that land use change impacts sources and fluxes of dissolved Si, by comparing two nearby Brazilian watersheds, one of which had been converted to agricultural use while the other remained in native forest.  Changes in flow paths that result from agricultural use directly translate into changes in solutes and water quality  We studied a suite of sites that had broadly similar granitic bedrock, but developed under quite different climate conditions.  In all of them the dissolution reaction of feldspar to form both dissolved silica and the clay mineral kaolinite was important, but the extent of this reaction varied quite widely depending on climate and the residence time of water in the system (roughly speaking the time for passage of water through the Critical Zone).  At the Southern Sierra CZO, with Mediterranean climate and snow-melt driven water flows, groundwater has a long residence time and this allows the clay-forming reaction to go to completion.  The result is that germanium and aluminum are almost completely retained in the new clays, along with 1/3 of the Si produced.  In contrast, at the Hakai site in British Columbia, with a wet maritime climate, clay formation is strongly inhibited and essentially what dissolves from the feldspar is what is exported to streams.  We believe that high levels of dissolved organic carbon inhibit clay formation, and so Si, Al and Ge are nearly quantitatively released, with potential downstream biogeochemical effects from the biotoxicity of aluminum.  These two end member cases are also valuable in that they allow us to test a new thermodynamically rigorous model of Ge-Si behavior we developed as part of this project.  The model can now be incorporated in larger reactive transport models used to understand and predict chemical reactions in complex settings like the Critical Zone.  Broader imopacts - student participation and training:  A number of graduate and undergraduate students from the US and our international partners participated in this project. The group included Hispanic-American students from Texas and Puerto Rico, female graduate students from Massachusetts, Chile and Spain, and undergraduates from Ohio, Virginia and New York State.

Importantly these students began to be part of the international community of scientists working in this area though working with each other and colleagues from the US, Canada, and Europe.
