<AbstractNarration>The planned I/UCRC for the Sustainable Use of Greenhouse Gases intends to undertake research aimed at advancing current theory and technology, and to become a scientific focal point within the renewables and sustainability fields. Work will include (a) novel scalable plant and algae based systems and synthetic biomimicry approaches to capture and convert CO2 and CH4 into methanol, sugars, fatty acids, and oils, (b) scalable fermentation and biohybrid catalytic approaches to up-convert these into high demand, high value industrial chemicals and fuels, (c) application of these approaches to capture and convert greenhouse gases from distributed systems (e.g., the atmosphere) and concentrated systems (e.g., flu streams from coal and gas powered generators). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through the planned center?fs addressing of industrial needs through efficient capture and up-conversion of greenhouse gases to valuable chemicals and fuels, the major threats and potential impacts of climate change may be in part ameliorated on both a sustainable and profitable basis. The planned center will develop and promote a collaborative, focused scientific community on the sustainable use of greenhouse gases, including short courses, cross?]departmental and cross?]university graduate course offerings, and internships with member organizations. The Center will recruit and train underrepresented groups (minorities, women, and students with disabilities) through various existing programs on campus as well as new programs. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this I/UCRC planning grant was to develop a collaborative proposal to establish the I/UCRC in Sustainable Use of Greenhouse Gases with Ohio State University, University of Akron and Ohio University.  The inital phase of planning process was to host a technical conference of researchers working in broad areas that address capture and conversion of greenhouse gases to value added products.  Specifically, three broad areas of focus for conversion of captured green houses gases were genetic modification of plants for biological pathways, fermenation and chemical catalysis.  In addition, methods for recovery and concentration of greenhouse gases was addressed.  The outcome of this meeting were refinement of focus areas of research.  In addition, a number of new collaborations were established between researchers at different institutions that can lead to novel projects that were beyond the scope of this project.  Two separate industry planning meetings were held to encourage intereactions with potential industrial collaborators to identify topics of interest to industrial members and focus efforts in securing commitments for membership. While there was individual interest in the general topic of recovery and conversion of greenhouse gases, the broad nature of the topic made it difficult to secure commitments for membership from potential industry members.  The team decided to not pursue submission of I/UCRC proposal because of insufficient number of industrial commitments.
