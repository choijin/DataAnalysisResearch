<AbstractNarration>Legal processes shape people's experiences of significant economic challenges.  Professional assistance is differentially available to people.  Professional assistance may allow people to engage legal processes more effectively; it can be variable by place, area of law, and time.  Legal assistance may not make a difference because the legal problems themselves are too substantial and are too deeply tied to ongoing problems.  Alternatively, legal assistance may improve outcomes for people because assistance allows better negotiation of legal processes.  This project will examine the how legal processes work for clients in one type of case.  By only examining one type of legal problem, the project will allow the investigator to draw conclusions about legal effectiveness in a way that would not be possible were the project to focus on multiple kinds of legal problems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop a unique dataset on cases, including contextual information concerning economic characteristics of places, that will be useful to researchers in the future.  In addition, the project will contribute to training in the social sciences for both the investigator and a student who will be trained on the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Emily S. Taylor Poppe has completed her doctoral dissertation, "Going it Alone: Legal Mobilization and Efficacy in the Foreclosure Crisis," supported by the NSF Dissertation Improvement Grant.  As a sociologist and lawyer, her research focuses on individuals? willingness and ability to use lawyers and the legal system to address legal problems.   Her dissertation explores this theme in the context of residential foreclosures.  More specifically, she investigates (1) whether, and in what cases, homeowners facing foreclosure hire lawyers and participate in legal proceedings, (2) whether having a lawyer makes it more likely that homeowners will avoid foreclosure, and (3) whether the reality of the process is consistent with laws governing foreclosure.   To address these questions, she used NSF funding to collect court records from a representative sample of 955 foreclosure cases initiated in New York City between 2007 and 2011.  From these records, she gathered information about the lenders, homeowners, lawyers, properties, loans, and court processes involved in each case.  She combined this information with Census data describing the characteristics of the neighborhoods where the properties are located and information about the lawyers and law firms involved.  Additionally, she observed foreclosure proceedings and interviewed participants to deepen her understanding of the foreclosure process.   She documents that not all homeowners facing foreclosure are equally likely to hire a lawyer or file an answer in response to the complaint filed by the plaintiff in the foreclosure action.  However, she finds that changes in the legal process of foreclosure are more strongly related to homeowners? behavior than characteristics of the loan or the property involved.  She also presents results suggesting that court processes are important for case outcomes.  While cases where the homeowner had legal representation less frequently end in foreclosure, she finds that there is not a significant difference in the probability of foreclosure for cases with and without legal representation for the homeowner, once variation in the court process is taken into account. In contrast, cases that had a court-facilitated settlement conference are less likely to end in foreclosure than those without a conference.   Finally, she considers homeowners? and lenders? actions in light of the design of the foreclosure process.  The foreclosure process largely relies on homeowners to challenge lenders? actions as a means of enforcing laws governing the foreclosure process and the assignment of mortgage loans.  Yet she finds that many homeowners do not challenge lenders, even when the court record suggests that they may have reason to do so.  In light of this and revelations regarding systematic improper legal filings by lenders? law firms, she concludes that the foreclosure process should be reformed.   Her dissertation offers the first scholarly analysis of how the residential foreclosure process was carried out during the Foreclosure Crisis, and presents results that have implications for policies designed to address foreclosures and other common types of civil litigation.
