<AbstractNarration>Fock and Goncharov have defined coordinates for representations of surface groups into a Lie group. For linear groups, these coordinates have been generalized by the PI and his collaborators to representations of 3-manifold groups. The coordinates allow for exact computations of representations and efficient computation of invariants such as volume and Chern-Simons invariant. The proposal will study the properties of these coordinates, maintain and develop databases of computations, study applications in quantum topology, and generalize to other Lie groups and higher dimensional manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When solving a problem it is very important to express it in the right coordinates. A problem can be completely intractable in one set of coordinates while having an elegant solution in another. The PI and his collaborators have defined special coordinates for representations of 3-manifold groups, which are important objects for studying 3-dimensional spaces. These coordinates allow for computations that were previously intractable, and the computations have revealed new and interesting phenomena. The proposal will study the properties of these coordinates, generalize in many directions, maintain and develop databases of computations, and study applications in quantum topology and mathematical physics.</AbstractNarration>

The proposal is very close in spirit to the celebrated scissors congruence problem for Euclidean polyhedra, a problem with broad appeal and a long history going back through Hilbert?s third problem all the way to the ancient Greeks.   Specific outcomes:  - 6 published papers, 2 preprint.  - Start of the CURVE project, an international research project focusing on themes related to the proposal, curve.unhyperbolic.org.  - Database of representations of 3-manifold groups, available at curve.unhyperbolic.org.  - 8 talks at conferences and workshops, 11 talks at department seminars, 1 three lecture minicourse.  Broader impacts:  - Supervision of 3 graduate students (ongoing).  - Conducted an REU project about representation volumes (2014).  - Presentation at "Maryland Day" (2013-2017), an annual community outreach event.  - Presentation at "Howard County Math Festival" (2014,2015).  - Minicourse for high school teachers on scissors congruence (2014).  - K12 outreach at Takoma Education Campus (since 2015): Keynote adress for students, teachers, and parents about the importance of mathematics.
