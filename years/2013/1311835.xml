<AbstractNarration>This award supports the analysis of photometric observations of over 100 star clusters using the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). The PI will 1) provide a uniform calculation of star-cluster ages and distance using uniform photometry from large surveys, 2) build a high precision dynamical sample of open cluster tracers, and 3) determine the Galactic disk abundance gradients using a large open cluster sample.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The APOGEE survey will provide a picture of the disk of the Milky Way galaxy that is unrivaled in scope, richness, and detail. In turn, this research will provide critical information for our understanding of the Milky Way in a fully cosmological context. The PI will also make the APOGEE-derived dataset available to the community, as well as train undergraduate and graduate students at Texas Christian University.</AbstractNarration>
