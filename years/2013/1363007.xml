<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms B program of Chemistry Division, Professors Lin Chen of Northwestern University and Felix Castellano of North Carolina State University are developing spectroscopic and synthetic methods to investigate how multiple metal centers in transition metal complexes (TMCs) act cooperatively to convert and accumulate energy from sunlight to multiple electronic potentials that ultimately will drive catalytic reactions for generating fuels. The proposed research is in line with the NSF Strategic and Performance Goals to transform the frontiers and innovate for society.  The knowledge obtained through the proposed studies could be transformative for the chemical sciences and will greatly enhance our ability to rationally design chemical materials/devices for catalysis, optoelectronics and energy sustainability.  The research activity engages university graduate students to use the advanced laser facility for characterization and advanced chemistry lab facilities for materials synthesis, providing them with a unique training ground for the development of multidisciplinary expertise.  Such training is urgently needed for the next generation STEM workforce in order to explore the frontier of chemical science and to keep the US globally competitive at the frontiers of knowledge. The proposed research/education activities are integrated with public outreach and mentoring aimed at young scientists, including undergraduate students inside and outside of the University (especially female, minority, and underrepresented local college students) through collaborative training, summer school and education focused symposiums.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work aims at controlling materials processes at the level of electrons by engineering structural factors to influence intramolecular electronic interactions and system-bath interactions on the time scale of coherent electronic and atomic motions. The mechanistic details enabling multiple-electron conversion will be investigated by newly developed two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) and optical anisotropy spectroscopy applied to new molecular architectures.  The proposed work aims at understanding intrinsic electronic couplings between the multiple metal centers TMCs and their influence on photochemical reactions.  The work will engineer intrinsic coherent motions in a series of di-platinum complexes via systematically varying structural factors, such as the inter-platinum distances as well as the steric hindrance/energetics/size/conjugation of the ligands, resulting in systematic changes of the energy levels of the molecular orbitals.  The researchers will use external perturbations, i.e. laser pulses, to shift electron density on a time scale faster than the period of the ground state Pt-Pt stretch, and follow with systematic investigations of dipole correlations by transient optical anisotropy, electronic couplings by two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy.  They will further investigate the implications of these coherent motions in chemical and photochemical processes.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project focuses on studying excited state structural dynamics of a series of platinum dimer complexes that have excellent luminescence and great potentials in many applications, such as organic light emitting diodes. These complexes have shown variation of their optical properties from absorption to emission spectra to excited state lifetimes, all linked to the platinum-platinum distances in the complexes.&nbsp; In collaboration with the Castellano Group of North Carolina State University who synthesized the complex series with chemically tuned platinum-platinum distances, we were able to measure the excited state pathways of these complexes via ultrafast optical transient absorption and transient grating methods.&nbsp; We found in these studies that the excited states of these complexes evolve in different pathways depending on the electronic structures of the molecules largely tuned by the inter-platinum distance. When the platinum-platinum distance is long, their interactions are weak and electronic transitions are localized in one-half of the molecule, as described by ligand centered (LC) or metal-to-ligand-charge-transfer (MLCT) state in nature (Figure 1). In contrast, when the inter-platinum distance in the complex becomes shorter, the electronic interactions between the two platinum atoms are strong, and both platinum atoms as described by metal-to-metal-to-ligand-charge-transfer (MMLCT) state in which the inter-platinum distance becomes even shorter in the excited state as one of the antibonding electrons is removed by the photoexcitation. These results will help in the future to design molecules for desirable properties in optical materials. In the past, most people viewed excited state vibrational relaxation without considering the vibrational phases. In contrast, we also examined the coherent nuclear motions of the platinum-platinum stretching in the MMLCT state on the time scale of less than 10<sup>-12</sup> second and found the change of the vibrational frequency for the platinum-platinum stretch increased due to the shortening of their distance (Figure 2). Considering that there are several excited state that are energetically close with each other, the energetic fluctuations by vibrational motions could have phase correlated consequence with the outcome of photochemical processes.&nbsp; In order to study the effects of these ultrafast platinum-platinum vibrations in photochemistry, we have built our two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) (Figure 3) and observed coherent motions of platinum-platinum stretch vibrations that vary with the ground state structure and the solvent. We will continue to use to decipher the effect of coherent vibrational motions to the outcome of the photochemistry through a number of new complexes from the Castellano group with electron and energy transfer functions.&nbsp;</p> <p>This grant has supported mainly a female postdoctoral researcher who was successful in mentoring other graduate students in the group and who has become a faculty member in a University since August 2017.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/09/2017<br>      Modified by: Lin&nbsp;X&nbsp;Chen</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1363007/1363007_10336341_1507566134757_Figure1forfinaloutcome--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1363007/1363007_10336341_1507566134757_Figure1forfinaloutcome--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1363007/1363007_10336341_1507566134757_Figure1forfinaloutcome--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1.
