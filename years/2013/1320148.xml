<AbstractNarration>This proposal is motivated by the observation that the battery drain of an app in a mobile device is user-centric, i.e., it depends on several factors that are associated with specific usage patterns.  These factors include but are not limited to the mode in which the app is used, the network coverage that the user enjoys and whether or not certain features of the app are turned on/off. In this project, the objectives are to (i) develop a fundamental understanding of the factors that influence the energy consumption of smartphone apps and, (ii) based on the understanding obtained, design and implement a user-centric battery management system that is called BLT.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs plan to first undertake an extensive measurement study that will provide a comprehensive understanding of how and to what extent user-centric factors affect the energy consumption on a smartphone. Subsequently, they aim to tackle several challenges towards identifying the energy hungry apps on a user's smartphone;  some of these challenges include the presence of several coexisting active apps at any given time.   Finally, they will design and implement a set of solutions that allow a user to trade-off performance or content quality for energy savings.  This project hinges on a strong experimental and prototyping effort, and the PIs will leverage the smartphone testbeds at UC Riverside and UC Davis towards undertaking the same.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have an immediate broader impact in empowering users with an ability to control their battery usage.  It will also allow users and developers in understanding why activities and apps result in high battery drain.  The project will also undertake efforts towards inspiring K-12 students in our respective regions, and helping teachers develop projects for science olympiads.  The project will include the modification of wireless networking courses taught at UCD and UCR, and  new educational efforts on establishing courses that include design and implementation on mobile devices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project seeks to identify energy hungry applications on users? smartphones and design and implement methods to curb those applications.  The thesis of this work is that the energy consumption of apps is user-centric i.e., are closely tied to how the user interacts with her phone.  For example, for a gaming app, the energy drain is tied to the level of the game played by the user (higher levels are more complex and thus, drain higher energy), and the networks that the user associates with (more frequent WiFi could lead to lower energy).  First an extensive measurement study is performed to show that this is indeed the case.  Subsequently, methods are designed to (a) identify energy hungry apps for that user and (b) develop approaches that can facilitate the reduction in energy.      First, a tool for identifying energy hungry applications (TIDE) is designed. TIDE is able to tease out which apps are consuming high energy when a plurality of apps are running simultaneously on the user?s phone by using lightweight monitoring methods and appropriately filtering out noise.  Second, a tool ZapDroid is developed to identify the apps that a user has installed but does not frequently use; such apps run in the background consuming high energy. Finally, fundamental analytical methods are developed to quantify the energy savings that can be achieved by streaming lower quality video instead of high quality video over cellular networks.     Second, the project develops several methods to reduce the energy of apps that are heavyweight.  First, in ZapDroid, methods are included to quarantine apps that are infrequently used, while also providing methods to restore them in near real-time if the user so desires.  Finally,  methods are developed towards reducing energy of other heavyweight applications such as machine learning based object detection and video streaming.     The project resulted in multiple Ph.D students being supported. These students found positions at SamSung Research, SalesForce and Amazon. A new undergraduate course on mobile wireless networks was introduced and has an enrolment of about 50 students currently.  A website that contains the relevant information and papers from the project is found at http://networks.cs.ucr.edu.
