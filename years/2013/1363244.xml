<AbstractNarration>Parking is a growing problem in dense urban areas. To many, finding a parking space in these areas is an unpleasant experience of uncertainty and frustration. Cruising for parking makes traffic on already-congested urban streets even worse and leads to significant waste in time and fuel. In transportation, smartphone-based parking management applications have emerged. These applications help drivers find parking spaces by allowing them to use smartphones to view real-time availability and prices of parking spaces and guide them to open parking spaces, reserved or otherwise. This award develops theoretical foundations and methodologies for analyzing these emerging parking management services. Results from this research provide a better understanding of the impacts of advanced parking management services on parking competition and travel patterns. The research develops policies to reduce traffic congestion and emissions in dense urban areas. This award positively impacts engineering education by offering new materials and case studies and engaging underrepresented student groups in research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using game-theoretic, dynamic and stochastic programming approaches to investigate both temporal and spatial travel patterns with advanced parking management, this project generates a set of analytical tools that explain the underlying working mechanisms of advanced parking management services and gauge their potential for reducing traffic congestion. The theoretical efforts in this research are complemented by an agent-based simulation, which tests the validity and applicability of the theories, and unveils complex outcomes of parking competition under realistic parking search behaviors. This work advances the knowledge and analysis of parking management and enriches the literature of modeling morning commute and vehicle routing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project aims to investigate a variety of theoretical questions associated with the analysis and design of smartphone-based parking management services.  Such services include providing information on real-time availability and prices of parking spaces, recommending optimal parking searching strategies to motorists, and allowing motorists to make reservations on open parking spaces.  The goal is to provide analytical foundations and methodologies to better understand the impacts and implications of emerging parking management services on parking competition and travel patterns, and shed lights on optimal design of those services to reduce traffic congestion in dense urban districts.  The ASU team of this collaborative research is interested in investigating optimal parking search strategies for individual drivers with given (probabilistic) travel and parking information, drivers? strategic interactions in the parking competition, and the outcomes of such non-cooperative games.   The team first proposed a model-based approach to predicting parking occupancy.  A practical framework for occupancy prediction was further proposed with the model-based approach as its core.  The framework includes methods to address practical considerations in actual implementation such as recognizing parking pattern shifts and algorithm modifications for special events with abnormal demand patterns.  Extensive comparison was carried out with existing machine-learning methods in the literature and it is found that our approach delivers equal or better performance but requires the computation time that is orders of magnitude less to tune and train the model.  Optimal parking search strategies were then investigated.  For normal parking conditions where the future occupancies and probabilities of finding parking can be reasonably predicted, a dynamic programming approach can be adopted.  We investigated four different cases where the transition probability matrix is fixed or time-dependent and where drivers are given real-time update or allowed to wait.  For special event parking conditions where the probabilities of finding parking are difficult to predict, a reinforcement learning approach was developed.  In addition to the models and algorithms developed, the team has built a proto-type Android mobile application that is intended to provide parking search guidance for end users (travelers).  Users input their origin and destination through an interface; they also have the option to specify their preferences such as maximum walking distance, maximum driving distance, etc.  The application is also able to locate the user based on the user?s mobile phone GPS data.  The application is designed to pull historical parking facility occupancy data in the area of interest (once it learns about the user?s travel behavior), and (pre-)computes probabilistic parking availability.  The algorithm for optimal parking search strategies based on the probabilistic parking availability and user?s preference is yet to be developed and implemented into the application.  As part of the research efforts to investigate parking competition, we also developed an agent-based simulation tool.  The tool is capable of modeling various groups of users with different preferences and risk-taking behaviors, as well as multiple parking facilities with different stochastic queuing processes.  Results from this project have been presented to the research and professional communities at various conferences as well as through journal publications.  The proto-type Android mobile application, once fully developed, is likely to be commercialized for public use.  The results and outcomes of the project are likely to 1) change the parking search behavior once the optimal parking search strategies and the proto-type Android mobile application are fully developed and commercialized; 2) improve parking search experiences of the general public and reduce traffic congestion in dense urban areas caused by parking search; and 3) impact policies and decision making of relevant government agencies by providing tools and data to better understand the impacts and implications of smartphone-based parking management systems.
