<AbstractNarration>This project aims to prove the concept that a cost-effective modification can be made to exiting dental implants with biomimetic nanofibers with the potential for regeneration of periodontal ligaments (PDL). Researchers propose to coat aligned biomimetic nanofibers onto the root of the dental implants for rapid attachment, migration and proliferation of PDL fibroblasts along the fiber alignment and promoted formation of PDL-like tissues. To address this, the research objectives are accordingly made to (1) formulate and deposit aligned biomimetic nanofibers (containing collagen and/or chitosan) onto the root of Ti dental implants, and (2) verify that the fiber alignment is sufficient to guide the desirable cellular functions of PDL fibroblasts for PDL regeneration. The research team anticipates that an accelerated formation of PDL will take place right onto the biomimetic nanofibers, which will potentially lead to the bonding of dental implant with surrounding alveolar bone. The same aligned nanofibers can be used to modify other implant surfaces involving gingival regeneration, neuron extension, directed tissue and organ regeneration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With projected growing global demand for dental implants, it is expected that the proposed cost-effective biomimetic nanofiber coating will provide a competitive solution to current unmet problem, i.e., the lack of PDL regeneration capacity, with an improved guidance of the regeneration of PDL onto dental implants. Compared to current practice, directly bonding implant onto alveolar bone, aiming to physically fix the implants, the new biomimetic nanofiber coating can significantly promote PDL regeneration by providing the PDL cells with a biomimetic stimulatory environment. The proposed modification strategy may have a high potential for widespread use, as they mainly deal with a modification of current dental implants and the materials for nanofibers have been used in FDA-approved devices for in vivo use.</AbstractNarration>
