<AbstractNarration>The project is addressing the critical need for more Native American geoscientists by creating a innovative Baccalaureate degree program in Hydrology at Salish Kootenai College, a tribal college which serves the Salish, Kootenai, and Pend d'Oreille people, as well as American Indians from throughout the U.S. The curriculum, which includes undergraduate research on tribal lands, is informed by a unique combination of culturally relevant instruction, industry-recognized standards, input from an external advisory board comprising scientists, educators, administrators, industry professionals, tribal leaders and resource managers, and competencies required for geoscientists working in Native American watersheds, such as water-law and sovereignty issues. Curriculum development is supplemented by co-curricular retention strategies, and project assessment addresses the impact of both the culturally relevant curriculum and co-curricular efforts to increase the rate of Native American geoscience graduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project lies in its creative and comprehensive approach to curriculum design and retention in the first geoscience-centered baccalaureate program at a Tribal College or University. The broader impacts include a sustainable program that graduates additional Native American hydrologists, who contribute valuable perspectives to the science and support resource management in watersheds undergoing change from natural and human causes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall objective of the SKC Hydrology degree program supported by NSF award 1323692 Transforming Indigenous Geoscience Education and Research (TIGER) was to increase the National participation of Natives in the Hydrologic Sciences by graduating students in a new tribal college hydrology program who are able to "give voice" to the perspectives of Native peoples on natural resources and particularly water-related issues.   The addition of the two degree programs (AS and BS in Hydrology) increases educational opportunities for Native Americans who wish to attend graduate school and/or seek professional employment in the growing fields related to water resources. The curriculum was carefully designed to integrate scientific concepts and research methods with Native American ways of knowing and worldview. The program thus offers a unique opportunity for preparation to work with tribal programs or work in local, state, or federal agencies that interact with tribes and tribal members in areas related to water resources.  The Hydrology program provides the opportunity for interdisciplinary study in physical, chemical, and biological water resources and their management. Students gain theoretical, conceptual, computational, and practical knowledge/experiences in quantifying, monitoring, qualifying, and managing today?s water resource challenges with particular emphasis on Tribal lands.  The Hydrology Program was designed to address a critical lack of programs that prepare American Indians for careers in geosciences disciplines. Previously absent from SKC and the other 36 TCU?s STEM related programs were specific geoscience disciplines focusing on hydrological and water based sciences. Currently, American colleges and universities award only 30 to 40 bachelor?s degrees per year in the geosciences to Native American students. Only a small fraction of these students are in the field of hydrology or water resources which highlight the geosciences as one of the least-diverse fields. This is of particular significance since approximately 20% of the nation?s water resources are located on Indian lands.   New student enrollment in the SKC Hydrology Program has increased; 10% of new STEM students declared Hydrology their major.  The number of enrolled students in Hydrology has risen from a cumulative 3% to 15% of all STEM majors at SKC between 2010 and 2016.   The student population in the Hydrology Department is predominantly Native American.  Notably, the number of students from reservations other than the Flathead Indian Reservation in increasing, providing increased viability for the program and increased program reach in terms of the goal of creating more Native American hydrologists.   There are only a few  undergraduate water science degrees offered in the nation and SKC now offers the only one at a TCU.  Native graduation rates in the geosciences are PhD 0.4%, MS 0.5%, &amp; BS 1.8%. On average, only 1.5 Hydrology or Water Resources undergraduate degrees are conferred nationally to Native American students each year.  Though the total number of graduates from the SKC Hydrology Program is relatively small it approximates a 67-100% increase in the National graduation rate of Native American Hydrologists in the past 3 years.   In total, the program has conferred 13 AS and 6 BS degrees with an expected 6 more BS degrees in the next year (5 of which will be earned by native students). We currently maintain 100% placement of all of our BS graduates.  A significant percentage of the courses taught by hydrology faculty address the perpetuation of culture by utilizing a modification of a Culturally Congruent Instructional Survey collaboratively developed by the Big Sky Science Partnership (BSSP), a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded Math-Science Partnership Teacher Institute administered by SKC. It partners with three Montana institutes of higher education (IHEs), with five tribal communities on three Montana American Indian reservations, and K-12 schools and teachers on or near those reservations.
