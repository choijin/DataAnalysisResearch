<AbstractNarration>The Advanced CyberInfrastructure - Research and Educational Facilitation: Campus-based Computational Research Support project develops and implements strategies that serve to advance our nation's research and scholarly achievements through the transformation of campus computational capabilities and enhanced coupling to the national cyberinfrastructure environment. Among the project's collaborating institutions are the University of Hawaii, the University of Southern California, the University of Utah, the University of Wisconsin, and Clemson and Harvard Universities. The project brings together education and research institutions that are committed to the vision of advancing scientific discovery through a national network of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (ACI) Research and Education Facilitators (ACI-REFs). Working together in a coordinated effort, the project is dedicated to the adoption of models and strategies to leverage the expertise and experiences of its members to maximize the impact of investment in research computing. Located on the campuses and fully embedded in their local environment, the mission of the ACI-REFs is to extend the reach and impact of campus and national research computing infrastructure on the science conducted by students and faculty. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By building a cloud-like environment for advanced computing infrastructure and support, the project seeks to create a community that fosters seamless integration of cyberinfrastructure and domain researchers and expand the reach of researchers involved in the use of advanced cyberinfrastructure across campuses. The project also seeks to develop the expertise base across partner campuses to support information sharing and to facilitate the formation of extended local and national collaborations. The project explores the potential for the creation of a nationwide alliance of educators to empower local campus researchers to be more effective users of advanced cyberinfrastructure. In particular, the project seeks to work with the "long tail" of ACI users - those scholars and faculty members who traditionally have not benefitted from the power of massively scaled cluster computing but who recognize that their research requires access to more compute power than can be provided by their desktop machines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The focus of this project, ACI-REF (Advanced CyberInfrastructure - Research and Educational Facilitation) was to formalize the practice of facilitation and education of researchers who leverage large-scale computing and data services (termed "advanced cyberinfrastructure", or ?ACI? as in the ACI-REF project title) on their campuses. A "facilitator" is by definition a person that makes an action or process easier, and thus an ACI-REF is a person that specializes in making it easier to use advanced cyberinfrastructure.  This is important because (1) we are at a time when advanced cyberinfrastructure resources (e.g. computing clusters, specialized processors, data storage systems, etc.) and analytical software for science are rapidly evolving and (2) the use of advanced cyberinfrastructure is rapidly spreading into research disciplines beyond the physical sciences and engineering. Many researchers are overwhelmed with these major changes -- uncertain of how to take advantage of available technology in a way that advances research capabilities and discoveries.  At the beginning of this project in 2014, the term "Facilitator" was virtually unused within campus computing centers across the U.S. In a relatively short period, computing experts and researchers, themselves, are seeing and using it at many community conferences, which now have a "Facilitation" track or focus, and through a number of newly-created positions within campus computing organizations, which include "Facilitator" in the title.  This is a significant cultural shift in cyberinfrastructure staffing models from focusing primarily on expertise around the function and administration of advanced cyberinfrastructure systems and toward the necessary human element required for researchers to fully realize the potential of computing to advance their work.   Each project campus?s ACI&shy;-REFs continue to enhance and refine their work in practices of facilitation, as defined in the project?s Leading Practices of Facilitation document.  As well, they have expanded communication about "Facilitation"  to a number of campuses and national computing centers through various scholarly activities that included a total of 92 papers, presentations and publications. Beyond facilitating research use of cyberinfrastructure on and across our campuses, project activities focused in three primary areas: (1) Building and expanding the human ACI-REF network with contributions to a new national network of  campus cyberinfrastructure professionals (the CaRCC People Network within the Campus Research Computing Consortium); (2) Developing standards of Facilitation methods and for evaluating success; and (3) Expanding the ACI-REF communication materials and website with detailed reports of project impacts and metrics for other institutions to follow as a guide as they grow their Facilitator roles. Throughout the life of this project, it is the stories from researchers across a variety of scientific domains, which describe successful advances in their research that may not have been realized without the collaborative efforts of facilitation. Thus, the practice of facilitation for the betterment of the research process is starting to be understood as an essential part of compute-intensive or data-intensive research irrespective of domain.
