<AbstractNarration>This work will conduct a survey of nearby low-mass stars and Brown Dwarfs using the Pan-STARRS 1 survey. This will provide a census of kinematically-selected high-velocity low-mass stars and substellar objects, including parallaxes, spectral type classifications and luminosity functions of several hundred low-mass objects within 25 parsecs of the Sun. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Brown Dwarfs are substellar objects which have more mass than planets, but not enough mass to sustain hydrogen fusion in their cores.  These and other low-mass stellar objects, such as M-dwarfs, are very poorly understood, yet may play important roles for understanding star and planet formation.  Many of the objects discovered in the solar neighborhood by this study will be prime targets for searches of exoplanets in habitable zones, regions where conditions are right for water to exist in the liquid form.  The team will use telescopes in Hawaii (Pan-STARRS 1, CFHT, UH 88?, IRTF, Gemini) to obtain photometry and spectroscopy at optical and near-infrared wavelengths. This work will involve the participation of graduate and undergraduate students, who will be trained in scientific research, including data-mining techniques.&lt;br/&gt;techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Brown dwarfs are a kind of oddball in our Galaxy.  They are not heavy enough to fuse hydrogen into helium like stars, but they are not as light as the planets.  We study brown dwarfs partly to understand the behavior of this odd intermediate class of objects, and partly to find clues about the behavior of both the more massive stars and less massive planets.  Over the course of the project, our team has included contributions from three UH graduate students, two postdocs, one UH undergraduate student, and two UH faculty members.  The students have learned to work with very large datasets and modern data-mining techniques.   Our goals in this project were to use new surveys and dedicated observations to discover many new brown dwarfs in the neighborhood of the sun and to use these observations to better understand the life-cycles of these faint, rare objects.    We started by mining the Pan-STARRS 3pi Survey, a project led by the University of Hawaii.  We combined precise Pan-STARRS measurements of the motions of stars across the sky with observations from the 2MASS near-infrared survey and the WISE mid-to-far infrared survey.  This combination allowed us to find faint, red objects moving against the background stars, and thus likely to be the relatively near-by brown dwarfs we wanted to discover.  The discovery stage was very successful.  One exiciting discovery was PSO 318.5-22, an object associated with the nearby young cluster of stars called the Beta Pictoris moving group.  Because of its young age and very red colors we were able to pin down the mass to less than agreed boundary between brown dwarfs and planets.  This object was the first free-floating object, not bound to another star, with a planetary mass -- it was nicknamed by the Lonely Planet.  We also discovered a number of brown dwarfs which are companions to regular stars.  Because we can more easily determine the properties of the primary star, these so-called 'benchmark' brown dwarfs allow us to improve our understanding the evolution of brown dwarfs more generally.  We also discovered many other brown dwarfs, filling in the census of the populations in some difficult-to-search temperature ranges.  In the end, we published 8 papers just on the brown dwarf discoveries.   The next stage of the project was to better characterize the sample of brown dwarfs in the solar neighborhood to learn about their evolution. We generated a complete, uniform catalog of the brightness and proper-motions of the full set of known brown dwarfs, with measurements coming from the Pan-STARRS survey:  http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/~wbest/Will_Best/PS1_MLT_Dwarfs.html  In parallel, we identified all brown dwarfs likely to be within 25 parsec of the sun and carefully measured their distances by observing their motion against the background stars due to the Earth's orbit (the parallax of the objects).  This latter work was done with the UKIRT telescope on Maunakea by IfA graduate student William Best.  With these parallaxes, we could define a volume-limited sample of brown dwarfs in which we are confident that we had identified (essentially) all brown dwarfs within 25 parsecs of the sun, at least within the 68% of the sky covered by our survey.  By having a volume-limited sample, we can now judge the populations on a consistent and even footing.  We can be confident that a deficit of a certain type of brown dwarf tells us about the astrophysics of the brown dwarfs and not just the biases due to the way we identfied our sample.  One very interesting result from this volume-limited sample is in fact the absence of brown dwarfs of a certain color and brightness range. Since brown dwarfs do not burn hydrogen, they do not have an internal energy source.  They thus spend their lives getting cooler, and generally objects which get cooler also get redder.  However, at a certain stage of a brown dwarf's lifetime, for certain infrared colors, they become bluer for a period.  Astronomers believe this is due to changes in the clouds in the upper atmosphere of the brown dwarfs.  As they cool, the material in the clouds 'rains' down, clearing away the redder clouds.  In our study, we are able to show that the start of the transition is very quick: there are very few brown dwarfs in the local solar neighborhood with the brightness and color corresponding to the start of this transition.  We anticipate many studies of the brown dwarf populations and their evolution will result from the data we have released during this project.
