<AbstractNarration>This project will use data obtained from the Kepler satellite to search for transiting planets in open star clusters. All data are already obtained.  One of the main goals is to improve the accuracy of stellar ages using stellar rotation  techniques(gyrochronology), which has applications to other fields of stellar astronomy. This work will be used to constrain planet formation models in open star clusters.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include making the data publicly available and training undergraduate students in research, including experience with reduction and analysis of stellar spectra for stellar properties, radial-velocities, and binary star orbits, and with time-series photometric data for transiting planets and stellar variability(rotation).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A star cluster is a dense group of stars born at the same time and place, traveling through the Galaxy held together by their mutual gravity. They are a special and very valuable class of objects in astronomy. This is primarily because we can determine the shared age and distance of their member stars with high precision and good accuracy. The ages of most other stars, not in clusters and drifting through space in relative isolation - like our Sun, are much more difficult to determine, and so are the ages of potential planets orbiting them. Knowing the ages of stars is critically important for studying the evolution of most astronomical phenomena, including the formation and evolution of planets and planetary systems.
