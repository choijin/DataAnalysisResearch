<AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;This award supports an experimental research program to understand emerging light-matter-spin involving processes within pre-designed zero-dimensional colloidal quantum structures by ultrafast optical spectroscopy. This research plan will directly involve graduate students training in tools and techniques needed to address a few fundamental issues: control of resonant plasmon-exciton interactions; realization of ultrafast spin control and echo in colloidal quantum structures by spin-plasmon and spin-phonon interactions; and development of new class of colloidal quantum magneto-semiconductor devices. Accomplishment of this project should advance our fundamental understanding and materials engineering of light assisted spin-dependent phenomena at the nanoscale. This work is additionally important because zero-dimensional quantum structures represent the smallest dimensional units that can be used for quantum information processing based on the spin degree of freedom. In addition to student training, this award will also allow to integrate cutting-edge research activities with undergraduate education program, K-12 outreach, classroom demonstration and teacher training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;This award supports experimental research to understand and control various fundamental interactions that are of relevance to the spin of electron at the nanometer scale. Spin is an intrinsic quantum mechanical property of electron that can potentially lead to new technology and device development. Time-resolved spectroscopy that can provide extremely high temporal resolution with ultrashort light pulses will be applied to launch, probe and manipulate nanoscale spin-dependent processes. This will include application of ultrashort light pulse to create coupling of spin in semiconductor with plasmon (that is a collective motion of electrons in metal nanostructures) and phonon (that is atomic lattice collective motion in a solid), to manipulate spin of semiconductor quantum structures in a very fast time scale, and to discover novel interactions between spins of nanoscale magnets and semiconductors. This project will be accomplished by employing multidisciplinary experimental tools, including chemical synthesis of quantum structures, ultrafast optical spectroscopy and nano-device engineering, and thus provide a fertile ground for students' training, K-12 outreach and curriculum development.</AbstractNarration>
