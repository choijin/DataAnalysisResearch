<AbstractNarration>This action funds Benjamin Thomas Fine of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Texas A&amp;M University to conduct a research project in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering area during the summer of 2013 at the Australian Centre for Field Robotics at the University of Sydney in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.  The project title is "Manipulating Migratory Motions of Flocks of Birds: A Computational Exploration." The host scientist is Dr. Salah Sukkarieh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many groups of agents, such as birds, fish, and locust, exhibit emergent collective behaviors (e.g., schooling fish and locust migratory band formation).  The environment in which the agents operate is one determinant of the resulting behaviors.  Using unmanned aerial vehicles to monitor the migratory motions of the swift parrot in New South Wales, Australia, this investigation attempts to identify which properties of the agents' environment influence the exhibited behaviors of the parrot flocks.  The Fellow developed an approach for the generation of environments that elicit a pre-specified behavior from a given group of agents.  This approach is used to explore how different environmental properties can be used to manipulate the migratory motions of the parrots.  Moreover, the data collected from the field will be used to refine the geometrical theory and computational implementation, which can be used for investigating other agents and collective behaviors (e.g., migratory motions of locust bands and evacuation behaviors of pedestrians).    The computational implementation developed for this investigation along with empirical data collected from the field, will allow the PI to explore the possibility of effectively manipulating collectives by altering their environment.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, the understanding of the environmental properties that effect group behaviors could also be applied to effective manipulation of Australian Plague Locust migratory bands, which has the potential to affect the livelihoods of one in ten people throughout the world.  Moreover, this work would also be useful for applications in livestock/poultry management, the study of emergent behaviors, and assisting in improving the efficiency of building evacuations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Participation in the EAPSI program assisted in my overall education and research studies in multiple ways. First, the process of collecting large amounts of group-level data is difficult and resource expensive. The Australian Centre for Field Robotics (ACFR), which is one of the foremost laboratories in field robotics, has already designed a robust unmanned aerial vehicle system (UAV) for the collection of such data and Australia is home to one of the largest seen aggregates in the world, the Australian plague locust (APL).  Although we were unable to collect the desired amount of data in the short time I was there, I was able to gain a better understanding in how such data can be collected using the unmanned areal system.   Any empirical scientist knows there are two aspects to any investigation, (1) the presented design, implementation, and results and (2) the various trial and error experiences gained while preparing the former. I will gained first hand experience in the design and implementation of a robotic system from a 'sensing-first' perspective. This opportunity  helped me understand the many steps taking in the creation of their robust tracking system, in order  for me to assist in the development of a similar system at Texas A&amp;M University, which can be  used for the study of other groups, such as herds of cattle, flocks of sheep, and crowds of  pedestrians.   The ability to control swarms of locust is a primary focus for both the ACFR and the Australian Plague Locust Commission (APLC), which is concerned with minimizing the effects the APL has on the economy and environment. Over the past year, I have developed and evaluated a method for manipulating groups of agents through the use of the environment. While at the ACFR, I was able to further develop this system as well as gain useful ideas for future development to increase the usefulness of this work.   Beyond the research opportunities, participation in the EAPSI program afforded me the opportunity to visit the ACFR and to exchange both research ideas and general philosophies in the field of robotics. My robotics background varies from the group I worked with in that I am interested in distributed system which operates in a laboratory setting where they typically study single autonomous robots in real-world environments and situations.
