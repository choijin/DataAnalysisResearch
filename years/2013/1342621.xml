<AbstractNarration>There is a need in the mathematics community for conferences that are geared toward the professional growth of young mathematicians. Attending and giving talks at conferences is a necessary part of every mathematician's life, but many conferences cater to established specialists. Such an environment can prove too intimidating for graduate students who wish to give talks of their own. The Binghamton University Graduate Conference in Algebra and Topology (BUGCAT) was specifically designed to meet the need for an alternative. It is a math conference run by graduate students, for graduate students. Like all conferences, BUGCAT provides a gathering place for professors and graduate students from various institutions to present their research to a wider audience, to collaborate, and to share ideas. The focus at the BUGCAT, however, is on the graduate student. The BUGCAT gives graduate students doing research in any area of algebra or topology an opportunity to practice giving talks and to network with other mathematicians sharing related research interests. At the same time, it gives graduate students an opportunity to hear talks by world renowned mathematicians doing groundbreaking work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the Binghamton University Graduate Conference in Algebra and Topology, which will take place at Binghamton University on November 17-18, 2014. Now in its seventh year, the BUGCAT is a venue where algebra and topology graduate students in all stages of their research can present their work.  The graduate students who attend the BUGCAT are better equipped to find academic positions and continue research and collaboration.  Attendees are exposed to a wide variety of current research, ideas, and results, and they have ample opportunity to meet senior researchers and students of their generation who may become future collaborators or colleagues. The conference also promotes diversity in the mathematical sciences by encouraging and supporting participation by women and minorities.</AbstractNarration>
