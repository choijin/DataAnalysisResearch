<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professors Kev Abazajian, Mu-Chun Chen, Jonathan Feng, Manoj Kaplinghat, Arvind Rajaraman, Yuri Shirman, and Tim Tait at the University of California, Irvine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the discovery of a Higgs-like particle at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the recent wealth of cosmological results, this is an exciting time in particle physics and cosmology.  Data from the LHC and other particle physics experiments are deepening our understanding of the fundamental interactions and probing the weak scale with unprecedented detail.  At the same time, outstanding questions in astrophysics and cosmology also guide theoretical work on physics beyond the so-called "Standard Model", and the interaction of cosmology and particle physics in recent years has been fruitful.  The research plan of these researchers exploits innovative ideas in both particle physics and cosmology in order to address outstanding problems in a wide variety of fields, including supersymmetry, extra dimensions, collider phenomenology, neutrino physics, grand unified theories, dark matter, and particle cosmology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the group's activities are directed towards increasing public interest in and improving public understanding of the exciting results of particle physics. These include public talks and outreach activities, the training of postdoctoral researchers and graduate students both at UC Irvine and around the world, and significant contributions in the area of professional service.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported research, teaching, and public outreach in the fields of particle physics and cosmology at the University of California, Irvine.  The work was led by Professors Kev Abazajian, Mu-Chun Chen, Jonathan Feng, Manoj Kaplinghat, Arvind Rajaraman, Yuri Shirman, and Tim Tait, who collaborated with and mentored 6 postdoctoral scholars and 11 Ph.D. students, as well as a host of domestic and international collaborators and visitors.  Intellectual Merit: The work resulted in over 90 peer-reviewed publications that deepened our understanding of the fundamental particles and forces that govern our Universe.  The research uncovered tentative evidence for a 5th fundamental force of Nature and identified ways to experimentally test this potentially revolutionary discovery. The researchers also proposed new ideas for the dark matter that makes up 85% of the matter in the Universe, including dark matter candidate particles such as sterile neutrinos, weakly-interacting massive particles (WIMPs), self-interacting dark matter, and exotic dark sector particles. In addition, they explored new ways to determine the properties of neutrinos and new ways to search for particles at high-energy colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva.  The work built new interdisciplinary ties between particle physics, nuclear physics, and astrophysics, and also was closely connected to leading experiments worldwide, including not only the LHC, but also dark matter searches underground and in space, and a host of other world-leading observatories and experiments.  Broader Impacts: The group increased public interest in and improved public understanding of exciting results of physics and astronomy. The principal investigators were interviewed for a host of news articles in print, television, and web-based media. Their research on the fifth force alone was covered by over 125 new stories and generated the 3rd most media attention of over 14,000 scientific papers ranked by Altmetric.  In addition, the researchers developed and taught a COSMOS summer course on particle physics and cosmology to high-achieving high school students from diverse socio-economic backgrounds.  They also founded and organized UC Irvine Women in Physics and Astronomy to strengthen the representation of underrepresented minorities in physics and other STEM fields and organized a wide array of lectures and other events for the general public.  The Principal Investigators trained many postdoctoral researchers and graduate students both at UC Irvine and around the world, and helped lead and strengthen a number of professional institutions, including several scientific journals and organizations, including the American Physical Society.
