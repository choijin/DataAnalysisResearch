<AbstractNarration>This action funds Stephanie Tong of University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at the National Center for Research on Earthquake Engineering (NCREE) at National Taiwan University (NTU) in Taipei, Taiwan.  The project title is "Model-based Tracking Control Design for Accurate Shake Table Response." The host scientist is Dr. Keh-Chyuan Tsai.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shake table testing is an effective method for evaluating the response of structures under dynamic loading, particularly earthquake excitations. To take full advantage of shake table testing, tracking control algorithms are applied for more accurate reproduction of earthquake ground accelerations. Realization of an appropriate tracking control algorithm will ensure that the actual shake table response matches the commanded shake table response. The project accomplishes this through the development of a model that captures the dynamics of the system driving the multiple shake table system at the NCREE laboratory and formulating tracking control schemes to ensure robust tracking control. Compensation for tracking error of the system will be provided by feedforward controllers, which control the system through an adjusted command anticipating the system behavior, and feedback controllers, which control the system by correcting the accumulated error. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, appropriate tracking control strategies secured for the NCREE shake table will ultimately advance modern control design by allowing other shake table users to obtain more meaningful testing results for improved structural control methods. The procedure to develop the tracking control will be shared so that perhaps other facilities with similar testing equipment can apply the same concepts in improving their tracking control. Upon return to the home institution, the fellow will give a seminar describing both the scholastic and cultural experience.</AbstractNarration>

The improvements to the shake table system will augment other researchersÆ efforts in furthering current earthquake mitigation strategies.  Shake tables operate by reproducing ground accelerations from desired earthquake records. The actuators that drive the shaking table must be able to replicate the ground motion accelerations encountered in earthquake loading. This is achieved through application of displacements (double derivative of accelerations).  However, the dynamic test system is inherently flawed due to time delays (analog/digital signal conversion, communication of data, sampling rate) and time lags (actuator response time, structure-table interaction/coupling, rate dependent behavior). Time delays are assumed to be small and constant in comparison to the time lags, which vary with excitation frequency. For simplicity, the time delays are lumped with the time lags and are assumed to be frequency dependent. Time lags make generation of prescribed accelerations for the table particularly challenging and are more pronounced for tests occurring at fast rates (real-time), thus requiring appropriate compensation.  In the model-based approach, a commanded displacement signal corresponding to the desired acceleration is sent through a servo-controller to a servo-valve attached to an actuator at the beginning of each time step. Since the shake table has its own specimen-dependent dynamics, the predetermined command displacement may fail to generate the desired acceleration. The discrepancies in commanded and measured movement can be substantial, making accurate shake table testing quite challenging. Therefore, it is important to understand the frequency dependent behavior of the shake table test system. Modeling of the shake table dynamics is advantageous, as it can be used to develop feedforward controllers to determine a modified command signal based on the desired signal. In doing so, the shake table performance is improved over the desired frequency range, and more meaningful test results are obtained.  The three main tasks for improved tracking are:  Conduct system identification testing of the servo-hydraulic system to yield an appropriate input/output transfer function Gyu(s) that accurately captures the system dynamics. This process involves exciting the table with a random noise signal containing a specified range of frequency content. The measured table responses (displacements, accelerations) can be compared to the desired responses over a chosen frequency range. The experimental transfer function obtained from this data is used to construct a transfer function model of the system. Develop a model-based feedforward controller GFF(s) to cancel out known system dynamics. The feedforward controller is defined as the inverse of the input/output transfer function Gyu(s) of the servo-hydraulic model to counteract any effects of the servo-hydraulic model. In doing so, the feedforward controller and the system together act as a unity gain such that the measured output, y, more closely tracks the reference signal, r. Implement controller design and verify with tracking tests. The controller is used to compute an updated command for a desired earthquake record.   The tests verify that the shake table response is improved with the use of the model-based feedforward controller. The measured response has improved phase tracking of the desired reference signal without noise amplification. The robu...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
