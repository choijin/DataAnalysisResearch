<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry and the Nano-Biosensing Program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET), Professors Isiah Warner, Daniel Hayes, and Francisco Hung at Louisiana State University &amp; Agricultural and Mechanical College and their groups will optimize development of novel nanomaterials derived from a group of uniform materials based on organic salts (GUMBOS). The goal of this research is to apply these nanoGUMBOS toward applications in measurement science. These materials can be developed as safe and effective alternatives to many current nanomaterials used for bioanalytical applications. This research is designed to examine the properties of nanoGUMBOS that contribute to their stability, tunability, biocompatibility, and ready applicability for use in such applications. Thus, the potential of nanoGUMBOS for employing effective combinations of properties through unique combinations of cations and anions is outlined in this proposal. As an example, a fluorescent nanoparticle may be generated from GUMBOS by use of a fluorescent dye as the cation and a traditional anion. In addition, a non-fluorescent magnetic particle may be generated by use of a non-fluorescent cation in combination with a paramagnetic anion. Obviously, multiple properties for a given nanoGUMBOS can be achieved through a combination of similar strategies. Such particles would then have uniform multiple functionalities and thus realize the full potential of nanomaterials in terms of maximum surface activity per given surface to volume ratio. This is in contrast to many nanoparticles where multiple functionalities are generated by independently injecting species with these properties into a neutral species such as silica.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Professor Warner and his team have been actively involved in educational strategies for using research and mentoring as tools to actively engage undergraduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. They will continue their efforts in engaging undergraduate and graduate students of diverse backgrounds in this grant.</AbstractNarration>
