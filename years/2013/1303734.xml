<AbstractNarration>The Otterbein University group of Nathaniel Tagg and his team of undergraduate students will conduct research on neutrino oscillations and interactions using experiments in the Fermilab NuMI and Booster neutrino beams.  The research program includes the study of neutrino oscillations (in the MINOS+ experiment), measuring neutrino nucleus cross sections (in the MINERvA experiment), measuring neutrino velocity (MINOS+), and searching for anomalous events that might indicate physics beyond the Standard Model (the MicroBooNE experiment).   A special contribution of the group and an exciting broader impact of their research program is the development and implementation of 3D visualization tools to guide the physics analyses of the experiments and to render visible to students and the public the nature of neutrino interactions as recorded and studied by the scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Otterbein University is a small 4-year liberal arts college in central Ohio.  Our group consists of one professor (Nathaniel Tagg) and 2-3 undergraduates working each summer on neutrino experiments at the Fermi National Accelerator Lab in Illinois.  We have been working on three different experiments: MINOS, MINERvA, and MicroBooNE.  These experiments are doing work on understanding how neutrinos propagate through space, and what happens when neutrinos interact with matter.  In each of these experiments, the Fermi accelerator complex is used to make a beam of neutrinos, which then interact in a detector.  Both the MINERvA and MicroBooNE experiments use high-resolution detector systems to see the fine details of what particles get made when a neutrino hits a nucleus, and count the probability of these types of interactions.  Despite the small size of our group, we can make substantial contributions to these experiments, thanks to this grant.   We have designed technologies that can be used to visualize our event data, and let both scientists and the general public see representations of neutrino interactions.  These tools are publicly available: http://minerva05.fnal.gov/live and http://argo-microboone.fnal.gov/live show real-time data being collected at the MINERvA and MicroBooNE experiments, respectively.  This technology is very useful to allow scientists to understand how our computer algorithms work when attempting to 'reconstruct' events, and figure out what happened in the interaction.  This visualization work has also been used for K-12 education: we curate a website http://neutrino-classroom.org that has materials for teachers who want to use real MINERvA data to introduce ideas of particle decay and momentum conservation.  Other outreach programs (such as the Physics Masterclass program) are looking at our tools as well.  We have also been deeply involved in understanding our experiments' detector performance at a low level.  A major achievement was building the Online Monitor system for the MicroBooNE experiment.  This sofware samples data from the Data Acquisition system and uses it to make plots of important quantities that describe the data quality.  We use this tool constantly to scan for problems with our experiment.  Undergraduate students are integral to this work, who recieve training in the methods of scientific experimentation, as well as technical training in computer software and mathematical techniques used in these experiments.
