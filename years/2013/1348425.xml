<AbstractNarration>This proposal proposes to study the counting and equidistribution problems of geometric and arithmetic objects on homogeneous spaces arising as  orbits of discrete subgroups of Lie groups which are not necessarily lattices. The guide line is to use the techniques from various different fields such as  harmonic analysis, dynamics of group actions, hyperbolic geometry, ergodic theory, and automorphic forms of semisimple algebraic groups in order to describe the asymptotic distribution of an infinite sequence of submanifolds arising in number theoretic and geometric situations. However most of these techniques are well developed only for the study of orbits of lattices and  our main focus lies in investigating to what extent we can further develop similar techniques for orbits of discrete subgroups with infinite co-volume.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed projects lie in the intersection of several fields of mathematics including Lie groups, analytic number theory, hyperbolic geometry, Kleinian groups, ergodic theory and dynamics. It involves connections between several areas of research, and has deep applications to various topics in different areas of mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    We have obtained substantial results in measure classification for unipotent flows on infinite volume homogeneous spaces. Although there is a complete measure classification for unipotent flows on finite volume homogenous spaces due to Ratner, almost nothing was known in an infinite volume setting.  Our major outcome is the classifiation of joining measures for certain unipotent flows for the frame bundle of an infinite volume 3-dimensional hyperbolic manifold. This is the first measure classification result beyond horospherical group actions.  We have also obtained the joint counting and equidistribution problems for closed geodesics and holonomies for any geometrically finite rank one manifolds. Again such results were previously known only in a finite volume case.   Our investigation opens up new interactions between dynamics, geometry and number theory. As we investigate flows on the quotients of  Lie groups by  iscrete subgroups which are not lattices, the theory of Kleinian groups as well as of more general discrete subgroups plays a much more important role.   The PI have given several seminar lectures, and gave lecture series at the 6th European women mathematics summer school on topics of Apollonian circle packings. The PI has also give the 13th Takagi lecture series in Japan.The PI is also one of main organizers for a weekly Dynamics seminar at Yale university. The PI is also mentoring Ph. D graduate students.              Last Modified: 08/26/2014       Submitted by: Hee Oh]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
