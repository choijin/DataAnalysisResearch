<AbstractNarration>This award provides travel support for students and postdoctoral fellows to attend the 29th Annual Symposium on Computational Geometry, to be held June 17?20, 2013 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Symposium on Computational Geometry (SOCG) is the oldest and most influential international conference in computational geometry. Throughout its almost 30-year history, SOCG has played a seminal role in the formation and evolution of the field, and it continues to serve as the flagship venue for groundbreaking research in all areas of geometric computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The funds will be used to encourage and facilitate the participation of under-represented groups in this top-tier computer science conference. They will also contribute towards attracting more underrepresented groups to computer science research giving students an opportunity to engage in the important technical, professional and social exchanges that SOCG fosters. Finally, the conference itself and all conference attendees will benefit from the greater attendance and consequently higher proportion of students and under-represented groups that this travel grant makes possible.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant subsidized student travel to the 30th Annual Symposium on Computational Geometry (SOCG), which took place in Kyoto, Japan from June 8 to June 11, 2014.  SOCG is the premiere conference in the field of computational geometry.  In addition to contributed talks on peer-reviewed research papers, the symposium includes the Young Researchers Forum, a venue specifically for students and postdocs to present their research and gain exposure to the SOCG community.  (The proposal was written to support the 29th SOCG, which took place in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, in June 2013.  However, the proposal was approved too close to that conference to use effectively, and the program manager approved a one-year no-cost extension.)  Grant funds were used to offset transportation, lodging, and registration costs for 14 graduate students at 10 different US universities.  Most of these students received $1500; two requested smaller levels of support.  The supported students included five authors of accepted papers who presented their work in technical sessions, and five others who spoke at the Young Researchers Forum.  Two supported students are female; one is Hispanic.  Seven  supported students had never attended a computer science conference before SOCG 2015.  Most of the supported students would have not have been able to attend the conference at all without support from this grant.
