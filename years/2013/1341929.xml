<AbstractNarration>Leveraging US-R2R and EU-ODIP Informatics for International Marine Science &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Since the 2009 launch, the Rolling Deck to Repository (R2R; http://rvdata.us/) program has made dramatic progress in routinely capturing shipboard data from the entire US academic fleet of 25 active service vessels. The R2R team has developed innovative technology to overcome the wide diversity of data practices, naming conventions and data formats across the fleet, which is managed by 18 independent operating institutions, large and small. As of September 2012, R2R had cataloged 11,026,386 data files from 2,644 cruises. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These NSF-funded accomplishments clearly benefit the US research community, but inquiries in the marine sciences are becoming more global in scope. While other nations and regions, notably the Europeans and the Australians, have also made tremendous progress in gathering data sets and placing them online, inevitably barriers to discovery and access can exist for a host of reasons, from basic awareness of resources to conflicts in search and access protocols, naming conventions and data formats. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rather than continuing to independently develop (expensive) wheels, ODIP proposes to establish formal collaboration mechanisms to synchronize US, European and Australian efforts with a series of technical workshops designed to make practical advances, rather than a series of meetings in which PI?s stand up and make presentations. The Ocean Data Interoperability Platform (ODIP) has been launched as a combined US-EU-Australian project specifically because ocean data interoperability must span national boundaries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;R2R is a collaborative NSF program, funded through 31 August 2014, combining the efforts of LDEO, SIO, WHOI and FSU. The R2R team requests funding to (1) enhance the flexible discovery and harvesting of R2R content through implementing a ?Linked Data? approach; (2) map key vocabularies used by R2R to their EU counterparts, allowing users to search across US and EU resources using the terms with which they are familiar; and (3) upgrade existing R2R ISO 19115 metadata records to be compliant with the EU INSPIRE schema, which specifically addresses documenting quality. These efforts will be carried out in coordination with a number of other current interoperability projects, such as the work of the EarthCube Interoperability Concept Group, Unidata, and the COOPEUS project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Ocean Data Interoperability Platform (ODIP) was a three-year EU led project (2012-2015) with partners from 10 organizations and 5 countries, to promote global access to marine data through a series of technical workshops and joint projects.  US participants in ODIP included the four institutions (Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Florida State University, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution) in the NSF-supported Rolling Deck to Repository (R2R) program, whose mission is to ensure the underway environmental sensor from US academic research vessels are routinely captured, cataloged, documented, archived, and disseminated to the public.  The R2R team completed a set of prototype projects that (1) published research results from the R2R data catalog using Semantic Web ("Linked Data") technologies, making results easier to discover and harvest; (2) linked controlled vocabularies used by the R2R catalog to equivalent vocabularies used by European and Australian catalogs; and (3) upgraded the R2R catalog to align with the EU INSPIRE standard, which supports documentation of data quality.  Each R2R institution recruited a university student to participate in technical development and attend an international workshop, in support of US workforce development.  The R2R team at LDEO led development of Cruise Summary Reports (CSRs) for expeditions on US academic research vessels, using an international standard ISO 19115-2 metadata profile developed by the EU SeaDataNet project.  A GeoNetwork Web portal was deployed at http://catalog.rvdata.us/geonetwork/ to serve CSRs, and similar portals have been deployed by partners in Europe and Australia.  These records, in turn, are harvested by the Partnership for Observation of the Global Oceans (POGO) global catalog.  CSR development involved collaboration with developers at IFREMER (France), BODC (UK), MARIS (Netherlands), BSH (Germany), CNR (Italy), and CSIRO (Australia).  In parallel to the CSR development, a Ph.D. student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute developed a "Linked Data" interface to the R2R catalog that makes research results easier to browse and search.  A new initiative was launched to publish a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for each expedition in the R2R catalog, making research results from field expeditions easier to cite and link with journal articles.  Results from ODIP have been published in two journal articles and a book chapter, are available online from the R2R Web site, and have been presented at numerous international conferences.
