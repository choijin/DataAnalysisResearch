<AbstractNarration>The objective of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) Collaborative Research project is to investigate a novel self-powered dual-mode piezoelectric resonant pressure/temperature sensor that can operate in the harsh downhole environments without requiring external electricity as a step to resolve the critical challenges for downhole sensing and power supply posed by high temperature, high pressure, large shock environment of oil/gas field explorations. The material properties of the new high temperature piezoelectric material will be characterized, and theoretical analysis will be performed to predict the specific cut angle for dual-mode sensing. A novel torsional vibration energy harvester and thermoelectric generator will be designed to harness electricity from downhole drilling with dual function of suppressing the self-excited torsional vibration of the drill string. The complete self-powered sensing system will be validated through laboratory and in-field test. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results will create new knowledge on high temperature and high pressure sensing and energy harvesting. The data of material properties and theoretical modeling will not only enable predictable design of the piezoelectric resonant sensor operating in harsh environments but also will lay a solid foundation for future piezoelectric resonator design. The proposed multi-source thermoelectric and electromagnetic energy harvesting mechanism not only generates useful energy from the intrinsic downhole heat and drillstring vibrations, but also creates new knowledge of energy harvesting in harsh environments with broader applications. The self-powered sensing system will lead the way to drilling deeper and more productive oil &amp; gas wells to meet the urgent national energy need. Integrated with the research is a carefully orchestrated educational and outreach plan at the both participating universities, particularly for minorities, women, undergraduate, and K12 students.</AbstractNarration>
