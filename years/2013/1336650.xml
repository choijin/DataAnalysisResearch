<AbstractNarration>1336650 (Pruden). Residential hot water infrastructure is a critical nexus of water, energy, and public health. In the U.S., its total energy demand exceeds that of the water and wastewater utility sectors combined, while building plumbing systems (especially hot water) are now the primary source of waterborne disease outbreak. In particular, Legionella pneumophila, non-tuberculosis mycobacteria, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acanthamoeba are especially challenging because they establish and grow within the hot water distribution system itself. Unfortunately, there is currently a void of practical research to guide rational selection of optimal hot water systems. Thus, the overall goal of the proposed research is to advance sustainability of our residential hot water infrastructure by conducting the first integrated assessment of performance in terms of public health, water savings, energy goals, and overall system vulnerabilities. Three specific research Objectives (O1-O3) are: O1. Conduct a controlled, head-to-head study of standard, recirculating, and on-demand water heater configurations over a range of temperatures and water demands and compare their performance in terms of energy consumption and microbial quality of the water; O2. Examine the interplay of varying water chemistries, pipe materials, and water heater configuration on scaling, corrosion, energy loss, and microbial quality of the water; and O3. Develop a multi-criteria decision analysis tool to identify the most sustainable configuration(s) for a specific context, with consideration of consumer barriers to implementation.  Although 3.3-5.5% of total U.S. energy demand is used in residential water heating systems, and such systems are now the primary source of waterborne disease outbreak, there exists a critical gap in fundamental knowledge needed to select an optimal water heater. Extensive head-to-head comparisons will be made of water and energy demands incurred by three representative water heater configurations. Application of next-generation DNA sequencing tools will provide a truly pioneering understanding of water heater impacts on pathogens and the broader microbial ecology. Preliminary results suggest that hydrogenotrophic bacteria may utilize hydrogen produced by magnesium anodes (common in tank heaters to reduce corrosion) and, in turn, fix and release detrimental levels of organic carbon into the water. Other preliminary results indicate that copper may possess beneficial properties for inhibiting Legionella. While this research focuses on electric energy sources as an important first step, the fundamental understanding gained, such as effects of temperature stratification, scaling, and roles of plumbing components, can be readily extrapolated to other energy sources. The optimal water heater is likely to vary based on a variety of local constraints. Although on-demand is expected to have the lowest initial water and energy demands, and the least potential for pathogen amplification, it is not likely to be a feasible option in waters of high scaling potential. Effects of all operating conditions on disinfectant residual levels, a critical protective barrier against pathogens, will also be a vital factor for overall performance evaluation. Evidence is mounting that existing ?green? advice may be creating misguided policy with long-term negative repercussions on water-energy consumption and public health. This research seeks fundamental knowledge and a holistic perspective to support rational decision-making by consumers, public health officials, and regulators on selection of optimal hot water systems. Scientifically-defensible recommendations considering multiple dimensions of performance are necessary to achieve truly sustainable water systems. The proposed effort incorporates a significant social science component and sustainability ranking approach in support of the development of a multi-criteria decision making tool. Results will be available on public websites, presented at green building and water engineering conferences, and published in the peer-reviewed literature. The project will also support three graduate students, who will participate in the Water INTERface Interdisciplinary Graduate Education Program and will be trained across fields of green engineering, water chemistry, and environmental microbiology. Undergraduate researchers will also participate through the Interdisciplinary Water Science and Engineering NSF REU site.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Certain conditions can lead to the growth of pathogens (i.e., disease-causing microorganisms) in biofilms that form in pipes, showerheads, and other fixtures delivering potable water in buildings.  In particular, Legionella is a pathogenic bacterium that causes a deadly form of pneumonia called Legionnaires? disease.  Several factors can influence the growth of Legionella in potable water plumbing systems, including pipe materials, disinfectant type and concentration, flow conditions, stagnation, organic carbon, nutrients, and temperature.  Of these, the present study and others have shown temperature to be an overarching factor that can either control or stimulate Legionella growth.  Cold temperatures (e.g., less than 20&#8304;C) inhibit Legionella growth, warm temperatures (e.g., 25-38&#8304;C) stimulate Legionella growth, and hot temperatures (e.g., greater than 60&#8304;C) kill Legionella.  However, it is difficult to maintain such hot temperatures in the far-reaching distal portions of the hot water plumbing in buildings, while concerns about energy savings and scalding are major drivers incentivizing lower temperature settings on water heaters.  Identifying the ideal water heater type, configuration, and temperature settings and their interaction with various other factors that affect Legionella growth is a grand challenge for waterborne disease control.   The objectives of the primary award were to conduct controlled, head-to-head studies of different water heater types, plumbing configurations, water demands, water chemistries and pipe materials in order to identify operational ranges that minimize energy requirements as well as Legionella growth.  Full-scale studies of commercial water heaters with different plumbing configurations (standard, recirculating, convective mixing) were carried out alongside simplified batch-scale simulations of water heaters with waters of varying chemistries (e.g., different organic carbon concentrations, varying doses of copper and other disinfectants, presence of iron) and results were compared in terms of energy utilized and survival of Legionella.  At the same time, a study was conducted to identify and survey stakeholders involved in water heater purchase and installation in order to understand the drivers of water heater selection and configuration and how energy savings and public health considerations factor in.      A supplement to this award was granted by NSF to conduct field research to explore factors that could have contributed to the Legionnaires? disease clusters that occurred in Flint, MI from 2014-2015.  A research experience for teachers (RET) was also awarded to support a high school teacher in collaborating in this effort, along with several other research experience for undergraduates (REUs) and RETs that were funded by NSF REU/RET sits at Virginia Tech. Key aspects of the intellectual merit of this research included the interdisciplinarity and multiple scales of the research question towards providing a tangible means of optimizing energy savings and advancing public health.
