<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to advance understanding of the physical processes responsible for uncertainties in the projected evolution of the West Africa Monsoon (WAM) in climate models. Making use of simulations from the recent fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), this project proposes to explore the hypothesis that differences in the simulation of land-atmosphere processes in climate models play a role in the spread of WAM projections across models. Expected outcomes of this activity include: (i) an evaluation of WAM evolution in climate change simulations from the latest generation of climate models; (ii) a characterization of simulated land-atmosphere processes in these models; and (iii) an estimation of how inter-model variability with respect to these processes relates to the spread in WAM projections. Regardless of whether simulated land-atmosphere processes are found to explain the scatter in WAM projections in climate models, this project will lead to increased understanding of how models simulate fundamental coupled land-atmosphere processes as well as the uncertainty of such processes across the CMIP5 ensemble.</AbstractNarration>

Local populations rely heavily on this precipitation for their livelihood. As a result, past dry spells of the Monsoon, such as the drought of the 70?s and 80?s, have had dire humanitarian consequences, and the region is vulnerable to potential adverse future changes in the Monsoon in the context of climate change. Yet, the physical mechanisms governing the monsoon behavior and its variations are not fully understood, and simulations from climate models give contrasting results regarding the future evolution of the Monsoon in a warmer climate.  In this context, the research conducted under this Award aimed at improving our understanding of the West African Monsoon and its future under climate change.  The focus was on investigating the role of physical interactions between soil moisture and the atmosphere. These processes are important for surface climate.
