<AbstractNarration>The goal of CRA-W (Computing Research Association Committee on the Status of Women in Computing Research) is to increase the number of women, including minority women, who participate and succeed in computer science research at every stage of the research pipeline. Achieving these objectives requires that an increasing number of women in academia start and progress to the next stage. Alas, the percentages of women in academic positions in PhD-granting Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) departments indicate that women continue to be severely underrepresented. The failure to capitalize on the creativity of female researchers represents a huge opportunity cost to the U.S. economy and national security to grow our nations leadership in technical innovation. CRA-W will (1) develop programs to increase the number and successful promotion of women CSE faculty to tenured and full professor and (2) conduct comparative evaluation of participants in our programs versus non-participants. Our programs apply the unifying framework of Social Cognitive Career Theory, which finds that interest in and choice of a particular career path will be increased by interventions that improve one or more of the following: (1) outcome expectations (understanding and valuing the rewards of a particular outcome), (2) self-efficacy (a belief that one can successfully achieve an outcome), and (3) social supports that help one persist and overcome obstacles. Our long-term group and individual mentoring programs aim to make participants aware of the rewards of an academic career; to help participants develop self-efficacy through increased knowledge, skills, and confidence; and to connect participants to the computing research and education communities and to each other to further their success. Participants and research mentors attend an initial group workshop, re-connect in small mentoring groups yearly, and meet every three to four months electronically. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This ADVANCE PAID project seeks to improve equity in the discipline, through a coordinated suite of mentoring, role modeling, community building, and professional development workshops. The program adaptations are based on prior published research and our experiences and evaluation of programs in our portfolio. For example, the programs use results that show that individual faculty mentoring in other fields improve faculty success with respect to top venue publication, grant funding success, and promotion.  In addition, the CRA Center for Evaluating the Research Pipeline (CERP) will provide the first ever, longitudinal and national study of the factors that lead to successful academic careers for faculty in computing. In particular, CERP will evaluate whether our CRA-W intervention programs are effective at increasing the participation and success of faculty women in computing.  The evaluation efforts of CERP will yield a national faculty comparison database that will become a powerful national resource for the CSE community and for informing the wider research community on influencing success within academic careers.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The Computing Research Association?s Committee on the Status of Women in Computing Research (CRA-W) was established in 1991 with the goal of implementing and evaluating programs to increase the success and retention of women in computing research.   The programs have an overarching goal of widening the research pipeline at all career stages; in addition, CRA-W, through the formation of the CRA Center for Evaluating the Research Pipeline (CERP), has developed a methodology for thoroughly evaluating the success of its programs by comparing a nationwide sample of students, researchers, and faculty (non-participants) to program participants. Graduate/Early-Career: Early-Career Mentoring Workshops offer career skills, advice, and technical insight and are typically co-located with major technical conferences. The workshop goals are to build technical skills and community among women researchers within computing research.  Mid-Career: Mid-Career Mentoring Workshops ensure the development of senior leaders and access to role models to attain the top of their career track, i.e., full professor, chaired professor, administrative and other leadership positions in academia. The workshops focus on topics such as achieving excellence in teaching, research, and service; determining what work is important; establishing mentoring for participants and encouraging them to mentor others; understanding professional opportunities; and creating opportunities and establishing technical and service leadership, within their institutions and outside. An essential outcome of this project is a method for comparative evaluation for Career Mentoring Workshops in order to determine program effectiveness and improve program design.  The Data Buddies project, designed by CRA-W and now conducted by CERP, collects and reports survey data from computer science and computer engineering departments to examine patterns of entry, experience, and progress among students and faculty.   Cumulatively, this project enabled CRA-W to provide essential career skills, advice, and technical insight with approximately 4,827 participants (~331 in intensive career mentoring workshops, and ~4,496 in conference session settings). CERP?s analysis assessing the impact of the Career Mentoring Workshops indicates early career professionals reported stronger levels of peer support and confidence to communicate with others after attending the workshop. They also felt an increase in their knowledge about the steps they needed to take to reach the next level in their careers and who to turn to for guidance moving forward. Mid-career women reported stronger proficiency in their ability to build and maintain their professional network. They also reported a boost in their vision for their future careers after the workshop. Additionally, the comparative analysis found that, after the workshop, both early and mid-career women were more likely to do formal outreach to K-12 and undergraduate students and utilize their outreach efforts to promote broadening participation in computing compared to both women and men who did not attend the workshops.
