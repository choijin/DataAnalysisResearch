<AbstractNarration>Rengmitca is a highly endangered Tibeto-Burman language currently spoken by fewer than fifty individuals along a tributary of the Matamuhuri river in Southeastern Bangladesh. Study of the language is crucial because its core vocabulary exhibits a number of conservative features for a Tibeto-Burman language: Rengmitca retains not only consonants that the Tibeto-Burman parent language had at the ends of its words, but also prefixal elements which most modern languages have lost. Rengmitca may thus act as an independent source for verifying hypotheses about the parent language. The relationship through contact of the language to a second language, Mru, which all Rengmitca speakers have as their primary language, is also of particular theoretical interest. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project will collect as much data as possible for the language before it disappears. Project members will gather a corpus of texts representing different genres from the remaining speakers. Using collected text material and other investigative methods, a lexicon of essential Rengmitca items will be assembled. The project will attempt to provide a detailed phonology and sketch grammar for the language. The project will archive documentary materials for the language at Dartmouth College and with The Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The primary research objective of this project has been the collection of high-quality documentary materials for Rengmitca, a critically endangered language spoken in the far southeast of Bangladesh. The language is a member of the South Central (Kuki-Chin) branch of the Tibeto-Burman language family, one of the world's major linguistic groups stretching from Tibet to Southeast Asia. Within Tibeto-Burman, the South Central languages number around fifty in the Bangladesh, Northeast India, and Myanmar border region.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>When the PI located speakers of Rengmitca in 2009, the language was known only from a few references to it and a wordlist collected by Lorenz L?ffler, a German/Swiss anthropologist. At the time of its rediscovery, the Bangladesh government did not even know of its existence. At the beginning of the project in 2015, there were perhaps ten fully proficient speakers of the language. Today the number has dwindled to around half that.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Having tracked down most of the remaining speakers of the language, the PI made several hours of high-quality audio and video recordings for the language representing different speakers and speech genres: narratives, procedural texts, oral histories, etc. Not all of the collected materials could be fully processed during the course of the grant, but a representative amount has been subjected to careful transcription, translation, and linguistic analysis. The PI's notes from this work have been converted into time-aligned analyses for the recordings using the ELAN linguistic annotation software. All materials, including the PI's notes, the raw audio and video files, as well as the ELAN time-aligned transcription, linguistic analysis, and translation, will be deposited with PARADISEC (the Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures) at the University of Sydney, and with CoRSAL (Computational Resources on South Asian Languages) at the University of North Texas. These materials will provide a rich, publically-available resource for scholars on Tibeto-Burman linguistics, as well as for anthropologists and historians specializing in the area. The materials furthermore will provide the community with a lasting record of their language, which may not be retained in future generations.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The PI has presented several conference papers treating various aspects of Rengmitca's grammar. He will expand these presentations and the archival materials into a monograph on the language, projected to include the analyzed texts and a glossary, as well as extended grammatical and phonological sketches for the language.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Rengmitca is an important language among South Central languages because of its great conservatism. In particular, it retains consonant elements found both at the beginnings of words and at the ends of words in the hypothetical parent language to the South Central languages. One scientific outcome of the research is thus the important validation that Rengmtica's retention of such sounds provides for reconstructed vocabulary otherwise based on languages which don't offer as complete a record.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Rengmitca also is intriguing due to its contact with a more distantly related Tibeto-Burman language, Mru, which Rengmitca speakers have been shifting to over several decades. Although all current Rengmitca speakers are equally fluent in Mru, and can import Mru words wholesale into their Rengmitca grammar, a further scientific outcome of the research is that Mru's grammar has had remarkably little influence on the structure of Rengmitca, which closely resembles that of its South Central relatives.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The project has furthermore led to human resources development. In Bangladesh, local field assistants and interpreters received training in the operation of recording equipment and practice in speaking English and linguistic analysis, experiences they will transfer to other contexts. At Dartmouth, students who assisted with data entry received training in using ELAN software and in linguistic analysis. One of these students has gone on to an industry career in computational linguistics; others involved in the project have moved on to, or plan to begin, graduate studies in linguistics.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In the Rengmitca community, the project has engendered awareness of the importance of preserving the language. The PI conducted two workshops on the language for community members, during which the participants formed committees for promoting use of the language and for literacy. The community is uncertain as to what sort of orthography they will ultimately adopt for the language, but the project's analysis of Rengmitca's sound system will facilitate development of a writing system and literacy materials when the community is ready.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Finally, in Bangladesh, the project has led to greater visibility for the issue of language endangerment. Since the revelation of the language, Rengmitca's case has become an important discussion point, especially around the 21<sup>st</sup> of February (<em>Ekushey</em>) holiday. This holiday inspired the establishment of the United Nations International Mother Language Day, and it is the most important secular holiday celebrated in Bangladesh. Now each year, Rengmitca and its story feature widely in the Bangladeshi press in conjunction with this holiday.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/20/2020<br>      Modified by: David&nbsp;A&nbsp;Peterson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1360770/1360770_10315978_1595189934033_workshop--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1360770/1360770_10315978_1595189934033_workshop--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Workshop on Rengmitca language, January 2015"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1360770/1360770_10315978_1595189934033_workshop--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Workshop on Rengmitca language, January 2015"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Rengmitca speakers and other community members meet with the PI for a workshop on the language in Alikadam, Bangladesh.</div> <div class="imageCredit">David A.
