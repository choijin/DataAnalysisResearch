<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to discover revolutionary origami-based electromagnetic components, radiofrequency circuits, and systems, that will transform the fields of communications, energy autonomy and sensing. This research is producing the first origami engineered systems with cognitive capabilities, that are exploitating numerous bands of the ambient radiation spectrum. The scientific objective of this work is to derive rigorous and integrated Mathematical-Computational-Electromagnetic models of origami geometries in order to study and develop novel foldable, energy autonomous and self-deployable electromagnetic systems with multi-band and folding-dependent operation. This comprehensive, fundamental study of origami foldable and self-deployable electromagnetic systems focuses on the development of advanced miniaturized, perpetual (that is, autonomous battery-less operation through energy harvesting and wireless power transfer) and reconfigurable electromagnetic systems for next generation communication, reconnaissance, sensing, as well as wireless power systems that support civilian and military applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this work will benefit the fields of autonomous near-zero-power reconfigurable wireless telecommunications and sensing systems operating in harsh environments, such as disaster areas, structural health monitoring, Internet-of-Things, agricultural and water quality monitoring. Also, this work is expected to revolutionize airborne and wearable antennas, antenna arrays, resonators, harvesters, radiofrequency circuits and Wireless Sensor Networks realized in a variety of flexible materials with an easy to launch and carry miniaturized folded area. The project will also bring benefits to autonomous radio frequency devices with enhanced electromagnetic compatibility capabilities that can be integrated with biomedical implants and biosensors. This will enhance our national capabilities for disease prevention and real-time treatment as well as improving health and quality of life. The project's educational efforts are focused on broadening participation of underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering and mathematics through curriculum development, undergraduate research experiences and outreach efforts. Broad dissemination of the project results will be accomplished through presentations to schools and the industrial community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the National Science Foundation and the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research.</AbstractNarration>
