<AbstractNarration>Tuskegee University engages 150 students in grades 8-12 in three-week summer workshops featuring STEM content, web-design, the multi-disciplinary area of human-computer interaction, and career study seminars/webinars. Students design a website incorporating STEM content, and then use a technology called eye-tracker to test the effectiveness of their communication. The project design combines three aspects of best practices in learning and extends them to a technology-based pedagogy: writing-to-learn, learning-to-write, and project-based learning. Teams of students will use project-based learning and will learn how to design a web-page (layout, incorporating content) as the learn-to-write component and then incorporate appropriate STEM content as the writing-to-learn mechanism to learn STEM concepts.  The project will primarily target students from groups traditionally under-represented in STEM careers. Workshops will be held at two Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) sites: Tuskegee University and Alabama State University. The program will be aligned with the Alabama Course of Study which is currently based on the Common Core.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The motivation of the project "Strategies: The Eyes Say It All -&nbsp;Using web page design and eye-tracking technology to learn STEM concepts, research skills, and human factors" was the non-competitive performance of US K-12 students in science in general, and of students from underrepresented groups in particular. An innovative approach for learning science concepts for 9-11 grade students was designed and implemented as a three-week long summer program for approximately 40 students each of the three years of the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Intellectual Merit: Of the many reasons for the subpar performance of US school students in science is engagement with the learning materials. A learning environment that provides opportunities to apply, or see the application of the concepts being learned, to real life problems has been shown to engage students. This project used an authentic learning environment in which students were required to deliver a 'product' and in this product developmemnt process the learnig of science concepts was embedded. The&nbsp;constructs of 'Learning to Read - Writing to Learn' were implemented in an innovative manner by applying them to a technology-mediated environment. The camp-participants worked in&nbsp;5-person&nbsp;teams as 'web developing companies' and responded to requirements that were provided to them. These requirements were based on several science concepts that were selected from the Alabama Course of Study standards. The student teams went through a complete product development cycle that included the use of state of the art eye-tracking technology to test how viewers responded to their designed websites. In this process the students learned about team work, the product development cycle, web design, and human factors, embedded in which was researching and learning the science concepts.&nbsp;</p> <p>Project Outcomes: The analysis of the data indicated that students developed their team work and web development skills. Science content assessment data showed improvement in students' understanding of the science concepts that they researched for inclusion in their websites. The participating students also showed an increased understanding of the product design cycle, human factors and eye-tracking technology. Overall, the project was successful in engaging 9-11 grade students in learning science and technology.&nbsp;</p> <p>Broader Impacts: The project impacted 128 students (63 females and 65 males). All students were from underrepresented groups, with half of them from a rural county and half from an urban county.&nbsp;&nbsp;Students also were exposed to college life and distance education instruction as they received synchronous distance education with their sister site and communicated with each other via distance education technologies.&nbsp;The project team also conducted&nbsp;one 3-day long professional development for 17 high school teachers (13 females and 4 males), 16 of whom were from underrepresented groups. The results of the research have been shared with other professionals at various conferences&nbsp;and in publications. The results of the project indicate that this learning method can be incorporated into the classroom to teach a variety of science and non-science concepts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/04/2018<br>      Modified by: Mohammad&nbsp;J&nbsp;Khan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1312285/1312285_10261967_1520047734620_SummerCampComponents--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1312285/1312285_10261967_1520047734620_SummerCampComponents--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Summer Camp Components"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1312285/1312285_10261967_1520047734620_SummerCampComponents--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Summer Camp Components"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Components of the Eyetrackers Summer Camp</div> <div class="imageCredit">Tuskegee University/Alabama State University</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Mohammad&nbsp;J&nbsp;Khan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Summer Camp Components</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1312285/1312285_10261967_1520047879167_StudentWebsite--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1312285/1312285_10261967_1520047879167_StudentWebsite--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student Website"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1312285/1312285_10261967_1520047879167_StudentWebsite--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student Website"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Student Developed Website With Eye-tracking Heat Map</div> <div class="imageCredit">Tuskegee University/Alabama State University</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Mohammad&nbsp;J&nbsp;Khan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student Website</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1312285/1312285_10261967_1520048520044_2016-activities--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1312285/1312285_10261967_1520048520044_2016-activities--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student Camp Activities"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1312285/1312285_10261967_1520048520044_2016-activities--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student Camp Activities"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Various team activities of the summer camp</div> <div class="imageCredit">Tuskegee University/Alabama State University</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Mohammad&nbsp;J&nbsp;Khan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student Camp Activities</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1312285/1312285_10261967_1520048593977_Studentactivities--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1312285/1312285_10261967_1520048593977_Studentactivities--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Student Camp Activities"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1312285/1312285_10261967_1520048593977_Studentactivities--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Student Camp Activities"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Student Camp Activities</div> <div class="imageCredit">Tuskegee University/Alabama State University</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Mohammad&nbsp;J&nbsp;Khan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Student Camp Activities</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
