<AbstractNarration>An important role of computational geometry is to understand and formalize the structure of data.  And as data is becoming a central currency of modern science, this role is growing in importance.  However, much of classical computational geometry inherently assumes that all aspects of data are known and precise.  This is rarely the case in practice.  This project focuses on building the foundations for two extensions to classic geometric settings pertinent to noisy data.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. The PI will study locational uncertainty in point sets, where the location of each data point is described by a probability distribution.  Given such an input, the goal is to formalize how to construct, approximate, and concisely represent the distribution of geometric queries on this uncertain data.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. The PI will study the geometric consequences of applying a statistical kernel (e.g. a Gaussian kernel) to a data set.  He will investigate how this process can smooth data, remove degeneracies, and implicitly simplify and regularize algorithms.  Moreover, he will explore the geometric structure of the resulting kernel density estimate, and how it relates to algorithms for the data and approximate representations of the data.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will lead the development of a data-focused educational program around the themes of data analysis, algorithmics, and visualization.  The PI is developing a model course for this program on data mining; it focuses on the geometric, statistical, and algorithmic properties of data.  An extensive set of course notes is being compiled, accompanied with videotaped lectures freely available online.  This class and program attract many interdisciplinary and diverse students and observers.  This program is part of a larger effort to make relevant data analysis techniques from computational geometry available to a broader data-rich audience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project formalized the important role of computational geometry in understanding noisy data.  It focused on two models: kernel density estimates (KDE) which implicitly replace each data point with a smooth kernel like a Gaussian, and a combinatorial uncertainty model where each point is endowed with a specific and known discrete distribution of its unknown location.  In the KDE model, this project developed and resolved the construction of KDE coresets, which are small subsets of points which guarantee bounded error in the density estimate implied by the KDEs.  This project provides tight bounds on the required size, which vary across 3 different regimes of dimensionality.  It also provided best known techniques and bounds for embedding these KDEs into a high-dimensional Euclidean space, that is easier to work with.  Both developments imply improvements in many classic kernel machine learning models and in new anomaly detection models based on KDEs.  In the discrete locational uncertainty model, this project provided new general and scalable algorithms for shape-fitting and robust estimators.  This perspective also resulted in new ways to model complex shapes as high-dimensional vectors which provides for simple and extremely efficient data analysis for complex and noisy shapes.  Furthermore it gave rise to clean and efficient approaches towards understanding structure in language models from a geometric perspective.     Driven by this geometric perspective on data analysis, the PI lead the development and growth of several outreach and educational efforts.  He co-organized 5 iterations of the Workshop on Geometry and Machine Learning -- an event at SoCG which provided a venue to promote and share advances highlighting the connections between the two areas.  He also spearheaded the development of the Data Science program at the University of Utah.  This included a new MS degree, expansion of the PhD and a graduate certificate programs in this area, a new Bachelors in Data Science, and two undergraduate certificates in data science.
