<AbstractNarration>Idealized fluid flows are modeled by the Euler equations of fluid dynamics; these are a coupled system on nonlinear conservation laws in (3+1)-dimensional space-time, and are the fundamental to all models of fluid motion. Compressible flows, in which the theory of sound is included,  exhibit discontinuous wave profiles; examples include shock waves, contact discontinuities, moving material interfaces, moving vacuum boundaries, entropy waves, and a variety of additional discontinuous wave patterns. The analysis of such multi-dimensional wave patterns, and in particular, solutions of the Euler equations which propagate at least one surface of discontinuity, is fundamental to the understanding of basic physical phenomena.  The goal of this research effort is to treat such multi-dimensional discontinuous wave profiles as moving free-boundary problems, and to develop a theory for the well-posedness of hyperbolic and degenerate hyperbolic systems, construct solutions which exhibit finite-time singularities wherein the propagating hypersurfaces collide with one another, study  singular asymptotic limits such as vanishing viscosity limits and limits of zero surface tension, and develop a novel nonlinear stability theory for so-called hyperbolic-parabolic problems which are ubiquitous in models of phase transition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiphase fluid flows with moving interfaces play a central role in a multitude of physical and engineering applications, ranging from the creation of hurricanes due to wind blowing on top of the ocean surface to the atomization of liquid fuel jets in combustion chambers to the motion of astrophysical bodies such as gaseous stars, and to fundamental predictions in atmospheric science and meteorology. The analytical understanding gained in this work may have important ramifications in the understanding of basic physical phenomena, which is heretofore, poorly understood. In addition to basic wave motion and singularities that occurs in the motion of interfaces between water and air, other conventional examples include the interface between air and water, the motion of cloud fronts,  the melting of ice-bergs,  basic  instabilities between two compressed gases, the behavior of a gas bubble in a liquid in a shock wave, and liquid fuels which are usually burned by first atomizing a fuel jet to increase the surface area and hence the evaporation rate.  This proposed research aims to analyze the motion of evolving surfaces of discontinuity in gases, liquids, plasmas, as well as in the context of classical phase transition models.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The equations describing fluid flow are now more than 250 years old, and have been studied extensively by mathematicians, physicists, and engineers, but some of the most basic questions concerning the existence and behavior of their solutions remain open.   In short, some of the most fundamental questions to answer are whether smooth solutions exist for all time, or if there is some mechanism which creates a singularity (known as a blow-up) in a finite amount of time.   Any attempt to answer these questions requires a detailed analysis of the complicated nonlinearities inherent in the Euler equations of inviscid fluid flow, and all other models that add dissipative effects and other physical quantities advected and interacting with the fluid.    Any attempt to provide a rigorous mathematical explanation for finite-time singularity formation or  the existence of global-in-time solutions  relies on the development of new analytical tools.   The PI's research has resulted in the development of a variety of new mathematical tools for the analysis of fluid flow with moving time-dependent fluid interfaces, either separating two (or more) fluids or separating a fluid from a vacuum state.     Specifically, the PI has developed a methodology which allows for the simultaneous study of the fluid flow and the changes to the geometry of the interface surrounding the fluid.    These methods have then been used to address some open problems in fluid interface motion, such as if interfaces can self-intersect, if two different fluids can collide with each other, and under what conditions such fluid interface motion is stable to small perturbations and thus solutions exist for all time.   The PI has disseminated the results obtained through papers,  the participation and organization of workshops, conferences, and seminars. Among these, the PI has been the organizer of the UC Davis "PDE and Applied Math" seminar, and the lead organizer of the NSF funded summer school "Mathematical Analysis of Water Waves and Related Models."
