<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program, Professor Keith Woerpel of New York University develops new chemical reactions of silicon-containing reactive intermediates to synthesize a class of compounds, trans-cycloalkenes, that have been particularly difficult to prepare, and explores the chemistry of this class.  The source of that difficulty has been their extraordinarily high energy, which renders them very reactive and difficult to isolate using conventional methods.  Conversely, their distinctive reactivity makes these tempting intermediates for the synthesis of biologically active and other useful compounds. Once the reactivity of this particular type of compound has been determined, the structure and reactivity of structurally related compounds can be predicted, and the design and synthesis of pharmaceutical agents, of tools for exploring biological systems, of plastics for use in medical and technological applications, and of materials for solar cells can be exploited. This project also serves as a training tool for graduate, undergraduate, and precollege students to prepare themselves for careers in research, in medicine, and in materials science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Divalent silicon reactive intermediates (silylenes, R2Si) are used to prepare highly strained trans-cycloalkenes.  Although strained cycloalkenes show promise for the development of efficient routes for the synthesis of biologically active natural products, the construction of strained cyclic alkenes has been difficult.  This project explores the synthesis of highly strained seven- and eight-membered ring trans-alkenes and examines the elevated reactivity of these compounds.  Studies of new reactions of these compounds focus on reactions that give products that are difficult to prepare using other methods.  Additional efforts will address the detailed reaction mechanisms of new reactions that deviate significantly from expected reactivity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project focused on the development of new chemical reactions of compounds containing silicon atoms.  Silicon is one of the most abundant elements on earth, and its chemistry is diverse, which can lead to new types of molecules and new reactions that are unique to silicon.  Our laboratory has focused on developing new chemistry of highly reactive silicon species and to apply those findings to the synthesis of compounds that could never have been made previously.  These studies led to the development of additional new reactions, which led to additional new types of highly reactive compounds.       We discovered that silicon-containing compounds called silylenes are highly reactive with a number of organic compounds.  These silylenes can then form new highly reactive cyclic compounds containing silicon atoms, which are in turn highly reactive.  Three-membered ring compounds led to the synthesis of seven-membered ring cyclic compounds upon addition of a second organic compound.  This unprecedented reaction could not have been anticipated based upon our previous knowledge of chemical structures and their reactivity.  Furthermore, these seven-membered ring compounds were found to be the most highly twisted and distorted small molecules of their class.  Consequently, they were found to be the most reactive of these kinds of molecules, and these reactions occurred in a highly specific way. This specificity provided important insight into our understanding of how these reactions worked, which has resulted in new chemistry development in our laboratory and others around the world. In addition, we also investigated the chemistry of eight-membered ring compounds with silicon atoms, which also could be prepared from silylenes.  These eight-membered ring compounds were also highly reactive.     This project has provided a number of important outcomes.  It has provided new insight into why certain compounds might be highly reactive, and how to tune that reactivity by placing certain groups at key positions on a ring.  It has also challenged the prevailing notions of what kinds of reactions are possible of strained organic compounds.  It has also shown that the chemistry of silicon can be used to create new types of reactive compounds that were never before possible to be made. Basic science of this type of essential to support and initiate applications of chemistry to fields such as biology, medicine, and materials science.     The project has also had broader impacts. Research on this project has enabled several students to receive their Ph.D. degrees, and those students are currently employed in academia and industry.  It has also served as a training ground for undergraduate students, who have used this training to further their own professional degrees.
