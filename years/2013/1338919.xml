<AbstractNarration>The Gordon Research Conference on Biological Mechanisms in Evolution: in Basic Biology, Cancer, Infectious Disease and Medicine, 2-7 June 2013 at Stonehill College, Easton, MA will bring current understanding of biological mechanisms, including molecular mechanisms of genome plasticity, mutagenesis, protein- and RNA-based inheritance, epigenetics, stress, stress responses, stochasticity, and phenotypic variation and plasticity, to bear on understanding of evolution, and many basic-science problems driven by evolution. The fields of evolutionary biology and mechanistic molecular genetics, genomics and molecular biology, focusing on the contributions of the latter to our understanding of evolution will be united. The modern synthesis of the early twentieth century, which gave birth to current evolutionary biology, predated the molecular biology revolution. Traditional evolutionary biology has not always kept pace with changes to the basic assumptions of genetic inheritance and discoveries of non-genetic inheritance that have come from studies on molecular mechanisms. Similarly, molecular biology has often ignored the critical roles of evolution in important basic-biological problems. This meeting is aimed at the growing body of investigators attempting to bring molecular biological mechanisms to bear on understanding of evolution. The goals are to catalyze integrated, mechanistic views of mechanisms of evolution operating today and their consequences in medicine and basic biology. Although molecular biology is only recently beginning to penetrate the arena of evolutionary biology, integration of these disciplines is crucial for deeper understanding of evolution and biology in general. This meeting will give a home and community to researchers doing this. The GRC program will include invited and contributed oral and poster presentations by both younger and more established researchers, focusing on the best emerging science in the field.  The GRC will provide participants a state-of-the-art view of a revolution in our understanding of the mechanisms of evolution brought about by understanding the fundamental biological mechanisms that drive it. The GRC will promote international and national collaboration between physicists and biologists, aimed at understanding fundamental molecular and biological mechanisms, and bringing this understanding to bear on evolution in disease and basic biology. It will also provide networking opportunities, inspiration and connections for young scientists, mentoring, and perspectives on cutting-edge new research for younger participants at a critical stage in their careers. The NSF funds will be used to defray the costs of a diverse group of graduate students, postdocs, new investigators and women and minority participants particularly.</AbstractNarration>

There was a conscious effort to stimulate lively discussion about the key issues in the field today. Time for formal presentations was limited in the interest of group discussions. In order that more scientists could communicate their most recent results, poster presentation time was scheduled. Attached is a copy of the formal schedule and speaker program and the poster program. In addition to these formal interactions, "free time" was scheduled to allow informal discussions. Such discussions are fostering new collaborations and joint efforts in the field.          Thank you for your support of this Conference. As you know, in the interest of promoting the presentation of unpublished and frontier-breaking research, Gordon Research Conferences does not permit publication of meeting proceedings.
