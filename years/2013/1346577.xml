<AbstractNarration>The 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallaj√∂kull volcano in Iceland resulted in weeks of air traffic disruption and more than a billion dollars of economic losses.  The disruption was exacerbated by limitations in the accuracy of models used to forecast the size, location, and ash concentration of the cloud.  The pre-2010 airline industry policy was to avoid any volcanic ash during flight, and existing models predicted that the plume covered much of Europe.  This has provided a new challenge to forecasters, as the rate that ash is fed into the cloud cannot be accurately estimated in complex flow situations.  This rate is usually determined from the height of the plume above the volcano, but it can vary significantly due to many factors, including eruptive conditions, atmospheric properties, and local wind speeds.  Hence, there is a vital need to develop improved models for realistic conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional plume models assume flow in a calm atmosphere, but plumes are significantly modified by perpendicular cross flows with varying scales of turbulence.  While cross flow has been considered in some models, the accuracy is still quite crude.  This study will develop an improved understanding of volcanic plumes in a stratified cross flow, which will be used to aid in forecasting the dispersal of hazardous ash clouds.  Advanced experimental techniques will be used to measure the flow in a laboratory scale plume.  These results will be incorporated directly into a state-of-the-art analytical model, which will more accurately quantify the ash density distribution for volcanic scales.  In addition, this research will be presented to the broad public audience through small-scale, hands-on laboratory demonstrations at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 2010, the relatively small, remote volcano Eyjafjallaj&ouml;kull erupted, generating an ash cloud that covered much of Europe for several days.

A primary forecasting challenge lay in the estimate of the mass of material erupted, which must be determined rapidly through field observations of plume height and eruption duration.  This information can be used in models that simulate the plume growth, but unfortunately these models are most accurate in a calm atmosphere.

The model also predicted the trajectory from Eyjafjallaj&ouml;kull quite accurately. Throughout the study, we performed educational outreach at the Oregon Museum of Science &amp; Industry (OMSI), disseminating the findings to the general public. through a permanent, hands-on demonstration.  We developed an interactive, hands-on activity on volcanic plumes in cross flow, which is being presented at OMSI periodically.  This outreach has been conducted multiple times per year by the PIs, a graduate student, and their youth-oriented Teen Science Alliance, reaching over 1000 guests of varying age and educational background. Finally, we have disseminated our findings through a series of journal articles and conference presentations.  At present, we have one published journal article, two more in review, and three more in final preparation for review.  Further publications are also being planned.
