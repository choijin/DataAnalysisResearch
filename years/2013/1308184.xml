<AbstractNarration>In this project we will study geometric structures and the structure of representation varieties.  These topics are a natural outgrowth of previous research programs that focused on low-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds.  The areas of Kleinian groups and the geometry of 3-manifolds have seen an amazing amount of progress over the last decade. As a result these areas are in a position to refocus their efforts.  The situation has become more like that of surfaces where one is interested in families and spaces of structures.  It is important to try to understand the genealogy of 3-manifolds, how they are related by various topological and geometric operations. This has led to the study of many other types of geometric structures, such as projective and Lorentzian structures, that don't have an invariant metric.  These structures are interesting in their own right.  They also provide a context in which to view the relation between the different eight 3-dimensional metric geometries, leading to the concept of transitional geometry.  Furthermore, there are interesting questions about geometric structures in other dimensions, involving an array of different Lie groups, such as hyperbolic structures in high dimensions, complex and real projective structures on surfaces, and representations of surface groups into higher rank Lie groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The idea of studying various types of metrics on spaces dates back at least to the late 19th century and the work of Poincare, Klein, and others.  Much of their motivation came from the desire to understand physical phenomena.  Modern physics, beginning with Einstein, has led to an even greater need for sophisticated mathematics to understand the physical universe, particularly that coming from metric geometry.  Although the physical world is not a completely homogeneous one like the type of structures studied in this project, hyperbolic and Lorentzian geometry are believed to represent useful models for understanding physical phenomena.  Geometry in dimension 3 is particularly appealing because it is visually accessible to many people, including beginning mathematics students and those with less technical backgrounds.  It also has led to the creation of a number of graphical interfaces that have been widely utilized.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The study of the topology of  3-dimensional manifolds has been greatly influenced by considering homogeneous geometric structures.  This approach was championed by William Thurston who made tremendous contributions to the field.  He showed that there are 8 maximal metric geometries in dimension 3, the most prevalent of which is hypberbolic geometry.  A smooth hyperbolic metric on a 3-manifold, if it exists, is unique up to isometry so all of its geometric quantities are topological invariants, allowing them to be used to study topological properties of 3-manifolds.  Because of the rigidity of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, there is no deformation theory available when sticking with smooth structures.  However, if one allows certain types of cone singularities, there is a rich deformation theory that allows one to interpolate between structures on manifolds related by topological operations, like Dehn surgery.  In some cases, the singular hyperbolic structures degenerate during a deformation.  This can lead to new types of geometric structures that are connected to hyperbolic geometry within the larger umbrella of projective geometry.  These include spherical and Euclidean geometry but also certain Lorentzian geometries, like anti-deSitter, deSitter, and flat Lorentzian geometry.  These lie outside Thurston's list of Riemannian homogeneous geometries but are shown to be intimately related to them.
