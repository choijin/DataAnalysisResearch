<AbstractNarration>Professor Donald Perry of the University of Central Arkansas is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, Nanochemistry (MSN) Program in the Division of Chemistry to investigate the catalytic and thin film growth properties of small organic and biological molecules on elongated metal nanostructures (EMNs) formed by oblique angle deposition (OAD). The long term goals of the project are to develop transformative methodologies of growing EMNs using OAD over a range of metals for applications in surface-enhanced vibrational spectroscopies, and to demonstrate the versatility of EMNs by exploring their catalytic properties and characterizing how an array of EMNs composed of different metals can alter the intermolecular forces in thin organic/biological films.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will provide new methodologies for growing metal nanostructures and will influence a range of applications in chemistry, biochemistry, physics, and engineering where the interactions of metal nanoparticles with organic and biological molecules are important.  Undergraduate students will also be impacted by exposing them to new developments in nanotechnology and the possibilities of a research oriented career in a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) field.  Involvement of undergraduates in research will also motivate students to choose careers in Arkansas where only 20% of the population has a four-year college degree.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this grant was to study the interactions of biological molecules with new and existing types of metal nanostructures using a combination of experiment and theory.  The direct impact of this work is broad and spans the range of scientific disciplines, including chemistry, physics, biology, engineering, and medicine.  Potential applications are enormous with examples in medicine, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, fragrances, adhesives, catalysis, agriculture, food processing, polymers, optics, photography, and numerous other areas.  Seventeen undergraduate students were involved in this work (12 published thus far), and all the students have moved on to industrial/government careers, graduate school, or various professional and medical schools.      The metal nanostructures were comprised of either gold, silver, copper, or nickel.   These metal nanostructures were used to make previously engineered and original types of substrates for optical applications involving surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA), which were the workhorse analytical techniques in these studies.  Other techniques utilized in this work include atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), various electronic spectroscopies, mass spectrometry, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.  A range of biological systems was studied from basic organic building blocks such as aromatic isomers, amino acids (used to make proteins), antibiotics, and the brain chemical dopamine.  In particular, the investigated focused on layer-by-layer film growth and attractive interactions within the layers including Van der Waals? forces, hydrogen-bonding, C-H hydrogen bonding, and halogen bonding.  Work also included catalytic studies of isocyanate chemistry on silver nanostructures.    Key results included the development of new nickel and copper nanostructures with never before seen or improved optical properties.  The demonstration of controlled isocyanate catalysis on silver nanostructures.  New types of C-H Hydrogen and halogen bonding as never before observed in both the biological monolayer and multilayer during adsorption on silver nanostructures.  Detailed analysis of hydrogen bonding networks in thin, biological films and the impact of metal nanostructures on the attractive forces.   The impact of solvent properties on thin biological film formation, especially in conjunction with the presence of metal nanostructured substrates.  Innovative theoretical approaches for modeling metal-organic interactions.  Analysis of various antibiotics combined with silver nanostructures (which have their own antimicrobial properties.  Finally, dopamine interactions with metal nanostructures revealed dopamine to be a most versatile molecule that formed unique thin films on every metal nanostructure in this investigation.
