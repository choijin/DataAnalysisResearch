<AbstractNarration>This Widening Implementation &amp; Demonstration of Evidence-Based Reforms (WIDER) award is providing the College of Natural Sciences at California State University San Bernardino (CSUSB) with a Faculty Learning Community (FLC) that is identifying, studying, and piloting evidence-based teaching practices in this University's areas of greatest need. In light of rapidly increasing enrollments and declining budgets, CSUSB seeks to develop and implement new teaching methods that improve student learning, and retention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The decision to create a FLC is based on evidence that FLCs are a more effective form of faculty professional development than other approaches. The FLC is focusing on improving teaching in large classes, employing online instructional methods, promoting engaged learning activities, using co-curricular activities, working with diverse populations, implementing appropriate assessment techniques, and evaluating teaching. Eight specific gateway courses with large enrollments and particularly high failure rates are the initial focus of the project. Thereafter, the FLC is collecting data to identify the extent to which faculty in the college use evidence-based teaching practices. The FLC is studying best practices in strategic planning and organizational change in order to develop a model for how evidence-based teaching practices can be adopted throughout the college and university. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to spread the most promising practices throughout CSUSB, thus improving student achievement. CSUSB is a Hispanic Serving Institution; the College of Natural Sciences has a 50% Hispanic population, 22% other minority groups population, and 61% female population. The results of this project hold promise to benefit STEM programs throughout the state and the Nation, especially as CSUSB disseminates information about evidence-based teaching practices in STEM disciplines and shares lessons learned about facilitating change in teaching practices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The College of Natural Sciences at California State University, San Bernardino, is committed to creating the systemic  change necessary for students taking Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics courses to be successful. The strategy is to create  a culture of  equity-minded, evidence-based teaching and learning that fosters deep  learning in students, and provides sustained faculty development  opportunities.  The project was successful at creating an active and intensive Faculty Learning Community that included two faculy members from biology, two from chemistry and two from physics, the College of Natural Sciences Dean, and that was co-faciltated by an internal and external faciltator.  The Faculty Learning Community met regularly as intended throughout the course of the project  and appears to have been an effective platform for increasing faculty  knowledge related to evidence-based teaching practices for STEM  education. The facilitators witnessed significant growth in  participants? understanding of how students learn, their confidence in  using evidenced-based teaching practices, and the degree to which they engaged in self-reflection  with regards to their teaching. All participants reported that the  experience had been extremely valuable for them, particularly the  community aspect of being in the group.  The  project was successful at disseminating information about evidenced-based teaching practices within the departments of College of Natural Sciences, at regional and  at national conference; participants reported increasing interest in pedagogy  in the biology, chemistry, &amp; physics departments and ongoing  conversations about new approaches to STEM pedagogy among the faculty.   A total of ten evidence-based teaching practices were piloted in ten College of Natural Sciences classes. The majority of students rated the piloted courses highly. In particular, most students felt that their instructor was well prepared, responsive to students, enthusiastic about their teaching, and successful at creating an environment that was conducive to learning. Over half of the students in pilot courses reported that as a result of the course, they had more positive feelings about that field of study and students who were more likely to report this were more likely to receive a higher grade in the class. The majority of students interviewed reported that they?d like to see the evidenced-based teaching practices, especially the clicker questions, implemented in their other courses. However, they felt that group work should be supplementary to direct instruction rather than the primary mode of instruction and wanted more flexibility with group assignments.  The project team was successful at developing a strategic plan for increasing the understanding and use of equity-minded evidence-based  teaching methods among faculty members in the College of Natural Sciences.  This project has already impacted students in General Education, lower  and upper division courses in the three participating departments, and  has begun to positively change the culture of the college toward the  investigation, use and assessment of evidenced-based teaching/learning  methods to enhance student success.  An increased number of College of Natural Sciences faculty members are particiapting in sustained professional development activities sponsored by the university's teaching center.  In 2012 only 20% of the participants in such activities were from CNS; the number rose to 44% in 2015.  The pilot project was also tremendously useful in assisting in identifying the needs and wants of faculty members and tailoring the professional development to these needs.  New in 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 is an Faculty Learning Community focussed on developing online/hybrid courses and Faculty Learning Communities that focus on re-designing programs rather than simply courses.  In addition, there are anecdotal indications that the culture around curriculum and pedagogy has changed. These indications include:    1) CSUSB is converting from quarters to semesters.  The quarter to  semester conversion director (formerly the teaching center director) has noted that in past years participation by College of Natural Sciences faculty  members in university-level teaching and curriculum related efforts has  been minimal but that there is significant participation in the Quarter to Semester  actitivities from the college.  An example is that Program Principles Re-design  Institutes are being offered as part of the Quarter to Semester conversion; five of the  nine departments in College of Natural Sciences are sending a team to one of these institutes  with one department sending two teams;  2) Similarly the effort to reform the general education program has active participation from the College of Natural Sciences;  3) Faculty members from eight of the nine departments in the college  are now actively involved in sustained professional development focussed  on equity-minded evidenced-based teaching practices.  4) Departmental practices in hiring faculty members has changed with  the review process taking into consideration a balance between teaching  and scholarship experience and potential, whereas in the past some of  the departments focussed almost exclusively on the scholarly record and  potential. A small indicator of this is that department chairs now  introduce new faculty members by not only describing their research  pedigree and experience but also their teaching experience and  interests.
