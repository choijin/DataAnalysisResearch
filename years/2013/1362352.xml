<AbstractNarration>This project lies in Algebra and focuses on cluster algebras and Poisson-Lie groups. Since the invention of cluster algebras by Fomin and Zelevinsky in 2001, the mathematical community witnessed an explosion of interest in the subject due to the deep connections that were revealed between cluster algebras and a variety of branches of mathematics and theoretical physics ranging from quiver representations and algebraic geometry to string theory and statistical physics. The PIs will build upon their previous collaborations to continue a systematic study of multiple cluster structures in coordinate rings of Poisson-Lie groups and a number of other varieties of importance in algebraic geometry, representation theory and mathematical physics and study an interaction between corresponding cluster algebras. The proposed research is linked to the development of undergraduate and graduate courses and research projects. Synergistic activities are planned with the goal to promote inter-institutional and inter-departmental cooperation, to attract graduate students from underrepresented groups and with diverse educational backgrounds, and, through community outreach, to expose high school students to mathematical research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will continue their work on applications of Poisson Geometry to the theory of cluster algebras. The main goals of the project include construction and study of (i) exotic cluster structures on simple Lie groups compatible with Poisson-Lie brackets described by the Belavin-Drinfeld classification; (ii) generalized cluster structures on the Drinfeld double and the Poisson-Lie dual of a simple Poisson-Lie group; (iii) combinatorics and inverse problems for higher genus nets dual to quivers arising in cluster structures above; (iv) discrete integrable systems arising as sequences of cluster transformations and elementary transformations of higher genus networks; (v) continuous limits for directed networks with applications to moduli spaces of flat connections.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The notion of cluster algebra was introduced by S.Fomin and A.Zelevinsky  mainly for the purpose of describing canonical basis of the universal enveloping algebra for simple Lie groups.  Later, the elements of the theory of cluster algebras were discovered  in many independent areas of mathematics and mathematical physics. Our group studies the relation between cluster algebra theory and  Poisson structures on an algebraic variety.  Our paper from 2003 claims that any cluster algebra generates  a compatible Poisson structure on some algebraic variety. Vice versa, it is interesting when the coordinate ring of an  algebraic Poisson variety has associated cluster structure.  One of the examples that we studied extensively is classical  simple complex Lie groups equipped with the R-matrix  Poisson-Lie bracket. The Poisson bracket on the Lie group is called Poisson-Lie if the multiplication map is a Poisson map. Belavin and Drinfeld classified in 1982 classical R-matrices. Sklyanin construction allows to build a Poisson-Lie bracket  for every R-matrix from Belavin-Drinfeld list, hence we obtained  constructable class of Poisson-Lie bracket for every  simple complex Lie group called Belavin-Drinfeld bracket. We conjecture that for every Belavin-Drinfeld Poisson-Lie bracket  there is a compatible cluster structure in the coordinate ring of the  corresponding simple Lie group.  Our main findings include considerable progress in this conjecture  for the case of SL_n-group. Namely, the Belavin-Drinfeld classification states that any solution of classical Yang-Baxter equation, namely classical R-matrix is described by two parameters, one discrete (called Belavin-Drinfeld triple) which is a nilpotent isometry between two isometric subsets of simple roots, and one continuous parameter.  Our conjecture for SL_n states that for every choice of Belavin-Drinfeld triple the coordinate ring of SL_n carries cluster algebra structure.  As a result of this project,  1. we proved our conjecture for a special choice of  Belavin-Drinfeld triple (so called, the Cremmer-Gervais Poisson bracket); 2. we proved the generalization of this conjecture for  the standard Poisson bracket to the Drinfeld double of SL_n.  Another finding is the prove of complete integrability  of corrugated pentagram map using the connection between cluster theory and Poisson structures.  Namely, the classical pentagram map was invented by Richard Schwartz. It maps a planar n-gon to another planar n-gon whose sides are short  diagonals of the original n-gons. The map is clearly projectively equivariant,  so it makes sense to consider the pentagram map on projective classes of  n-gones. The theorem by Ovsienko, Schwartz, and Tabachnikov claims that  this map is a discrete integrable map in Liouville sense, i.e., it is a time one map of a continuous integrable flow. Our result shows that complete integrability holds for some generalization  of pentagram map, called corrugated pentagram map, which maps an n-gon  in m-dimensional space to n-gon in m-dimensional space.
