<AbstractNarration>Project Description:&lt;br/&gt;This project is producing a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) delivered workshop that addresses the poor completion rate for MOOCs that currently exists. The project team is studying what factors impact the completion rates and gathering data that indicates how the addition of human mentoring and guided peer learning can impact student completion. The exploration is based on two observations: (1) MOOCs are presently more successful for highly self-motivated individuals, and (2) currently there is an absence of interactive human mentoring in MOOCs. Six different modes of instructor-student and instructor directed-student peer interactions are being investigated to determine efficacy of multiple methods of instructor intervention and human guidance in the success rates of online MOOC students. Ultimately, the project is offering guidance as to how MOOCs can more successfully impact a broader segment of students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Significance:&lt;br/&gt;MOOCs are presently being offered on a large scale; however, there has been little discussion of how effective these courses are with respect to student learning. This timely workshop offers a groundbreaking effort to study and report on the addition of interactive student mentoring to MOOCs. The effort is also examining the potential to provide students in high schools and community colleges with increased access to low-cost remedial mathematics courses. Students who complete such mathematics remediation before they arrive at a community college or university campus may be more successful in college, thereby increasing the likelihood of obtaining a bachelor's degree. The workshop is helping faculty to design and offer MOOC-style courses that have built-in mentoring components that are needed to help students complete these courses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ San Jos&eacute; State University (SJSU) and Udacity, a Silicon Valley-based provider of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), partnered to pilot three online courses spring 2013 with an enrollment of a broad range of participants (e.g. students from SJSU, community colleges, a partner high school and others from the Bay Area and beyond). The goal was to leverage new educational technologies to provide increased access to affordable, high quality university courses in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields.  In these pilot courses (Math 6L [Developmental Math], Math 8 [entry-level College Algebra], and Stat 95 [entry-level Statistics], enrollment was limited to 100 per course.  Research was conducted to examine students? performance and experience in the three pilot courses. The study included an analysis of student academic outcomes and surveys designed to document participants? satisfaction with their instructor, the MOOC technology, an array of MOOC student support services and their online interaction with other students.  In spring 2014, the Stat 95 MOOC was transitioned to a regular SJSU online course, still making use of the content developed with Udacity but adapted to SJSU?s learning management system, Canvas.  Further studies were conducted to assess faculty perspectives on the initial development and delivery of the course as a MOOC with Udacity and on the evolution of the MOOC to a regular SJSU online course delivered through Canvas.   The research found that in the spring 2013 courses, matriculated students performed better than non-matriculated students and that, in particular, students from the partner high school were less successful than the other students. Pass rates varied significantly with course taken and by persistence of student effort.  Stepwise logistic regressions found that student effort was more important than all other variables tested for their relationships to student success, including student demographics, course subject matter and students? use of support services. The clearest predictor of passing a course was the number of problem sets a student submitted. Video Time, another measure of effort, was also found to have a strong positive relationship with passing, particularly for Stat 95 students.  While the analysis did not find a positive relationship between use of online support and positive outcomes, this should not be interpreted to mean that online support cannot increase student engagement and success. As students, Udacity service providers and faculty members explained, several factors complicated and compromised students? ability to fully use the support services, including their limited online experience, their lack of awareness that these services were available and the difficulties they experienced interacting with some aspects of the online platform.   The low pass rates in all courses should be considered in light of the fact that the project specifically targeted at-risk populations, including students who had failed Math 6L before Spring 2013 and groups demonstrated by other research to be less likely to succeed in an online environment.  Previous studies have found that these students do less well in online than in face-to-face courses. Overall, much was learned during and from the first iteration of AOLE and improvements were put in place when the courses were offered with Udacity in summer 2013. Perhaps most importantly, the faculty members who taught these courses, although they had to contend with major difficulties along the way, believe that the content that has been developed has considerable potential to advance students? critical thinking and problem solving abilities.  The Udacity-SJSU collaboration facilitated the translation of the SJSU faculty members? subject knowledge and instructional expertise into contextualized, highly polished and professional online content.   The SJSU instructors invested a large amount of time in this process. In the words of one of the SJSU instructors: " [it was as much work as] writing an entire text book." Three years later, the faculty members looked back and felt very satisfied that the online course was "strong" and of very high quality.    Other faculty perspectives on teaching the online Stat 95 in subsequent semesters (spring 2014-fall 2016) indicate that instructors would benefit from more training in delivering online courses and from having in place a more formalized process to document and share effective practices and lessons learned&mdash;thereby supporting ongoing improvements over time.   Further, while there was considerable information available to the instructors that could be used to track student engagement and performance, the interviewees were not able to fully take advantage of this capacity because this was not included in the training or introduction they received to the course.  Many things need to be considered in the design and evolution of an online course: Instructor preparation and support, student preparation and support, and processes that can be developed to identify and quickly reach out to struggling students.
