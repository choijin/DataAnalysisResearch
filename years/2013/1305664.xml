<AbstractNarration>This research award in the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) program supports work by Professor Gary A. Lorigan in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio to probe the structure of membrane peptides using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy.  Membrane peptides are difficult to study because they are very hydrophobic.  Thus, the peptides are incorporated into a lipid bilayer membrane.  The objective of the proposed research is to develop state-of-the-art EPR spectroscopic techniques to probe the structural properties of integral membrane peptides. These techniques will be widely applicable to all peptide and protein systems. The pulsed EPR technique of ESEEM spectroscopy will be used to measure short-range distances (less than 8 Angstroms) between a spin label and deuterium nuclei on integral membrane peptides.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that the ESEEM technique will become a valuable biophysical tool for measuring distances on chemical and biological systems.  EPR spectroscopy is approximately a thousand fold more sensitive than NMR spectroscopy.  This new biophysical technique can move the field forward by providing an efficient and easy way to distinguish between alpha-helical, 3-10-helical and beta-sheet structural segments. The potential future benefits of this basic research are to develop new techniques to obtain structural information on membrane proteins.  This methodology is useful for all peptides and proteins, associated with energy shortages, electron transport, photosynthesis, and greenhouse gases.  Through this research program undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students from diverse backgrounds are trained in advanced techniques in biophysical chemistry, helping to strengthen the US STEM workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes (CHE-1305664 (CLP), "Investigating Membrane Proteins with Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy" $430,000, 9/1/13 &ndash; 8/31/17 Gary A. Lorigan, P.I.; We made excellent progress on this project over the last several years.  Funds from the NSF have resulted in approximately 93 publications since 2001 including a NSF CAREER Award.  Over the last 4 years (recent funding cycle), approximately 32 papers have been published from financial support on this project from the NSF.  We are working on 3 additional manuscripts right now.  This is an excellent track record.  Membrane proteins (which make up approximately one-third of the total number of known proteins) are responsible for many important properties and functions of biological systems: they transport ions and molecules across the membrane, they act as receptors, and they have roles in the assembly, fusion, and structure of cells and viruses.  Despite the abundance and clear importance of membrane-associated molecules, very little information about these systems exists.  New biophysical methods are needed to study the structure of membrane peptides and proteins.  Structural studies of these membrane proteins represent one of the final frontiers in biophysics and structural biology.  We developed new and alternative methods using the pulsed EPR ESEEM technique and the application of DEER to study membrane proteins and peptides with the NSF funding.  The NSF (CHE-1305664) project involved the application of state-of-the-art magnetic resonance spectroscopy to investigate peptides/proteins incorporated into phospholipid bilayers.  Two new methods were developed from this funding: (1) determine the structural topology of membrane proteins using EPR spectroscopy using an aligned approach, and (2) pulsed EPR techniques were developed to determine the secondary structure of membrane proteins. The pulsed EPR technique of Electron Spin Echo Envelope Modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopy was used to efficiently determine the local secondary structural characteristics of different membrane proteins when compared to solid-state NMR techniques.   Several graduate students and undergraduate students were trained with this funding.  The project has several important broader impacts as well.  The biophysical chemistry research conducted on this NSF grant advanced our understanding of the structural properties of several different integral membrane proteins while promoting teaching and training.  Postdoctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students received important scientific training. Undergraduate students played an integral role by preparing membrane protein samples and conducting EPR spectroscopic experiments. I have considerable experience working with undergraduate students in my lab. This summer 6 undergraduate students worked in my research lab. Undergraduate researchers in my lab have been co-authors on over 50 articles, with 8 of them serving as the first author on the paper.  Several of them have achieved Beckman Scholar awards, Astronaut Fellowships, Goldwater Fellowships, USA Today College Awards, and NSF Predoctoral Fellowships.  Thus, I am deeply committed to undergraduate research. In addition, 11 students who were in the lab as part of our summer research program decided to attend graduate school.  Postdoctoral researchers and graduate students typically help train undergraduates in the lab; therefore, they receive important experience in mentoring.  Five undergraduate students from underrepresented groups worked on this research project over the last few years, including two NSF REU students.  I currently have one African-American student, one Native American, a Hispanic undergraduate student, and numerous women working in my lab on this project.  In 2017, a female undergraduate student received the Astronaut Fellowship working on this project.  We met Astronaut Charles Duke from Apollo 16.  A new problem-based learning magnetic resonance lab was developed for a physical chemistry lab course. Undergraduate students construct knowledge about the physical properties that make NMR/MRI feasible by applying them to real work problems.  The results of this work were recently published in J.
