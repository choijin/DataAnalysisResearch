<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will optimize large-scale production of latex polymers from alkyl itaconates. These latexes represent a new class of polymers that offer desirable properties in wood, textile, paper and adhesive coatings, including low odor, no VOC contribution, and bio-based production. Itaconix has previously developed cost-effective emulsion polymerization processes to produce this new class of polymers. The research objective for this project is to scale and optimize these processes for use in large production reactors.  The expected result is commercial quantities of itaconate latexes. The project is highly innovative and will enable a major new class of latex polymers that are novel, offer desired coating properties, are made from renewable resources, and will accelerate the development of integrated bio-refineries. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is a significant expansion in the potential use of competitive bio-based products. Many of the current bio-based products under development, such as bio-acrylic acid, are drop-in replacements for petroleum-based versions of the same product. Future use of such drop-ins often depends on complexities of commodity prices, short-term economic objectives and long- term environmental goals. The benefits from producing and using of itaconate latexes are straight forward and uncomplicated. These products offer novel chemistry with unique functionality at competitive price/performance to petroleum-based products. They are safe for humans and the environment to manufacture and use.  They are made from renewable resources and will accelerate the development of high-value-added bio-refineries, and from paints to paper, consumers are seeking to increase the bio-content and use of renewable resources in the products that they buy. Commercial scale production and use of itaconate latexes will expand opportunities in the U.S. to meet all of these objectives.</AbstractNarration>
