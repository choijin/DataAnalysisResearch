<AbstractNarration>This REU program couples data-enabled science with mathematical modeling. The goal is to attract and retain students in STEM fields and to introduce them to this novel and exciting area of mathematical research. The objectives of the program are: to introduce students to scientific computing to strengthen programming skills, to use mathematical models to solve real-world problems, to apply computational tools to research-level problems, and to analyze results using data and translate into a scientific context. In this way, this REU site will not only expose students to an upcoming, data-intensive science, but will also promote creation, development, and application of novel tools essential for addressing the challenges of this emerging field.  This REU program will provide a rigorous and meaningful research experience in modeling and data-enabled sciences for undergraduate students in a team environment, improve the communication skills of future mathematical researchers, and recruit potential researchers in data-enabled sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU project will support eight undergraduate students for nine weeks each summer as they learn and develop the mathematical and computational tools necessary for data-driven applications, and as they gain professional-level research experiences in preparation for careers in STEM fields. In the first week, students will participate in a computational "bootcamp" designed to develop fundamental computational skills, preparatory to doing research during the rest of their summer program.  The students will then work intensely for the remaining eight weeks, in teams of four and with a faculty mentor, on projects with strong computational and modeling components. Students will actively participate in weekly workshops and presentations to practice and improve their communication skills. They will also produce a technical report and a poster, and present at a public research symposium at the end of the program.  Recruitment efforts will target groups that have been underrepresented in the STEM fields, including women, African Americans, Hispanics, American Indians, Alaskan Natives, Pacific Islanders and persons with disabilities.</AbstractNarration>

About half continued on to graduate school in various fields (biomedical engineering, applied mathematics, pure mathematics, statistics, and biology), with three students receiving NSF Graduate Research Fellowships.  Others are pursuing careers in industry as software engineers, research assistants, risk analysts, and business analysts.
