<AbstractNarration>The proposed project consists of two parts. The central theme of the first part is a conjecture, which can roughly be stated as follows: the class of groups admitting a non-elementary and "reasonably proper" action on a hyperbolic space is the same for any reasonable interpretation of the phrase "reasonably proper"; moreover, it coincides with the class of groups with non-degenerate hyperbolically embedded subgroups introduced by Dahmani, Guirardel, and the PI. The second part of the proposal is devoted to a more detailed study of groups with hyperbolically embedded subgroups. In particular, the PI plans to study questions related to rigidity, small cancellation theory, and applications of the general theory to groups acting on trees, one-relator groups, graph products, and fundamental groups of 3-manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The general goal of the project is to better understand the scope and limitations of geometric methods based on negative curvature in group theory. As a first step towards this goal, the PI proposes to analyze various negative curvature phenomena of algebraic, geometric, dynamical, and analytic nature occurring in different branches of group theory. This analysis is expected to lead to new general results with possible applications in group theory, 3-dimensional geometry, the theory of operator algebras, and other branches of mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Geometric group theory studies algebraic objects (groups) by visualizing them as sets of transformations of geometric objects (metric spaces). In 1980s, Gromov revolutionized the field by introducing the notion of a hyperbolic space and outlining a broad program of study of isometry groups of such spaces. Intensive work in this direction has resulted in the rich theory of hyperbolic and relatively hyperbolic groups.   A further generalization, the class of acylindrically hyperbolic groups, was suggested by the PI. It received considerable attention in the papers of the PI and others over the past few years. This class is broad enough to include many new examples of interest, yet a significant part of the theory of hyperbolic and relatively hyperbolic groups can be generalized in this context.  Results obtained by the PI lay the foundation of the theory of acylindrically hyperbolic group and provide new examples. The major achievements of the PI include  1) the proof of the equivalence of various definitions of acylindrically hyperbolic groups;  2) the general classification of acylindrical group actions on hyperbolic spaces;  3) a sufficient condition for a group acting on a tree to be acylindrically hyperbolic (joint result with A. Minasyan), which allowed the PI to provide new examples of acylindrically hyperbolic groups;  4) the study of transitivity degree of groups of geometric origin based on acylindrical hyperbolicity (join with M. Hull); in particular, this includes solutions of several open problems about highly transitive actions posed by Galssner;  5) linking analytic properties of finitely presented groups to the existence of nice actions on hyperbolic spaces.
