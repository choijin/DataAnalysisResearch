<AbstractNarration>The northern Awash region of Ethiopia is famous for its abundant fossil remains of the early hominin Australopithecus afarensis (e.g., "Lucy"), as well as evidence for the origins of our own genus, Homo, and the world's earliest stone tools.  Due to a regional unconformity, however, appropriately aged sedimentary deposits that bridge the critical interval between A. afarensis and Homo unfortunately are missing from most of the northern Awash.  This research project builds upon recent paleoanthropological work in the Afar Ledi-Geraru (ALG) region of the northern Awash that has identified paleontologically-rich sediments that fill this time gap,  providing a rare window into understanding the origins and the evolutionary and paleoenvironmental contexts of early Homo, and of lithic technology, a hallmark of the human lineage.  This field project also contributes to our understanding of the interval between 2.5 and 3.0 million years ago, one of the most fascinating periods in human evolutionary history, and one which encompasses both the first and last appearance dates of several other hominin species as well as significant changes in mammalian fauna and flora throughout Africa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique preservation of the ALG sequence enables a multidisciplinary team of paleoanthropologists, paleontologists, archaeologists, and geologists to 1) determine the paleoenvironmental context directly relevant to the morphological change and last appearance of A. afarensis, and the subsequent appearance of early Homo and stone tools in the northern Awash region; 2) extend spatial analyses of A. afarensis habitats from adjacent paleoanthropological sites into the ALG region to better understand the lateral variation in paleoenvironments; 3) collect evidence from fauna, hominin-modified fauna, and artifacts that existed in the ALG region during the earliest development of lithic technology; and 4) utilize transect excavations where potential hominin-modified bones were recovered, to document further evidence of possible early carnivory among hominins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes training in relevant field and lab techniques for a diverse group of graduate students, including women, Ethiopians, and other Africans, students typically under-represented in this field.  Data from this project also will be incorporated into teaching materials developed for K-12 teachers via internet download from the Arizona State University Outreach website.</AbstractNarration>

Research in the Ledi-Geraru region of Ethiopia has extended the known time period for the genus Homo back to 2.8 million year ago. Research supported by the National Science Foundation has identified that this species is the likely produced of some of the earliest chipped stone tools. With generous support from the National Science Foundation we excavated a large locality in the Ali Toyta drainage system. Volcanic ashes from the Busidima Formation from this region range in age from 2.9 million years old to &lt;2.4 Ma. The stone tools from this site represent of some of the earliest known stone artifacts in the world. They extend the age of clear chipped stone tool production by several hundred thousand years. In addition to the spectacular finds from this site, we helped support the graduate education of several American students (including a young woman) as well as several other international students (Ethiopians, South Africans). The findings of this study will dramatically change our understanding of when and how we began to make and use tools.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/29/2016<br>      Modified by: David&nbsp;Braun</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1302067/1302067_10169073_1456751790607_OUTCOMES_Report1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1302067/1302067_10169073_1456751790607_OUTCOMES_Report1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Excavations at BD1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1302067/1302067_10169073_1456751790607_OUTCOMES_Report1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Excavations at BD1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The excavations at BD1 in the Ledi-Geraru Area.
