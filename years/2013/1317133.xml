<AbstractNarration>Research has shown that in some societies fathers have lower testosterone levels than non-fathers.  Recent research by the investigators conducting this project was the first to use data collected over multiple years to show that it is the transition to married life and first-time fatherhood which causes large declines in testosterone, compared to if men remain single and childless.  These decreases in testosterone in new fathers and married men have been hypothesized to improve men's functioning as parents and spouses, but this has yet to be thoroughly tested, and it is known that not all men who become married or have children experience substantial decreases in testosterone.  This variation across men in their hormonal responses  might be linked to differences in mens roles across professional, social, and familial (including nuclear and extended kin) lives. To clarify the behavioral effects of these hormonal changes, their variation across men, and how these hormonal aspects impact child well-being and relationship quality requires that men and their families be followed through time. This project will explore these questions among 908 men, their spouses, and children participating in a unique study in the Philippines that has followed a large sample of families for 30 years. Demographic, health, behavioral, and relationship data will be collected through interviews with men and their spouses. Parents will provide child well-being and development data, and men's testosterone will be measured in saliva samples.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     By correlating hormone levels with detailed reports of men's familial, professional, and social behaviors and comparing with outcomes related to child well-being and family relationships, this study will help clarify the importance of men's biology to the functioning of families. This project also expands understanding of the ways in which behavior and biology differ between individuals and across cultural groups by contributing important insights into the range of human diversity in fathering/marital behaviors and their relationships to male hormonal profiles.  In achieving these goals, the project will be central to an integrative graduate/undergraduate training program in human biology at Northwestern University, and will broadly and positively impact productive international scientific collaboration between scholars and universities in the United States and the Philippines.</AbstractNarration>

By tracking these men through time, we were able to show that fathers&rsquo; testosterone declines are linked to their involvement in childcare. Based in part on this past research, scholars have hypothesized that declines in men&rsquo;s testosterone improve their functioning as parents and spouses, by facilitating nurturant, sensitive interactions within the family, but this has yet to be thoroughly tested. Moreover, parenting quality has been shown to be a bigger contributor to child development than sheer quantity of parental involvement. So, if biological changes in fathers impact child outcomes it is likely through effects on the quality of fathers&rsquo; interactions with their children. In addition, not all men who become married or have children experience substantial decreases in testosterone. Presently, it is not known why men vary in their hormonal responses, but it might be linked to differences in men&rsquo;s roles and experiences within the family as well as with men and women outside of their family (for example, at work). The present study was designed to revisit the same men in Cebu and to the collect the data required to clarify the behavioral effects of these hormonal changes, how they vary across men, and how they influence the well-being and development of their children. NSF funding allowed our research team to locate and re-contact 775 of these men, who were 30-32 years old when we located and interviewed them.&nbsp; Among men who were married or partnered, we interviewed and collected information on 480 of their partners or spouses, and also obtained information on 477 of the offspring born to the fathers in the study.&nbsp; Among the men, we collected 4 saliva samples, which allowed us to non-invasively measure testosterone levels.&nbsp;</p> <p>Preliminary analyses from the data generated by this study show that fathers have lower testosterone than men without children (Figure 1). This is consistent with what we observed among these men when they were younger, and suggests that these differences persist into later adulthood. We also find that men who are married or living with their partner have significantly lower testosterone than single men (Figure 2). Those men who had been married but are now separated have higher testosterone levels than either single or married men, hinting that the reduction in testosterone levels that accompanies being in a stable relationship may rebound to, or even above, the pre-relationship level after separation. Although field work for this study is complete, our analysis of the data that we generated has only just begun. While these initial analyses are preliminary, they are consistent with the predictions we made in the grant and buoy our anticipation that these new data will generate important new insights into how men&rsquo;s biology as parents and spouses relate to their behaviors within families, with implications for the well-being and development of their children and the quality of their relationships.</p> <p><strong>Broader impacts</strong></p> <p><em>Contributions to the infrastructure of science and education. </em>Over the past decade the senior scientists on this proposal have built a graduate/undergraduate training program in human biology at Northwestern University while the junior scientist on this grant is beginning to build a similar program at the University of Notre Dame.
