<AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;The ability to rationally design magnetic molecules with properties tailored for specific applications represents a key goal within the molecular magnetism community. The past few years have seen remarkable breakthroughs in this regard, aided by the study of molecules comprised of magnetic ions with strong spin-orbit anisotropy, e.g., orbitally degenerate transition metals and lanthanides. In order to develop a theoretical understanding of these highly anisotropic magnetic materials, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies performed at very high fields and frequencies are essential. Recent instrument developments at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL), spanning unprecedented field and frequency ranges, will open up the EPR technique to many more materials of current interest. The information obtained will lead to improved theoretical understanding of the important static and dynamical processes that dictate the behavior of these materials. Strong collaboration with chemists will provide a crucial feedback loop, with the potential for transformative advances in molecule-based magnetic materials. Two female graduate students will participate in the research. Interdisciplinary workshops will also be organized, providing outstanding educational opportunities for a significant number of young researchers from diverse backgrounds, and a pipeline for knowledge transfer from within the NHMFL EPR program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Fundamental studies of nano-scale molecular magnetic materials are essential for future advances in information processing technologies. The past few years have seen remarkable advances in this field, aided by investigations of molecular magnets based on heavier elements found further down the periodic table than those that have traditionally been of interest, e.g., rare-earth elements. The unusual properties of these materials that make them attractive for applications necessitate the development of new measurement techniques. This project will bring to bear on this problem the uniquely high magnetic fields available at the US National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, together with recently developed magnetic resonance methodologies, with a view to obtaining improved understanding of the physical processes that give rise to technologically useful properties. Strong collaboration between physicists and chemists will provide a crucial feedback loop, with the potential for transformative advances in molecule-based magnetic materials. Two female students will participate in the research. Interdisciplinary workshops will also be organized, providing outstanding educational opportunities for a significant number of young researchers from diverse backgrounds.</AbstractNarration>
