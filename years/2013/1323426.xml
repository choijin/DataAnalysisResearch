<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to investigate student learning of physics concepts and topics that are critical to undergraduate physics and engineering programs in thermodynamics and electronics (including electric circuits).  The populations under investigation include post-introductory students enrolled in both physics and engineering courses covering similar topics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is: (1) systematically analyzing both the content in these parallel courses and content overlap across disciplines; (2) conducting in-depth investigations of student understanding across the disciplines, both before and after relevant instruction.  The work draws extensively upon existing conceptual questions from both physics education research (PER) and engineering education research (EER) and is developing new questions informed by the project's ongoing findings; and (3) drawing upon research results to guide the modification and testing of existing instructional materials as well as the development of new materials for use across disciplines.  The aim is to compile research-based and research-validated materials well suited for cross-disciplinary use. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit : This project expands the interdisciplinary research on conceptual understanding of two topics central to engineering and physics education and for which there is a growing body of literature in PER. Furthermore, this project extends and enhances the in-depth exploration of the learning of physics concepts and ideas by students beyond the introductory level, building upon existing research bases in PER and EER and thereby enhancing the connections between the two education research fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The teaching strategies, instructional sequences, and learning tools emphasized in each discipline are in many ways discipline-specific; however, the basic content is similar. Thus, through the comparative work, the project is studying the relationship between learning outcomes and the discipline-specific nature of instruction.  The findings can be valuable for all disciplines engaged in thermodynamics and electronics education. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project is interdisciplinary and has the potential to improve the teaching and learning of both physics and engineering broadly.  The careful documentation of differences in the instructional approaches employed, and measured differences in learning outcomes, can serve as a valuable resource for instructors, textbook authors, curriculum developers, education researchers, and governing bodies in both disciplines. This work serves to cross-fertilize discipline-specific and institution-specific efforts to improve student learning and strengthen degree programs. These efforts may also contribute to the development of a more coherent educational experience for undergraduates. The modified instructional materials arising from this work do not require the wholesale adoption of entirely new curricula or pedagogies. They may be flexibly integrated into courses in both disciplines, thereby supporting incremental course transformations and minimizing the barriers to instructional improvements through the adoption of research-validated materials. Finally, this research at the interface between disciplines may also strengthen both education research communities and increase the overall impact of such research on STEM instruction.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Undergraduate programs in physics and engineering often include parallel courses that cover the same topics. Thermodynamics and electronics, for example, are topics central to programs in both disciplines.  Historically, however, research on the learning and teaching of both topics was primarily focused on individual disciplines (including the identification of specific student difficulties encountered when learning the material), and typically didn?t explore the extent to which the nature of student understanding (including the existence and/or prevalence of specific difficulties) depends upon the discipline in which the topic is taught.    This project investigated the learning and teaching of thermodynamics and electronics in both disciplines, thereby expanding the interdisciplinary research on student conceptual understanding of two topics central to both engineering education and physics education. In particular, project researchers looked at the content in parallel courses across disciplines for similarities and differences, conducted in-depth investigations of student conceptual understanding across the disciplines, and drew upon research results to guide the modification and testing of existing instructional materials and/or the development of new materials for use across disciplines. As a part of these efforts, conceptual questions (either drawn from prior research or developed expressly for this project) that were found to be productive for these cross-disciplinary investigations were compiled and curated.   In the area of thermodynamics, student conceptual understanding of the First Law of Thermodynamics, its constituent concepts, and of the interpretation of a characteristic diagram (a pressure-volume, or ?P-V?, diagram), was investigated.  Students across chemical and mechanical engineering and physics share some conceptual difficulties when they enter thermodynamics.  No specific difficulty unique to a discipline was found, but the prevalence does vary between disciplines.  However, students do not use the same concepts and tools when approaching the same problems.  Potential difficulties with mathematics or graphical interpretation may persist with mechanical engineering students.  Furthermore, findings suggest that the groups that most successfully overcame specific difficulties engaged in active-learning activities and spent more time applying the specific definitions.    In the area of electronics, cross-disciplinary investigations of student understanding were conducted on the topics of operational amplifier circuits, bipolar junction transistor circuits, diode circuits, voltage division and loading, and ac biasing networks.  The findings from these investigations were reported in two published journal articles, one submitted journal article, two peer-reviewed conference proceedings papers, and numerous invited and contributed presentations. The investigations have revealed that students in circuits/electronics courses typically encounter the same conceptual and reasoning difficulties regardless of the discipline in which the course is offered, although the exact prevalence of a given documented difficulty may vary.  Project findings also suggest that some students errors may be linked, at least in part, to difficulties in interpreting the more advanced circuit representations used in upper-division electronics courses.    As a result of the work described above, the project extended and enhanced the in-depth exploration of the learning of physics/engineering concepts and ideas by students beyond the introductory level, leveraged existing research bases in physics education research and engineering research, and helped strengthen those bases as well as connections between the two discipline-based education research fields.   Through dissemination via publications and presentations, the findings reported will contribute to efforts to improve the learning and teaching of both physics and engineering both nationally and internationally.  Indeed, detailed documentation of project work in journal articles and conference proceedings may serve as a valuable resource for instructors, textbook authors, curriculum developers, education researchers, and governing bodies in both disciplines, serving to cross-fertilize discipline-specific and institution-specific efforts to improve student learning and strengthen degree programs.  It is also anticipated that the instructional materials refined and/or developed under the project may be flexibly integrated into courses in both disciplines, thereby supporting incremental course transformations and minimizing the barriers to instructional improvements through the adoption of research-based materials.
