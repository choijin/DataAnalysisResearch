<AbstractNarration>Title: Collaborative Research: SAVI- Building a framework between the EU and the USA to harmonize data products relevant to global research infrastructures in the environmental field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is designated as a Science Across Virtual Institutes (SAVI) award and is being co-funded by NSF?s Office of International Science and Engineering. Four US environmental observatories (National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI), Advanced Modular Incoherent Scatter Radar (AMISR) and collectively EarthScope, comprising USArray and the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO), operated respectively by the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) and UNAVCO) are working together with their respective counterparts from the European Union on developing common data policies and standards relevant to global research infrastructures in the environment field.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project goals include developing new understanding through broad harmonization of data and constructing multi- discipline, synergistic data products that have wider societal importance.  In addition, these activities will help the scientific community to better develop coupled models that better capture critical feedbacks and interactions of the earth system.  These models are needed to help make these types of data more accessible to decision-makers at many levels.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Linking these existing programs provides a unique opportunity for early career researchers and students to learn in a multi-disciplinary environment and to benefit not only from the US participants but also their European counterparts.  The observatories will be developing graduate and post-graduate courses and the workshops will seek to include early career scientists and students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activities will focus on addressing societally relevant challenges. Through case studies, ways of harmonizing data will be investigated with the goal of making the data from these observatories easier to include in effective decision-making.   Disasters, carbon and water will likely be the first set of issues addressed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program is creating opportunities for enhancing the career trajectories of a new generation of researchers in Europe and the U.S. The virtual institute is providing mechanisms for exposing early-career scientists to interdisciplinary, multi-institutional activities focused on environmental data and cyberinfrastructure; arming them with new scientific tools to address challenging questions in harmonizing environmental data to help in effective decision making; and showing them how international partnerships can help to solve global problems. It is recruiting a diverse set of US and European students to create collaborative networks of environmental data and cyberinfrastructure experts across these countries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall SAVI project aimed to build a framework between the European Union and the United States to harmonize data products relevant to global research infrastructures in the environmental field. US involvement with EU partners was supported by the US SAVI Steering Committee (USSC) and mediated through an umbrella project, CoopEUS (Cooperation between the European Union and the United States), with subtasks in multiple areas of geospace science and observation. Those areas were reflected in the composition of the USSC.  The USSC and CoopEUS were very closely related, and the USSC and US CoopEUS Steering Committee names were used interchangeably. The USSC served as a coordinating body for US involvement in CoopEUS and supported four primary activities: 1) as an extension of the COOPEUS Steering Committee; 2) to coordinate with the corresponding EU Steering Committee; 3) to support US Facility involvement in CoopEUS; and 4) to coordinate US involvement in the specific CoopEUS Work Packages (WPs). The latter included relations with the EU teams charged with the responsibility for Project Management (WP1), Common Data Policies and Standards (WP7), and Common Research Infrastructure Framework (WP8) as well as WPs covering individual areas of cooperation, including Atmospheric Science, Carbon, Oceans, Solid Earth Dynamics, and Biodiversity.  The primary goals for the USSC were to develop specific strategies; identify US- and EU-based meetings, agendas, and tasks; identify US teams; coordinate the activities related to CoopEUS WP1, 7, and 8; and ensure that crosscutting activities reflected work done in the other WPs (i.e., 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6) on specific science topics (when separately funded).  This component of the project supported WP2, Atmospheric Incoherent Scatter (ISR) Radar Observations, to be implemented through cooperation between the incoherent scatter radars of the EISCAT Scientific Association in Europe, specifically the not-yet-constructed EISCAT_3D next-generation phased-array radar, and the Advanced Modular Incoherent Scatter Radar (AMISR) facilities built and operated for the NSF. The project covered only the US SAVI Steering Committee activity. Effort on the specific cooperation between AMISR and EISCAT_3D, as envisaged under the CoopEUS program, was intended to be funded from other existing resources, with the prior approval of NSF and/or by subsequent additional proposals to NSF. Changing priorities meant that such funding was never secured and, while CoopEUS goals continued to be pursued with pre-existing Facility support, the project became generally less relevant to the SAVI effort. AMISR and EISCAT were already strongly coordinated through the International Union of Radio Scientists (URSI) Incoherent Scatter Working Group (ISWG) and the MADRIGAL database.  While operated at a lower level than originally envisaged, the project continued to coordinate and encourage US involvement in CoopEUS and the corresponding SAVI activities as well as planning for future expanded collaboration should such opportunities arise after the end of the project.  AMISR and EISCAT (including EISCAT3D) collaborate efficiently through the URSI ISWG to coordinate their observing programs and share data through the MADRIGAL database. The work of SAVI and CoopEUS enhanced these collaborations. The principal outcome (CoopEUS Task 2.1) was to develop an understanding of areas where the coordination between the US NSF Upper Atmosphere Facilities and the European radars of the EISCAT Scientific Association might be further developed beyond URSI ISWG and MADRIGAL. The project promoted greater international collaboration for knowledge sharing and technology deployment to advance earth science investigations and enhance societal benefits. It was a high priority of US and European organizations to develop the necessary large-scale, world-class research infrastructures (RIs) for environmental and geophysical research, as well as the framework by which these data can be shared.  Linking observations from geophysical observatories in the U.S. and Europe and facilitating provision of that data to diverse users is a key step toward improved societal understanding of geophysical variability and change and toward increased utilization of the data for adaptation and mitigation.  Collection and dissemination of appropriate, reliable, and comprehensive geophysical data on a global scale remains crucial to successfully understanding, modeling, and eventually forecasting large- and small-scale events in geospace ranging from space weather to climate change.
