<AbstractNarration>This Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) grant provides funding for the development of a computational tool to determine optimal design parameters for the synthesis of DNA-based materials. The developed tool will determine the optimal DNA sequences and environmental assembly conditions, including solvent and temperature, to realize pre-specified design criteria for two-dimensional and three-dimensional DNA-based nanoscale structures and materials. Physics-based computational models will be used to incorporate mechanical, electrostatic, and hybridization free energies into an overall structural-thermodynamic model of the target DNA-based assembly. This model will be used together with numerical optimization and highly parallel computation to optimize the design and synthesis process. Detailed experimentation will be used to test and validate the computational tool, including two-dimensional and three-dimensional characterization of target structural properties and assembly kinetics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will lead to a broadly accessible, automated design tool for the production of custom DNA-based nanostructures and materials. Optimal sequence design and assembly conditions for target DNA-based material properties will be generated using this tool, enabling its broad use in diverse nanotechnology applications. Target properties may include complex two- and three-dimensional nanoscale structural features, mechanical response, and operating temperature and solvent conditions. Determining computationally the sequence design parameters to achieve these target properties will reduce the financial cost and time required to manufacture DNA-based materials, as well as optimize the quality and uniformity of the final product. This computational tool will also enable the simulation and design of diverse functional aspects of custom DNA-based nanomaterials using complementary computational modeling approaches.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The over-arching aim of this DMREF project was to facilitate the predictive, in silico design of structured nanoscale assemblies fabricated using DNA. DNA offers the unique ability to structure and spatially organize materials at the nanometer-scale in a highly programmable manner. Prior to this work, structured DNA assemblies were largely programmed manually using a tedious and costly trial-and-error process, without feedback from computation. As a consequence, the discovery and design of novel functional materials based on structured DNA materials was severely limited. To overcome this limitation, our team collaborated to develop the in silico computational design and simulation frameworks CanDo, DAEDALUS, TALOS, and PERDIX, which offer powerful abilities to predict in silico the 3D structure and stability of nearly any complex DNA origami object programmed in 2D or 3D. We also applied these tools to design functional DNA-based materials from the Yin lab using DNA origami to 'cast' custom metallic nanoparticles of diverse shapes and sizes with unique optical properties predicted in silico and validated experimentally. Physics-based modeling of DNA origami structure and stability by the Bathe lab further validated sequence designs programmed from the 'top-down' using DAEDALUS, PERDIX, and TALOS, with experimental synthesis and validation performed by the Yan lab. This experimentally validated suite of computational tools now offers the ability to program next-generation DNA-based materials fully in silico before resorting to costly and time-consuming experimental synthesis and validation. Because these tools are disseminated as open source software and are freely available for use online, they can impact diverse areas of nanoscale materials discovery and development both in academia and in industry. Additional specific outcomes of this project from the Yan lab address two areas of DNA self-assembly. First, various DNA tiles were created and engineered to be self-assembled into three-dimensional (3D)&nbsp;crystals&nbsp;with programmed sticky-ended cohesion. Several types of designer DNA crystals with novel space groups have been successfully constructed and their structures obtained from diffraction data match the original design. Specifically,&nbsp;the Yan lab constructed a rationally designed and self-assembled 3D DNA crystal lattice with hexagonal symmetry. The rationally designed DNA crystal provides a new avenue that could create self&#8208;assembled macromolecular 3D crystalline lattices with atomic precision. In addition, the structure contains a highly organized array of well&#8208;defined cavities that are suitable for future applications with immobilized guests.&nbsp;The newly developed DNA tiles for designer DNA crystals have enriched the toolbox of structural DNA nanotechnology as well as other potential applications. In addition, the Yan lab demonstrated a general strategy to design and construct highly knotted nucleic acid nanostructures, each weaved from a single-stranded DNA or RNA chain by hierarchical folding in a prescribed order. Sets of DNA and RNA knots of two- or three-dimensional shapes have been designed and constructed (ranging from 1800 to 7500 nucleotides), and they exhibit an unprecedented amount of complicated topological features, with high crossing numbers (from 9 up to 67). The self-assembly was optimized with hierarchical folding, which significantly increased the yield. This work establishes a fundamental and general platform for constructing nucleic acids nanostructures with complex molecular topologies. Additional outcomes from the Yin lab advanced our understanding of how DNA can be self-assembled. In creating novel DNA structures that vary in scale, sequence, and organization, they demonstrated new, viable thermodynamic pathways to construction and generated empirical data for modeling. In the 'DNA Brick' approach, four short DNA binding domains are arranged so that the bricks can interlock. Early protocols organized hundreds of distinct bricks into well-formed structures, but attempts to create larger structures had limited success. They showed that DNA bricks with longer domains self-assemble 0.1 to 1-gigadalton, three-dimensional nanostructures from tens of thousands of unique components, including a 0.5-gigadalton cuboid containing about 30,000 unique bricks. They also applied the brick methodology as repeating DNA components to create large, spatially unconfined 'crystal' structures, and demonstrated crystals of micrometer lateral dimensions and precisely controlled depths of up to 80 nm. To investigate the possibility of applying nano-scale DNA structures to shape other components, the Yin group computationally designed DNA strands to self-assemble into stiff 'nano-molds' with prescribed, three-dimensional cavities predicted using CanDo.

Finally, they altered the popular 'DNA Origami' methodology to generate structures from single strands of RNA or DNA, giving rise to the possibility of more stable constructs or even biological generation of complex shapes. Products of these systems have been used in turn to generate new DNA origami structures.
