<AbstractNarration>This action funds Katherine A. Mazzio of the University of Washington to conduct a research project in the Math and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at Victoria University of Wellington in Wellington, New Zealand.  The project title is "Exciton Dissociation in Hybrid Materials for Solar Energy Conversion." The host scientist is Justin Hodgkiss.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the most promising renewable resources lies in photovoltaics for electricity generation. For many applications, however, the product output of photovoltaics has been limited by materials scarcity and competition with the microelectronics industry, as well as by a limited ability to control the structure-property relationships of the materials used in photovoltaic devices. Using a recently developed method for the in-situ functionalization of semiconducting nanocrystals with pi-conjugated molecules during growth, the performance of hybrid photovoltaic devices is expected to be significantly enhanced, while allowing them to be solution processed. This project examines the charge transfer dynamics in these new hybrid materials. Specifically, it will investigate how varying the concentration of polythiophene ligands affects both the loading on cadmium selenide quantum dots and the resulting charge transfer rates for use in hybrid photovoltaic devices. This information will result in a better understanding of the charge transfer processes in hybrid materials, while aiding in future design aspects of optoelectronic materials, which will in turn benefit society by resulting in improved materials for photovoltaic devices towards zero-emission electricity generation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the proposed research will result in the Fellow obtaining a fundamental understanding of the electron transport phenomena inside the active layer of these next-generation solar cells. The Fellow will couple this experimental data with computer modeling of the charge transport processes in order to act as a predictive tool for the rational design of future light-harvesting systems. The results of this project will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at international conferences, in addition to informal presentations regarding the EAPSI program and the results obtained over the course of this program within the University of Washington.</AbstractNarration>
