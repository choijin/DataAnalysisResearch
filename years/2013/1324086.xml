<AbstractNarration>According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 11.6 million people were admitted to jail from 2011-2012;&lt;br/&gt;yet, there has been relatively little research examining the impact of short-term incarceration on offender&lt;br/&gt;adjustment. Two opposing theories have typically been provided to explain how inmates adapt to the&lt;br/&gt;incarceration environment. The importation model suggests that inmates bring a host of pre-incarceration&lt;br/&gt;experiences and characteristics with them into the incarceration environment that account for how&lt;br/&gt;inmates adapt and behave. Conversely, the deprivation model posits the oppressive incarceration&lt;br/&gt;environment is responsible for inmate adaptation. Research has found support for both models. &lt;br/&gt;However, these theories have not been tested longitudinally in jail. This project will test these theories&lt;br/&gt;throughout a stay in jail and into the community to update and expand these models. The study will test&lt;br/&gt;the overarching hypothesis that traumatic experiences with violence encountered before, during, and after&lt;br/&gt;jail are related to increased mental health difficulties and recidivism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Two hundred male and female inmates will be recruited to participate in the present study. Subjects will&lt;br/&gt;complete surveys approximately once a month for four months, starting from the initial point of&lt;br/&gt;incarceration and ending a month after release from jail. The subjects will self-report psychosocial&lt;br/&gt;problems including symptoms of anxiety, post-traumatic stress, depression, antisocial behavior,&lt;br/&gt;aggression, and substance use. Recidivism data will also be collected for released subjects. The&lt;br/&gt;researchers will use self-report data on violence exposure prior, during, and after incarceration, to explain&lt;br/&gt;the development of psychopathology and predict mental/behavioral outcomes, as well as identify risk&lt;br/&gt;factors for recidivism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current study is the first longitudinal examination to assess developmental changes in mental and&lt;br/&gt;behavioral health throughout jail and in the community. This project will identify risk and protective&lt;br/&gt;factors that can be used to create interventions and programs, reducing the risk of recidivism. By learning&lt;br/&gt;more about the context in which offenders must adapt, researchers can provide informed&lt;br/&gt;recommendations to policy makers and increase safety in communities and jails.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Recent research suggests that incarceration yields persisting psychological damage because of experiences with violence in jail or prison (Boxer, Middlemass, &amp; Delorenzo, 2009). It is well known that violence exposure is associated with a host of negative outcomes. Community violence exposure increases aggression, depression, anxiety, antisocial behavior, and post-traumatic stress (PTS; see Buka, Stichick, Birdthistle, &amp; Earls, 2001). However, there has been little research that examines the impact of violence exposure in jail on mental and behavioral health outcomes. The few studies examining this issue have not followed inmates over time; therefore, little is known about the development of these disorders and what may cause them. This project is the first longitudinal study examining developmental changes in mental and behavioral health throughout a stay in jail and into the community. The study also explores experiences with violence before, during, and after jail as the underlying causal factors in these changes. Lastly, we investigate how these factors impact whether offenders recidivate three months after release from jail.</p> <p>Four hundred male and female inmates participated in a 16-week study. Participants were surveyed three times during the course of their jail stay and once after release. Surveys were administered at four separate times: Wave 1) Within the first three months of admission to jail; Wave 2) Five weeks after Wave 1; Wave 3) Six weeks after Wave 2; Wave 4) Approximately one month post-release. Participants self-reported psychosocial problems including symptoms of anxiety, post-traumatic stress, depression, aggression, and substance use. They also reported on traumatic and violent experiences prior, during, and after incarceration. We obtained recidivism data for all released subjects.</p> <p>The results suggest participants&rsquo; mental and behavioral health symptoms generally remained constant during incarceration or decreased. Despite declining symptoms of mental health during incarceration, participants with pre-incarceration trauma showed initial increased psychosocial symptoms, and slower declines of these symptoms. Additionally, community violence exposure showed a similar relationship; however, pre-incarceration trauma and community violence exposure were not related to recidivism. Once incarcerated, being housed in solitary confinement and exposed to jail violence resulted in greater psychosocial problems and slower reductions in psychosocial symptoms over time.
