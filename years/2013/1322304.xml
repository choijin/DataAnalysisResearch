<AbstractNarration>This project is a four-phase examination of the micro-processes of collaborative creation of documents to identify what processes and tool features make the products of collaboration good and to determine what new tool features might contribute to more successful collaborations. The study includes an exploratory phase analyzing and visualizing trace of activity around the collaborative creation of existing documents, a systematic study of teams of students using distributed word processing tools to create text documents, an experimental study contrasting the use of synchronous and asynchronous systems and an extension of the study to non-textual documents, all with the goal of determining which features of collaboration processes (e.g., the distribution of roles or the handoff pattern among collaborators) correlate with quality of the resulting documents (e.g., lack inconsistencies, unnecessary repetition or conflicting sections). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study is important because distributed work has become ubiquitous in industry as well as in the sciences but current theories of collaborative work were generated when technology-supported distributed work was less common and before the development of widely-adopted collaboration tools. This study will grow these theories to include the collaboration patterns when people use new tools and cope with the challenges of being distant.  Findings will be disseminated in academic publications, in classes that help people learn to collaborate and through contacts with industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We explored how people are writing collaboratively now that they have tools like Google Docs, where they can write both in hand-off style and now simultaneously.  We developed two tools that allow you to see who wrote what in the document, and when they wrote it, both available in the Chrome Web Store as AuthorViz and DocuViz respectively.  The first simply colors each word in a document to represent which author wrote it, shown here in Figure 1, and the second shows how the document grew and changed over time, shown here in Figure 2.  We used the second tool and some other indicators to reveal the various styles of collaborative writing people used, and then found which aspects of their work were associated with high quality.  It turns out that high quality documents were produced by teams that participated more equally, and high quality documents more often had an apparent leader in the group. These results were replicated in a second study.     In addition, now that it is possible to write simultaneously, we gathered stories of how people used this capability to their advantage.  One set of stories revealed that the whole nature of meetings can change now that we can get work done in the meeting rather than just talking about it.  For example, software documentation, something programmers dislike writing, can be efficiently and effectively written by having a technical writer lead a group session in which the key programmers simultaneously just dump into the document what they know about the program?s structure and algorithms.  The technical writer then cleans up the document, checking with the programmers on the accuracy of their edits.  In other meetings, people can share the responsibility of taking notes, with people taking over the note-taking for each other when one speaks.  In another setting, a student and his advisor can both work on, say, a presentation, with the student "seeing" what the advisor is doing and imitating the apparent best practice.  Instead of the advisor explicitly instructing the student in writing, they can merely show what the kind of writing is and have the student follow along presumably doing the same kind of thing.
