<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to investigate stochastic optimization models and methodologies that will assist in managing and adapting water resources and infrastructures in an effort to ensure a sustainable future. The project will focus on two problems. The first is a large-scale multi-period water allocation problem under uncertainty (Lower Colorado River Basin) and the second is a regional-scale water reuse infrastructure design and operation problem. The proposed research will address these water resources management problems in a comprehensive manner by: (1) formulating mathematical optimization models under known and ambiguous uncertainties; (2) investigating decomposition-based solution methods that exploit the special structures of these models; and (3) advancing theory and methodology to evaluate the resulting solutions and other multi-period adaptation and mitigation policies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have a significant impact on the well-being of the 25-30 million people who reside in the southwestern United States. The models and methods developed can be applied wherever water is scarce. The project also addresses two of the grand challenges identified by the National Academy of Engineering: to help restore and improve urban infrastructure and to provide access to clean water. While the project focuses on water resources management, if successful, it will result in modeling, algorithmic and computational advances in stochastic optimization.  These advances may help solve other important optimization problems.  The curricular materials and tutorials developed will serve to educate the next generation of engineers on the methods and real-world applications of stochastic optimization. The project will also promote and increase the visibility of women students through a "Women in Industrial and Systems Engineering Research (WISER)" program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award investigated optimization-under-uncertainty models and methods to manage and adapt water resources and infrastructures for a sustainable future.  Water and the movement of water are essential for life and central to a civilized world. However, there are numerous and complex uncertainties involved in managing water resources like changes in population, future water-use trends, climate variability, and how these uncertainties affect water demands and water supplies.  Furthermore, many water resources problems are complicated because (i) their uncertainties cannot be modeled with traditional probability distributions (e.g., long-term climate variability), they involve (ii) risk aversion and (iii) robust decision-making.  In contrast, traditional models typically assume a known probability distribution, are risk-neutral, and focus on average behavior.  To address these limitations, this project investigated new optimization models under uncertainty, devised efficient solution algorithms to solve these models and to evaluate the resulting policies, and applied them to water allocation and water infrastructure design problems.      A class of problems studied by the project explicitly considers the ambiguity in the probabilities of future outcomes (by considering all possible probability distributions that are sufficiently close to a nominal distribution) and provides risk-averse, robust solutions.  Several properties of these models were uncovered and efficient decomposition algorithms that enable the solution of large-scale problems were devised.  For many problems under uncertainty and risk, not all future scenarios are important to decision making.  The project defined and identified which scenarios make a difference in the optimal value, referred to as effective scenarios.  When allocating Colorado River water to various users, higher-demand scenarios were found to be effective even when the water supplies were high. This shows the importance of managing water demands more effectively in arid and semi-arid regions. Furthermore, the project improved existing methods to assess the quality of a given solution/policy for systems under uncertainty by reducing the bias and variability in these estimators.      The models and methods developed in the project have been applied to allocate Colorado River water to various users in Tucson, AZ, to design water and wastewater infrastructures with a focus on reusing water as much as possible, and to manage reservoirs. The models and methods can be applied wherever water supplies are limited and variable. Therefore, the project addressed issues that affect the well-being of more than 30 million people who reside in arid and semi-arid regions in the United States.  Even though the project focused on water resources management, the modeling, algorithmic, and computational advances made have the potential to help solve other important decision-making problems under complex, ambiguous uncertainties like energy and financial planning.     The project partially supported four Ph.D. students for their doctoral research. In addition, the results of this research were used to generate new course materials at both graduate and undergraduate levels.  The project research topic (water resources management) and its societal impact were used to introduce Industrial and Systems Engineering and Operations Research to female and other underrepresented students in engineering.  The project also supported other activities like mentoring female students.  The results were widely disseminated through publications and presentations at prominent national and international conferences including tutorials.
