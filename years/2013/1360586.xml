<AbstractNarration>This project will support six semiannual AGNES weekend workshops in Algebraic Geometry, the first of which is to be held at Stony Brook University, April 25 - 27, 2014. Algebraic geometry is a dynamic subject with vital connections to physics, applied mathematics, and fields such as number theory, differential geometry and representation theory. The Northeastern United States are a particular nexus, with a density of researchers and an output rivaling any region in the world. AGNES weekend workshops bring together a spectrum of algebraic geometers from the region and beyond, as well as representatives from allied fields invigorating algebraic geometry. There is diversity both in speakers and participants, from senior experts to burgeoning young researchers. There is a special emphasis on students: AGNES hosts "students-only" introductory pre-talks, as well as professional development sessions. Through lectures, panels, problem sessions, poster sessions, and informal discussion periods, AGNES informs the community of developments, AGNES fosters new research collaborations, and AGNES trains junior algebraic geometers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometers study the geometry of shapes defined by the polynomial equations of Algebra. In fact, the geometric shapes occurring in nature -- in science, in engineering, etc. -- are frequently "algebraic", explaining the vital importance of algebraic geometry in physics and applied mathematics. This grant promotes research, dissemination and training in algebraic geometry through a series of conferences held throughout the Northeastern United States. There is an emphasis on supporting graduate students, highlighting the broad array of work in the area and its many connections to allied areas, and fostering communication in our broad research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AGNES website is available at http://www.agneshome.org/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The AGNES workshops ("Algebraic Geometry Northeastern Series") bring together algebraic geometers, other mathematicians, and even some non-mathematicians (such as physicists) for a series of lectures on cutting-edge results in mathematics.  There are also "pre-lectures" aimed at training younger mathematicians.  Finally, there are professional development events for discussing important aspects of the profession beyond math research.  The workshops are well-attended, not only by mathematicians from the Notheastern United States (where the workshops are held), but mathematicians from all over the United States, and even some international mathematicians.  The Spring 2014 workshop at Stony Brook University was a large meeting, with 164 registered participants.  The lectures were recorded and are freely available from the AGNES webpage.  The webpage also contains the slides prepared by authors.  In this way, the workshop reaches an even larger group of mathematicians.  The eight research lectures of the weekend event included a lecture by James McKernan, a winner of the prestigious Cole Prize in mathematics.  There were four pre-lectures for younger mathematicians.  There was a professional development event led by a leading mathematician and Steele Prize winner, Robert Lazarsfeld, on incorporating undergraduate students into mathematics research.   There were many informal discussions during the breaks between lectures.    The anonymous feedback from participants was very positive.  Participants discussed the value of the activities to their own research programs, the willingness of expert speakers to discuss the speculative and informal aspects of their research,  and the interactive nature of the professional development event.  Participants commented on the continuing value of a regular series of events like AGNES for keeping abreast of research developments, and meeting colleagues face-to-face to share ideas and solve problems.
