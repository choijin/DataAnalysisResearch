<AbstractNarration>The Earth's magnetic field is now known to be the result of fluid motion within the Earth's molten iron outer core.  This "dynamo" process remains one of the least understood phenomena in the Earth sciences, however, due to the lack of direct observations.  Computer simulations have proven to be valuable tools for advancing our understanding of dynamos.  Nevertheless, it is not currently possible to capture all the temporal and spatial scales of dynamical relevance in the Earth's core given modern-day technological constraints. The PIs are overcoming these limitations by developing the first multi-scale mathematical model of the geodynamo. In this respect, the proposed work can be viewed as a new computational and modeling framework that will allow for the highest resolution simulations of the Earth's core to date.  Additionally, these methods will be broadly applicable to a range of other scientific problems ranging from molecular physics to cellular dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Three-dimensional numerical simulations have vastly improved our understanding of convection driven dynamos, yet computational constraints currently limit them to physical parameters that are distant from those that characterize the Earth's liquid outer core.  This fact highlights a serious gap in our understanding of the geodynamo, and severely limits our ability to relate directly geomagnetic field observations and the output of numerical dynamo models.  The proposed work will, for the first time, employ the methodology of multiple scale asymptotics to planetary dynamo systems for purpose of developing a model that is capable of reaching parameter values and physical properties of Earth's core.  In this way, the asymptotic regime of the proposed model will provide a more complete understanding of geomagnetic field observations.  Findings of the research will be directly applicable to other rapidly rotating, turbulent fluid systems on and within stars, extrasolar planets, and the other planets within the Solar System.  Moreover, the mathematical methods employed for development of the reduced equations are broadly applicable to a range of other scientific problems ranging from molecular physics to cellular dynamics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This proposal effort has focused on the development of a new generation of models that can more accurately capture the physical processes at work within the Earth's liquid iron outer core, and therefore be utilized to understand the changing geomagnetic field that is generated by the so-called dynamo process. Modeling this system remains a challenging task despite the increased efficiency of modern supercomputing systems.

These models simulate physics that has not previously been accessible for study. Ongoing and future simulations of this model will help us to better understand the physics of the geodynamo and other planetary and stellar dynamos.  The work carried out under this proposal provided the main research topic of Co-PI Calkins during his time as a postdoctoral researcher. Over the course of this proposal effort Dr. Calkins developed expertise in high-perfomance computing, asymptotic model development strategies and the theory of electrically conducting fluids that continue to form the basis of his research, now as a tenure-track faculty member at the University of Colorado.  This research also provided valuable training in asymptotic model development, numerical methods, and computer code development for postdoctoral researcher Dr. Philippe Marti. Dr. Marti's code now forms the basis of simulation work that is currently being carried out by the University of Colorado research group.  Using the code of Dr. Marti to perform simulations of the new models is the primary thesis topic of University of Colorado graduate student Meredith Plumley. Ms. Plumley is currently preparing a publication that details the first simulations of the new models.  In addition, this proposal effort allowed for two undergraduate students from the University of Colorado (Derek Driggs and Louie Long) to gain research experience in dynamo modeling, scientific computing and the development of scientific publications.  This effort produced numerous publication in top-tier journals detailing the fidelity in utilizing muliscale asymptotic approaches coupled with numerical simuations to probe the extreme regimes of the turbulent geodynamo.
