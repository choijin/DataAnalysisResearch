<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemistry Major Research Instrumentation Program, Professor Jeffrey Werner from SUNY Cortland and colleagues Christa Chatfield, Terrence Fitzgerald, Patricia Conklin and Francis Rossi will acquire a linear ion trap mass spectrometer with integrated liquid chromatography separation (LC/MS). The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) use of proteomics time series analysis to optimize open microbial communities in a bioreactor producing extended carbon chain commodity chemicals; (b) identification of larval trail pheromones that could be exploited to reduce insect-related crop damage; (c) elucidation of the physiological mechanisms of environmental biofilm formation involving Legionella pneumophila; and (d) determination of the role of VTC3 in the regulation of ascorbic acid in plants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mass Spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species embedded in complex matrices. In a typical experiment, the components flow into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized into the parent ion and its fragment ions and their masses are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows detection and determination of the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. An instrument with tandem capability provides additional structural identification power through further fragmentation of ions produced in the spectrometer. As a primarily undergraduate institution, SUNY Cortland's faculty embraces undergraduate research experiences as one of the most important outcomes of their research activities. The proposed instrument will directly impact the research experiences of at least 28 students within the three-year project period, and many more in years to come. The added synergistic benefit of enhanced capabilities on campus will also increase competitiveness for external funding, further facilitating and enhancing undergraduate research experiences. Undergraduate researchers will travel to high-needs school districts to share their experiences with high school students. Their authentic narratives of scientific inquiry will inspire future scientists as to the leading-edge research one can do as a college student. Ultimately, the goal of these high school connections is to enhance the diversity of students entering science and technology fields.</AbstractNarration>
