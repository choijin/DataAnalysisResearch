<AbstractNarration>The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) program award is to create an innovative 3D workspace visualization method, which will enable automated construction equipment to safely and efficiently handle construction materials for robotic field erection and connection. Robotic construction material handling requires both rapid visualization of the workspace and highly accurate position data for safe and secure physical contact between a target object and a robot. These are difficult to achieve with current sensor technologies. To meet this challenge, a target-focused range data collection and modeling method will be researched through a hybrid approach that integrates a light-weight 3D laser scanner with secondary and tertiary sensory devices such as a laser rangefinder and an infrared camera. A hybrid system mountable on a robot or piece of equipment will significantly reduce data collection time while enhancing data accuracy. Automatic target detection and model-based fitting and matching algorithms will be developed for various shapes of construction material components. The hybrid approach will be tested using real-world robotic test beds, including a multi-joint arm robot at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and a bolting robot and a robot crane located within Korea University's automated building construction system. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will enhance the development of more intelligent and automated construction job sites and manufacturing processes by providing a fully sensed, monitored environment for materials, equipment, and operators. This research will also positively impact the environment by reducing the enormous amount of construction waste, which will greatly benefit the construction industry and society in general. Finally, this project has strong educational plans that will nurture tomorrow's leaders in engineering and science, promote lifelong learning for industrial practitioners, and broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research.</AbstractNarration>

For this reason, there is a recent trend toward greater automation of construction equipment, such as dozers, graders, cranes, and excavators, equipped with various position sensors to improve safety, productivity, and reliability. 3D spatial modeling can help to optimize automated equipment control, significantly improve safety, and enhance a remote operator?s spatial perception of the workspace.  Yet, the rapid processing of tens of thousands of range data in real-time, which is a crucial component of the spatial modeling process, is still an unsolved problem requiring further investigation. Unstructured work areas like construction sites are difficult to visualize graphically because they contain highly unpredictable activities and change rapidly.  To address these challenges, this project aimed to provide the construction industry with a highly automated and seamlessly integrated intelligent and safe construction job site using cutting-edge 3D spatial perception and robotics technologies. The following is a brief description of the main outcomes of the project, along with a summary of their intellectual merit and broader impacts.  Intellectual merit  1)      A model-based automatic dynamic object recognition and registration algorithm, Projection-Recognition-Projection (PRP): The PRP algorithm was developed to help heavy equipment operators rapidly perceive the 3D working environment of construction sites.  The PRP method rapidly extracts a target object?s point cloud data from the background point cloud scene by significantly reducing scan data size and modeling time.  The target object?s point cloud is then processed to rapidly recognize and register a 3D target model from a model database to the corresponding point clouds.  2)      A non&shy;model based automatic dynamic object recognition and surface modeling algorithm:  This algorithm has the similar process with PRP but does not require a 3D model library.  The target?s point cloud data are rapidly converted into a 3D surface model using the concave hull surface modeling algorithm after a process of data filtering to increase the model accuracy and data processing speed.  3)      Ground Robot for Mapping Infrastructure (GRoMI)- Hybrid LiDAR system and a mobile robot:  GRoMI is a hybrid laser system mounted all-wheel drive mobile robot. It is designed to improve mobility and autonomy of data collection and processing at construction sites.  4)      Principal Axes Descriptor (PAD) for automated object recognition and classification from point clouds: PAD is a geometric descriptor consisting of dimensional variation, occupancy distribution, shape profile, and plane counting features and it encodes 3D characteristics of each object category. Using the derived features, machine learning methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine were employed to determine class membership among construction object categories such as heavy equipment and structural components.  The developed method can be extended to support automated information extraction and analytics for many other applications, such as workspace modeling, asset and inventory management, job site safety, defect detection, and progress management.  5)      A target-less automatic registration algorithm using RGB features and surface segmentations: This method allows a small overlapping area between consecutive laser scans and a small number of scans to reconstruct large sites, thus reducing time and cost for data collection and processing.    Broader Impacts    This project fosters a breakthrough innovation in automated and robotic construction site operations which would greatly benefit the future U.S. construction industry and society in general.  1)      Advancing discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and mentoring: The project has generated the knowledge that fills in the blanks in current construction technologies in the area of rapid workspace modeling for automated construction operations. The obtained knowledge and curricular activities in state&shy;of&shy;the-art sensing and robotics technologies were integrated into engineering education.  2)       Broadening participation of underrepresented group: Several activities were conducted to expose and engage underrepresented science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) groups that include both colored women and minority K&shy;12 students and college students. Day workshops for domestic and international student groups were held, including laser scan theory lectures, sensing and robotic technology demonstrations, question and answer sessions, and hands-on learning.  3)       Broad dissemination to enhance scientific and technological understanding: The knowledge obtained from the research has been exposed to a broad class of infrastructure construction and other fields including software companies, design and construction companies. Also, the research team was able to interact with many global engineers and scientists in other fields such as aerospace engineering, computer science, mechanical engineering, electronic and computer engineering, and psychology.  4)       Impact on society beyond science and technology: The resulted real-time workspace modeling methods for construction equipment and robotic operations are likely to enhance productivity by shortening construction time and improving jobsite operation safety, thus benefiting the economy and society.
