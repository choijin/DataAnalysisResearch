<AbstractNarration>This is a proposal to understand the excitation of fast magnetosonic waves and their interaction with relativistic electrons in the radiation belts. Fast magnetosonic waves have long been observed near the equator in the magnetosphere. They are thought to be generated by energetic (10s of keV) protons with a ring distribution.  Recent studies indicate that these waves are ion Bernstein waves whose properties change to magnetosonic like but this is not understood. The fast magnetosonic waves are thought to contribute to pitch angle scattering and acceleration of relativistic electrons through Landau resonance, bounce resonance and transit time scattering. The relative importance of these mechanisms is not known.  This research will use satellite data analysis, linear kinetic dispersion theory, kinetic plasma simulations and test particle computations to investigate the excitation of these waves and their interaction with the relativistic electrons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI is a young assistant professor and the work will support a graduate student.</AbstractNarration>
