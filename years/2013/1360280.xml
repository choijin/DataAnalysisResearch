Confounding issues such as urban sprawl and agricultural intensification make it difficult to determine the singular effects of climate change on water quality, ecosystem function and on the costs to achieve water quality goals. In view of the challenges facing the Chesapeake Bay (urban growth, agricultural intensification, climate change) an integrated multi-disciplinary approach is critical to provide policy makers with robust and reliable information. The approach that the research team will use is to integrate key climate, hydrologic, estuarine, and economic drivers at multiple scales which will provide water management options for the Chesapeake Bay system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One way to assess the impacts of climate change in the face of these other stressors is to develop coupled models that incorporate the pertinent controls on the water system. The overarching goal of this project is to develop a quantifiable, predictive framework that couples biogeochemical and hydrologic drivers of terrestrial nutrient export with climate change to evaluate the effects of ecosystem management on estuarine function and costs of water quality protection. To achieve this goal, the project proposes to work broadly across common regional Chesapeake Bay watershed physiographic gradients and dominant land uses (e.g., agriculture, forest and urban) using a multi-scale model evaluation of the impact of climate change and climate variability on the hydrologic, biogeochemical, and economic drivers of water quality degradation in the Chesapeake Bay estuary. Climate data will be down scaled from global and regional climate models and applied to watershed models to predict hydrologic activity and nutrient production across five test-bed watersheds where significant investments in land management (e.g., Best Management Practices) have been made. Test-bed model results will be used to populate an economic model to quantify the optimum tradeoff between water quality improvements and their associated costs. The watershed models will then be upscaled to predict hydrologic and nutrient delivery to an estuarine model to determine estuary impacts.</AbstractNarration>

The following goals  allowed us to develop this framework based on our best current knowledge, explore the impact of CC and extreme weather events on nutrient and sediment export, and develop new modeling paradigms to improve water quality models used for management decisions.   Bracket the mid-century changes inclimate for the CB with downscaled high-resolution regional climate models.  Evaluate likely changes in landscape patterns and magnitudes of N and P cycling and erosion using downscaled climate model outputs coupled to multi-scale landscape models. Investigate how CC and alternative nutrient management strategies affect water quality in the CB.  Assess tradeoffs between costs of Best Management Practices (BMPs) and landscape management intended to control nitrogen (N) loadings and variability of N loadings under alternative CC scenarios.    Our results show that climate change will indeed impact water quality in the CB region, both inland freshwater sources and the estuary. Several relevant findings include: 1) climate change will result in increased nutrient cycling, particularly for nitrogen, which may force producers to apply more fertilizers, increasing nutrient loss; 2) Climate change will alter in agricultural management such as earlier spring tillage and altered nutrient application; 3) Agricultural conservation practices can mitigate the impact of climate change on water quality, 4) Targeting management practices on critical source areas results in nearly the same water quality protection as widespread targeting.  Climate change also results in greater intensity storms, which increases sediment transport and phosphorus losses in the CB region, but there are also longer periods of low flows, which can degrade in-stream habitat.    Climate change is likely to increase costs of meeting water quality goals for both agricultural and urban watersheds. Major reasons for higher costs in agriculture are higher predicted nitrogen loadings from crops resulting in higher loading reductions that need to be achieved to meet water quality goals. Costs in urban watersheds are likely to increase due to higher costs of controlling phosphorus and suspended sediment loadings under climate change due to increased runoff volumes.
