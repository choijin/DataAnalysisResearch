<AbstractNarration>The TECHFIT proejct fosters middle school student enthusiasm for STEM disciplines. This is accomplished by equipping teachers with skills and tools to engage their students and show them how engineering technology knowledge can help them become innovators of interesting, fun, and valuable products. TECHFIT recruits teams of 2-5 science, technology, math, and physical education teachers from partner schools to complete a 6-day, professional development summer workshop. The workshop provides teachers with the information, instruction, lessons, and practice required to deliver a ten-week afterschool program for 6th to 8th grade students in which they design and build exergames.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Programs are needed to make study in STEM areas more appealing to America's youth. TECHFIT addresses this need by equipping middle school teachers with the skills and tools to educate students and spark their students' interest in STEM by showing how these skills contribute to the creation of interesting and functional technology-based fitness games. The TECHFIT program is designed to enrich the knowledge base of young students by stimulating their interest in STEM subjects through an after school program run by TECHFIT-trained teachers. By partnering with schools that have large underrepresented, underserved populations, TECHFIT can reach the populations in greater need of programs to interest students in STEM. By giving students an important, appealing reason to pursue these often neglected STEM subjects, students who may not have considered STEM careers will begin to take these subjects more seriously and will be more likely to study STEM in college, thus addressing society's future workforce needs.</AbstractNarration>

TECHFIT participants learn firsthand that programming, technology and engineering are within their grasp, and they can apply those skills to solving big problems.</span></p> <p><span>From summer 2014 to spring 2018, TECHFIT offered eight sets of intensive, 6-day, hands-on, professional development (PD) programs to teams of middle school teachers from several states. Each teacher team was provided with a technology toolkit valued at $3000-$4700 that were made possible through generous donations from Phoenix Contact, Balluff, Automation Direct, Microsoft, and Tupelo. The summer PD taught them how to identify and use all of the technology in the toolkit. Additionally, teachers learned programming in Scratch to create animations to visually describe their exergame inventions. They also learned flowchart programming to create software to run their exergames. They also learned how to wire electronic components to the Nanoline controller provided in the toolkit, so that when their downloaded their flowchart program to the controller, the physical system would operate as their exergame was designed. Short and long fitness activities called brain blasts were taught to both increase their retention of the considerable content taught over the first three days and to provide a repertoire of movement activities as inspiration for their exergame innovations. By the fifth day of the PD, each teacher team presented their exergames to demonstrate understanding of concepts taught. On the last day, they adapted the provided curriculum to their unique school circumstances, so they would be ready to implement TECHFIT when school began in the fall.</span></p> <p><span>Using the hands-on experiences they gained during the summer PDs and the provided 250+ page TECHFIT workbook that included a standards-based curriculum, the teachers then taught their students during the fall the same things they learned with the goal of having them innovate their own exergames. In December, each school had the opportunity to be considered for the TECHFIT showcase where each participating student team shared their TECHFIT educational experience, presented their Scratch animation, and demonstrated their physical exergame. An independent panel of judges evaluated each team&rsquo;s presentation against a published rubric to determine the showcase winner. </span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;">Since 2014, TECHFIT has reached over 115 teachers and over 1500 middle school students in over 40 schools in several states: Indiana, South Carolina, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Tennessee, Virginia, and Washington. Over 91% of the students who responded to our surveys said that the TECHFIT experience increased their interest in STEM careers. 95% of the students thought TECHFIT was fun and interesting. 95% of the students said they would recommend TECHFIT to their friends. Unsolicited teacher feedback and research results confirm that the TECHFIT program is motivating students to pursue STEM and computing careers.</span></p> <p><span style="font-family: Calibri;
