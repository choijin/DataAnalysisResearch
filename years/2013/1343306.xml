<AbstractNarration>This research effort focuses on the impact that 4G/LTE wireless devices (e.g. cell towers and smart phones) may have on radar altimeters operating in the 4200-4400 MHz spectral band.  Based on the identification of this band by the government as a potential candidate for commercial cellular use, the spectral characteristics and potential impact to the operation of these airplane landing radars has become extremely important to a broad audience.  The recent crash of the Asiana Airlines flight has added to the focus on the operation of these radars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To obtain this understanding, a significant spectrum measurement campaign will be undertaken focused on appropriate radar altimeter systems and on 4G/LTE systems.  The measurements will quantify the effects of 4G/LTE on radar altimeter performance using actual and/or simulated equipment. These measurement results will provide a basis for performing the detailed analysis work required to gauge the level of impact that would be expected under a variety of conditions.  This information will need to be quickly and effectively disseminated to others in the wireless research community and importantly to various decision-makers in the telecommunications policy realm.</AbstractNarration>
