<AbstractNarration>This project concentrates on (i) developing limit theory for a class of long range dependent spaÂ­tial processes under various spatial sampling designs, including the case of irreguraly spaced data-sites, which is encountered frequently in spatial applications; (ii) developing new resampling methodology for spatial data under both short-and long-range dependence that are immune to the e.ects of the curse of dimensionality, (iii) developing Edgeworth expansion theory for spatial data for both regularly and irregularly spaced cases, and (iv) investigating higher order properties of resampling methods for spatial data and study their higher order properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project aims to make important theoretical and methodological contributions to several critical areas of spatial statistics that have a wide of potential applications but the state of the current literature on these areas is very sparse. In addition to advancing the state of statistical methodology for spatially referenced data, the proposed research would also bene.t many other areas of sciences, such as Astronomy, Hydrology, Geology, Economics, Atmospheric Sciences, etc. where spatial data exhibiting di.erent forms of dependence are known to occur naturally, and model-free statistical methods such as those proposed in the project play an important role in their analysis. Further, the project would lead to the development of human resources through advising of Ph.D. students and mentoring of junior researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on developing resampling methodology and investigating their statistical properties for  time series and spatial data, and it provided crucial training to  several  graduate students  and a post-doctoral  fellow  on research skills related to the project. In the course of the project, several new nonparametric methods have been developed which provide improved tools for statistical analysis and inference on complex data structures, namely spatial and temporally correlated data. A key results obtained as a part of the project is  a nonstandard probabilistic limit theorem  for  highly correlated spatial processes that will form the theoretical basis for statistical analysis of data sets exhibiting such strong dependence. This result has a novel aspect in that the limit distribution of the sum  not only depends on the dependence structure of the underlying spatial process but it also depends on the geometry of the sampling region. Other important results include the development of a nonparametric likelihood based methodology for irregularly spaced spatial data, development of resampling based methdoology for predicting nonGaussian spatial and temporal processes,   theoretical comparisons of competing inference methods and establishing the optimality of a nonparametric plug-in rule proposed by the PI under a previous NSF grant, among others.     The findings from the project has been presented in national and international conferences, and published in leading scientific journals.         On broader societal impacts, the findings of the project will indirectly benefit the society through the tools it provides in applied sciences. Specifically,  statistical methodology and probabilistc results obtained here is expected to make a difference in statistical analysis of spatial and temporal data with complex dependence structures that routinely appear in Atmospheric Sciences, Economics and Finance, Agricultural Field trials, among others.
