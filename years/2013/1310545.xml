<AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;This award explores the dynamics of nanomaterials, employing atomic-scale spatial resolution, femtosecond temporal resolution techniques to explore the mechanisms underlying how nanoscale materials transform in the single nanocrystal limit.  Snapshots of nanoscale phase transitions will be captured in order to understand the rules that govern nanomaterial transformations, the energy barriers that separate metastable phases of matter, and the atomic-scale pathways that connect them.  In order to achieve this, this project brings together techniques never before combined, involving optical tweezers, short pulse x-ray scattering and spectroscopy, and nonlinear-optical techniques. This award is coupled to an educational outreach program involving a local high school student who will take part in this research, with the goal of encouraging the student to continue on in science and technology fields in college.  This award will also support the education of a PhD student in this area. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates how nanosized systems transform, using the equivalent of stop-action photography to visualize the atomic-scale pathways that nanoscale materials follow in real time.  Novel experimental techniques are combined together to capture the first steps in processes fundamental to the efficiency and speed of technologically relevant devices.  The output of this program will be a basic understanding of single nanocrystal phase changes and the development of new techniques for engineering and controlling the properties of materials at the nanoscale.  An integrated outreach program is also part of this award, involving a student from an economically-disadvantaged local high school who will take part in this research, with the goal of encouraging the student to continue in science and technology fields in the future.  This award will also support the education of a PhD student in this area with broad connections to advanced technologies and novel synthesis techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project explored the dynamics of nanomaterials, employing atomic-scale spatial resolution, femtosecond temporal resolution techniques to answer a fundamental question: How do nanoscale materials transform?    The general goal of this program was to develop a basic understanding that will enable engineering of new materials and devices with unique and technologically useful properties, with applications to nanoscale non-volatile memory storage and novel synthesis techniques.   Measurements were carried out at the single nanoparticle level, studying light-induced structural transformations within ferroelectric nanostructures.  An optical tweezers setup was used to trap and align a single nanoparticle within an optical beam, enabling pump-probe studies of their dynamical response.  Additional experiments probing single nanowires on substrates were also carried out. A key motivation that underlies the work carried out here is associated with developing an understanding of the ultimate speed limits for these processes.  How fast can the polarization of a ferroelectric, encoded in the positions of atoms, be changed?  These experiments provided first evidence that these processes can occur on sub-picosecond (1 trillionth of a second) time-scales.     Our results furthermore showed first evidence of ultrafast dynamical changes in symmetry occuring within the first picosecond following optical excitation within the prototypical ferroelectric, BaTiO3, as captured by nonlinear optical pump-probe techniques.  These are associated with a transformation from the initial tetragonal phase to one of monoclinic symmetry. Finally, our results enabled first studies of unique photoferroelectric coupling of light to nanowires, with enhanced photoabsorption observed for a nanowire embedded within the optical field of a light pulse.  New opportunities for nanoscale photoelectromechanical devices may follow from this work.  This research program was integrated with an educational outreach program involving local high school students and elementary school students from economically-disadvantaged backgrounds, with the goal of increasing their excitement and understanding about science from a broad perspective. Additionally, aspects of the research involved in this project were described both by the PI and graduate students involved in this project.
