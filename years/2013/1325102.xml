<AbstractNarration>This project will evaluate how anthropogenic changes in estuarine morphology affect sediment fluxes in urban estuaries, and how consequent shifts in the physical regime affect estuarine sustainability, based on a combination of environmental and socio-economic factors. Geophysical models of hydrodynamics, sediment transport, and morphodynamics will be combined with economic models that value ecosystem services to examine two study sites, the Delaware and Hudson-Raritan estuary systems. The work will incorporate field observations, historical analysis, high-resolution physical modeling, morphodynamic modeling, and coupled modeling of the human-natural system. Studies of estuarine physical processes will lead to the application of dynamical models that represent the hydrodynamics and recent morphodynamics in these estuaries, with particular emphasis on coupled estuary-wetland responses to channel deepening and shoreline modifications. Socio-economic analyses will provide a quantification of the ecosystem services under past, present, and future states of the natural-human system. The culmination of the research will be a coupled model of the natural-human state trajectory, which quantifies the feedback between human actions to alter the estuarine regime, the response of the physical system, and the changes in values of the altered ecosystem services. The proposed work will define the relevant and appropriate natural and human scales for sustainable management of an urban estuary and identify a decision framework that permits the assessment of socio-economic values across generations such that alternative predictive outcomes can be compared and ordered in terms of their sustainability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique contribution of this research is the quantitative integration of advanced analysis and modeling of physical processes in estuaries with socio-economic analyses, in order to predict the trajectory of the coupled human-natural system. Assessment of sustainability in estuaries requires this type of coupled analysis because of the sensitivity of the physical regime to human impacts and because of the critical human dimension of ecosystem services in estuaries. Important intellectual advances will also occur within the sub-disciplines. The morphological model of the estuary and surrounding wetlands will provide novel coupling of three-dimensional estuarine hydrodynamics and sediment transport with system-scale morphodynamics. The socio-economic analysis will analyze the linkage between policy, economics and ecosystem services within the context of the coupled human-natural regime.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will develop a framework for decision-making leading to the sustainable management of estuaries. The models will provide prototypes for future decision-making tools for planning of urban estuarine economic development, environmental management, and risk management. Engagement with policy professionals at the municipal, regional, state and federal levels with responsibility for management of the Hudson-Raritan and Delaware estuarine resources will advance the use of system-scale integrated analysis of the human-natural system. Communication of methodologies to the broader community is intended to shape future analysis and decision-making concerning estuarine sustainability throughout the U.S. and worldwide. The research program provides professional development for six graduate students, one post-doctoral investigator, and undergraduates through the institutional research experience for undergraduates (REU) programs. The diverse-yet-integrated project team will foster strong interdisciplinary collaborations and educational experiences that will prepare the students for future careers in sustainability science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported under NSF's Coastal SEES (Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability) program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcomes Report  Estuaries are environments where natural processes and human activities are strongly interconnected.  The natural processes of estuaries have positive and negative impacts on human welfare, and human alterations can ameliorate or exacerbate the interactions between nature and society.  This study examined the natural processes of estuaries in context with alterations by human activities, most notably the changes in estuarine morphology by dredging, with the goal of determining how these changes affect the environmental services and hazards.  Two case studies were examined?Delaware Bay, where rapid shoreline erosion is threatening the sustainability of the coastal environment, and the New York Harbor/Hudson River estuarine network, where centuries of human modifications have altered the estuarine environment in ways that are only beginning to be recognized.  The field methodologies involved a combination of ship-based surveys, instrumented mooring deployments, and land-based marsh surveys.  These were complemented by realistic numerical modeling studies of the two estuarine systems, in order to examine the influence of historical changes in the bathymetry that have altered the physical processes and the ecosystem functions of these environments.   Not surprisingly, we found that dredging has significantly affected the natural function of these estuaries, but some of the results were unexpected.  In the unexpected category, we did not find that dredging makes these estuaries more vulnerable to flooding.  On the contrary, we found that while the tides have gotten larger due to the deepening of channels in the upper Hudson tidal river (extending to Albany, NY), it is significantly less prone to flooding associated with river discharge events.  In the Delaware, we found that wave-induced shoreline erosion, which is the main agent of shoreline retreat, is not particularly sensitive to the presence of dredged channels.   It is possible that shoreline loss along Delaware Bay is largely a natural adjustment to sea-level rise. This adjustment can lead to changes in other important ecosystem services, however, including carbon sequestration in salt marshes.  The tidal wetlands of the Delaware are currently being lost at a rate of about one square kilometer each year, mostly to open water and woody wetlands, but also to encroaching human development.  Depending upon assumptions about the rate of remineralization of carbon, each lost square kilometer constitutes a conservatively estimated ecosystem service loss of $5 million, and the future accumulation of economic losses at this rate would approach $0.5 billion for scenarios of rapid sea-level rise.  Another important influence of dredging is its influence on salinity.  All estuaries have salt water that slides under the outgoing fresh water from river flow, and its position continually shifts with the river flow and tides. These interactions between salt and fresh water are particularly sensitive to the variations in estuarine depth?where the estuary is deep the salt water can readily extend up the estuary, but where it is shallow the mixing between fresh and salt water retards its advance.  We expect that as estuaries become deeper, the salt water should extend farther into estuaries, and that is exactly what we found in both estuaries, by examining historical data on salinity and with numerical modeling of the changes in bathymetry.  In the Delaware, this extension is likely to raise the costs of water treatment in electric generating facilities, especially those utilizing evaporative cooling towers, due to increased salinity in water withdrawn from the Delaware because of a deepened channel and sea-level rise.  The increased costs of water treatment for the Hope Creek nuclear power plant alone would reduce the estimated net benefits of the Delaware channel deepening project by as much as seven percent.  In the Hudson, we found that during low river flow conditions, the salt intrusion now extends more than 30 km farther up the Hudson than it did in the pre-dredging conditions of the mid-1800?s.  This has serious consequences for the city of Poughkeepsie, which gets its water from the Hudson at a location that used to be fresh even during the most extreme droughts, but now becomes saline during moderate to severe droughts.  This change is not due to climate change?it is due to dredging.  The effect of dredging the lower estuary is undeniably far reaching.  Existing policies to respond to elevated salinity at Poughkeepsie?s water intake on the Hudson would require the drawdown of a reservoir in New York?s Adirondack State Park, releasing water to lower the salinity downstream, and leading to significant losses in the generation of renewable energy by hydropower at the reservoir upstream.  Our research has provided tangible results that illustrate the influence of human activities on natural processes of particular importance to society.  The value of this research comes from our increased ability to understand the causes of these environmental changes and to develop more effective methods of predicting them and mitigating their negative consequences.
