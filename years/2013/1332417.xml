<AbstractNarration>This three year REU Site program at Drexel University will engage 10 undergraduate students for 9 weeks in interdisciplinary research in medicine, energy, and advanced manufacturing. The REU students will be part of a multi-institutional team, including a graduate student and faculty mentor from Drexel, a faculty mentor from the participant's home institution, a Drexel freshman from the Students Tackling Advanced Research (STAR) program, and a high school teacher in an NSF funded Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) program.  Students will also attend weekly seminars on research, education, and ethics, present an educational module on their research to middle school students, visit local industry and national laboratories, and attend social and cultural events.  The participants will keep photo journals of their experiences.  These journals will enhance and reinforce research and social experiences, and provide a tool for program assessment.  At the end of the summer program, participants will present their research results at a poster presentation and will be encouraged to submit their research at professional conferences.  After the program, REU participants will be encouraged to remain in contact with their interdisciplinary team through a Facebook group. Travel grants will be provided if students need to use Drexel's facilities to produce additional data that could result in a presentation or publication.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recruitment efforts will be focused on minorities, women, and underrepresented groups, and those who do not have access to advanced research facilities at their educational institutions. The PIs will recruit from regional institutions such as Delaware State University, Cheney University, Lincoln University, Swarthmore College, West Chester University, Rowan University, Villanova University, Widener University, Community College of Philadelphia, Burlington County College and Camden County College.  The PIs have established strong connections with faculty at these institutions. REU students will be encouraged to pursue graduate studies and careers in science and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"This REU site is co-funded by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program."</AbstractNarration>
