<AbstractNarration>This project continues the development of the AITopics information portal, a service to the Artificial Intelligence research community and an educational resource for the general public.  The portal can be found at www.aitopics.org. This site was originally conceived as a compendium of introductory and historical articles about artificial intelligence for use by the AI community as well as the general public. The initial prototype was a manual effort conducted by volunteers at the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI). Following this, an NSF-funded effort was undertaken in 2012 to reduce the time required of volunteers without reducing the quality of information provided. This project advances the sophistication of the portal by  automating the time-consuming process of selecting content from the literature to post on the website, and by enhancing a deployed AI news finder program employed to feed the site with fresh content. The ultimate goal of this work is to build a generally useful content management framework that would be applicable to such outreach effort across all sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project activities include A) development of the NewsFinder program to browse online AI journals as well as current periodicals to find interesting overview articles; B) creation of additional content management technology including tools for user interaction and feedback; creation of meta-data for search engines, creation of summary descriptions; automatically learning criteria for interesting items; and creation of tools to identify new topics as the field changes; C) continued curating of online versions of classic books and papers, including scanning material only available in hard copy; D) extension of NewsFinder to find articles describing new applications in each Applications area; E) as well as to provide useful information to practitioners in a new area of technology, including classification of IAAI papers by industry and type of problem; and F) expansion of the use of social media and mobile devices to refine and deliver information.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our long-term goal is to help educate non-specialists about the methods, new developments, and issues in STEM fields and the humanities.  We developed the AITopics information portal (www.AITopics.org) to provide a demonstration that the process of collecting and maintaining reliable information can be automated and will result in a well-organized, useful, and cost-effective collection of relevant information.  The portal itself provides information about many aspects of artificial intelligence (AI).  Its daily use by the lay public (without charge), as well as its adoption by the AAAI, the premier scientific society for AI, confirm our success.    We satisfied our objectives of creating a web-based information portal for one discipline, with a design and implementation that is  portable to other scientific and humanities disciplines extensible within and across disciplines maintainable because it is largely automated usable on mobile devices and tablets, portable computers, and desktop machines      Integrating information from diverse sources &ndash; news stories, semi-technical articles, videos, podcasts, historical "classics", and other information about research groups and course syllabi &ndash; helps readers at all levels understand the intellectual context and historical origins of concepts.  We automatically classify stories about AI into eighteen main topics, such as Machine Learning, Robots, and Science Fiction and provide various ways of searching for a specific topic or just browsing.     Our most important achievement has been automating the delivery of news items for daily posting to the web site, weekly email alerts, and real-time RSS feeds.  We have also designed, and largely automated, the identification of journal articles that provide good overviews of major research topics in artificial intelligence.  The AAAI sends a news alert, which is generated by the programs developed here, to over 1000 subscribers every week.  In this two-year period, information about AI in the web site has been viewed by over 200,000 visitors (about 8,000 per month) who viewed over a half-million pages.     Anyone interested may access the website without charge.       Last Modified: 12/08/2015       Submitted by: Bruce G Buchanan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
