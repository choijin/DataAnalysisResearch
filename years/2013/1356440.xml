<AbstractNarration>This project at the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) is providing an enhanced educational experience to economically disadvantaged and academically talented students, with emphasis on those from underrepresented groups and those who are transferring from local community colleges. In support of that goal, the program is awarding annual scholarships to sixteen students who are majoring in mechanical engineering, with an average scholarship amount of $7500. By expanding access to a course of study in this field, the project is helping to increase the overall pool of STEM-educated students ready to meet national workforce needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical basis of this project lies in a formal cooperative relationship UMBC has with local community colleges to increase the number of students transferring to the four-year Mechanical Engineering program. Within its overall enrollment strategy the project is actively recruiting underrepresented minorities and women through a focus on the biomedical specialization within Mechanical Engineering. The S-STEM scholars receive multi-layered faculty mentoring, academic intervention, access to research opportunities, and career advice, and benefit from an institutional support infrastructure designed to increase retention and career success of all undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>

In this funded NSF grant, our long term goal is to improve the nation&rsquo;s development of a highly trained workforce that meets the current and future technological needs of society. Our specific goals are to provide an enhanced educational experience to economically disadvantaged and academically talented students, with emphasis on underrepresented groups, who are pursuing undergraduate degrees in Mechanical Engineering.</p> <p>The ME S-STEM scholarships are available to students transferring from local community colleges in Maryland, incoming freshmen, current UMBC students, and non-traditional students. Our program utilizes a multi-faceted recruitment strategy to develop an informal consortium relationship between UMBC and Maryland&rsquo;s community colleges, which involves visits to community colleges and high schools, prepare and distribute multi-lingual S-STEM fliers, and utilize peer recruitment. Mentoring of the scholarship recipients occurs through one-on-one mentoring with a faculty member/investigator, peer group mentoring, community building activities, and research experiences/projects and internships. Professional development opportunities including workshops, seminars, career fairs, etc. are provided to help students identify employment opportunities and/or prepare them for applying to graduate school as they work towards completing their degrees. We awarded new S-STEM scholarships to 41 ME undergraduate students from Fall 2014 to Spring 2018, with an amount up to $7500/year/student.&nbsp; Among the scholars, 39% of them are female, 39% of the scholars are underrepresented minority students (African American and Hispanic), and 29% of them originally were community college students. All three percentages are higher than the student population percentages in the Mechanical Engineering department at UMBC.</p> <p>This project has provided insights on effective strategy to achieve the program goals.
