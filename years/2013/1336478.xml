<AbstractNarration>1336478 (McConnell). The primary objective of this research is to prove that widespread reuse of structural steel in buildings would be structurally-sound engineering practice with significant environmental benefits. The reuse of structural steel is currently exceedingly rare and, furthermore, reusing primary structural steel members as primary structural members is even less common. Once it can be shown that reuse of structural steel is generally acceptable or the specific conditions in which reuse of structural steel is appropriate are identified, this will lay the foundation for a new paradigm for reuse of structural steel and transform current construction practices resulting in significant environmental benefits. Original data that are to be generated through this research is detailed information on construction-induced stresses through field testing using established and novel monitoring and inspection techniques combined with computational structural analysis. The work will also result in improved understanding of the holistic stress state within a building system, which can be used to optimize future designs, building layouts, and conventional and deconstruction-focused connection methods. Such practice would dramatically reduce the need for recycling steel members, and the associated minimum estimates of 10 GJ of energy and 0.92 tons of CO2 emissions per ton of steel. The outcome of this research and its complementary activities is targeted to cultivate a cultural shift in the way in which buildings are designed, constructed, deconstructed, and repurposed in order to have a more thoughtful regard for energy and natural resource consumption. Through four tasks, data to support or disprove the primary hypothesis that structural steel members can safely be reused will be generated by creating a stress envelope of potential stress states for common applications. In support of the second hypothesis of this research (conditions most likely to impair future structural usefulness are construction-induced stresses and connection stresses), considerations of construction sequencing and/or analysis in the vicinity of connections will be common to all research tasks. Task 1 will be a laboratory pilot case for later field instrumentation to be installed in Task 2 to obtain novel information on the construction-induced stresses in typical buildings. In Task 3, the residual stresses in and structural performance of decommissioned steel members will be quantified. Through the combination of Tasks 2 and 3, the actual stresses in a suite of steel building members will be known at all stages of a steel member?s life cycle (construction and service-life from Task 2; end of service-life from Task 3). The information from these select members and structures will be used to predict the peak life-history stresses via computational structural analysis in Task 4. Through the monitoring efforts in Tasks 1 and 2 it will also be determined if novel monitoring and inspection methods have the ability for evaluating suitability for reuse on a specific individualized basis for any member that is a future reuse candidate. The broader impact of the proposed research and its integrated activities is to initiate a cultural shift towards a more thoughtful and environmentally-friendly regard for the manner in which materials are used and reused in our profession and society. Through this research it is anticipated that the frequency at which steel is reused will increase, to achieve reductions in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions in the construction industry. Through a comprehensive plan for disseminating the research topic and results, the concept of reusing materials will be promoted within the scientific, college, pre-college, and local communities. Outreach activities to expose a diverse population of pre-K students to the concepts of sustainability and the field of civil engineering in a manner that is integrated with existing research-based best-practices in pre-K literacy education is also proposed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ While the concept of reduce-reuse-recycle is well known, what is less commonly considered is that the three components of reduce, reuse, recycle are not equally beneficial from an environmental impact perspective.  Another environmental concept that demonstrates this is the waste management hierarchy, shown in Figure 1.  Here it can be seen that preventing or reducing material use are the most desirable goals, followed by reuse, then recycling, then energy recovery prior to disposal.  For structural steel, the environmental benefits of reuse versus recycling are significant as recycling one ton of steel generates approximately one ton of carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas) and consumes a minimum of 10 GJ of energy, typically from non-renewable energy sources.  Furthermore, iron and steel production (40% of which is used by the construction industry) is the third largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States.  The advantages of the construction using reused versus recycled structural steel members are further visually represented by Figure 2.    Given the environmental benefits of steel reuse versus steel recycling and the widespread use of steel as a building material, there is significant opportunity for reducing the environmental footprint of the construction industry if steel reuse becomes a common practice.  The material properties of steel are favorable to directly reusing it.  One of the reasons for this is because of its strength, quantified by the amount of force that can be resisted per area, which is termed stress.  While the stress applied to a building component can generally be calculated with confidence, there are some situations where structural engineers are uncertain of the applied stress.  Because of the uncertainty in these situations, there are questions regarding the suitability of reuse of a steel member.  Two of these situations are during construction and near connection areas.  Thus, the objective of this research project was to quantify the stresses in these two situations.    This was achieved by placing a wireless sensor system in three buildings constructed with steel members during the construction process.  The novel wireless system allowed for continuous measurements without interfering with typical construction processes.  The system also piloted the field application of a novel carbon nanotube based sensor (known as a sensing skin) that allowed for measurements over a greater localized area than traditional sensors (like strain gages).  The construction monitoring was supplemented with laboratory testing to create computer simulations that allowed for stress conditions to be evaluated in greater detail.    The data generated provided detailed information on construction-induced stresses and stresses in the vicinity of connections.  These results support that reuse of steel members could become viable practice from a structural integrity perspective.  Thus, by transitioning away from the present practice of steel recycling towards direct steel reuse, the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from construction are reduced.  Furthermore, this result can serve as a model for considering the reuse of other materials that are presently recycled in large quantities, such as aluminum and glass, and additional evidence promoting a cultural shift towards a more thoughtful and environmentally-friendly regard for the manner in which materials are used and reused in the civil engineering profession, other professions, and society.  Another outcome of this research is improved understanding of the holistic stress state within a building system during construction, which can be used to optimize future designs, building layouts, and conventional and deconstruction-focused construction methods.
