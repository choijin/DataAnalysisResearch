<AbstractNarration>The proposal requests Phase II funding for the North Carolina State University (NCSU) and Georgia Tech (GT) to remain as active sites in the Center for Silicon Solar Consortium (SiSoC). NCSU is the lead institution while GIT is a "Partner" site. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed center's goal is to help reestablish a global leadership role for the US Silicon PV industry by having government together with the solar-electric power industry jointly stimulate high quality university level research and education, while developing an expanded and skilled workforce. The NCSU research center will emphasize materials characterization leading to a fundamental understanding of impact of defects/impurities/mechanical behavior of solar cell materials emphasizing the development of advanced characterization tools to accommodate the various needs of both single- and multi-crystalline Si wafers, thin films and nanoscale PV science and technology. The GT research will focus on reducing the cost of PV generated electricity and designing and fabricating high efficiency solar cells. Their demonstrated expertise in developing low-cost materials and rapid thermal processes for next generation silicon solar cells will provide training and enriching the educational experience of PV knowledgeable students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SiSoC will actively develop a skilled workforce, while meeting the rapidly growing demand for clean energy with an emphasis on minimal environmental impact on our planet. This will be enabled by having other government agencies, together with the solar-electric power industry jointly stimulating high quality university level research and education. The specific scientific results will be widely disseminated through semi-annual SiSoC review meetings, conference presentations, and publications. The research activity will also be amplified through student internships at industry member locations. The PIs plan to hire undergraduates as lab assistance under NSFs REU Program to create an excellent outreach opportunity for underrepresented minorities/women to participate in PV materials research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Phase II of the SiSoC NSF I/UCRC: Enhancing the Manufacturability of Silicon Solar Cells PI: Lewis Reynolds North Carolina State University     Summary:  This research is an extension of the Silicon Solar Consortium (SiSoC), an NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC). The mission was to conduct research on pre-competitive technology issues of the photovoltaic industry to enable advanced silicon solar cell manufacturing, educate students for the photovoltaic industry and to stimulate a US leadership role in PV technology for clean energy, thus reducing use of fossil fuels. It is clear that the NSF I/UCRC SiSoC was an unqualified success. The focus of the silicon solar cell research addressed relevant topics such as crystal growth, residual stress, wafer breakage, role of impurities and defects on carrier lifetime and cell efficiency, wire cutting, passivation of defects and surfaces, process modeling and device design and fabrication. These investigations led to demonstration of Si solar cells with efficiencies &gt;20%.  The SiSoC consortium provided a unique environment for research in an area of national interest, that is, clean energy. It fostered collaboration between university, industrial and government scientists to address the most important topics in silicon photovoltaic manufacturing. This was accomplished by industrial members providing a list of research and development topics of interest, and then university members submitting project proposals to address these PV topics. The strong industrial mentor-university interactions enabled students to perform state-of-the-art research on silicon photovoltaics for enhanced cell efficiency at reduced cost. The accomplishments of the Center have been documented in more than 170 technical publications and presentations and the graduation of more than twenty MS and PhD students directly supported by SiSoC.  Project 2012-NCSU/GIT: Key accomplishments  Carrier lifetime in both n-type CZ and cast-mono Si showed that lifetime significantly reduced after POCl3 diffusion but can be recovered after six hour gettering at 600oC (Figure 1). Project focus centered initially on performance of n-type cast-mono Si versus CZ Si then evolved to investigating CCZ Si for wafer cost reduction and changes in lifetime through cell fabrication. Nanoindentation measurements on CCZ Si wafers indicated low residual stress which is critical for mechanical integrity of thin wafers during fabrication (Figure 1). Bevel polish revealed that saw damage from wafer slicing could extend 25 &mu;m into the wafer, which can have a deleterious impact on carrier lifetime and hence cell efficiency. Lifetime of field-passivated n-type CCZ Si determined by QSSPC depends on donor concentration via power law dependence of surface recombination velocity on doping (Figure 1). Accurate assessment of lifetime via PCD limited by surface damage related recombination and surface passivation. During solar cell fabrication, the minority carrier lifetime exhibits a decrease with B implantation and anneal but is double that of the unprocessed lifetime after P implant and anneal (Figure 2). Conclude that CCZ Si is a viable growth process for photovoltaic applications with cell efficiency nearly comparable to that of the CZ control (Figure 2).   Project 2013-NCSU/U Manchester: Key accomplishments  Demonstrated that Mo forms nano-precipitates in solar grade Si and introduces a deep level in the gap that behaves as an effective recombination center for minority carriers in p-type CZ Si (Figure 3). Observation of three new recombination traps in CZ and CCZ Si of which two contain an oxygen dimer and hydrogen which may negatively impact minority carrier lifetime and hence is deleterious for solar cell efficiency. The concentration of the defect O2i-H is lower in CCZ Si due to the lower oxygen dimer concentration.
