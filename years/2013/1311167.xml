<AbstractNarration>Males produce a myriad of proteins that are transferred to the female during mating and directly influence reproductive success. As a group, the genes that encode these male reproductive proteins exhibit elevated levels genetic diversity and rapid evolution.  The proposed research aims to further understand the evolutionary causes and consequences of the rapid evolution of male reproductive proteins, a ubiquitous but enigmatic pattern.  Using the red flour beetle as a model system, this research will combine both genetic and phenotypic approaches to differentiate between two alternate hypotheses proposed to explain the rapid evolution observed among this class of genes.  Specifically, the research aims to determine whether the accumulation of genetic variation is due to adaptive or neutral evolutionary forces. &lt;br/&gt;This research will also benefit a number of undergraduate students who will be trained by the graduate student co-PI. The co-PI also contributes to a popular science blog accessible to a general audience. Furthermore, understanding the evolution of male reproductive proteins will inform areas of applied research.  For example, efforts aimed at developing biological control methods for insect disease vectors and agricultural pests, such as the red flour beetle, have recently begun to investigate whether this group of genes may provide new avenues for population control.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the most consistent wide-spread genomic patterns to emerge over the last 15 years is that genes involved in reproduction diverge rapidly between species.  The most prominent hypothesis proposed to explain this pattern is that the rapid evolution of SFP genes is driven by positive selection, which arises due to post-copulatory sexual selection (PCSS).  In other words, competitive interactions between males or between males and females after copulation takes place (i.e. sperm competition or cryptic female choice) exert strong selection on reproductive genes causing new beneficial mutations spread quickly through populations.  However, a relaxation, rather than a strengthening, of selection can also lead to rapid divergence.  The major goal of this project was to test the hypothesis that post-copulatory sexual selection can drive the rapid evolution of reproductive genes, as well as investigate the null hypothesis, that the observed variation arises due to a relaxation of selection.    We develop a rigorous theoretical framework for understanding how selection could drive the rapid evolution of reproductive genes. Our work demonstrates that relaxed selection due to sex-specific expression and mating system variation can produce the patterns of elevated polymorphism and divergence observed among these genes without invoking an adaptive hypothesis. The theoretical predictions we developed can be widely applied to empirical data collected in many study systems.  The results of this research have been accepted for publications in the journal, Evolution.  To test our predictions using empirical data, we used a genomics approach to measure within and between population genetic variation in male and female reproductive genes in Tribolium castaneum, a highly promiscuous species and a common agricultural pest.  We sequenced 24 individuals from each of four globally-distributed populations (Lima, Peru; Bhopal, India; Jerez, Spain; West Lafayette, IN, USA). We developed a novel statistical approach to use our knowledge of genetic variation within and between populations to distinguish between alternative hypotheses concerning the evolution of reproductive genes.  We observed that reproductive genes in T. castaneum exhibited elevated variation within populations in comparison with the rest of the genome; this finding is not consistent with the prediction of strong local positive selection. It is consistent with theoretical expectations for genes expressed in one sex but not in the other sex (where the gene phenotype is exposed to selection in the former but not in the latter).  Furthermore, the genomic database developed for this project has proven valuable outside of stated goals of the project, allowing us to better understand the genetic variation of insecticide resistance genes in T. castaneum. The genomic resources produced by this project will be made freely available upon publication of our results.            Last Modified: 01/26/2016       Submitted by: Amy Dapper]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
