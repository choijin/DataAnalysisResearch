<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the College of Charleston will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2014-2016. Student research training will be done at the Grice Marine Laboratory, located in Charleston, SC.  This award is supported by both the Directorates for Biological Sciences (Division of Biological Infrastructure) and Geosciences (Division of Ocean Sciences).  The program focuses on the theme of marine organism health, which addresses how organisms, populations, communities, and ecosystems respond to natural or anthropogenic changes in oceanic and estuarine environments.  Student projects involve issues on climate change, coastal development, natural disasters, species introductions and pollution -- conditions that are creating special challenges to organisms because of more rapid changes in variables like temperature, pH, salinity, oxygen level, and presence of harmful pharmaceuticals, metals and other pollutants. In addition to being engaged in full-time research in the lab or field, students will participate in seminars, field trips, and workshops on topics like the responsible conduct of research, communication with professional and public audiences, and the graduate school application process. Students from schools with limited research opportunities and those from underrepresented groups are encouraged to apply. Participants are selected based on potential benefits to the student's career, on the diversity that each student contributes to the intern group, and on evidence of strong potential for academic and personal achievement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REU students will learn how research is conducted and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. REU students will be housed in the dormitory of the Grice Marine Laboratory at the Fort Johnson Marine Resources Center.  The program will use the REU common assessment tool (Student Assessment of Learning Gains) and its own instrument to assess student gains in the program, and will continue to assess participant interest in science and math disciplines, their career paths, and the lasting influences of the research experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Fort Johnson REU summer program (FJ-REU) is a ten-week internship that combines independent research with workshop activities to promote STEM career development and communication skills.  The program provided these experiences to 30 undergraduate student interns over the last three years.  Student participants were drawn from 15 U.S. states and Puerto Rico and included &gt;50% underrepresented minorities and &gt;65% from non-PhD granting institutions and many inland schools, providing research experience in marine biology to students with traditionally fewer opportunities.  The broad theme of the program, "Marine Organism Health: Resilience and Response to Environmental Change," enabled interns to pursue a range of research topics in the marine biology of climate variation, natural and anthropogenic disasters, pollution, coastal development, and natural resource management.  Research projects included the effects of environmental stressors on corals, crabs, invasive seaweeds, invertebrate larvae, amphibian gametes, estuarine shrimp, manatees, phytoplankton, and macrophage, as well as ecological variables influencing the distribution and diversity of benthic microalgae, sharks, horseshoe crabs and teleost fishes.  Many of the systems studied have implications for conservation or involve commercially important species.   The Fort Johnson campus where the program is housed is a consortium of five partner institutions: two state academic institutions (the College of Charleston and the Medical University of South Carolina), one state government agency (Department of Natural Resources), and two federal agencies (National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Institutes of Standards and Technology).  Participating mentors were drawn from all of these institutions across the Fort Johnson campus.  By leveraging the strengths of this partnership, the program provided interns with exposure to diversity in the culture and practice of science in different institutional settings, including familiarity with how environmental questions are formulated and addressed by mission-based and inquiry-based institutions.   In addition to having students carry out independent research under a faculty mentor, a second major component of the program was a Science Communication Workshop Series (SCICOMM).  The SCICOMM series, co-led by a science writer/educator and a scientist, developed skills and an awareness of opportunities for presenting science to public and professional audiences.  The communication products developed by SCICOMM for public audiences involved traditional and social media platforms, including press releases that interns provided to their home institutions and blog posts designed to educate the public about the impact of their research on environmental health.  Each intern also engaged in the production of scholarship for professional audiences included a scientific research proposal, a research manuscript and a colloquium presentation.  Research done as part of this program has resulted to date in at least four peer-reviewed publications with intern co-authors, at least 13 intern presentations at national meetings, and at least two intern best student presentation awards.
