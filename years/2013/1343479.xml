<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Research Alliance project focuses on building a sustainable innovation ecosystem in biophotonics, on educating the next generation of entrepreneurs and on accelerating the translation and transfer of key biomedical technologies developed by an NSF Science and Technology Center (STC), the Center for Biophotonics Science and Technology (CBST). &lt;br/&gt;The technologies proposed for commercialization in collaboration with our partners will fill technology gaps in the following areas: 1) super-resolution cellular imaging for biology and medicine, 2) novel non-photobleaching labels for imaging of cell dynamics, 3) monitoring cellular response to cancer drugs, and 4) automated blood pathology for disease detection and monitoring. These technologies have the following market-valued features: 1) outstanding image quality at resolutions that are at least 8 times higher (volume-wise) than the diffraction limit, that provide exemplary performance at lower, and thus more forgiving, illumination intensities when compared to leading optical microscopy technologies; 2) provide the ability to use non-photobleaching SERS (surface enhanced Raman scattering) labels for cellular imaging of cell dynamics, for monitoring unique biomarkers that cannot yet be monitored with other techniques; 3) capability to monitor cellular responses to cancer drugs in almost real-time by using Raman cytometry and in a more efficient manner compared with other experimental strategies; and 4) automated, real-time, point-of-care blood testing systems that provide enormous cost savings when compared to impedance-based, large, skilled labor-intensive and expensive commercially-available blood pathology systems.  &lt;br/&gt;The Ecosystem for Biophotonics Innovation accomplishes this transfer to the market either by working in collaboration with research partners and transferring technologies to them, or via spinoffs, resulting in creation of new jobs (Entrepreneurial Fellows in academia, scientists collaborators in industry, and scientists in startup companies), commercial products for biology and medicine, with the potential to advance research and help patients while also training entrepreneurial scientists and generating licensing and royalty revenues. The partnerships engaged to transfer the technologies to the market domain include: 1) Applied Precision Inc, a GE Healthcare Company - will commercialize software algorithms for next generation super-resolution microscopes; 2) BD Biosciences - will commercialize novel SERS labels for studying cell dynamics; 3) Keaton Raphael Memorial foundation - will invest financial resources to advance technologies for diagnosis and treatment of pediatric cancers and to launch a startup company to commercialize the most promising technologies; 4) SARTA - will provide links to entrepreneurs in the region and educational opportunities; and 5) Tahoe Institute for Rural Health Research - will commercialize the automatic blood pathology system. &lt;br/&gt;The potential economic impact is expected to be realized through: 1) employing highly skilled and productive entrepreneurial fellows, faculty, as well as the scientists at our partnering organizations; 2) employing highly skilled scientists in spinoff companies; 3) licensing of technologies; and 4) through product sales (e.g., next generation super-resolution optical microscopes, labels and assays for cellular imaging, assays for monitoring cellular response to cancer drugs, and automated pathology systems), in the next one-to-five years. All these activities will ultimately contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the biomedical technology market space through ensuring that cutting-edge technologies are commercialized in the U.S. instead of by scientists and companies from other countries and through providing excellent professional development opportunities to talented entrepreneurial fellows who we expect will have innovative and resourceful careers beyond their tenure with EBI. In the short term, the societal impact includes the movement of advanced technologies closer to commercialization, as well as hands-on training and learning for the next generation of scientists and entrepreneurs regardless of whether entrepreneurial fellows pursue careers in academia or in the private sector. In the long term, the societal impact includes enhancement of scientific discovery enabled by cutting-edge instruments, medical devices, techniques and assays, better understanding of biophysical phenomena, and ultimately improved patient care. EBI will also benefit society by strengthening an infrastructure to promote innovation and to educate would-be entrepreneurs, while also enabling universities to more productively partner with private industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF Partnerships for Innovation: Accelerating Innovation Research Alliance award (PFI:AIR) has allowed us to expand the development and sustainability of the Ecosystem for Biophotonics Innovation (EBI-2) program, which was created at UC Davis between 2011-2013 as a framework to accelerate the commercialization of important biomedical technologies in collaboration with external partners and to educate graduate students and postdoctoral researchers as entrepreneurs.  During the lifetime of this award:  We built upon and expanded our biophotonics innovation ecosystem that accelerates the commercialization of academic research technology and know-how into end-user validated biomedical technologies and devices. To do this, we strengthened existing partnerships and developed new ones, to expand our industry partner base. We tested and optimized different concepts for the ecosystem by accelerating the commercialization of 6 technologies developed by scientists at UC Davis, in collaboration with end-users from medical and life science communities, i.e. product development teams. We continued and refined our education and mentorship program for scientist innovators, including entrepreneurial fellows (eFellows), to better equip them to become creative leaders in technology maturation and commercialization, with highly marketable skills. We contributed to new economic growth and job creation by training PhD students and postdoctoral fellows in the process of technology development and commercialization, making them more suitable for jobs in the biophotonics industry.    In the EBI ecosystem, we engaged with public and private entities on multiple levels, partners who matched NSFÆs investment at least 1:1 with cash and in-kind contributions. Our EBI-2 partners and third-party investors for this award period are: GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences, BD Biosciences, Keaton Raphael Memorial Foundation, Tahoe Institute for Rural Health Research, Agilent, Photometics, SARTA and its MedStart program, COMPASS Product Design, JDID Product Design and Development, Sacramento Angels, Velocity Venture Capital, Wavepoint Ventures, and academic partners from California State University at Sacramento, UC Davis College of Engineering, Graduate School of Management, Child Family Institute for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, and the UC Davis Health System. Each partner has a representative on the EBI Board of Directors. Dr. Steven Currall, Dean of the Graduate School of Management, chaired the Board of Directors.  EBIÆs primary intellectual merit stems from the development of a unique alliance of committed partners who worked collaboratively to translate research-based technologies to the marketplace. Our scientists and eFellows accelerated technology commercialization in response to end-user needs, in collaboration with entrepreneurs and scientists from industry:  Software algorithms for enhancing superresolution and deconvolution optical microscopy &ndash; The teamÆs reconstruction algorithms achieved 100 times reduction in light exposure, thus minimizing photobleaching and toxicity; less artifacts; higher contrast and cleaner background. Developed and tested new labels and markers for flow cytometry and cellular imaging Built and demonstrated a new Raman microscope that is 2 orders of magnitude faster than conventional microscopes and used it to test promising approaches to cancer-selective chemotherapy. Portable blood count monitor that uses only 2 microliters of blood and provides a Complete Blood Count (CBC); can also measure blood cell counts in human synovial fluid, spinal fluid, peritoneal fluid, as well as animal CBC. Microscopy with Ultraviolet Surface Excitation (MUSE) &ndash; UV-based surface-weighted microscopy that can provide histology-quality images without requiring the preparation of a traditional microscope slide.
