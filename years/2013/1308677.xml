<AbstractNarration>This project addresses the design and synthesis of zeolite-like frameworks based on assembly of Archimedean polyhedra constructed from hydrogen-bonded molecular tiles and related molecular frameworks to create a new family of microporous molecular frameworks with structures and properties that can be modified through choice of molecular constituents.  These frameworks are used as scaffolds that encapsulate functional molecules such as laser dyes as well as templates for synthesis of nanoreticulated metal oxides that replicate the topology of the zeolite-like frameworks.  This work also capitalizes on the unique ability of lamellar GS compounds to form high quality thin films with controlled two-dimensional packing of conjugated guest molecules with adjustable electronic properties for a systematic examination of electron transport in a field effect transistor configuration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The motivation for this project is driven by promise of new materials that capitalize on the versatility of organic synthesis, which permit manipulation of properties through molecular design.  The project explores the synthesis of materials for a new generation of solid-state lasers as well as the molding of nanomaterials with unique electronic properties that can impact technologies ranging from displays to solar energy.  The project also provides summer research experiences for undergraduates and faculty from minority-serving and four-year institutions, research experiences for high school students, exposure of students and postdocs to the industrial section through the NYU University Chapter of the Chemists' Club, and professional development opportunities for students and postdocs that will prepare them for careers in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
