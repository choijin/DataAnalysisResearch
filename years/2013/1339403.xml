<AbstractNarration>Boise State University (BSU), in cooperation with local high schools and the Idaho Technology Council (a state-wide organization of industry, research, educators, investors, and government), proposes to develop and implement a comprehensive program -- IDoCode -- that will provide high quality CS preparation for high school teachers. Its primary goal is to significantly increase the number of teachers prepared to teach CS in the state of Idaho, and its secondary goal is to increase the number of Idaho high school graduates that are motivated to pursue a CS degree and career. The project leverages two existing degree programs at Boise State: the IDoTeach program (a UTeach replication program designed to increase the number of secondary math and science teachers in the state of Idaho and its surrounding region) for preservice teachers, and the Master of Science in STEM Education for in-service teachers. IDoTeach will prepare teachers to teach the AP CS Principles curriculum, creating CS pathways in both programs. The resulting CS prepared teachers will be further supported through face-to-face workshops, mentoring programs, support from industry, professionals, and online resources. BSU along with local industry partners will work to recruit inservice teachers and high school students (potential preservice teachers) to the programs. The project will create a blueprint for states such as Idaho to provide high quality CS preparation high school teachers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ How do you build a strong foundation of computing skills required for students to excel in almost any field in the 21st century?   By exposing students to computational thinking and problem solving skills woven into the computer science curriculum in K-12.  In 2014, Boise State University received an award (NSF #1339403, part of the CS10K initiative) to introduce high quality computer science in high schools by  training up to 40 high-school teachers who would receive a Masters in STEM Education with Computer Science (CS) Emphasis in the IDoCode program.  As the Boise State CS and Educational department team members began the process to achieve goals, we realized the importance of stakeholder involvement to ensure the outcomes are ?sustainable.?  The effort to bring lasting educational change required the IDoCode team to coordinate efforts with School Districts, Teachers, State Board of Education, Legislature, Industry, Parents, and Students.  The goal to bring computer science to all requires educational professionals take proactive steps to ensure wider student participation.  The chosen curriculum needs to be engaging to all students.  Student graduation standards that allow computer science to count towards graduation requirements is crucial to attract wider student population.  Providing school counselors, teachers, and administration with information to encourage all students to explore computer science educational skills - no matter the student?s future career plan!  Student outreach is crucial to building a thriving program which prepares students with 21st century skills.  The IDoCode program outcomes include:  The program has accepted 74 high school teachers into      multi-year Masters, Graduate Certificate for CS Teacher Endorsement, and      Secondary Education Bachelor's programs.  We will have 22 Graduate      Certificates, 20 Masters and one Bachelors completed by Fall 2018. Every high school in the Boise and surrounding areas      now offers multiple high quality CS courses. The number of reported students taking computer science      courses in surrounding area high schools has gone from 50 to over 1200      during the four years of the grant!  We have tracked 3690 students who have participated in      CS classes since Fall 2016, with not all teachers or districts reporting.       Additionally 362 students have taken advanced Computer Science      course for dual college credit. Teachers are capable of teaching the introductory Exploring      Computer Science (ECS) course after they complete the first IDoCode      course. AP Computer Science Principles (CSP), AP Computer      Science A, and more advanced capstone courses suitable for Academic or      Career and Technical Education tracks as they continue the IDoCode      program. The IDoCode program actively engaged with school      districts and teachers who have established or plans to offer computer      science classes. We worked closely with these ?Associate? IDoCode      members to adopt the new ECS and CSP curriculum and provide additional      training. To promote broad student participation, we:    Offered NCWIT?s ?Computing by       Design? to 56 teachers, administrators, and counselors with information       and resources to support all students as they explore computer       science education. Hosted four CS teaching       gathering events to build collaboration between CS teachers to share       their experiences and best practices. Provided yearly student and       teacher summer workshops to show how computer science skills may be       incorporated through music and art, as well as mobile application       development and cyber security. Held meetings with district       representatives throughout the grant life to provide information and seek       their feedback.   Active participation of the award PIs and personnel      with the SBOE and legislature resulted in the creation and adoption of      statewide CS teaching standards for teachers and K-12 students, the      establishment of Idaho?s CS teacher endorsement, creation of the Idaho STEM      Action Center to support and promote broad STEM goals with a special focus      on Computer Science, and recent legislation requiring all high schools to      offer at least one computer science course starting FY 2020. IDoCode partnerships helped magnify the project      results.  For example, IDoCode trained teachers hired by      IDLA to bring online CS access to students across the state.  Or      partnering with the University of Idaho who created a dual credit CS      computational thinking and problem solving workshop and is now replicating      the IDoCode program at their campus.   In conclusion, the IDoCode program has been on a journey that took us beyond our original goals of training CS teachers, to expanding access to CS to a broad population through partnerships established along the way.  We wish to thank the effort of others who broke ground on new curriculum and those who brought national attention to the K-12 initiatives.
