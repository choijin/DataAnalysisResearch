<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to understand the very early parts of how cells adhere to surfaces such as natural extracellular matrices and artificial surfaces used in biomaterials. Specifically, this research will investigate how the membrane controls the transport of lipids and the recruitment of important adhesion molecules to adhesion plaques. These experiments will use advanced microscopes capable of measuring dynamics of cellular adhesions and molecular dynamics in these structures. If successful, these measurements would lead to a better understanding of cellular adhesion dynamics and why atherosclerotic lesions form in areas of low and oscillating fluid shear stress such as at blood vessel bifurcations and near stents. It may also be important for shear-induced vasodilation, which is known to counteract pressure-induced myogenic constriction in small arteries and thus is an important component of blood pressure control and hypertension.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, these studies would add significantly to the field's understanding of mechanosensing in particular and molecular scale functional organization of plasma membranes in general.  This understanding may assist in future testing of mechanosensation theories and in the development of new biomechanical mimetics, such as unilamellar vesicles with proteins, proteoglycans, and cytoskeleton.  Since almost all cells need to sense and apply force, these studies may have broad implications for many mechanobiological processes including bone remodeling, stem cell differentiation, and developmental biology. The proposed research on membrane mechanobiology will be integrated into graduate training and in undergraduate honors thesis preparation. This training will form the basis of outreach to young scientists (grades 6-12) in which molecular scale mechanobiology is made more accessible through modern 3-D visualization. Such outreach will provide opportunities to reach underrepresented groups such as women and minorities and students in rural Pennsylvania, who visit Penn State frequently as they consider their higher education options.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported work aimed at uncovering the relationship between cell membrane lipids and adhesion of cells to surfaces.  Specifically, we investigated the role of the membrane in adhesion of endothelial cells to extracellular molecules found in the body.  Endothelial cells are the cells that line blood vessels and protect them from vascular disease.  Endothelial cells are also used to cover stents in order to reduce disease formation after stent deployment.  The focus of this area of research has traditionally been on the role of transmembrane proteins, called integrins, in adhesion to molecules outside of cells, called extracellular matrix.  However, since integrins span the lipid bilayer membrane from inside the cell to outside the cell, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the lipid bilayer will affect the conformation of integrins and affect their ability to adhere to the extracellular matrix.   For the first time, we used single molecule force spectroscopy to show that adhesion probability and strength between integrins and extracellular matrix molecules can be increased by applying chemicals that target specific parts of the membrane called liquid-disordered domains.  Using laser-based techniques that can measure diffusion of integrins and the number of integrins that are diffusing, we showed that changes in the thickness of the liquid disordered portion caused integrins to pair up and attach to extracellular molecules 2 at a time when integrins were near ECM molecules for 1.5 seconds.     Adhesion is also affected by the thermal flexing of the membrane near surfaces.  For this reason, we developed a new method by which we can assess molecular scale area-per-lipid, and the dynamic changes of area-per-lipid associated with membrane bending fluctuations.  This new method is based on measuring the time between excitation of a fluorescence molecule in the membrane and its emission of photons.  This time, called fluorescence lifetime, increases when the area-per-lipid decreases.  Using this method, we found that the mechanical properties of bending and stretch of membranes are related to membrane thickness and measured, for the first time, the mechanical properties of intact lipid bilayers in red blood cells and endothelial cells.  We anticipate that research conducted under this grant will help us understand the detailed mechanisms by which cells adhere to surfaces, and, in particular, the role of the cell membrane in modulating this behavior.  This research establishes the lipid bilayer as an important partner in modifying the adhesive properties of single integrin molecules.  Lastly, the ability to measure mechanical properties of membranes provides a new tool for researchers to study the mechanical relationship of cells and their environment in vitro and, potentially, in vivo.
