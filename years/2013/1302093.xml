<AbstractNarration>Dr. Kelly Denney is awarded an NSF Astronomy and Astrophysics Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a program of research and education at The Ohio State University.  The Fellow plans to improve our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution by focusing on the impact and role of supermassive black holes (BHs) and their growth rates across cosmic time.  The connection between BH growth and galaxy evolution can be studied in active galactic nuclei (AGNs)---systems in which the central supermassive BH is actively accreting matter.  Here, the BH mass and accretion rate can be measured, and the connection to the host galaxy evolution can be judged through feedback processes and the relation of BH and galaxy properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Fellow's primary goal is to recalibrate the Mg II- and C IV-based AGN BH mass scales---on which all high-redshift BH masses are based---by taking into account recently discovered systematic uncertainties in these masses.  This program will also characterize the observed emission-line, spectral energy distribution, and radio characteristics of the sample to investigate the creation of intrinsic reddening and inclination indicators applicable to all types of AGNs.  Finally, time will be spent initiating a series of future reverberation mapping monitoring programs out to a redshift of around 2 for measuring BH masses and AGN distances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project include a significant educational component.  The fellow will undertake a program of educational outreach with two components: (1) delivering to the Columbus-area schools an inquiry-based astronomy curriculum targeting the 6th--10th grades that aims to improve both teacher and student attitudes and competence in STEM fields, and (2) a telescope lending library available to public schools and other groups for use in the classroom and evening observing activities.</AbstractNarration>

Denney completed a series of projects to improve the accuracy and precision of supermassive black hole mass measurement methods applicable to actively accreting black holes at the centers of galaxies, known as active galactic nuclei (AGNs).  The broad context goal of these projects was to better understand the co-evolution of black holes and galaxies and how this co-evolution may affect the formation history of galaxies across the history of the universe. Her program utilized a time-domain study of the light coming from different, but causally connected regions of hot, dense, light-emitting gas near the actively accreting supermassive black hole at the center of a population of galaxies containing AGNs.  This technique, called reverberation mapping, provides a means for directly measuring the mass of the central supermassive black hole. Extensions and applications of this technique, also used by Denney for her investigations, provide a means for estimating masses in larger samples of AGNs from more resource economic observations than those required to apply the full reverberation mapping technique.  The investigations led by Denney and collaborators helped to increase the accuracy of measurements of AGN black hole masses and our understanding of the fundamental assumptions in making these measurements by looking at the details of the time-dependent emission coming from the black hole accretion disk and surrounding gas in the broad line region, as well as the geometry and kinematics of this gas, which can be inferred from the time response of the brightness changes of this emission.  This was done within an international collaboration of scientists who performed a high-fidelity ground- and space-based reverberation mapping monitoring campaign known as STORM.  Next, the work of Denney and collaborators within the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) addressed improvements in the precision of black hole mass estimates (a) by extending direct mass measurements to higher redshifts and larger samples with a reverberation mapping program completed (and still on-going) with the SDSS telescope, and (b) by investigating systematic uncertainties in black hole masses estimated through observed properties of a high-ionization emission line produced by a carbon ion that is observed in the rest-frame ultra-violet region of the AGN spectrum.  This line is of particular interest for estimating black hole masses in very high-redshift (very distant) AGN but has been known to exhibit various systematic problems in its application to estimating black hole masses that Denney was able to better understand through her work.  In addition, K. D. Denney implemented an educational program with three components: (1) a Summer Astronomy Series for the public hosted by a local library and consisting of a public lecture, inquiry-based, hands-on activities, and star-gazing with portable telescopes, which after the first year, became the most popular Summer program this library offered, (2) mobile inquiry-based astronomy and STEM curriculum lesson boxes that also focused on inter-disciplinary teaching adaptations and were transported to classroom and outreach events on demand, and (3) a telescope lending library available to public schools and scouting groups, etc., for use in the classroom and evening observing activities (e.g., these were used for the library Summer series described above).
