<AbstractNarration>A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students.  Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education.  This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will inform the body of knowledge about the importance and conduct of undergraduate research experiences in recruiting and retaining underrepresented individuals into STEM studies, and preparing the next generation of STEM professionals.   The connection of faculty to research and thereby the students to culturally and geographically relevant research is an important step in retaining students who are more likely to pursue advanced degrees.  For those students entering the STEM workforce directly from a tribal college, it is equally important that they have a well-defined skill set in mathematics, science, and technology.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The overall goal of this project is to model how and why TCUP supported innovations, such as early exposure to research, have contributed to the enhancements of teaching and learning among STEM students in the tribal college.  This proposal builds on prior research conducted in relation to the two TCUP projects conducted at Chief Dull Knife College (CDKC) over the last ten years and addresses key issues concerning tribal college student retention and completion in STEM fields. One of the major findings of the past ten years of TCUP capacity building at the college is that students who are involved with research at the two-year college tend to remain engaged longer in the educational process. The research projects have served as a tool to keep students involved in STEM fields and helped them choose STEM areas for degrees and for workforce placement. The first objective of this work is to increase the number of students choosing STEM majors and continuing in those majors upon transfer to four-year colleges. The Research Engagement Across Curricular Tracks (REACT) project proposed here includes exploring the use of research as a tool for recruitment, retention and success among CDKC students. The second objective is to increase the number of STEM students entering the STEM workforce. The addition of a new Associate of Applied Science degree program to the college addresses this objective and will help students focus their skill sets and fulfill local STEM employer needs. The third objective of this work is to increase number of students choosing STEM majors upon enrollment in the Tribal College. To help accomplish this objective, the college will offer a summer research experience for area high school students. Students will interact with current research and older college age science research interns helping facilitate the transition from secondary school to college STEM programs.</AbstractNarration>
