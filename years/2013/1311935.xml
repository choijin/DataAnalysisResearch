<AbstractNarration>A longstanding problem in astrophysics is to understand how galaxies form and develop throughout their lifetimes.  Such understanding is necessary to uncover how our Universe evolved and to gain insight into the origin of our own Milky Way Galaxy.  One important aspect of understanding galaxy formation and evolution is to decipher how galaxies merge and interact and how such processes affect the formation of new stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a multi-wavelength study of 42 nearby strongly-interacting pre-merger interacting galaxies.  Building on extensive prior data collection, this project will utilize GALEX UV, ground- and space-based optical, Spitzer and Herschel infrared, and VLA 21 cm HI radio observations, and it will compare with a matching control sample of normal spirals.  This study will address questions of star formation triggering in interacting galaxies and in tidal features, compared to those of spiral galaxies.  The PI will use both numerical and analytical models of the interactions and population synthesis models.  The main goal is to study the nature of star formation and its triggering mechanisms in interacting galaxies, and to compare observations with simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will support undergraduate student researchers who will be encouraged to present their results at local and regional conferences.  The PI has a strong history of involving undergraduate students in her research, including a high proportion of female students.  The institution is located near the heart of the southern Appalachian region; so, another broader impact of this award will be to expand high quality science education opportunities to underserved students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Division of Astronomical Sciences and the Office of the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Galaxies like our own home galaxy the Milky Way contain both stars and interstellar gas.  Clouds of interstellar gas in these galaxies occasionally collapse under the force of gravity to form new stars.  This star-forming process is known to be enhanced in galaxies that are strongly interacting with nearby companion galaxies, with interacting galaxies having higher rates of star formation per stellar mass, compared to normal galaxies.  In the current project, a sample of 46 nearby pairs of strongly interacting galaxies were compared with a control sample of 39 normal galaxies.  The interacting galaxies were found to have proportionally more regions with high rates of star formation than the isolated galaxies.  This means that interacting galaxies have more productive star-forming regions (more young stars per area), compared to normal galaxies. The regions in the interacting galaxies also tend to have more interstellar matter, consistent with models that predict pile-up of gas in certain locations in interacting galaxies.  This pile-up of gas thus leads to increased formation of stars.   The regions with the highest rates of star formation were found to contain extremely luminous star clusters, more massive and more luminous than star clusters in normal galaxies.   This result is consistent with theoretical calculations that predict more efficient formation of star clusters in regions with more gas.   This project utilized data from a wide variety of telescopes, including NASA's Spitzer infrared telescope, the Hubble Space Telescope, the ultraviolet Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), and the Chandra X-ray telescope, as well as ground-based telescopes.    A total of 12 undergraduate Physics majors participated in aspects of this research, gaining experience in data analysis, technical writing, computer programming,working with Astronomical archives, and other computer skills.  This research project resulted in five papers published in peer-reviewed Astronomical journals.  Six of the undergraduates were included as co-authors on at least one of these papers.  A total of 16 student research posters based on this research were presented at various undergraduate research conferences.  In addition to presentations at student conferences, two students were lead authors on posters presented at meetings of the American Astronomical Society, and three students were co-authors on posters presents at other professional Astronomical conferences. In addition, five students gave talks on their research at East Tennessee State University.   Three undergraduate Honors theses at ETSU were based on aspects of this research.
