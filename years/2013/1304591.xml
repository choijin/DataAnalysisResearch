<AbstractNarration>The National Geospatial Technology Center of Excellence (GeoTech Center) is a collaboration of two-year colleges, universities, professional organizations, and industry focused on a specialized set of information technologies referred to as Geospatial Information Science and Technology (GIST). The GeoTech Center embraces the opportunity to provide systemic educational change in GIST and assist in the proliferation of successful learners, thereby expanding the field with a well-qualified workforce having a recognized set of industry-defined skills and competencies. The goals of the GeoTech Center are to: 1) Build a Community of Practice focused on GIST by forging relationships between professionals from industry, government and academia; 2) Create and disseminate relevant GIST Curricula and pedagogical tools based upon the current needs of the geospatial industry and the expanding community of ancillary users; 3) Facilitate professional development by offering faculty access to innovative teaching strategies, insight into GIST in related STEM fields, and tools to address differing learning modalities; 4) Provide resources to include a national map of programs, GIST competency assessments, model courses, programs, and additional services through the GeoTech Center Clearinghouse; and 5) Support student success in GIST through the creation of competency protocols, career pathways, and career clusters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GIST field is important to a variety of industries and therefore it is important to have an educational leader that can meet its existing and changing workforce demands. This Center builds upon previous work and clearly outlines the next steps that are needed, including developing pedagogical methods, in-depth curricular content, and student and faculty resources.  These efforts create a community of practice focused on Geospatial Information Science and Technology, as it brings educators together to work on industry-defined needs and demonstrate a broad, national impact on education that will help the US remain globally competitive as essential core needs of the GIST industry are achieved.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The National Geospatial Technology Center of Excellence (GeoTech Center) has the mission to increase the number of two-year colleges offering Geospatial Technology courses which align to the Geospatial Technology Competency Model (GTCM) which the GeoTech Center created for the U.S. Department of Labor (DoL).  The GeoTech Center accomplished the following items to fulfill its mission:  Updated and published the GTCM in 2014 in conjunction with the Department of Labor.  The GTCM lays out competencies that incumbent and future employees should have to work as a geospatial technician, technologist or scientist and related fields of study. Developed a MetaDACUM based on the DACUM research that had been accomplished by this and previous grants.  The DACUM process assists in the development of a curriculum based upon what members of the working community describe as their tasks. Created ten model courses, which was accomplished by a group of educators based on the GeoTech Center Program Content Tool which was developed based upon the work for the GTCM and DACUMs. Producing professional development for educators was a prime activity of the GeoTech Center.  Without an in-depth understanding of the subject matter the ability to instruct students in this evolving technology is limited.  The GeoEd conferences were held in Louisville and the geospatial workshops were held in San Diego each summer.  The San Diego event was a single topic workshop covered in-depth.  The GeoEd conference contained both topical exploration and conference sessions. Maintained and curated the National Map of Geospatial programs of colleges and universities. Disseminated educational and workforce information, via the GeoTech Center Newsletters, presentations at professional development activities and the creation of webinars.  The GeoTech Center maintains a website for all things related to geospatial technologies. Established and cultivated a community of practice which has grown to approximately 2000 members. Created Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) with various professional organization so that the work of the GeoTech Center is done in a collaboration with other members of the geospatial community. Created a self-assessment tool so that people can judge their knowledge of geospatial technology.  This online tool was created and made available at no cost to members of the community. A veteran's crosswalk was created to assist this population in earning credit for their prior experiences.        Last Modified: 09/25/2020       Submitted by: Vince A Dinoto]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
