<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The Transantarctic Mountains (TAM) encompasses exposures of Antarctic bedrock that provide a history of Antarctic continental evolution. The TAM also creates microhabitats for extremophiles and hosts unconsolidated sedimentary deposits that record the history of the ice sheet and Antarctica?s changing climate. Much less is known of the extant faunal and floral assemblages, climate, or geophysics of this region. The PI proposes a workshop to facilitate the gathering of multi disciplinary researchers to exchange ideas for investigating processes that are occurring or that have occurred in the TAM. This workshop will take place in September 2013 in Minneapolis and will be locally organized by Polar Geospatial Center.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;TAM researchers come from diverse fields in geoscience, atmospheric and climate science, glaciology, and ecology and evolutionary science. This workshop will encourage the participation of graduate students, post-docs, and early career researchers and the organizing committee will strive to include a diverse group of participants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to organize an interdisciplinary Antarctic research meeting. And to determine the current status of the Antarctic research and chart directions for future. The third goal was to challenge the participants to look at the Antarctic research as not only their own narrow problem solving task, but as a bigger venture aimed at breakthroughs through collaboration and interdisciplinary collaboration.      All the above tasks are important since no currently existing venue serves the varied community that is spread  under many disciplinary meetings (biology, geology, atmospheric science&hellip;) or cannot gather in large meetings during Antarctic field season (American Geophysical meeting in December).      The first meeting under this funding was organized in Minneapolis, MN in 2013. This meeting included presentations and interactions from all main disciplines active in Antarctic research. The community worked on the breakthrough challenges and a community report was published and distributed in 2014. A second interdisciplinary Antarctic research meeting was organized in Loveland, CO, in 2015.      The two meetings and the community document have helped to consolidate the community and build broader understanding of the goals and objectives in various disciplines. The document charted the way to collaboration and is aiming at breakthroughs in the area of Antarctic research not bound by disciplinary boundaries.
