<AbstractNarration>The University of Wisconsin, River Falls  GREAT (Graduate, Retain, Engage, Advise, Team learning) Falcon Project is designed to increase the number of graduates in Biology, Chemistry, Geology, Environmental Science, Physics, and Mathematics. The project targets students in their first two years, using proven strategies to increase student success and support to increase the retention of STEM students.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The GREAT Falcon Project takes a three-fold approach to improve STEM retention, progression, and graduation rates. First, faculty are implementing student-centered pedagogies such as research-based laboratories, Studio Physics, and Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning to increase student engagement and success in gateway STEM courses. Several of these teaching strategies are making extensive use of a new high-technology Active Learning Classroom. Second, Peer-Led Team Learning is utilized in key bottleneck courses in Chemistry and Mathematics to teach students the problem-solving skills needed in STEM. Finally, a hybrid advising system helps STEM students with academic, social, and/or financial issues. Students showing risk factors for continued retention are contacted by a retention specialist/mentor, with appropriate interventions scheduled as needed. Students who leave STEM majors and/or the university are interviewed to assess why they are leaving.  The GREAT Falcon Project directly impacts 900 students per year in STEM majors and is designed to increase the number of STEM graduates by 40 per year (from the current 130 to 170 students per year) by the end of the grant period.</AbstractNarration>
