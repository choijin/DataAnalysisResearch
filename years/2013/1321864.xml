<AbstractNarration>The NRCs Board on Science Education requests co-funding from NSF (other funders are The College Board and Burroughs Wellcome Fund) to convene an expert meeting that will be a first step toward creating a systems-level evaluation and implementation plan for the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).  Specifically, through short commissioned papers and a day-long meeting, a roadmap for implemention of the NGSS that identifies barriers and opportunities will be developed.  It is anticipated that this will provide the backdrop for a more extensive NRC Roundtable activity.</AbstractNarration>
