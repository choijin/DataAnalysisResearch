<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the National Science Foundation, Professor Eike B. Bauer of the University of Missouri - St. Louis will investigate chiral-at-metal allenylidene complexes as intermediates for enantioselective catalytic propargylic substitution reactions, in which the -OR functionality of propargylic alcohols or their derivatives is replaced by nucleophiles. The chemistry of chiral-at-metal allenylidene complexes [Ru*=C=C=CRR'] will be developed, which are potential intermediates in propargylic substitutions. This approach will utilize stereogenic metal centers as the source of chiral information for stereoinduction in these reactions. The impact of varying electron densities at the metal center and of the oxidation of stable Ru complex precursors on their catalytic reactivity will be studied. The direct evidence for allenylidene intermediates by ESI-MS measurements will also be sought. The research will add to our understanding of chiral-at-metal allenylidene complexes and their use in organic transformations. The research will be performed with the aid of graduate, undergraduate and local high school students, which will educate the next generation of chemists (and related professionals) to serve the needs of industry and the educational system on all levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conservation of energy and resources has become an important aim of chemical research and production. Catalysts are compounds frequently employed in the synthesis of chemicals that can speed chemical reactions and allow for reactions to be performed without employing heat, thereby saving energy and resources, both in industrial and academic settings. The project proposes the investigation of novel catalyst systems based on the metal ruthenium that are designed to promote chemical reactions with potential applications in pharmaceutical industry. The research is directed towards saving resources and energy in chemical production while providing a new tool for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals.</AbstractNarration>
