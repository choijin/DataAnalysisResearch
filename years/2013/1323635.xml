<AbstractNarration>PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS: &lt;br/&gt;Arizona State University (ASU - Lead)&lt;br/&gt;University of Virginia (UVA)&lt;br/&gt;University of Notre Dame (ND)&lt;br/&gt;University of the Pacific (UOP)&lt;br/&gt;Colorado State University (CSU)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT DESCRIPTION &lt;br/&gt;This project is developing and evaluating a computer-aided tutoring system to support the teaching of elementary linear circuit analysis. It is expanding a prototype system to cover topics in a traditional two-semester linear circuits course. The system can generate circuit problems with random topologies and element values for DC, steady-state AC, and transient circuits; allowing students to study concepts related to Fourier analysis, Laplace transforms, Bode plots, and three-phase circuits. Problem solutions are produced using a variety of special pedagogical features, including exercises designed to correct common student misconceptions. The system accepts a rich variety of inputs such as equations, re-drawn circuit diagrams, waveform sketches, matrix equations, as well as conventional numerical and multiple-choice answers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The web-based system is being employed and evaluated in a variety of ways in linear circuit classes at ASU, UVA, ND, and UOP. Dr. Daniel Robinson (at CSU) is conducting rigorous evaluation and analysis of the resulting qualitative and quantitative student learning data collected at these institutions. Through testing the software system in a variety of public and private schools, the team is demonstrating that the system can provide rapid feedback to instructors and enhance student learning - in areas that students have the most difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER SIGNIFICANCE &lt;br/&gt;The project is directly impacting more than 4300 students and having a significant effect on engineering education, since many engineering students in various disciplines take circuits courses. It is also expected that the system will be highly suitable for incorporation into massive open on-line courses (MOOCs) addressing this subject area. Student engagement is being increased through the use of interactive exercises that provide rapid feedback to students at each step of a problem. The team is also developing a tutorial authoring interface and execution engine that allows tutorial writers (e.g., instructors) to design more effective tutoring sequences by using the features of the circuit generation and solution modules. The approach is adaptable to other subject areas in electrical engineering, as well as other engineering disciplines. Some of the simpler tutorials and modules on basic circuit properties are being made available to high school students and the general public via a website designed for that purpose.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on the assessment of a new software tutorial system developed at Arizona State University.  Over a three year period, the web-based system entitled ?Circuit Tutor? was tested at University of the Pacific.  The system was designed to help students with difficult concepts in an introductory electrical circuit course which is primarily taken by electrical and mechanical engineering students in their 2nd year.  The system included both web-based tutorials and interactive exercises.      Several assessment methods were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the system.  Student performance was recorded and tracked in the system, and compared to in-class assessments.  Student feedback was collected regarding their experience with the system compared to traditional and on-line homework system (such as Wiley Plus).  In addition to student assessments, beta testing of new instructional modules was also conducted by the University of the Pacific.      The data collected at University of the Pacific was combined with other institutions, and the effectiveness of this instructional software system was published in several articles at the American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE) Conference proceedings, and in the proceedings of the Frontiers in Education Conference.  Student performance on key topics such as node and phasor analysis was higher for students using the Circuit Tutor.  Also, student?s preferred using the ?Circuit Tutor? system compared to traditional homework.          Last Modified: 11/29/2016       Submitted by: Jennifer T Ross]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
