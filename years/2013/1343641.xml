<AbstractNarration>1343641&lt;br/&gt;Chen&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this NSF/FDA Scholar-in-Residence proposal is to advance the development of phantom-based test methods and computational tools for elucidating and evaluating the performance of novel NIR oximetry devices. This will involve: 1) Development and validation of a portable NIRS system; 2) Characterization of the tissue optics of the main phantom material specified in the IEC/ISO fNIRS draft standard and evaluation of its use as a matrix material for tissue-simulating phantoms, based on homogeneous slabs and samples with vessel-like inclusions; 3) Development of 3D printed phantoms based on the acquired vascular network volume; and 4) Development and implementation of a 3D model of light propagation based on the vascular network volume to study the effect of device and tissue parameters on&lt;br/&gt;sampling sensitivity.</AbstractNarration>

NIRS has been successfully translated into clinical use in monitoring tissue blood oxygen content, particularly in brain and muscle.
