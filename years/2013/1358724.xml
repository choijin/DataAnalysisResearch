<AbstractNarration>No variety of U.S. English has received more attention by researchers, the media, or the public than that spoken by African Americans.  The place of African American English, and the language of African American children in the American social landscape has often been the source of controversy, kindling far ranging debates about such topics as equity in educational policies and practices and linguistic profiling in housing discrimination.  Researchers of American English have also long debated the historical origins of African American English and the ongoing relationship between language varieties spoken by African Americans and those spoken by their European American neighbors.  Studies have long demonstrated the systematic and rule-governed nature of vernacular African American English, and other non-standard language varieties more generally, yet important questions remain about the origin of African American English varieties, their current and future development, and their relationships to regional European American and other socioethnic varieties.  At the same time, important social and educational applications of enhanced knowledge persist about the nature of and socioeducational implications related to non-standard varieties in general and African American English in particular.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the major hurdles in developing better knowledge about African American English is the lack of publicly available data and detailed information about the variety.  Very little research data are available to scholars and educators beyond those data they collect privately for their own purposes.  This award supports the creation of the first public corpus of African American English.  Through the award, researchers are building a large collection of linguistically annotated spoken language data along with publicly oriented web-based resources.  These resources will enable a wide-range of researchers, as well as the public, to more robustly understand the variety.  Corpora such as these are also important for developing language technologies, such as speech-to-text software, and lead to better human-computer interaction.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[African American Language (AAL) is the most researched, the most publicly recognized, and most controversial set of language varieties in the United States. However, until this project, no primary data have been publicly available for research and education on these varieties and very little data has been shared widely across research groups. This grant-supported project substantially expanded the available resources for research, education, and outreach on AAL in ways of significance to both scholars and the public. It ensures, for the first time, the wide availability of primary, spoken AAL data, and it has already enlarged the research base on this critical variety, supporting work by a wide range of linguists, educators, speech technologists, and others.  This project had, and achieved, three interconnected goals: (i) It developed the Corpus of Regional African American Language (CORAAL), the first public corpus of language from African American communities in the U.S. (ii) In addition to the corpus, it developed a publicly oriented website, Online Resources for African American Language (ORAAL; https://oraal.uoregon.edu), to serve as a clearing house for up-to-date information for researchers, educators, and the general public on African American Language and language diversity in the U.S. more generally. (iii) It brought together researchers and educators to advance data sharing and the larger understanding of African American Language through conference activities and a special issue of a journal. The creation of CORAAL has greatly expanded the spoken language data available for research and education about AAL and other minoritized dialects of American English.  In addition to research by the project team (e.g. Farrington 2019, McLarty et al. 2019, Quartey &amp; Schilling 2019, Kendall et al. 2021) and by other sociolinguists (Cukor-Avila et al. 2019, Holliday 2019, Tanner et al. 2020), and growing classroom use, the corpus is becoming widely used by speech technologists.  CORAAL is being used by numerous research groups and technology developers to advance speech recognition and other natural language processing technologies in ways that promote greater fairness across society (see e.g.  Dorn 2019, Huang et al. 2020, Koenecke et al. 2020).  The project also supported educational activities at the project's home institution, involving 10 undergraduate research assistants, who gained important STEM skills through project activities.  Finally, by engaging deeply and publicly in the management and preservation of audio data the project also serves as a case study for open-access data, data sharing, and other data management outcomes from NSF-funded linguistic research (Kendall &amp; Farrington 2021).
