<AbstractNarration>In our layered atmosphere, gravity (or internal) waves are quasi-periodic disturbances most familiar as the wave-like cloud patterns, such as observed in the lee of mountain ranges.  This project seeks to experimentally investigate the role of the atmospheric gravity waves in ionosphere-troposphere coupling. In particular, the dynamics of plasma density irregularities in the ionospheric F region, and the connection of  these irregularities with atmospheric gravity waves will be investigated. The investigation is to take place in Antarctica as: 1) Large numbers of gravity waves may be observed there, and 2) The electromagnetic background there is quiet, important for detection of radio signals to be observed in this study. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To detect the density irregularities a HF receiver and transmitter will be placed at two different locations in Antarctica, probing the ionosphere along the passage between these two points. Numerical modelling will be used to describe parameters of the troposphere below the ionospheric path of the HF signal. The HF signal will give information about density irregularities, and the numerical model will give information about gravity waves in the troposphere. By comparing information of numerical model and from HF observations the investigators will be able to make conclusions about simultaneous occurrences of irregularities in the ionospheric plasma and gravity waves.</AbstractNarration>
