<AbstractNarration>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) translate signals recorded from the brain into useful outputs such as control of the movement of a computer cursor, selection of letters or icons on a computer screen, or even operation of a neuroprosthesis. Thus, BCI technology is a potentially powerful communication and control option for people with severe motor disabilities or disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brainstem stroke, cerebral palsy, and spinal cord injury, who may have little or even no muscle control and therefore no means of communication with the external world.  The success of this exciting work depends on close and productive multidisciplinary interactions among researchers working in neuroscience, psychology, engineering, mathematics, computer science, and clinical rehabilitation.  Because no standard venue existed to bring these groups together to share results, to exchange ideas, and to develop the requisite close and productive collaborations, the NIH sponsored and the Wadsworth Center in Albany NY organized the First International BCI Meeting in 1999, which was followed by additional meetings in 2002, 2005 and 2010.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is funding to support the Fifth International BCI Meeting, which will be held June 3-7, 2013, in Asilomar, California.  Because of the growth in the field of BCI research 300 or more participants are expected to attend, including investigators from at least 100 BCI research groups.  All attendees commit to the entire meeting, from the opening reception and dinner on the evening of Monday, June 3, through the final summary discussion at breakfast the morning of Friday, June 7.  The schedule for the days in between includes, on Tuesday morning, brief summaries scientific and technical advances by representatives of selected BCI labs.  Tuesday afternoon includes innovative applications and protocols for BCIs, as well as a panel on BCI performance metrics. Wednesday starts with a special breakfast for women in the BCI field, and continues with a session on Clinical Translation and Dissemination.  After a poster and demo session, there will be a Town Hall meeting focused on forming a BCI Society.  On Thursday up to 15 workshops proposed by researchers in the BCI field will run concurrently, each workshop to combine invited talks, targeted discussion, and sharply focused debates. Thursday's sessions will conclude with a discussion of the State of the Art and future workshops for BCI technologies.  On Friday morning there will be a plenary session of all meeting attendees, in which leaders of each workshop will present a 15-minute summary presentation.  The primary source of funding for the meeting will once again be the National Institutes of Health.  NSF funds will enable the conference organizers to support about 30 additional students (including undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows), to attend and participate in a special pre-conference seminar as well as the conference itself.  More information about the conference may be found online at http://bcimeeting.org/2013/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  Students will be encouraged to participate in all aspects of the conference.  The laboratory research reports of the first day will expose them to the breadth and variety of BCI research going on around the world.  The informal workshops will familiarize them with the issues now being addressed on the cutting edge of the research and with the different viewpoints on those issues.  Students will assist in workshop planning; participate in the workshop discussions; and may assist in the preparation of summary reports.  In preparation for the main meeting, a special colloquium will be held for students on the afternoon of June 3 with the purpose of presenting a big picture, as well as filling in gaps in their understanding before they move into specialized sessions on various aspects of the field.  On Monday and Wednesday afternoons, students will attend special "talk back" sessions where established researchers will be available to answer questions and to lead discussions.  Students and post-doctoral fellows will present posters on their research, which will be judged by a panel of senior BCI researchers on the basis of innovation and scientific or technical merit.  With all participants housed on site and all meals for all attendees taken together on site, there will be ample opportunity for informal discussions.  This creates a unique opportunity for students and trainees to mingle with and learn from established researchers.  Student participation is a critical feature of the BCI meetings, allowing students to meet potential mentors and collaborators.  Many students who attended the first four BCI meetings have gone on to pursue BCI as their chosen field of research.  The PI will make a special effort to encourage participation by members of traditionally underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The 5th International Brain-Computer Interface Meeting - Outcomes  The 5th International Brain-Computer Interface Meeting was held June 3rd through 7 at the Asilomar Conference Grounds in Pacific Grove, California.   The NSF funding provided through this grant provided programs and services for 114 student attendees, described below. National Science Foundation (NSF) Student Colloquium  The NSF Student Colloquium was held Monday June 3, 1:30 - 6:00 pm with a provided lunch.  The colloquium featured four presentations giving an overview of the field and providing preparation for the specialized sessions that are the focus of the main meeting.  The lecturers were Jonathan Wolpaw (Wadsworth Center), Jonathan Viventi (New York University), Aysegul Gunduz (University of Florida), and Emanuel Donchin (University of South Florida).  A total of 45 students attended the NSF Student Colloquium and were therefore eligible for travel assistance of $500 each.     Student Travel Assistance  Travel assistance was provided to students through a number of mechanisms.  These included $1000 merit based travel awards (23 awarded), $500 need-based travel awards (3 awarded), and $500 awards based on participation in the NSF Student Colloquium (45 awarded).     Special Student Housing Rate  A special housing rate was made available for students in quad-occupancy housing.     Lunch with Leaders  The general structure of the BCI Meeting, with joint buffet-style meals provides a lot of time for interaction between students and leaders.  However, the Lunch with Leaders event was designed to provide an arranged opportunity for students to interact with leaders in the BCI field, overcoming inhibitions the students may feel about approaching leaders in the field.  Leaders were nominated by the students.  The Lunch with Leaders event was held on three days, providing opportunities to interact with multiple leaders.  The Lunch with Leaders event had 88 registrants.  These were coordinated across the three days to provide 195 student interactions with leaders:  Day 1:  89 names at 9 tables (18 leaders, 71 students)  Day 2: 80 names at 8 tables (19 leaders, 61 students)  Day 3: 79 names at 8 tables (15 leaders, 64 students)       Women of BCI Breakfast  The Women of BCI Breakfast provided an informal interaction time for women in the BCI community, both students and established researchers, to interact over a meal.  There were 67 women who signed up for this event.     Poster Presentations and Competition     There were 205 submitted 2-page papers.  Of these, 189 were accepted and 188 were published in the conference proceedings (after 1 paper was withdrawn).  The program committee selected 25 papers for oral presentation.  Oral presenters had the option of also presenting a poster, so there were 181 poster presentations.      Of the students registered, 70% had presentations. Four awards made from among 80 poster and 15 oral presentations made by undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs:  $750 for best overall poster  $750 for best oral presentation  $250 for best technical work, poster presentation  $250 for most innovative work, poster presentation    Outputs Publications  There will be two special issue journals published from the BCI Meeting.  These special issues are still in production, so final results are not available.  There were 47 submissions to the Journal of Neural Engineering and 14 submissions to the Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.  Final counts of accepted manuscripts are not yet available.  In addition, a summary of the 19 workshops of the BCI Meeting has been published:     Huggins JE, Guger C, Allison B, Anderson CW, Batista A, Brouwer A-M, Brunner C, Chavarriaga R, Fried-Oken M, Gunduz A, Gupta D, K&uuml;bler A, Leeb R, Lotte F, Miller LE, M&uuml;ller-Putz G, Rutkowski T, Tangermann M, Thompson DE.
