<AbstractNarration>This cross-cultural research investigates cultural models (CMs) of nature held by populations across several cultures and five continents ranging from long-time primary food producers, e.g., farmers, fishermen, herders (and also hunters and gatherers) to those who recently shifted to become primary food consumers due to globalization forces. CMs of nature, typically held out of one's or a community's awareness, affect environmental actions in ways not necessarily predicted by more traditional ecological models. The project comprises fifteen scholars and six graduate students who are experts in a particular cultural area. Linguistic and experimental data will be collected and analyzed by a common protocol that combines qualitative and quantitative approaches. Methodology and ethnography play paramount roles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers expect to discover a variety of CMs of nature that characterize each community investigated. These CMs represent specific organizations of the constitutive categories underlying the concept of nature, that is, humans, animals, plants, weather, physical environment, and the supernatural. They also expect causal relationships to be one of the major forces (in addition to spatial relationships) weaving together these categories. Similarly, while attributed to different elements and in a different potency, intentionality will be universally present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results, because of the focus on primary food producers, will provide insights on how this kind of population typically constructs a CM of nature. In addition, one can explore the possibility that conceptions of space are central to the construction of CMs (in this case, of nature), thus, provide supporting evidence for an architecture of the mind that includes a major role for the spatial domain in the forming of other domains of knowledge. Finally and more importantly, the findings are intended to supply policy makers, i.e., major actors in finding solutions to climate change induced problems, with information on indigenous CMs of nature that will assist them in their decision-making.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Executive Summary  The aim of this report was to investigate the cultural model of nature held by the Gusii people of southwestern Kenya. Data for this research was collected by the administration of semi-structured interviews, animals-in-a-row tasks, and walks in nature were conducted to collect required data. The preliminary results indicate that the Gusii hold an absolute frame of reference, and that their cultural model of nature reflects a mix of mystical and scientific causal relationships.     Introduction  Primary food producers hold views about nature and the environment, i.e., cultural models of nature (CMs) on how they are related to, affected by, and must adapt to changes in that environment. These cultural models influence human action on the environment in ways not necessarily predicted by more traditional ecological models. Yes, there have been publications that have given insight into a better understanding of local/indigenous knowledge, including beliefs about nature. Yet, most of this literature lacks a deeper insight into how nature is conceptualized in ways that are out-of-awareness, as most of our knowledge is. This research set out to fill that void.  Moreover, the definition of a good number of cultural models of nature in communities all over the world opens the possibility of investigating a significant aspect of human cognition, the role played by space. It was hypothesized that a preferential way in organizing the representation of spatial relationships, e.g., use of relative or absolute or radial frame of reference can play a salient role in the organization of cultural models of nature.     Methods  Data for this research was collected by observations of Gusii landscape and its agricultural use, administration of semi-structured interviews and elicitation of "free listing" and "animals in a row."  From observations of the landscapes of a large section of Gusiiland, the investigator observed the layout of homesteads and patterns of agricultural use of the land. He then administered semi-structured interviews to 18 randomly selected respondents (9 male, 9 female; aged 30-80 years; level of education: 0- 12 years of school). At the end of each semi-structured interview, he asked each respondent to mention any five objects of nature that came to their mind. These proceedings were audio-recorded and later transcribed.  Finally, the investigator administered "animals-in-a-row" task to 18 other randomly selected individuals (9 females, 9 males; aged 30-72; level of education: 0-12 years of school).  Each respondent was asked to observe investigator arrange three stone-carved animals &ndash; a cow, a sheep, and a donkey &ndash; in a row on a table and then remember the position occupied by each animal in that row. After a small while (about a minute or two), the respondent was given the animals to arrange them on a second table (that was 180 degrees in position to the first table) in the exact order s/he saw them. Each respondent was asked to arrange the animals five times.     Results  Analysis of the data collected for this research is ongoing. These are preliminary results:  It was observed that the hilly and fertile Gusiiland is densely populated; every tract of land is intensely utilized for mixed farming. In some cases, even roadsides are encroached upon and used by adjacent landowners to grow Napier grass. Each tract of land displayed a fairly uniform layout: homesteads at or near one end of the land, then a front and/or back yard for livestock, then subsistence or cash crops and, finally, forage and trees (for fuel or timber) at the other end of the land tract. Each house has two main entrances: the first one that faces the valley or stream end of the land tract; the other that is at right angles to the first one. Each of these entrances serves specific cultural functions and defines WHO may enter the house through which entrance. This is so irrespective of from what direction, in respect to the h...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
