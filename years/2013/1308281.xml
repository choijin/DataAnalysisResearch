<AbstractNarration>The generation and applications of entangled optical quantum states (i.e. the optical fields displaying correlations beyond those allowed by classical physics) is one of the recently recognized challenges in quantum optics. The intellectual merit of this project is to demonstrate a new approach for generation of a complete set of special fundamental non-classical states of an optical field, called Bell states, in which polarizations of two optical fields with close frequencies become quantum-mechanically entangled. Such Bell states are produced via nonlinear interaction of resonant light with Rubidium vapor. They form a natural basis for characterization and manipulation of quantum entanglement, and thus the findings will stimulate new developments in practical realizations of both quantum information protocols and in quantum-enhanced optical sensors.  They will also be potentially transferrable to many other coherent systems (atomic/ionic, solid-state and photonic), with warm rubidium vapor serving as a prototype interaction.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project offers a rich spectrum of educational opportunities by engaging graduate and undergraduate students in meaningful scientific research. Particular emphasis will be placed in attracting female and minority students, with the PI serving as a mentor and as a role model. Added educational benefits arise from adapting components of the experiments for advanced laboratory classes, and development of exciting demonstrations and public events for broader community.</AbstractNarration>

We have investigated the behavior of such quantum-correlated optical fields in case of input strong pump laser and weak probe laser having phase singularities, called topological charge (i.e., when the phase of the electromagnetic fields varied azimuthally by integer of 2 pi).
