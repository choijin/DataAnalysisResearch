<AbstractNarration>GENI, the Global Environment for Network Innovations, is a suite of research infrastructure rapidly taking shape in prototype form across the United States. GENI aims to transform experimental research in networking and distributed systems, as well as emerging research into very large social-technical systems, by providing a suite of infrastructure for "at scale" experiments in future internets. Nationwide experiments began in Summer 2010. In the intervening three years, GENI has shown rapid growth in adoption by experimental researchers and is now expanding to over 50 GENI-enabled campuses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will implement four coordinated thrusts that consolidate important GENI gains and advance the maturity of GENI as it progresses through its "at scale" deployment phase. This work positions GENI to be maintainable, expandable, and broadly usable for research and energizes the GENI community to sustain the powerful growth momentum that is carrying GENI forward.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;* Build and deploy experimenter tools that make GENI easier to use for a growing community. &lt;br/&gt;* Create processes and institutions to carry GENI into the future. &lt;br/&gt;* Stretch and test GENI's experimental capabilities. &lt;br/&gt;* Introduce GENI to industry, research leaders, and students through direct engagements that make GENI relevant in their work by partnering with product developers and service providers and by bringing GENI-based curriculum into college and university classrooms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GENI allows academic and industrial researchers to perform a new class of experiments that tackle critically important issues in global communications networks, issues such as our ability to understand or predict the behavior of complex, large-scale networks, issues associated with the barriers to innovation in the current Internet, and issues related to the resilience and trust needed of our critical infrastructures. GENI is emerging as the prototype of a system for deploying and managing custom combinations of computation and communication. As such it is potentially a model for the next generation of commercial network infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Note: GENI is supported by multiple NSF awards. This outcomes report summarizes overall GENI-related outcomes. The specific work of this award, "Solicitation 4 Design and Prototyping," addresses the expansion of GENI capabilities through tool development, experimenter outreach, and larger-scale experimentation. GENI's Goals The Global Environment for Network Innovations - GENI - is a suite of research infrastructure that comprises a distributed laboratory deployed across the United States. (See Figure 1.) GENI aims to transform experimental research in networking and distributed systems by providing a suite of infrastructure for "at-scale" experiments in future internets. GENI supports a wide variety of experiments, including the following:  Experiments ranging from small to "at-scale" experiments. Both experiments that are compatible and experiments that are incompatible with today?s Internet. Not only controlled, repeatable experiments, which which will greatly help improve our scientific understanding of complex, large-scale networks, but also trials of experimental services that ride atop or connect to today?s Internet and that engage large numbers of users. A variety of classroom and research experiments.  Although GENI?s goal is to support "at-scale" experiments on future internets, our plan has never been to build a separate, parallel set of infrastructure "as big as the Internet," which is clearly infeasible. Instead, the approach has been to "GENI-enable" existing testbeds, campuses, regional and backbone networks, cloud computation services, and commercial equipment to be programmable, virtualized and sliceable, so that they can support end-to-end experiments.  GENI's Results GENI has addressed its initial purpose of supporting innovative research, and it has gone beyond these goals in a number of ways. The GENI project office and the GENI community have built GENI with an initial at-scale deployment now in place. GENI?s use in the classroom is lowering the barrier for laboratory-based learning in computer science education. It is increasingly finding application in data- and compute-intensive domain sciences. Furthermore, GENI infrastructure is supporting advanced application development in areas of societal impact, through initiatives such as US Ignite. (See Figures 2 and 3.) GENI continues to see explosive growth in usage for both research and education &ndash; over 12,000 unique users have turned to GENI, allocating over a third of a million GENI configurations. (See Figure 4.) GENI?s user base reaches more than 180 US universities and over 30 countries. (See Figure 5.) Under this award, the GENI community greatly expanded GENI?s tool base as well as experimenter and educator resources. These new capabilities proved extremely effective when combined with GENI?s nationwide deployment, incorporating sixty GENI racks and twenty-four GENI wireless base stations at universities, regional and backbone networks, and partner institutions across the US. GENI hardware and concepts are increasingly extending beyond GENI proper and being integrated with campus scientific computing infrastructure. More researchers from the GENI community are publishing their results &ndash; the bibliography of GENI-relevant publications now includes over 350 entries.  Educators continue to develop GENI-based curriculum and employ GENI in their classrooms. In the most recent complete academic year (2016-2017), instructors used GENI in at least 47 different courses with total enrollment of over 1400 students.   This award also developed and fielded in GENI the first functional software-defined exchanges (SDXs). These prototypes provide a valuable proof-of-concept environment that has paved the way for additional SDX research, including national and international interoperability, even while fostering the continuing development of competing and complementary SDX concepts. Future Directions The GENI community and GENI technology are playing a vital role in leading the development of research cyberinfrastructure. Key GENI concepts are increasingly embedded into new projects, such as the NSF Future Cloud research platform. Similarly, the central GENI notions of slicability and deep programmability are finding their way into future internet and distributed cloud research testbeds worldwide. (See Figure 6.)
