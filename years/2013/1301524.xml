<AbstractNarration>Evidence increasingly demonstrates that selective removal of marine life can induce restructuring of marine food webs. Trophic structure is the central component of mass balance models, widely used tools to evaluate fisheries in an ecosystem context. Food web structure is commonly determined by stomach contents or by bulk tissue stable isotope analyses, both of which are limited in terms of resolution and versatility. The investigators will refine a tool, Amino Acid Compound-Specific Isotopic Analyses (AA-CSIA), which can be broadly applicable for quantifying the time-integrated trophic position (TP) of consumers. Differences in source and trophic nitrogen isotopic composition for specific amino acids will provide an unambiguous and integrated measure of fractional trophic TP across multiple phyla, regardless of an animal's physiological condition or of the biogeochemical cycling at the base of the food web. AA-CSIA will allow testing of the efficacy of trophic position estimates derived from ecosystem-based models and promote the evolution of these models into decision-support tools. This project has three goals: 1. To validate the application of AA-CSIA across multiple marine phyla under differing physiological conditions. 2. To compare the application of AA-CSIA across systems with contrasting biogeochemical cycling regimes. 3. To develop the use of AA-CSIA TP estimates for validating trophic models of exploited ecosystems.  The investigators will test and refine the approach using a combination of laboratory feeding experiments and field studies across regions with differing biogeochemical cycling regimes. They will determine the applicability of the AA-CSIA approach in a variety of marine organisms assessed in controlled studies. Subsequently, ecosystem components will be sampled from the eastern tropical Pacific, coastal California and the subtropical Pacific gyre. They will also test the effects of sample preservation on the isotopic composition of individual AA to determine whether the approach can be used on archived samples. This tool will allow testing of the efficacy of ecosystem-based models currently used to gain insight into the ecological effects of fisheries removals and improve the reliability of future models required to manage marine resources. In addition to the goal of developing AA-CSIA for use as a TP indicator, the information obtained through this project will provide important species-specific biological data on the feeding behavior of marine organisms that could have implications for their resilience to anthropogenic pressures and climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will have direct application to evaluating ecosystem effects of fisheries by providing an unbiased, integrated and independent approach to&lt;br/&gt;estimating trophic structure, and a method by which to validate existing ecosystem-based model outputs and predictions. In addition, the project will have outreach benefits through the involvement of graduate and undergraduate students, and exposure of younger students through K-12 programs. This research will contribute to the greater understanding of the biology of locally important fish species as well as globally important shrimp and endangered marine turtles.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the one year NCE period (8/2013 - 7/2014) the Hawaii Pacific University team completed and submitted a manuscript entitled "Nitrogen isotope fractionation and amino acid turnover rates in the Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei" to Marine Ecology Progress Series.  The authors of this manuscript are CAMEO co-Investigators Brian Popp and Carolyn Holl and Holl's graduate student, Eileen Downs.  Eileen Downs is the first author on this manuscript and, as such, led the team in writing and editing the manuscript.  The manuscript is a portion of her MasterÆs thesis which was entitled "The use of compound-specific isotope analysis to elucidate dietary nitrogen sources and trophic position in the Hawaiian bobtail squid (Euprymna scolopes) and Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei)."  She successfully defended this thesis in the spring of 2013.  The reviews from MEPS were very favorable and minor revisions were completed in July 2014.  We just got word on September 2, 2014 that this manuscript, a first for Downs, was fully accepted and is in press at MEPS.   ABSTRACT: Fluctuations in an animalÆs trophic position (TP) can indicate changes within an ecosystem. Traditionally, bulk tissue or whole animal nitrogen (N) isotope analysis has been used to determine an animalÆs TP but there are limitations to the application of this approach. Amino acid compound-specific isotope analysis (AA-CSIA) can be used to determine TP based on the difference between the &delta;15N values of certain amino acids, commonly glutamic acid and phenylalanine. The rate at which 15N is incorporated into amino acids is largely unknown and this may affect the accuracy of relative TP estimates especially during periods of ecosystem change or ontogenetic changes in diet. To study amino acid turnover rates, the diet of the Pacific white shrimp, Litopenaeus vannamei, was changed in the laboratory from an unlabeled diet (7.2&permil;) to a 15N-enriched diet (24&permil;) and animals were sampled over the course of seven weeks. AA-CSIA revealed that turnover times of amino acids vary considerably with some amino acids having much more rapid turnover than others. The TP of L. vannamei (using &delta;15N values of glutamic acid and phenylalanine) over the course of the experiment remained constant and shrimp TP averaged 2.14 &plusmn; 0.15 (mean &plusmn; SD, n=7) relative to its diet, which was as expected. Our results indicate that the &delta;15N values of glutamic acid and phenylalanine can be used to accurately determine TP even while shrimp are undergoing a change to a diet with a different &delta;15N value.    This CAMEO grant provided an important research opportunity for Eileen Downs who has now successfully gone on to the School of Veterinary Medicine at Michigan State University.
