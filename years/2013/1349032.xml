<AbstractNarration>At the core of this research is a fundamental question: how and when do children acquire the prosodic patterns of their mother tongue?  Although young infants are sensitive to the prosodic properties of their language, children may not fully master their phonological use until the age of 12. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation project will be the first large scale study of the development of prosody using acoustic data. Data will be collected from three age groups (6-year-olds, 9-year-olds, and 12-year-olds) to assess the developmental patterns in the production of prosody in two languages: Greek and English. The study examines prosodic phenomena operating in different domains (compound, phrase and clitic stress) in order to explain the order in which they are acquired. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Comparing Greek and English will lead to a better understanding of the prosodic properties that languages have in common, as opposed to those determined by the specific linguistic system one learns. Since phonological development plays a major role in the development of reading skills, the findings may yield insights relevant to education. Understanding the developmental process may also contribute to improved methods of instruction for children with developmental problems in prosody (e.g. autism).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The fundamental intellectual merit of the research resides in the deeper understanding it has provided with regard to the course of development of the production prosody, specifically stress and intonation.  In particular, it addresses several long-standing gaps in the literature on the acquisition of phonology.  First, the systematic data collection procedure followed in two languages, English and Greek, provides the first large-scale corpora pertaining to the acquisition of a total of five prosodic patterns in these languages.  This has made it possible to formulate meaningful comparisons across the languages, and thus to advance generalizations regarding the process of the acquisition of prosody more broadly.  Second, since the structures examined involve larger prosodic constituents than the usual syllable, foot and word, the research provides insight into the role of the prosodic hierarchy in determining the order of acquisition of higher level prosodic structures and constituents.  Third, the acoustic analyses have provided fine-grained information regarding the role of variability in prosody acquisition, an area that has barely been considered at all.  Finally, the examination of children ranging in age from about 5 to about 12, as well as adult control groups, has not only further demonstrated that the process of phonology acquisition extends well beyond the first years of school, up to around age 12, but also that this continued acquisition involves input from a range of sources, beyond the speech of a child?s parents or other care-givers.  The major outcomes of the research have disseminated in conference presentations and publications.   The broader implications of the project are observable in the development of the large-scale Greek and English corpora, and the associated measurements and analyses of the main properties associated with stress and intonation, in particular duration, pitch (F0), intensity (loudness) and vowel quality (especially centralization) in children (5 &ndash; 12 years) and adult speakers of Greek and English.  The analyses demonstrate that refinement and reduction of variability in the production of the various acoustic properties continues at least until age 12, and therefore is something that must be considered in future phonological acquistion research.  Thus while adults may hear child productions as correct at an earlier age, it is now abundantly clear that they are attending only to the general speech patterns; they are not able to assess more subtle issues of accuracy and variability.  In addition, the examination of prosodic phenomena applying to phonological words, clitic constructions, compounds and phrases, provides the first detailed information regarding the acquisition of multiple higher level prosodic constituents, and thus it has been able to confirm earlier suggestions that the process of acquisition proceeds from the smaller to the larger domains in order.  Observation of the older children in particular has also led to a richer understanding of the language acquisition process beyond the earliest stages, where the parents and / or other caregivers are the main source of linguistic input.  It has been observed that other social influences become increasingly important in the production of speech, in particular prosody.  This was especially noticeable in the presence of two alternative speech patterns, up-speak (rising intonation) and creaky voice, used at the ends of phrases in English, almost uniquely by the females.  Thus, a proposal has been advanced for a more complex and nuanced model of phonological acquisition, in place of the usual view that acquisition follows a linear trajectory from infancy to the adult target language.  That is, the process of acquisition must include not only the mastery of basic acoustic phenomena, following the order of the constituents of the prosodic hierarchy, but it must also include a mechanism for the introduction of sociolinguistic considerations, and revisions of the child?s grammar accordingly.  Taken together, the different types of results have implications beyond linguistics and linguistic theory, contributing to our basic understanding of language development and maturation, which in turn has implications for education and applications in speech-language pathology, as well as the broader field of cognitive science.
