<AbstractNarration>ELT COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH: RESTRUCTURING OF TERRESTRIAL ENVIRONMENTS FOLLOWING THE PERMIAN-TRIASSIC MASS EXTINCTION.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Christian Sidor, University of Washington&lt;br/&gt;Peter Roopnarine, California Academy&lt;br/&gt;Kenneth Angielczyk, Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago, Illinois&lt;br/&gt;Sterling Nesbitt, Virginia Technological University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the broad-scale effects of climate change in deep time (between 245 and 120 million years ago) and its associated mass extinction, on terrestrial communities has been hindered by the lack of high-quality regional or global-scale data, as nearly all studies have been restricted to sequences in Russia or South Africa. This research will build on six prior seasons of fieldwork in Tanzania and Zambia (together TZAM) to bring new data to bear on this major linked event of environmental, climatic, and biotic change. Our team will gather multidisciplinary data (sedimentological, geochemical, vertebrate paleontological, paleobotanical, and geochronological) during two proposed seasons of fieldwork. In the lab, we will use geographic distribution and community food web models to address more general questions about mass extinctions and their subsequent recoveries. For example, do mass extinctions consistently cause certain types of community restructuring or do their effects vary with environment and geography? Does the ecological rebuilding of terrestrial communities proceed in a stereotyped way, regardless of the exact identities of the species involved? Answering these types of questions is an important step in the process of moving from documenting the causes and effects of this extinction event, to using it as a source of predictive information for dealing with modern biotic crises.&lt;br/&gt;Vertebrate paleontology fascinates the public. Because of their visibility, dissemination of our results to the general public will primarily occur at the natural history museums involved in the project. In collaboration with the exhibits departments at the Field Museum and Burke Museum, we will create two exhibit installations focusing on Asilisaurus kongwe, a small dinosaur relative from Tanzania that is an icon of our research project. At the conclusion of the grant, the installations will be permanently transferred to the National Museum of Tanzania (Dar es Salaam, Tanzania), and the Livingstone Museum (Livingstone, Zambia) where they will introduce local citizens to the rich paleontological heritage of their nations. We will also develop a level of the FMNH's paleontology video game Game of Bones focusing on Asilisaurus. The game level will be centered around discovering and excavating a specimen of Asilisaurus, reconstructing its anatomy, and making inferences about its paleobiology. The game level will be promoted on the main websites of the Field Museum of Natural History (FMNH), University of Washington Burke Museum (UWBM), and the California Academy of Science (CAS), the museums' social media sites, and web pages targeting science enthusiasts (e.g., FMNH: Science@FMNH, The Field Revealed; UWBM: BurkeBlog; CAS: Science Today and Science in Action).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p style="text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;">The Permian-Triassic mass extinction is the largest recorded in Earth&rsquo;s history. About 251 million years ago (mya), tremendous volcanic action in where is now Siberia, both above and below the ground, altered the planet&rsquo;s climate and functioning in dramatic ways. The result is that more than 70% of animals on land, and more than 80% in the ocean, became extinct. On land, warming and drying climates led to changes in precipitation and the collapse of forest ecosystems. The best understood fossil record of this is preserved in the Karoo Basin of South Africa. In this project, we set out to examine and compare similar ecosystems that existed at that time further to the north, in modern day Tanzania and Zambia. The result was a large compilation of new data on the Permian-Triassic world of southern Africa, and an understanding of what happened to the paleoecosystems there. One aspect of the project involved the development of mathematical models of how those ecosystems worked, how they were affected by the mass extinction, and how they might have recovered. These models are the first of their kind, and were very revealing of the region&rsquo;s history during the environmental crisis. We learned that for several million years before the extinction, the ecosystem developed in a manner that made it increasingly stable, and able to accommodate greater numbers of species. Even during the extinction, which unfolded in several phases or waves, the ecosystem remained very stable. This is not as puzzling as it sounds, because at least initially the extinctions were biased, with species that contributed less to ecosystem stability being more prone to early extinction.

Further modeling suggests that the Early Triassic ecosystem (about 250 mya) would have been vulnerable to any further environmental upheavals, and likely to be replaced by the evolution of species capable of assembling more stable systems. This is indeed what happened, and by no less than seven million years after the first phase of the extinction, both the Permian and early recovery systems had been completely replaced.
