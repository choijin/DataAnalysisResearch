<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to theoretically and experimentally investigate novel drivetrains for wind turbines with infinitely variable speed converters (IVSCs) and variable electromotive-force generators (VEGs), which can reduce failures, cost, and power loss; harvest more wind power; and reduce the cost of wind energy. By mechanically converting a variable wind input speed to a constant output speed using an IVSC, which is an all-mechanical gear train with minimal speed variation, one can generate grid-compatible constant-frequency power without using a power converter. A novel concept of an eccentric motion system that differs from all other continuously variable transmissions will be investigated. Two new concepts of VEGs are investigated: a generator with an adjustable overlap between the rotor and the stator and a multiple-generator configuration. The proposed research integrates various subjects including kinematics, dynamics, control, and electromagnetics. New control theories and laws will be developed for IVSCs and VEGs and implemented. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using an all-mechanical speed converter can generate cost savings from simpler assembly and lower maintenance. Besides wind energy generation, the new knowledge generated from this research can be used to develop water turbines to harvest current and tidal energy; new transmissions and VEGs for cars, trucks, military vehicles, and ships; motion controls for airplanes and construction machines; and energy harvesting devices for ocean wave energy and vibration energy from railway tracks. Various aspects of the proposed research will be adapted for educational purposes to students at all levels, from high school students to Ph.D. students. The infinitely variable motion control and energy harvesting concepts will be demonstrated to underserved high school students in a summer educational program to spark their interest in science and engineering and to expose them to engineering research. Students in different disciplines will be involved in different aspects of wind energy research; research results will be showcased at wind energy forums to arouse public awareness of clean energy.</AbstractNarration>
