<AbstractNarration>Overview:&lt;br/&gt;Symposium C: Thin-Film Compound Semiconductor Photovoltaics will be held at the 2013 Spring&lt;br/&gt;Meeting of the Materials Research Society. Thin film photovoltaics have demonstrated high&lt;br/&gt;light-to electricity conversion efficiencies and are leading candidates to provide lower-cost&lt;br/&gt;energy due to potential advantages in manufacturing and materials costs. The topic has great&lt;br/&gt;importance for the materials research community to further its contribution to the increased&lt;br/&gt;urgency in the US and globally for developing alternative energy sources. The specific goals&lt;br/&gt;of the symposium are to present and disseminate significant recent advances in the understanding&lt;br/&gt;of these materials and devices and to help develop a diverse and active community including&lt;br/&gt;established researchers and young scientists to further technical progress in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit :&lt;br/&gt;The symposium brings together a wide range of experts in research on thin-film photovoltaics&lt;br/&gt;including twelve internationally recognized invited speakers along with students and other&lt;br/&gt;young scientists. There will be sessions on many different aspects of the technology and&lt;br/&gt;a range of different materials needed for production. Synergies between different materials,&lt;br/&gt;processing approaches, and characterization methods will be highlighted. This range of technical&lt;br/&gt;presentations along with a symposium organization designed to foster open discussion will&lt;br/&gt;help further scientific progress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts :&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the symposium target two different impacts. First, the technical content&lt;br/&gt;will further the potential of thin-film photovoltaics to contribute to US and global energy&lt;br/&gt;and environmental needs. Second, an emphasis on developing a broad, collaborative research&lt;br/&gt;community with a specific focus on the educational development of students and early career&lt;br/&gt;researchers and their incorporation into this community will help develop the next generation&lt;br/&gt;of scientists needed to meet our research needs.</AbstractNarration>

Furthermore, the global collaborative research community, with a specific focus on the educational development of students and early career researchers and their incorporation into this community, was strengthened through a variety of discussion opportunities &ndash; during regular scheduled discussion sessions, at vivid poster sessions, and numerous "off-line" occasions for interactions of researchers from the US, Europe, and Asia. Furthermore, the particular focus on young scientists certainly contributed to developing the next generation of scientists needed to meet our research needs.
