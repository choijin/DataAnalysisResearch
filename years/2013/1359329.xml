<AbstractNarration>This funding renews a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Connecticut focused on computer systems security research. This site is co-funded by the CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service Program and the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program. Students will participate in research projects that are timely and in an area of national priority. Specific activities include collaborative projects in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department and the Computer Science and Engineering Department, including research in hardware support for computer security, hardware Trojan detection, and IC authentication, and access control. A series of seminars will equip students with knowledge specific to the various research projects as well as general skills required in graduate school. In addition, the undergraduate students will have the opportunity to participate in the Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust Symposium. This will broaden students' vision by allowing them to witness research projects conducted worldwide. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies with the strong research team and the focus on computer systems security, an area of national need and of interest to students. The students will participate in research initiatives that investigate algorithmic techniques, hardware and software design principles, computer architecture, and other aspects of trustable computing systems. A major goal of this project is to introduce such interdisciplinary research work to students in the early stages of their academic careers to spark their interests. At the same time, the research has the potential to contribute to the research core of the computing disciplines.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project is aimed at preparing undergraduate students for graduate study in a research area of vital national interest. Computer systems are integrated into every part of our national infrastructure, including financial systems, communication systems, transportation, and defense. A primary national need is research and researchers who can address the security of these systems. The research opportunities that this proposal provides will help develop the next generation of researchers investigating these important computer security issues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The REU Site on Trustable Computing Systems at the University of Connecticut introduced interdisciplinary computer systems security research to undergraduate students in the early stages of their academic career. This early exposure to cutting-edge research planted seeds that will potentially lead to future graduate researchers.The valuable hands-on experiences in research will help produce computer engineers who are prepared to formalize and solve security problems as practicing engineers, whether or not they continue as professional researchers.  From 2014-2016, the site hosted 33 students from 28 different universities across the country.  A particular focus was made to reach out to students from colleges without undergraduate research opportunities, with nearly 60% of our summer researchers from such schools.    As participiants in the program, students worked on a variety of research projects related to computer systems security.  A sample of such projects include developing secondary authorization methods using image recognition, authentication mobile phone users using touch screen patterns, automated smartphone malware detection, and ensuring memory safety in computer systems.  The student researchers contributed to a number of papers that were published at leading conferences.  In addition to the research projects, students also participated in professional development workshops on ethics, technical writing, presentations, and preparation for grad school.  A unique feature of the site was the trip to an academic conference on computer security which enabled students to experience the environment of collaboration and learning at these conferences.
