<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the effects of selection for starvation resistance on ovarian development in the fruitfly, Drosophila melanogaster.   Starvation-resistant flies have survived many generations of laboratory-controlled starvation conditions, and are substantially larger than control flies, which were continuously supplied with food. The starvation-selected flies carry much more stored fat, in expanded fat tissues.  In most insects, a larger female lays more eggs and therefore has more surviving offspring than a smaller female.  This is not the case when large females from the starvation-resistant populations are compared to the smaller females from the control populations.  This unexpected situation provides an excellent opportunity to look carefully at the tradeoffs between survival and reproduction, a central theme to the understanding of life cycles for many different species, and how they change during evolution. Because Drosophila melanogaster is a very well studied model organism, this project will use techniques of molecular genetics and cell biology to understand the underlying physiology and genetic changes that have occurred during starvation selection.  The experimental toolkit available for Drosophila will be used to test the function of specific candidate genes in ovarian development and fat body function.  This project will provide a unique learning environment for graduate students and undergraduates at a minority serving institution, by their participation in an integrated series of scientific activities that link evolutionary biology to developmental biology through an organismal perspective.  Outreach activities will include production of videos displayed in the lobby of a highly-trafficked research building on the UNLV campus, participation in the NSF Radio 360 program, and development of a Science Caf√© for the general public.  The latter will consist of a monthly series of short presentations and discussions led by scientists and engineers from the UNLV community, government and industry.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project used experimental evolution in fruitflies to investigate tradeoffs between survival and reproduction. These tradeoffs are ubiquitous in biology. An example would be the difference between a redwood tree, which allocates most of its resources to growth and survival, compared to an annual plant that devotes most of its resources to reproduction in its short lifespan. We selected for starvation resistance in fruitfly populations. Starvation survival can be achieved through several mechanisms; in this case flies evolved greater energy storage (obesity) and reduced metabolism to conserve energy. Flies became obese by extending pre-adult (larval) development, allowing them to eat and grow for a longer period. Lower metabolism was associated with increased sleep behavior (~16 hours per day). In contrast to theoretical predictions, starvation-selected flies produced fewer offspring than unselected controls. We identified the developmental differences causing reduced reproduction, and we identified the hormonal changes causing longer development. An important finding was that, although selection is performed on adult populations, many of the physiological changes we observed occur in pre-adult stages. Thus, natural selection has affected the entire life history of these flies. Obese flies share several traits in common with obese humans, including altered sleeping patterns, cardiomyopathy and improved performance when placed on a diet. Genome sequencing of these flies identified several hundred candidate genes potentially affecting obesity and related phenotypes. Most of these genes have human counterparts. This project supported participation by numerous undergraduate and graduate students, most of whom have gone on to advanced training in research or biomedical fields, or careers in biotechnology. We also founded Science Cafe Las Vegas, a monthly forum where local scientists discuss their research with members of the general public.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/24/2019<br>      Modified by: Allen&nbsp;G&nbsp;Gibbs</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1355210/1355210_10298663_1569365368328_ObeseFlies--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1355210/1355210_10298663_1569365368328_ObeseFlies--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Obese flies"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1355210/1355210_10298663_1569365368328_ObeseFlies--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Obese flies"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Starvation-selected flies contain more than twice as much fat as their controls.</div> <div class="imageCredit">C.M.
