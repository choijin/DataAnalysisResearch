<AbstractNarration>Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to replace the use of empirical constitutive descriptions of plastic deformation in three-dimensional simulations of polycrystal plasticity with direct dislocation-based modeling. We will base the work on a previously-developed fast-Fourier transform (FFT) formulation of polycrystal plasticity introduced by Lebensohn and colleagues.  The key feature to the FFT approach is that any eigenstrain can be included with no real change in the calculational procedure.  From a dislocation perspective, the eigenstrains are just the plastic distortion tensor, which reflects the slip caused by the dislocation.  Thus, replacing a constitutive model for plasticity with a more direct calculation of dislocation microstructure evolution is straightforward, given a way to model the dislocations.  We will base the initial work on polycrystalline plasticity on the use of a continuum-level model based on dislocation density evolution, which will be based in part on results from discrete dislocation simulations.  Our goal is thus to  bridge the gap between the behavior of discrete dislocations and macroscopic-level descriptions of the behavior of polycrystalline materials, enabling a better understanding of, and new predictive capabilities for, such fundamental materials properties as plastic deformation, creep, fatigue, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of this project will lead to a new methodology that couples coarse-grained and discrete dislocation modeling within a polycrystal plasticity framework.  The method will allow for simulation of the heterogeneity of plastic deformation at the grain scale that includes the effects of dislocation flow.  We thus expect to improve on the ability of polycrystal plasticity calculations to model local, intragrain orientation changes and strain, which currently are not well captured.  More specifically, this new capability will be an advance for  discrete dislocation simulations by including the ability to include anisotropic elasticity and local lattice rotations.  The new capabilities for  polycrystal plasticity will enable the modeling of the coupling of dislocation motion with grain structure and orientation and the accumulation of localized dislocation content.   Application of the method will be made to  a series of specific problems, comparing results with both experiments and existing modeling capabilities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In most technological applications based on metallic systems, the metals are not single crystals, but rather are made up of randomly-oriented crystallites, called grains.  These  polycrystalline materials serve as the basis for much of our current technology and will undoubtedly serve a similar role in the future.  Their mechanical properties depend not only on the properties of the single-crystal grains that make up the polycrystal, but also on the distribution of size and orientation of those grains.   New experimental methods are providing a detailed look at the three-dimensional distribution of local crystallographic orientations, with an emerging ability to do so non-destructively and as a function of time, yielding unprecedented views of the evolving structure of polycrystals under various loading conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computational modeling of the mechanical behavior of polycrystals has become a standard part the study of deformation, used, for example, in the design of the crash-worthiness of automobiles.   Currently, most models treat the deformation individual grains within the polycrystal as being uniform, which we know from experiment is not accurate.  The goal of this project is to incorporate within the modeling a better description of the deformation of the material within each grain.  Success of this project will enable us to more accurately model numerous important problems in deformation, including fatigue, an important phenomenon that can lead to the failure (breaking) of the material over time.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Metals are technologically important materials, due in large part because of their balance between resistance to deformation (strength) and resistance to fracture (ductility). Both strength and ductility arise from the movement of dislocations, which are defects in a crystal lattice whose movements lead to the permanent deformation of a material. For example, if a metal object is bent a small amount, it will relax back to its initial shape.  If the object is bent beyond a certain amount, it will be left with a permanent bend.  The permanent bend is called plastic deformation and arises from the movement of dislocations.  Dislocations also allow metals to resist damage by preventing cracks from running catastrophically through materials.

Recently, computer simulation methods (called dislocation dynamics, or DD) have been developed that enable the modeling of dislocation flow.  While yielding important information about dislocation movement, the simulation methods have generally been limited to studying the deformation of single crystals. In practice, however, metals in use are generally made up of many crystallites, called grains, separated by narrow interfaces, called grain boundaries.  The size and relative orientation of the grains can have a large effect on the strength of these polycrystalline metals, because they influence dislocation movement.  Thus, being able to model dislocation movement in polycrystalline materials would be an important advance in our simulation capabilities.  One of the most important computational tools in the study of metallic deformation is called polycrystal plasticity, which is the study of how polycrystalline metals deform. To date, however, polycrystal plasticity calculations have generally not been based directly on the movement of dislocations, but instead have relied on simplified models of dislocation behavior.   Our goal in this project has been to develop an approach to dislocation dynamics that would enable it to be directly coupled with polycrystal plasticity calculations.  To reach this objective, we first recasted the methods used to perform the dislocation dynamics simulations to use an approach that would enable that coupling.  An important aspect of this new approach is that it can be solved with the highly efficient fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm.  After developing an approach based on the FFT approach, we collaborated with Dr. Laurent Capolungo of Los Alamos National Laboratory, who had developed a similar method, to integrate our new approach into a polycrystal plasticity calculation.  Using the combined method, we can now directly model how a polycrystalline material would deform under an applied load by tracking how the dislocations movement depends on the grain in which they are located, the orientation of that grain to the applied load, and the relative orientation of that grain with its neighboring grains.  In the attached figure, we show an example from one of our simulations.    The results of this project represent a major advance in the field of dislocation-based plasticity and will enable detailed examination of the development of dislocation substructures in polycrystalline materials and the effects of those substructures on the strength of those materials.  Moreover, results of these simulations can be used in conjunction with recently-developed experimental techniques to enhance both the simulations and the experiments. The combination of experiment and simulation will open up many possibilities, including the study of plasticity in a wide range of technologically-important metallic systems (e.g., titanium, steel) and many important physical phenomena (e.g., grain-size strengthening, fatigue), which will help develop new metals, with improved properties, for future technologies.
