<AbstractNarration>This proposal was submitted for an EAGER grant; it seeks funding for a US-Turkey Collaborative research initiative. The application entitled, "Advanced Energy-Efficient Smart Buildings: Solar Energy Conversion by Next-Generation Construction NanoMaterials," was submitted by Touradj Solouki from Baylor University. This EAGER request will support a collaborative approach to enable NOx abatement using hybrid, nanomaterial-based photocatalysts, optimized for ambient conditions, without the incorporation of expensive platinum group metals. It is anticipated these new photocatalysts could be mixed with conventional construction materials to improve air quality in and around buildings. The work leverages the complementary skills and high resolution spectroscopic/spectrometric capabilities of the US and Turkish investigators and their individual facilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research is expected to produce cost-effective smart building materials that will use solar energy to clean the air and help to minimize air pollution. Moreover, research in this area will offer interdisciplinary training opportunities for students and scholars that will be involved in high-quality and meaningful research experiences, develop their expertise, and broaden their knowledge through shared and open-access facilities. Successful implementation of the research design will foster innovative research and serve as a model for future international collaborations.</AbstractNarration>

Nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide are referred to as oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and at high concentrations these contaminants cause inflammation of the airways and can have negative impact on vegetation. NOx can be produced during combustion from road transport and energy production activities. Although NOx abatement can be achieved at elevated temperatures, their reduction under ambient conditions is very costly but desired. Photocatalytic systems suitable for use under ultraviolet (UV) and/or visible (VIS) light can be used to clean the air and reduce our energy "foot print".  The major goals of this project are to (a) develop a highly accurate and sensitive analytical tool for evaluating efficacy of nanocatalysts and (b) produce new nanocatalysts compatible with use in building material for photocatalytical destruction of NOx contaminants.  The specific objectives of this pilot project were to (1) design, construct, and build a state-of-the-art analytical tool that can be used for quantitative and qualitative characterization of photocatalysts, (2) combine scientific expertise of two unique research teams and develop successful international collaboration between the scientists from Baylor University (USA) and Bilkent University (Turkey), and (3) synthesize novel nanomaterial that can be used, cost-effectively, with conventional construction/building materials to improve air quality by photocatalytic NOx abatement, using solar energy.
