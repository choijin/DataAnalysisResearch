<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, this program will design functional organic-inorganic hybrids to combine the advantages of molecules and extended solids in single-phase and well-defined materials. Specific targets include i) nonporous sorbents for the capture of atmospheric pollutants through chemisorption, ii) solid-state reaction templates that can alter product distribution from that of solution-state synthesis, and iii) materials with high ion mobility and tunable ion-transport pathways for fuel cell membranes and solid electrolytes. Solution-state self-assembly routes will be developed to synthesize highly modular structures amenable to systematic material optimization. The substantially different properties of the organic and inorganic components allow for optimization of conflicting features in single-phase materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;This research program targets the synthesis of organic-inorganic hybrid materials for applications in clean energy: sorbents to capture atmospheric pollutants, nonporous ion-exchange membranes for fuel cells, and solid electrolytes for rechargeable batteries. Most functional materials are plagued by tradeoffs. Optimization of one property requires compromising another: e.g., flexibility and strength, electronic conductivity and porosity. Inorganic solids have superior electronic, thermal, and mechanical properties typically not seen in molecules. However, the tools of synthetic chemistry allow for the structure and reactivity of molecules to be tuned at a level of precision not yet accessible with extended solids. This research seeks to combine the fields of solid-state chemistry and solution-state molecular synthesis to obtain materials with properties unique to both discrete molecules and extended solids. &lt;br/&gt;Many female faculty claim that female colleagues and mentors were instrumental in their career choice, but not all female students have easy access to informal female mentors. As a step towards decreasing the number of exceptional women who leave the academic track, the P.I. will develop an online mentor network. This program will provide interested female students with young female faculty mentors. Through a network of informal mentors, students can have senior colleagues in the community-with whom they identify-who have taken the next steps in the path to their chosen careers and are available for advice and encouragement.</AbstractNarration>
