<AbstractNarration>Objective: The objective of this project is to develop an integrated research and educational program on high frequency thermally actuated nano-electromechanical resonant devices and systems. This includes experimental demonstration and characterization of VHF and UHF thermal-piezoresistive resonators and self-sustained oscillators and developing solutions to major technological barriers such as nanoscale batch fabrication, and temperature and process compensation of such devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Micro/nanomechanical resonant devices hold the promise of unprecedented opportunities in sensory and electronic frequency referencing/filtering applications. Almost all the existing research on high frequency electromechanical resonators has been focused on piezoelectric and electrostatic transduction mechanisms. Thermal actuation, despite having several advantages, has generally been considered a slow mechanism only suitable for low-frequency applications. However, recent theoretical analysis and preliminary results have demonstrated not only the viability, but also superiority and uniqueness of thermal actuation for high frequency applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: At the fundamental level this effort could open-up a number of new unexplored research avenues in nanoscience and technology. At the practical level, the developed technologies can provide new opportunities in wireless communications and sensory applications.&lt;br/&gt;This project will contribute to training of the next generation of M/NEMS experts by involving and educating graduate and undergraduate researchers. Major educational activities that will be integrated along with the research activities include graduate/undergraduate lab module developments, K-12 outreach through nano boot-camps and teacher workshops, and dissemination of results to the technical community and general public. Special efforts will be undertaken to encourage participation of students from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Electronic filters, oscillators, and low-noise amplifiers are crucial fundamental building blocks of any communication system.  Due to the evergrowing need for speed and reliability of wireless communication technologies, addressing the complexity of radio frequency (RF) systems is currently a much more daunting task than it was a decade ago.  Today, there are multiple radios operating at the same time in a smartphone such as Cell Band, WIFI, Bluetooth, GPS, etc..  RF front ends of current wireless systems also must often operate at different bands simultaneously.  This requires integration of a large number of filtering and amplifying components within each system.   Under this projet, a new class of highly miniaturized electromechanical components have been developed that can perform both frequency referencing/selection and signal amplification required at RF front-ends within one nanoscale silicon structure.  Traditionally, this task has been accomplished using a combination of passive frequency selective electromechanical resonant devices and conventional transistor based low noise amlifiers.  Conventional frequency selective electromechanical components operate based on the piezoelectric effect and have relatively large dimensions in the hundreds of microns to milimeters.  The developed devices under this project, knowns as thermal-piezoresistve resonators/amplifiers, operate based on thermal actution of nanoscale silicon strucutres into high frequency resonance.  Thermal actuation coupled with the piezoresistive effect in the silicon structure leads to internal amplification of the electrical signal while utilizing the resonant behavior to select the desired frequency.  Such devices can potentially address the needs and significantly simplify and miniaturize highly complex RF front-ends of the future.
