<AbstractNarration>Arizona State University doctoral candidate, Angie Abdelmonem, under the guidance of Dr. James Eder, will investigate how non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and grassroots social movements engage international human rights discourses in democratization efforts. The research takes place in Cairo, Egypt, which despite being an important focal point for recent democratization social movements, there is very little credible formal scientific exploration of unfolding processes on the ground. The researcher's unique training and ongoing work in the area allow for a feasible research project, which through participant observation with three Egyptian NGOs and social movements, interviews with activists, volunteers and local citizens, and surveys among neighborhood residents, will underscore the strategies employed, as well as successes and challenges faced, by civil society entities in making the public sphere safe for participation by socially marginalized individuals. There is a critical need to understand these dynamics in the current context of political upheaval and democratic transition in Egypt, where the participation of historically marginal groups in the public sphere is actively being contested and defined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study builds on the growing literature on NGOs and human rights in anthropology and is significant in providing a unique understanding of the politics of transnationally inspired social change. By emphasizing the voices and lived experiences of local NGO workers and residents, it will reveal complexities around citizen action in constructing new ideas of civil social participation in public and an increasingly globalizing society. This project will further allow scientists to understand how NGOs and other actors assess and reconfigure democratization efforts. Understanding how NGO discourses and programming are increasing access to the public sphere and improving daily realities is fundamental to finding solutions toward the creation of sustainable democracy. The project also contributes to the education of a graduate student.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This dissertation project explores grassroots anti-sexual harassment activism in Egypt. In particular, the research examines how anti-sexual harassment initiatives have both mediated public understandings of sexual harassment and how they have sought to mobilize the public against such practices, in the pre-and-post Revolutionary context. It argues several key points, including that sexual harassment in Egypt is not only an expression of a prevailing system of gender that privileges the male-female unit, but also maintains this privileged pairing by reminding men and women of their place in the gender order. In addition, this dissertation focuses on community-based initiatives and argues that such activism that is centered on sociocultural negotiations of gendered norms and societal responsibility, which does not directly engage with the state or advocate for political and legal changes, represent inherently political processes with political effects. More specifically, community-based efforts are a form of political negotiation that may be far more politically impactful because it seeks to generate a critical mass of the public to speak out and demand change against public sexual harassment. In addition to these points, this dissertation further contends that the act of defining sexual harassment as <em>ta?arrush ginsy </em>in Arabic by anti-sexual harassment NGOs and initiatives was a strategic move designed to facilitate the criminalization of sexual harassment, and is connected to transnational and national efforts focused on criminalizing violence against women. Street sexual harassment was previously more commonly understood as <em>mu&rsquo;aksa</em> (flirtation), with far more benign implications, whereas <em>taharrush ginsy</em> conveys far more serious violence associated with sexual harassment and taps into historic understandings of <em>taharrush</em> as assault and rape. Along with this argument, public resistance to new notions of sexual harassment (as <em>ta?arrush</em>) are linked to these historic meanings, as well as<em> </em>the confusion resulting from the use of <em>ta?arrush </em>to signify both everyday and more violent forms of assault and rape, which occurred in the post-Revolutionary period.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Participant observation for this project was carried out between August 2013- August 2014 with the Egyptian social initiative, HarassMap. As part of this participant observation, workshops, seminars, trainings, focus groups, street outreach events both inside and outside of Cairo, public festivals, as well as daily operations, meetings and internal activist interactions serve as the basis for understanding anti-sexual harassment philosophical, discursive and mobilizational strategies. Between December 2013 - March 2014, in-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with prominent anti-sexual harassment activists and volunteers from multiple initiatives and NGOs, including Imprint Movement, Anti-Sexual Harassment Movement, Girls Revolution, I Saw Harassment, Operation Anti-Sexual Harassment, The Egyptian Center for Women&rsquo;s Rights, Nazra For Feminist Studies, The Nadeem Center for the Rehabilitation of Victims of Violence and Torture, the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, and the National Council for Women's Ombudsman's Office in order to gain insights into the larger field of gender violence activism, of which sexual harassment in an integral part, particularly since the January 25, 2011 Revolution.
