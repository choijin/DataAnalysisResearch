<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating smart fault detection methods for photovoltaic (PV) installations to fill the technology gap of identifying and protecting against dangerous electrical faults in solar PV installations.   The translated science/technology has the following unique features: 1) it uses machine learning to identify fault type and fault location in the PV arrays; 2) it will be able to clear faults that traditional fuses or other fault protection devices cannot presently clear; 3) it will be a fully integrated fuse holder and box that has user interface allowing the user to monitor the PV array performance. The new solar PV protection technology will be able to isolate, clear, and identify the type and location of PV fault. This includes several types of faults that presently pose fire hazards to PV installations, such as line-to-line faults that may occur when branches or wires accidentally connect two different PV arrays in a big installation.  The new, smart fuse protection adds exemplary safety, reliability, and even increased energy delivery when compared to the leading competing science/technology, such as traditional fuses or circuit breakers in this market space. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project accomplishes this goal by running smart fault detection algorithms that utilize machine learning, nonlinear model prediction of PVs, intelligent measurements of PV currents and voltages, resulting in a method to identify hazardous fault location and types.  Prototype smart over-current protection devices will be built with miniaturized self-contained electronics. The protection devices will be tested in PV installations to demonstrate their commercial viability and benefits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The partnership engages Mersen USA Newburyport-LLC to provide guidance in the fuse/over-current protection manufacturing and commercial market. Mersen will help manufacture the prototype smart fuse holders and test them in their lab PV facilities. Throughout the project, Mersen will lead product testing, customer surveys and other aspects of commercialization and financing as they pertain to the potential to translate the smart PV fuse protection science/technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality.  The potential economic impact is expected to be 1) the creation of a new product market in smart PV protection fuses projected to reach more than $750k annually within 2 to 3 years of the project conclusion and 2) the further acceptance of solar PV energy in the consumer marketplace by making the PV installations safer to the consumer. The smart PV protection devices will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in this PV installation market, since each installation of solar PV array must utilize (usually multiple) over-current protection devices, such as fuses.   The societal impact, long term, will be improved safety of any PV installation, increased energy yield due to immediate knowledge of fault, and better diagnosis in real-time of any reductions of energy yield caused by PV arrays that may need repair.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are known to have long lifetime, yet they also are subject to different types of failures, often called æfaults.Æ  Branches may fall from trees and cause damage or connections to the earth.  Inadvertent power flow may flow from solar panel to solar panel. Sometimes, even, these faults may cause reverse power flow into the solar panel and the panel may be absorbing power instead of producing power.  Impact of these faults can range from being minimal to becoming dangerously hazardous.  Minimal impact may occur when a fault would only reduce system efficiency or slightly accelerate aging/life-cycle.  On the other hand, hazardous faults may cause fire hazards.  Furthermore, PV systems pose additional challenges because it is difficult to shut down PV modules completely during faults, since they are always energized by sunlight in daytime.  To deal with the possible fault hazards, conventional fault detection and protection methods usually add overcurrent protection devices (OCPD), such as fuses, and ground fault detection interrupters (GFDI) within PV components. However, it has recently been discovered that certain faults in PV arrays may not be cleared by OCPD or GFDI due to non-linear output characteristics of PV arrays, high fault impedances, low irradiance conditions, or maximum power point tracker (MPPT) of PV inverters. This difficulty brings blind spots in the protection schemes, leading to the possible DC arcing and fire hazards.  This research project developed, designed, built and tested fault detection systems that were made specifically for PV systems.  The approach was to add computational processing power to existing fault detection methods through additional digital signal processing.  Then machine learning algorithms are used to learn about the PV installation and then be able to identify when the faults occur in real-time.  Previously undetectable line-to-line faults can now be detected, thereby making the PV system safer.  A commercial grade combiner (fuse) box, which is normally included at each PV installation, has been built that includes these new machine learning algorithms.   The smart PV protection devices developed in this project can contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in this PV installation market, since each installation of solar PV array must utilize (usually multiple) over-current protection devices, such as fuses.   The societal impact, long term, will be improved safety of any PV installation, increased energy yield due to immediate knowledge of fault, and better diagnosis in real-time of any reductions of energy yield caused by PV arrays that may need repair.
