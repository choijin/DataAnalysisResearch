<AbstractNarration>This dissertation project seeks to investigate the production of bilingual speech forms in the contact situation between Spanish and K'ichee' (Mayan) in Guatemala, where the languages stand in a situation of unstable diglossia. Specifically, it examines the phonetic transfer or convergence in the intonation contours of bilinguals that differ in language proficiency, as they produce contrastive focus utterances in naturalistic interviews and in controlled experiments. The principal questions that motivate the work are whether bilinguals give any prosodic emphasis to a contrastive focus constituent in K'ichee', and whether they present evidence of transfer from one language to the other or of convergence of intonation contours. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dissertation also explores the differences in prosodic focus marking in Spanish-dominant versus K'ichee'-dominant bilinguals and examines the patterns of interaction between these bilinguals' dominant languages. In pursuing these research aims, multiple tasks are employed to elicit contrastive focus productions from bilinguals from two dialect regions: Cantel, which is close to the Spanish-speaking urban center of Quetzaltenango, and Nahual√°, which is further removed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present study presents one of the first acoustic analyses of K'ichee' and Guatemalan Spanish and it contributes more generally to the literature on bilingual and contact Spanish intonation. In addition, it brings needed attention to an underrepresented indigenous population and its endangered language. Finally, in providing insight into the communicative norms and needs of this bilingual population, it may aid in the design and implementation of educational programs tailored to communities of Spanish-Mayan bilinguals throughout Guatemala.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project provides one of the first in depth analyses of how bilinguals of Spanish and K'ichee', a Mayan language from Guatemala, emphasize the important parts (words) of their utterances through word order and intonation. Two Mayan communities in Guatemala were investigated: one that is geographically close to a Spanish-speaking urban area, Cantel, and another that is further removed, Nahual&aacute;.  The preliminary analyses of this project show that bilingual language dominance (how much a bilingual speaks each language, how comfortable he or she feels speaking each language, his or her overall attitudes about each language, etc.) is quite different between the two communites: Cantel speakers tend to be more Spanish-dominant more whereas Nahual&aacute; speakers tend to be more K'ichee'-dominant.  The overall analyses of word order show that Spanish-dominant bilinguals were more likely to use a word order to emphatically mark a word that was similar to the same word order in Spanish whereas K'ichee'-dominant bilinguals generally used a different word order that has previously been described by researchers.  An acoustic analysis of the intonation used to mark these words shows that all bilinguals use an earlier rise of their intonation to emphasize words in both languages. However, Spanish-dominant bilinguals are more likely to use a higher intonation to emphasize a word than K'ichee'-dominant bilinguals in both languages.  Finally, a comparison of the intonational patterns used to emphasize a word shows that the bilinguals are using the same patterns in both languages, meaning that their intonation rises and falls in the same locations in both languages. However, most speakers tend to speak K'ichee' at a higher pitch than Spanish, regardless of language dominance. These results are similar to previous studies, i.e. English-German bilinguals tend to speak English at a higher pitch than German, but have not yet been reported among any bilingual speakers of Spanish and other languages.
