<AbstractNarration>Most coding schemes developed in network information theory are combinations of a handful of basic components using Shannon's random coding technique. With the goal of advancing our understanding of these random coding schemes and making them applicable in practice, this research explores three important problems in network information theory. First, this project investigates the simultaneous decoding rule that is easy to analyze, yet powerful enough to achieve the maximum achievable rates of random coding over interference channels. Second, this project applies the insights thus gained on random coding and simultaneous decoding to the index coding problem, in which multiple messages are communicated through a single, noise-free link to multiple receivers with different pieces of side information. Third, this project develops a concatenated coding architecture based on random coding, product codes, and iterative decoding that can provide a systematic method for translating random coding schemes to practical, implementable coding techniques for real-world networks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Playing an ever-increasing role in our networked society, network information theory studies the fundamental limits on information flow over networks and the optimal coding techniques, protocols, and architectures that achieve these limits. This research investigates canonical problems in network information theory that involve interference and broadcast, offering fresh insights and new mathematical tools for optimal information flow in several important applications such as network coding, wireless communication, peer-to-peer networking, and content broadcasting. The concatenated coding architecture developed in this research has potential to provide a new framework for transforming theoretical concepts in network information theory into practical algorithms for applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we investigated fundamental limits of random coding and the applications of random coding to index coding and interference networks. There are three main areas we have made significant contributions.  Optimal decoding of random code ensembles. We characterized the optimal tradeoff between communication rates for interference networks achieved by random coding ensembles, which are close proxies of practical codes and optimal for most network communication problems. This rate tradeoff serves as a canonical benchmark for different communication techniques.  Index coding. We developed the "composite coding" scheme for index coding that uses random coding at its heart of operation. This scheme yields a computable expression for its performance and is optimal for all 9,608 nonisomorphic index coding problems with five messages. We also developed a theoretical and computational framework to investigate the optimal data rate (capacity) of index coding for six or more messages based on tools from graph theory, algebra, and information theory. Using this framework, we characterized the capacity of 99.9% of 1,540,944 index coding problems with six messages.   Practical coding for interference networks. We developed the "sliding-window superposition coding" scheme, which allows low-complexity point-to-point encoders and decoders can be used to achieve the optimal decoding performance for interference networks, which typically requires prohibitively high computational complexity.   Overall, the project contributed to advancing our understanding of random coding in network information theory and opened up the possibility of transforming conceptual coding schemes from network information theory to practical coding techniques in wireless communication. The sliding-window superposition coding scheme has been proposed as one of the building blocks for interference mitigation in the fifth generation cellular standard.
