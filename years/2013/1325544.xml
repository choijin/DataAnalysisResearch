<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: Testing the link between climate and mammalian&lt;br/&gt;faunal dynamics in the early Paleocene record of the San Juan Basin, New Mexico &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;by&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thomas Williamson, New Mexico Museum of Natural History Foundation EAR-1325544&lt;br/&gt;Ross Secord, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, EAR-1325612&lt;br/&gt;Daniel Peppe, Baylor University, EAR-1325552&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The Nacimiento Formation of northwestern New Mexico contains the most complete, diverse, and longest record of early Paleocene mammal evolution known anywhere in the world, spanning from about 65.8 to 62.2 million years ago. The early Paleocene is of particular importance for understanding the evolution of modern ecosystems because it includes the first mammal-dominated ecosystems that appeared immediately following the end-Cretaceous extinction of non-avian dinosaurs. This was a time when the world was warmer than now and the climate appears to have been unstable. This study will test for a relationship between climate and mammalian faunal change in the early Paleocene, and will provide a better understanding of the role climate change played in the establishment of the earliest mammal-dominated ecosystems. This project will test if mammals responded to climate change during this critical interval of time by generating a detailed climate record, including estimates of mean annual temperature and precipitation from leaf-margin and leaf-area analyses of fossil leaves, and from the study of ancient soils. This study will also reconstruct the ancient biomes present at this time and the habitats within those biomes using stable carbon isotopes from mammal teeth, and the types of depositional environments present using sedimentology. These various proxy records will be compared to test for correlations between the mammalian faunal record and changing climate or changing biomes in the early Paleocene. Results from this study should be useful for developing more accurate models for predicting the consequences of climate change.  &lt;br/&gt;This project will provide educational and research opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, including Native American students from New Mexico, which are greatly underrepresented in the sciences, and "at risk" 6-8th grade students from Nebraska. The results of this research will also be incorporated into a permanent museum exhibit at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science.</AbstractNarration>

Following this global catastrophe and extinction of non-avian dinosaurs, ecosystems rapidly recovered and mammals quickly evolved and diversified to become the dominant terrestrial animals. This episode of explosive mammal diversification and evolution occurred under a &ldquo;hot house&rdquo; climate that prevailed through most of the Paleogene (about 66 to 40 million years ago) in which global temperatures were generally warm and equable, but temperatures occasionally spiked during brief, episodic hyperthermal events. Hyperthermal events are poorly understood, but appear to be related to a sudden influx of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. The effects of hyperthermal events on earth&rsquo;s biota are poorly understood, but may provide insight into changes happening in modern times. &nbsp;</p> <p>In order to better understand how changing climates affected early Paleocene terrestrial ecosystems, we examined the geologic record preserved in the San Juan Basin of northwestern New Mexico. The San Juan Basin contains one of the best records of terrestrial environments and ecosystems spanning the Cretaceous - Paleogene boundary and the ensuing four million years of the early Paleocene. We determined the age of early Paleocene strata of the San Juan Basin with high precision by correlating the paleomagnetic signature preserved in San Juan Basin strata with the known ancient shifts of earth&rsquo;s magnetic field. We also dated volcanic ashes and volcanic minerals using high-precision radioisotopic dating techniques. We reconstructed early Paleocene climate and environments using several different methods; we estimated mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation using leaf fossils, estimated mean annual temperature from oxygen isotopes extracted from the fossilized teeth of mammals, and reconstructed depositional environments from careful examinations of strata included detailed analyses of fossil soils. Finally, we compared these records to those constructed from fossil mammals collected from the same strata to see if sudden changes in climate or environments coincided with changes in mammal communities through the early Paleocene.</p> <p>Several Important results from this research are: 1) the San Juan Basin record across the Cretaceous &ndash; Paleogene boundary is much more complete than was previously thought &ndash; it includes a diverse fauna of latest Cretaceous vertebrate animals, including dinosaurs; 2) early Paleocene floras and faunas of New Mexico recovered from the end-Cretaceous mass extinction very rapidly and tended to be much more diverse than faunas and floras of the same age recovered from the Upper Great Plains of western North America; 3) significant differences between New Mexico latest Cretaceous faunas and early Paleocene floras and faunas and those from the Upper Great Plains suggest that there was a great deal of heterogeneity in plants and animals across western North America during this time; 4) we found evidence for at least two hyperthermal events in the early Paleocene &ndash; one of these coincides with the Late Danian Event found in deep sea cores, but one appears to be new &ndash; it corresponds to a major change in mammalian faunas; 5) preliminary evidence suggests that at least one mammal, the phenacodontid &lsquo;condylarth&rsquo; <em>Tetraclaenodon</em>, underwent a significant reduction in size within one of the hyperthermals &ndash; this &lsquo;dwarfing&rsquo; has been observed at the Eocene thermal maximum 1, a later and bigger hyperthermal event.</p> <p>This project provided educational and research opportunities for a number of graduate and undergraduate students and volunteers including a number of Native American undergraduate students, a group that is underrepresented in the geosciences.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ An impact of a large asteroid at the end of the Cretaceous, accompanied by massive volcanism, led to an important turning point in earth history in which about 75% of all animals and plants went extinct. Following this global catastrophe and extinction of non-avian dinosaurs, ecosystems rapidly recovered and mammals quickly evolved and diversified to become the dominant terrestrial animals. This episode of explosive mammal diversification and evolution occurred under a "hot house" climate that prevailed through most of the Paleogene (about 66 to 40 million years ago) in which global temperatures were generally warm and equable, but temperatures occasionally spiked during brief, episodic hyperthermal events. Hyperthermal events are poorly understood, but appear to be related to a sudden influx of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. The effects of hyperthermal events on earth?s biota are poorly understood, but may provide insight into changes happening in modern times.    In order to better understand how changing climates affected early Paleocene terrestrial ecosystems, we examined the geologic record preserved in the San Juan Basin of northwestern New Mexico. The San Juan Basin contains one of the best records of terrestrial environments and ecosystems spanning the Cretaceous - Paleogene boundary and the ensuing four million years of the early Paleocene.
