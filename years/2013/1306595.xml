<AbstractNarration>The California Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate was created in response to the NSF's Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program solicitation (NSF 12-554) for the AGEP-Transformation (AGEP-T) track.  The AGEP-T track targets strategic alliances of institutions and organizations to develop, implement, and study innovative evidence-based models and standards for STEM graduate education, postdoctoral training, and academic STEM career preparation that eliminate or mitigate negative factors and promote positive practices for URMs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The California AGEP is a collaboration between four doctoral degree granting institutions in California, the University of California at Berkeley, the University of California at Los Angeles, Stanford University, and California Institute of Technology. The vision of the California AGEP is to establish an alliance to ensure that underrepresented minority (URM) PhDs from alliance institutions, in much larger numbers, aspire to and populate the ranks of the postdoctoral population, the faculty at competitive research and teaching institutions, the federally funded national laboratories, and scientific think tanks. The California Alliance focuses on increasing diversity in the academic fields with the greatest URMs: the mathematical, physical, and computer sciences; and engineering (MPCS&amp;E).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the California AGEP is to significantly increase the movement of URM students into the most competitive research and teaching careers in the MPCS&amp;E fields to systematically address ethnic underrepresentation in the particular STEM fields and at the institutions where it is most severe and remains seemingly intractable nationally. The California Alliance defines URMs as African Americans, Chicanos, Latinos, Native Alaskans, Native Pacific Islanders, and American Indians. CA-AGEP participants are US citizens who are enrolled as doctoral students, who are URMs, and who are in the MPCS&amp;E fields at the alliance institutions during the award period, including those who graduate during the award period, and URM postdoctoral fellows who are US citizens in the MPCS&amp;E fields at the alliance institutions during the award period.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the California AGEP include:&lt;br/&gt;Objective 1. Create an unprecedented community of practice across the four institutions that include graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, faculty, and key administrators.&lt;br/&gt;Objective 2. Engage faculty as mentors to advance URM students' careers across these four institutions.&lt;br/&gt;Objective 3. Develop, implement, evaluate and set new standards for professional development.&lt;br/&gt;Objective 4. Promote URM PhD advancement to faculty and postdoctoral ranks in STEM through new partnerships and using new tools, and in partnership with federally funded national laboratories.&lt;br/&gt;Objective 5. Conduct research that leverages the architecture of the California Alliance to identify which of the specific programs and initiatives that are in effect in research universities working to increase diversity are most impactful in ensuring URM students' success and professional ascension in the MPCS&amp;E fields, and more generally within STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The activities that contribute to the model for this alliance are many and quite varied; they include: &lt;br/&gt;Objective 1: Hold an annual retreat, with both discipline-specific and cohort-specific sessions. Introduce students, postdocs and faculty to each other using in-person sessions, web site and new media. Create recruitment opportunity for faculty, departments, and national labs.&lt;br/&gt;Objective 2: The Internal Steering Committee (ISC) and the Implementation Team (IT) make faculty aware of California AGEP (CA-AGEP).  Invite and stimulate alliance-wide faculty advisement and mentoring of CA-AGEP students &amp; postdocs.  Include substantial presence of faculty at the annual retreat.  Engage faculty in development of professional development sessions. Engage faculty in recording and streaming of professional development activities on the campuses.&lt;br/&gt;Objective 3: Develop and institute a complete collection of professional development sessions &amp; provide cross-alliance access to all CA-AGEP students.  &lt;br/&gt;Objective 4: Develop and market new joint California Alliance postdocs.  Offer postdoc opportunities to California Alliance students.  Encourage departments to create further postdoc opportunities where strong applicant pool warrants this.  Link all 4 CA-AGEP universities to the University of California President?s Postdoctoral Fellowship Program (PPFP) for professional development and networking in an extended national postdoc community.  Create database of CA-AGEP scholars and access at annual retreat to graduating PhDs for direct recruitment by CA-AGEP and other university department representatives and national labs.&lt;br/&gt;Objective 5: Conduct annual surveys of students with measures related to well-being, identification with the university, attitudes, experiences, perceptions, and performance.   Conduct semi-structured interviews with students, postdocs and faculty.  Collect and analyze mentor reports.  Use of dismantling strategy in research&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CA-AGEP includes a social science research study that employs a dismantling treatment strategy to link exposure and utilization of the various initiatives and services offered to students through the CA-AGEP with individual and group outcomes.  Individual student level attitudinal assessments draw primarily from the social-psychological and educational literature on factors that relate to achievement, both population-general (e.g., self-esteem) as well as measures of variables that specifically tap into URM students' experiences (e.g., experiences relating to racism).  Institutional assessments focus on the qualities of the institutional programs and structures, and these measures tap into sociological-level variables.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The California Alliance consists of four tier-one research universities in California: U.C. Berkeley, U.C.L.A., Cal Tech and Stanford University. The goal of the California AGEP was/is to significantly increase the movement of URM students into the most competitive research and teaching careers in the MPCS&amp;E fields to systematically address ethnic underrepresentation in the particular STEM fields and at the institutions where it is most severe and remains seemingly intractable nationally. We had four objectives in this alliance, which were: 1) create a community of practice; 2) engage faculty as mentors of URM students; 3) set new professional development standards; and 4) promote URM Ph.Ds. to advancement to faculty and post-doctoral ranks.  Following these objectives we: Objective 1: Created a community of practice through annual retreats each year hosted by one of the universities.  At each of these retreats faculty representatives from the four alliance universities and Ph.D. students and post-doctoral fellows from across the alliance met for several days.  The retreats consisted of topical presentations, workshops covering a broad range of topics from networking, interviewing, proposal writing etc. as well as time for graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, faculty and staff to meet in a social setting. Objective 2:  Faculty mentorship with URM students occurred both within each university and across the alliance.  This engagements occurred in several ways including meeting and working with the students at the annual retreats, mentoring of Ph.D. students across disciplines with a university outside of retreats, research exchanges where a Ph.D. student from one university would visit another university to work in a faculty members laboratory, and a post-doctoral program that was advertised nationally. Objective 3: We set new professional development standards by constructing a nationally available on-line resource. It describes the steps along the career path into research and teaching, offering new resources for students, postdoctoral fellows and their advisers. This resource is accessed through the California Alliance?s website. This online guide to career development sets a new standard. It is an annotated, curated guide with carefully selected informational resources as well as comments providing insider insight and advice from faculty and alumni of each of the four institutions. The resource includes useful resources offered by relevant scientific professional associations, and other peer institutions. This on-line professional development resource is unique in its focus on the MPS and Engineering fields&mdash;unlike most available on-line resources that focus on the biological and health sciences. Objective 4: We were highly successful in promoting our pool of Alliance students and post-doctoral fellows to faculty and post-doctoral ranks. For example, we leveraged the NSF funds available through AGEP with internal funds at each university to support many more post-doctoral fellows than we allotted in the NSF proposal.  Moreover, we generated a strong pool of URM applicants that are now in faculty positions both within the Alliance universities and elsewhere.
