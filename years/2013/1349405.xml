<AbstractNarration>This international, multi-institutional, collaborative project will advance our knowledge regarding how alluvial and fluvial geomorphic systems respond to climate change at millennial timescales in arid and semiarid regions. The project specifically aims to analyze the coupled hydrologic and geomorphic response during post-glacial times in the arid Elqui valley in northern Chile.  Cosmogenic nuclides, luminescence dating and soils stratigraphy will be used to characterize, in terms of process and timing, the production, storage and transport of sediment from hillslopes to alluvial and fluvial reaches. Two nearby lacustrine records will be analyzed over the same temporal window with a suite of paleoenvironmental indicators. The robust coupled dataset is expected to contribute to our understanding of the local and regional pedology, geomorphology, tectonics and paleoenvironment of the semiarid western Andes.  Furthermore, understanding how landforms and soils evolve over Holocene timescales will contribute to geologic research of similar regions in other parts of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will contribute to the advancement of undergraduate geology programs at University of Nevada Reno and California State University Bakersfield, the latter a Hispanic-Serving Institution.  The project  has a strong international partnership with Centro de Estudios Avanzado en Zonas Aridas (CEAZA) in La Serena, Chile, as well as Dalhousie University in Canada and will provide international research experiences for two U.S. undergraduate students.  The research will aid land use planning and hazards mitigation efforts for the region as well as other parts of the world with similar arid environments.   Outreach activities will be coordinated with the Chilean partner.  This project is jointly supported by the Geomorphology and Land Use Dynamics, Paleoclimatology, and International Science and Engineering programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The principal outcomes for this component of NSF Grant GLD #1349405 titled "Collaborative Research: Millennial variability of hillslope dynamics and alluvial aggradation in semiarid regions: a view from the southern Hemisphere" are as follows:  Two cores of lake sediments were acquired in the upper Elqui River Valley drainage of the Andes at 3-4.4 km (10,000-13,000 ft) above sea level east of La Serena, Chile by a team including scientists from CSU Bakersfield, the Desert Research Institute, and CEAZA of the Universidad de la Serena.

The Laguna de Cerritos Blancas core was dated by paleomagnetic secular variation (PSV) correlation and 14C back to 4,000 years before present; the Laguna del Cepo core by 14C back to 11,000 years before present. PSV correlation with a marine core record and the 14C dating of both charcoal and bulk sediment organics yielded ages not distorted by redeposition and/or lake resident effect. Collectively, the proxy data suggested wetter and generally stormier intervals of time after 5.5 ka and, more specifically, from 11.0-9.5 ka, from 8.3-7.7 ka, from 5.5-4.9 ka, from 4.4-2.6 ka, and from 2.2 to the recent past. These intervals are very consistent with palynology from the same core and the mapping and dating of alluvial fans in the same drainage area by collaborators from CEAZA and the Desert Research Institute, respectively. The effects of a major cooling event in the Northern Hemisphere (the so-called "8.2 ka event"), suggested to be of global significance, was detected in this study. This event apparently manifested itself in the study region as period of anomalously intense storms. The resulting record of paleoclimate fills a hole in the global database of detailed paleoclimate records for the past 10,000 years. It suggests a specific time-dependent, latitudinal migration of at least two major atmospheric circulation features (the "Westerlies" and the "South Pacific Anticyclone" into and out of the study region. Thus it will be of interest to modelers of global climate change. One M.S. student and two undergraduate students were significantly involved in this research. All three were women and two are from populations underrepresented in STEM fields. Two travelled to Chile multiple times for field work and a presentation at the Congreso de Geologico de Chile.

The success of the method used in this subproject are encouraging toward continuing collaborations between the Chilean research center and two U.S. universities/research centers. A followup proposal is in preparation. The research was published as two peer-reviewed presentations at international meetings, one finished M.S. thesis, and a manuscript that will be submitted by the end of the summer.
