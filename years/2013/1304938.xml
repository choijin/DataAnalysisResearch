<AbstractNarration>An award is made to establish a thematic collection network that will digitize and make accessible media recordings associated with physical voucher specimens, broadly organized around the research theme of understanding the evolution and ecology of communication signals. Research on these questions has been challenged by the relative inaccessibility of the signal recordings and their associated physical specimens. This project will meet this challenge by partnering together multiple biological research collections and the Macaulay Library of Natural Sounds, the world's largest scientific archive of animal signal recordings. Collectively, these institutions will co-curate and make accessible digitized and vouchered recordings of the communication signals of birds, frogs, fish and insects, and will establish direct and transparent links across collections between physical voucher specimens and their digitized recordings. This project will make accessible digital audio recordings of animal signals that can be used to address a host of scientific questions, including the responses of animals to anthropogenic noise and other human activities. By providing a useful co-curation system and encouraging collection of recordings along with physical specimens, this project will have a transformative influence on the way that researchers collect and use biological specimens in the future, and will serve as a useful model for collections facing similar co-curation challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will also provide materials for extensive educational outreach at all age levels, and will have significant conservation impacts because the digitized material will contribute directly to our ability to assess and monitor biodiversity. Finally, this project will expand biological collection methods and help train the "next generation" of museum curators, collectors, and researchers. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).</AbstractNarration>

The goal was to create a database linking recorded animal sounds and the actual recorded animals now vouchered as museum specimens. Our portion of the project centered around a large collection (~700) of 5? and 7? reel-to-reel tapes housed at the Biodiversity Collections (formerly Texas Natural History Collections/Texas Natural Science Center). These tapes contained the call recordings of frogs and toads collected and recorded by Biodiversity Collections curators, staff, and students between 1953 and 1980. Recordings and collections were focused in Texas, but significant observations were made in Arizona and Central America. Because of their age, the tape recordings were in danger of deteriorating, so the opportunity to digitize the collection through the TCN was serendipitous. The entire audio collection was inventoried at The University of Texas, including ~100 cassette tapes recorded by students and faculty between 1998?2010 (Latin America, SE United States), and packed for transport by van by LaDuc to Cornell University and the Macaulay Library. Over 2900 individual recordings from the Biodiversity Collections were digitized and archived by the Macaulay Library.</p> <p>Back in Austin, we began to compile a database of voucher specimens in our collection that had been recorded. Some of the field notes and specimen records contained information allowing us to link a particular specimen to a named tape and/or field site, but in other cases, the necessary information had been recorded in the field on the tapes by the researcher. With this list, we looked through our paper archives for any additional field data associated with the specimens or recording events. Our final step was to photograph each specimen to provide a digital archive of the specimen itself to link to the digitized call record. In some cases, multiple animals were recorded at a given site (a chorus of frogs and/or toads) and multiple specimens were collected and preserved in the voucher collection with no specific identification for those recorded individuals. In this case, voucher specimens were treated as representatives of the population and photographed. In all, over 1600 individual specimens were imaged, with each specimen being photographed twice (dorsal and ventral views).</p> <p>Results from this work will benefit researchers and land managers across the Americas. &nbsp;Call recordings from a large number of species will now be available to listen and to study by workers from around the world. Almost all of these calls could not be accessed in their previous format and their discoverability has been enhanced through their digitization and placement on the Macaulay Library site. Images of the frogs and toads aid researchers in verifying species identifications and can help link size and shape variation to variation in frog calls. Additionally, because these tapes were recorded from a range of localities over seven decades, there are opportunities for researchers to investigate variation over place and time. Increased accessibility of these data will open the doors for many research projects for years to come.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/15/2019<br>      Modified by: Travis&nbsp;Laduc</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1304938/1304938_10243105_1557946910792_TNHC_Herp31728_D--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1304938/1304938_10243105_1557946910792_TNHC_Herp31728_D--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Dorsal image of Hypopachus barberi (Barber's Sheep Frog); TNHC 31728"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1304938/1304938_10243105_1557946910792_TNHC_Herp31728_D--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Dorsal image of Hypopachus barberi (Barber's Sheep Frog); TNHC 31728"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Dorsal image of Hypopachus barberi (Barber's Sheep Frog) recorded and collected 27 June 1964 by Nelson and Nelson in Guatemala: Quezaltenango: Quezaltenango.
