<AbstractNarration>SES- 1324367&lt;br/&gt;Craig Jenkins&lt;br/&gt;Andrew Martin&lt;br/&gt;Ohio State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study examines the organization of online activism in a contemporary context. This addresses a key gap in current literature, which treats online activism in isolation from other mobilization processes.  Our key hypotheses are: 1) Online activism is embedded in existing social networks and hence reflects the networks and social commitments online activists have developed in other contexts, 2) framing reflects these networks and commitments which shape the resonance of groups' strategic communications, and 3) groups that gear their messaging and tactics around these preexisting networks are more effective at mobilizing broader public support for public initiatives. This study uses regulatory initiatives in Ohio as its primary testbed for these arguments by:  a) conducting surveys of online and offline activists; b) analyzing framing in the Twitter messages associated with these efforts; c) examining the network structure of these communications and their links to mobilization efforts of the rival groups; and d) linking the above dynamics to the public opinion and the outcomes of the initiatives. The investigators also compare this Ohio Twitter network to parallel initiatives in Wisconsin to confirm the similarity to this other online activity. This addresses several major gaps in existing studies of online activism and communications:   How do the broader community networks influence the content and diffusion of Twitter communications?  Do online and offline network ties equally or interactively facilitate activism at both the community and individual levels?  How do online and offline communications affect public opinion and initiative outcomes? The answers to these questions will strengthen our understanding of how online activism fits in the broader context of contemporary activism as well as generate new text analysis tools for studying communications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The major impact of this study will be to inform the interdisciplinary study of the growth, organization and impact of online communications in the arena of activism. This study will enable understanding of how online communication content and network interacts with, and are embedded in, offline communications and networks to shape mobilization. The project will also generate new textual analysis tools for social scientists studying online communications. Additionally, the project provides training for graduate students who are directly involved in the research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project examined the use of online communication methods in social movement campaigns by studying the recruitment of political activists and their attempts to influence voters and other activists in two special issue elections that were held in Ohio in November 2011.  The project developed and evaluated the use of petition surveys as a method for studying political activists, finding that we could develop a representative sample from a relatively inexpensive online survey.  Data from an online credit bureau/information aggregator provided an effective way to evaluate the representativeness of the sample and to create weights to adjust the resulting sample.  The study found that over three-fourths of the political activists in these campaigns were using social media as a way to recruit and influence other activists and voters.  Most of their online effort focused on influencing family and friends (i.e. strong ties) with little focus on influencing the general public or elected officials and public figures.  Overall, online communications seems to work.  About a third of these activists reported having successfully used social media to alter someone?s views or to recruit them to attend a meeting or donate time or money to the campaign.  These activists tended to be older, better educated, and more affluent than the average Ohio citizen and the majority had a history of past political activism.  Most self-identified ideologically as either ?strong liberal? or ?strong conservative? depending on the special issue under question.   The project also developed machine-learning methods for coding the sentiment and the specific advocacy frame invoked in the Twitter posts, finding that over half of all political Tweets lack a clear frame.  Despite the fact that social media and other online methods make it possible to break down distance by communicating with others at large geographic scale, we found that the overwhelming majority of these online communications were with others located geographically within 10 miles of the sender, reinforcing the idea that most volunteer online political communication is focused on preexisting strong tie networks.
