<AbstractNarration>Data centers worldwide use approximately 30 billion watts of electricity&lt;br/&gt;with data centers in the United States using approximately 8 to 10&lt;br/&gt;billion watts. Power consumption of datacenter systems is expected to&lt;br/&gt;continue to grow both absolutely and as a percentage of national&lt;br/&gt;consumption. The goal of the proposed research is to develop massively&lt;br/&gt;parallel processor arrays that work in conjunction with traditional&lt;br/&gt;enterprise-class processors to compute datacenter workloads with vastly&lt;br/&gt;greater efficiency. The proposed research may lead to new applications&lt;br/&gt;and capabilities that were previously constrained by power dissipation&lt;br/&gt;or processing throughput.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project participants will propose, model, develop, and characterize&lt;br/&gt;novel fine-grain many-core architectures, VLSI chip designs, and&lt;br/&gt;application algorithms for a processor array serving as a co-processor&lt;br/&gt;or functional unit. The proposed programmable fine-grained many-core&lt;br/&gt;processor array contains no algorithm-specific hardware and is of a core&lt;br/&gt;granularity that is very lightly explored in prior work. The array will&lt;br/&gt;operate inside or near, and in co-ordination with a host&lt;br/&gt;enterprise-class processor and compute key computational kernels often&lt;br/&gt;with similar or higher performance than the host processor, but with&lt;br/&gt;orders of magnitude higher energy efficiency. During kernel computation,&lt;br/&gt;the host processor could attend to other tasks or enter a low power&lt;br/&gt;state. The targeted workloads include sorting, regular expression based&lt;br/&gt;pattern matching, encryption, data compression, video encoding and&lt;br/&gt;decoding, and other enterprise workloads of high impact that are&lt;br/&gt;discovered during the course of the research.</AbstractNarration>

The project has included sub-projects related to the 1000-processor KiloCore 1.78 GHz processor array chip's design, fabrication, programming, and application development. This chip is the highest clock rate processor designed in a university.  This project explored a critical domain and the work accomplished has already made significant impacts in processor designs developed by other researchers. We expect the impacts to continue into the future and to be far-reaching, impacting similar processor array designs to be higher performance and more energy efficient across many workload domains including some outside the scope of this project.
