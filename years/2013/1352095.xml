<AbstractNarration>Two geologic processes fundamentally shaped the early history of the Earth: large, frequent meteor impacts, and formation of crustal material and initiation of plate tectonics. The larger and more frequent impacts to the early Earth would have significantly affected the atmosphere, oceans and surface of the planet. Many of these impacts vaporized the top several meters of ocean water world-wide, excavated and vaporized rock as deep as the upper mantle, and occurred at a frequency that ensured that they influenced the early evolution of life. More than 10 large impacts from 3,500 to 2,400 million years ago excavated different parts of the crust into the upper mantle, and the vaporized rock formed a global plume that condensed and deposited this material as spherule bed deposits.  These deposits are still preserved in South Africa and Australia today. Unfortunately, the early Earth's exposed rock record is limited to small regions and is largely comprised of crustal rocks that are dissimilar to modern crustal rocks, most importantly in lacking any clear indication of oceanic crust forming at spreading centers, or of continental crust creating stable platforms. Thus, studies of the early Earth are commonly limited to models and proxies to determine the early crust formation, timing of initiation of plate tectonics, and continental crust extraction. This CAREER research project will investigate the geochemistry of the preserved meteor impact deposits to determine crustal and mantle composition at the impact sites, and identify plume processes in the atmosphere associated with impact. Many of the concepts intrinsic to the research are spaciotemporal, such as deep time and penetrative thinking. Because STEM performance is highly linked to spatial skills, in parallel with the geological research program, the pedagogic component of this research focuses on developing tools to improve 3D thinking in undergraduate and graduate students, and testing the tools to determine the efficacy in learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The overarching scientific questions that guide the geological component of this research are: (1) What is the ocean crust and upper mantle composition at the site of numerous large impacts from 3.5 to 2.4 billion years ago and what can that tell us about the Precambrian crust? (2) How do impact plumes form, condense, and crystallize and what effect do the plumes have on the atmosphere? This CAREER project will address these questions through an integrated program of fieldwork in the Pilbara craton of Australia and the Kapvaal craton of South Africa, modeling, petrography, micro-computed tomography, scanning electron microscopy, and other geochemical analyses to characterize the ocean/mantle target rock and impactites. This research will provide a unique insight into the composition of otherwise unpreserved Precambrian ocean crust and mantle, and will constrain the geochemical and mechanical processes that occur in impact plumes, to improve our understanding of the impact process as a whole and the environmental effects of these impacts. The pedagogic component of the research plan focuses on the communication of large-scale 3D concepts that are a struggle for students, and helps students move from 2D information typical of a classroom to 3D understanding. Because communicating complex spatial concepts is difficult with language alone, this project studies the effect of gesture in large classrooms, which is a particularly useful tool for early undergraduate learners. In addition, this research investigates the use of 3D printing technology to improve 3D visualization and promote universal design for learning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our understanding of how and when plate tectonics began on Earth is impeded by the rarity of rocks older than 2.5 billion years old.  In particular, we lack remnants of ocean crust forming at spreading centers or clear evidence of how much continental crust had formed. The intellectual merit of this project is that it has provided a unique insight into the composition of otherwise unpreserved Archean ocean crust and mantle, and constrained the geochemical and mechanical processes that occur in impact plumes.     Through investigation of meteor impact deposits from 3.24 billion years ago through 2.47 billion years ago, we see evidence of crustal extraction and evolution.  A 30 km in diameter asteroid vaporized the ancient crust of the Earth and excavated down into the mantle 3.24 billion years ago.  The vaporized material subsequently cooled, condensed, and formed a global deposit of hail-like rock, termed spherules, that are now preserved in South Africa.  Our geochemical analysis determined that the meteor hit ocean crust and underlying mantle that is very similar to modern ocean crust and upper mantle. It is also dissimilar to the ancient terrains that remain today, implying that the site of impact was far from the location where the samples were collected, and that our knowledge of the surface of the Earth at this time is heavily biased by the sparse crust that remains.  Around 2.5 billion years ago, three separate impacts, with spherules still preserved in western Australia and South Africa, indicate excavation of continental crustal material, consistent with models that suggest that the majority of the continental crust on Earth today had formed by that point.      Additional work has indicated that after these plumes of vaporized rock form and begin to cool, they are dense enough for particle collisions, and therefore may have a planet darkening effect.  Interestingly, although various gasses may be introduced into the atmosphere after impact, including CO2, we see no evidence of increased weathering associated with the impact due to acid rain.  This may be due to an already high concentration of CO2 in the Archean atmosphere.     This work has had a broader impact through the development, implementation, and evaluation of spatial tools, and the evaluation of 3D printing for teaching use.  More and more, high school and college classrooms are utilizing 3D technologies as 3D printers are fairly inexpensive and easy to use. The advantage of 3D printing technology is that it can be used to improve 3D visualization and promote universal design for learning. This is particularly important for use in classrooms with visually impaired students. Here, 3D printed materials were systematically tested under laboratory conditions for use in teaching topographic map reading.  Unfortunately, in the test conditions where students were explicitly taught topo maps with the 3D printed technology, or taught using traditional tools with access to the 3D printed materials, students performed more poorly compared to traditional methods.  Pattern recognition may be more important as a first step towards map reading. This emphasizes the need to explicitly assess the use of these new technologies in the classroom and identify optimal strategies for use.
