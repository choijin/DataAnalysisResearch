<AbstractNarration>A key challenge for environmental science is to understand how climate change will interact with other disturbance agents, such as invasive plant species, to impact biodiversity through changes in the range of both native and invasive species. There is overwhelming evidence that many species have shifted their ranges in the past 30 years as the climate has changed. However, observed range shifts and the results of computer modeling based on the current climatic boundaries of species distributions, both fail to provide a strong enough theoretical foundation for making sound predictions of how future changes will affect these distributions. A mechanistic approach that fuses theory with field experimentation is required to truly understand controls over range distributions. In addition, how plants disperse has not been included in models of range shifts except in rudimentary ways.  Yet dispersal may keep many species from responding to climate change, especially for those native species that occur in isolated pockets of the highly fragmented landscapes of today. This project will address this gap in understanding by using a novel climate change experiment at three prairie sites across a 300 mile climate gradient in the Pacific Northwest. It will also estimate historical and recent rates of dispersal of representative prairie plants using molecular genetics techniques, and computer models that include the effects of climate on the survival, reproduction, and rates of dispersal of these plants. A range of education activities will help high school, undergraduate, and graduate students to develop their professional skills. A web site will be developed to focus on the potential impacts of climate change on regional and global biodiversity. Several nongovernmental conservation organizations will be partners in the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will be comprised of three coupled tasks. (1) An established manipulative warming and precipitation study that is embedded within a regional climate gradient will be used to experimentally examine the role of climate versus local factors in controlling the demography of a broad suite of 12 native grass and forb species that currently reach northern range limits in the Pacific Northwest. Demographic models will be used to quantitatively determine the relative effect sizes of local factors (e.g., plant community composition and soil variables), regional-scale climate differences, and interannual climate variability on the vital rates of the focal species. (2) Landscape population genetics will be used to determine dispersal probabilities of eight of the focal species in landscapes that face different barriers to dispersal due to both historical and contemporary land use and vegetation, geographic dispersal barriers, and distance between prairie habitat patches. (3) The first two components will be synthesized in a regional landscape simulation under three climate change scenarios within interior-valley prairies in the Pacific Northwest. The simulation model will then be used to predict whether the focal species are likely to go extinct in all or parts of their current ranges, where they are capable of surviving outside of their current ranges under future climatic conditions, and the probability of reaching these new favorable habitats, if they exist. The effects of increased or decreased landscape resistance to dispersal through loss (e.g., increased development pressure) or gain (e.g., increased prairie restoration) of prairie habitat in the future will also be examined.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In recent decades, many organisms have faced decline due to the effects of global climate change. Since the last glacial maximum around 20,000 years ago, plants and animals were able to make large changes in their geographic ranges in response to gradual warming. However, human activities have made any future shift in geographic distribution much more challenging because 1) the rate of climate change is much more rapid, and 2) in many regions the landscape has been heavily modified leaving small, isolated fragments of natural vegetation. Unfortunately, we have only limited understanding of dispersal in general, and particularly of seed dispersal of plants. Natural plant communities provide habitat for many species, so establishing a thorough understanding of seed dispersal is important for the conservation and management of both plants and animals.</p> <p>We studied the seed dispersal of plants living in upland prairie habitat fragments in the Rogue River Valley region of southern Oregon. To evaluate the effects of landscape features on patterns of seed movement, we used different mapping methods depending on the spatial scale of analysis. At spatial scales of less than one kilometer, we mapped vegetation types using small unmaned arial vehicles (drones) and used photogrammetry methods to generate digital surface models of the sampled region. For larger-scale (one to 100 kilometers) analyses, we used geographic information systems (GIS) and ecological niche modeling (ENM) to estimate plant habitat quality and to characterize landscape features that might affect vector movement. We employed novel methods of plant tissue sample pooling and analysis of genomic sequence data from massive sequencing platforms to evaluate historical patterns of seed dispersal based on effective dispersal (seeds that grow into adult plants) for eight different plant species having different dispersal mechanisms. The high-efficiency methods we developed allowed the sequencing of whole chloroplast genomes of more than 5,700 plant samples. The influence of landscape features on patterns of genetic distance, which reflected the rate of seed dispersal, were evaluated using iterative methods to optimize landscape genetic models of seed movement. Our goals were to understand 1) the seed movement potential across a range of spatial scales for plants having different dispersal mechanisms, 2) the influence of variation in habitat quality on dispersal potential, 3) the effects of landscape features on the behavior of the biotic and abiotic vectors responsible for seed dispersal, and 4) the specific effects of human-modified landscapes on rates and patterns of seed movement.</p> <p>We found that the pattern of seed dispersal is strongly influenced by both the effects of the landscape on vector behavior, and the quality of the habitat for each individual plant species (Fig. 1). In general, wind-dispersed seeds had greater potential to move over longer distances than seeds that lack specific dispersal mechanisms. We found more limited seed movement across regions of high plant habitat quality, and higher rates of long-distance movement across regions used for pasture and agriculture, which represent low habitat quality. Higher rates of dispersal across human-modified landscapes was partly due to the movement behavior of large mammals such as deer and elk, which appear to be important vectors for the movement of seeds of many plant species (Meso Scale in Fig. 2). Dispersal over larger spatial scales may require multiple generations occurring across a sequence of habitat patches (Regional Scale in Fig. 2).</p> <p>Intellectual merit: Overall, the distribution of habitat patches and the types of intervening landscapes had a greater influence on patterns and rates of dispersal than did the distance between patches. Our results indicate that plants and animals may successfully modify their geographic distributions across regions with high proportions of natural vegetation, but dispersal potential is much more limited across heavily modified landscapes.</p> <p>Broader impacts: The course of conducting this research included the participation of a postdoctoral research associate, five graduate students, eight undergraduate students from universities across the country, one high school student, and a high school biology instructor.
