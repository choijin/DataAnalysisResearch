<AbstractNarration>Professor Andrew A. Gewirth and his students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are supported by the Chemical Measurements &amp; Imaging (CMI) Program in the Division of Chemistry to develop new tools to examine the reactivity associated with different types of electrode processes. Featured in this work is the use of advanced Raman and electrochemical surface stress measurements to interrogate electrode composition and reactivity during electrocatalytic events. The processes slated for investigation include the catalysis of nitrate reduction on bare and bimetallic electrode surfaces, carbon dioxide reduction on modified surfaces, especially those involving Ag, and the oxygen evolution reaction.  The group also plans to investigate hydrocarbon oxidation catalysis using non-stoichiometric oxides. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electrocatalysts are substances that promote electrochemical reactions so that they occur more quickly, efficiently or under milder conditions.  Electrochemical reactions are those that proceed with electron transfer, such as the burning of fuel and the plating of metals.  Many important natural and technological processes such as corrosion, deposition, remediation and energy storage involve electrochemical reactions and therefore can be improved by advances in electrocatalyst technology.  The studies that will be conducted in this project will advance electrocatalyst technology by developing tools that can reveal how electrocatalysts influence the structure and behavior of chemicals involved in electrochemical reactions.  The project will include focus on understanding the electrocatalysis of reactions that impact pressing societal needs, such as the reduction of nitrate and carbon dioxide, ubiquitous products of agricultural and industrial activity, respectively and the oxidation of hydrocarbon fuels and water.  This work also serves as a vehicle for interdisciplinary research training.  Students from many backgrounds, including those underrepresented in science, will be mentored, and hands-on science and chemical demonstrations will be performed in local schools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The focus of this grant was to interrogate electrode surfaces and their reactivity using analytical tools.  These tools, which include the relatively new Shell Isolated Nanoparticle Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SHINERS) technique, the kinetic isotope effect (KIE), and electrochemical surface stress measurements, had not seen the intensive use in problems related to electrocatalysis.  Using these techniques we examined a number of surface reactions.   We used surface stress to quantify changes occurring during the oxygen evolution reaction, the insight from which was later used to design new and very active catalysts.  On more traditional surfaces, such as platinum, we developed methodology to combine theory and experiment to quantify the insight from surface stress measurements directly.  We used SHINERS to examine products on electrode surfaces during CO2 reduction and again used the resultant insight to design more active materials for catalysis.  We used Raman spectroscopy to examine molecules that might prevent corrosion on electrode surfaces.  We used the KIE to show that the rate determining step (rds) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)  on precious metals such as platinum cannot involve hydrogen bond making or breaking, a result which has considerable consequence for understanding the mechanism of this important reaction.  Alternatively, determining the KIE for so-called non precious metal (NPM) ORR catalysts let us know that this class of molecules reacted by forming a bond with hydrogen prior to or during the rds, different from the precious metals.   We also used the KIE to show that the oxygen evolution reaction proceeds in yet another different manner.  The focus on oxygen reduction chemistry led us to try to understand the active sites in NPM ORR catalysts.  These materials, formed by high temperature pyrolysis, have been the subject of over 50 years of investigation, but insight into the identity of the catalytic center remained problematic.  We developed a new method to purify the NPM catalysts, involving a high temperature chlorine gas treatment.  Using the procedure and subsequent interrogation, we showed that the active site for ORR was likely a carbon encapsulated iron nanoparticle.  In addition to the scientific outcomes, the broader impacts of this work related to graduate student training (ca. 8 graduate students were involved in different phases of this work), and to developing methods and procedures with which understand electrochemical phenomena, phenomena which are at the heart of advanced energy production and consumption schemes.
