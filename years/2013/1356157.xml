<AbstractNarration>Roger Christianson of Southern Oregon University will oversee an international symposium on the role of German, Austrian, and Japanese anthropologists in annexed territories (in Eastern Europe and Asia) during the first half of the twentieth century through the Second World War. The research will aid in our understanding of the role that anthropological science played in colonial and wartime Europe and Asia. They will discuss the roles these anthropologists played in consigning Polish people from immediate death to mindless labor, the records they created, how the records were used to find Polish survivors after the war, and what transpired once survivors were found. Also to be discussed will be research relating to the investigations of Japanese anthropologists in Asia, beginning with the colonization of Taiwan in 1895 through military expansion during World War II.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This anthropological research documents little known information about the role of anthropologists during wartime, how their services were used to support German and Japanese ambitions, and how anthropologists today search for survivors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This symposium will be conducted before scientists, graduate students, and high school students at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Pacific Division, annual conference at the University of California, Riverside. Abstracts of the presentations will be published.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Although the extremes of human cruelty by the Germans and Japanese during WWII are widely known, there is yet much to be learned from records of the victims kept by the German and Japanese governments. Also, it is important to bring details to light in order to refute those who would deny that the events actually occurred.     The symposium was structured to discuss 1) the role of the Institut f&uuml;r Deutsche Osterbeit (IDO) in Poland during World War II and the records created by the IDO Section on Race and Ethnicity, how those records were used to find survivors of the War, survivors' recollections of the SectionÆs activities, and how the science from the records were used to document Polish migration patterns and 2) what the Japanese anthropologists carried out on Taiwan and Korea during JapanÆs colonial period and during the War.     There were approximately seventeen attendees in the audience, which consisted included professional members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) including several members of the Pacific Division of AAAS, students from a variety of universities including the University of California, Riverside, and members of the general public. Three of the panel members, including the chair, were from the United States. Those participating from outside the United States came from Japan, Korea, and Poland. At least one member of the audience came from a region (Podhale) in Poland that was being discussed at the symposium.     As a result of bring brought together for this symposium, several outcomes among the panel members have been identified:     1. Drs.
