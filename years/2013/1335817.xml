<AbstractNarration>PI: Kuhn, John&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1335817&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of South Florida&lt;br/&gt;Title: A Plasmon-enhanced Temperature-swing Process for Conversion of Carbon Dioxide to Carbon Monoxide&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines a novel photochemical route for the transformation of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide and oxygen.  The primary research goals are (1) to discover perovskite-type oxides with a large change in oxygen content (delta) for small changes in temperature in a low temperature range (T=350 to 400 deg. C), (2) to design and demonstrate monometallic silver and bimetallic silver-based particles that have peak plasmonic absorption wavelengths across the visible light spectrum resulting in a maximum temperature increase, (3) to identify the catalytic consequences of the composite materials (Ag-based phase supported on the perovskite-type oxides) on the molecular processes associated with carbon dioxide conversion and oxygen generation, and (4) to validate the predicted behaviors of prepared materials in photo-induced temperature swing separation and conversion of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance the field of carbon management as well as topics of optical properties of metal nanoparticles, design of mixed metal oxides, and synergy between these two sets of materials. The project will merge the experimental and computational aspects in both the research and in the student training.  Carbon dioxide emissions are an imminent and global problem and the proposed effort could significantly impact the status quo. The project will also contribute to the focus on sustainability and energy research and teaching at USF through a multi-pronged endeavor of activities with an emphasis on building students with both experimental and computational experiences and skills.</AbstractNarration>
