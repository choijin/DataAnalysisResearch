<AbstractNarration>The 54th Maize Genetics Conference (MGC) will be held at the Pheasant Run Resort, St. Charles, IL on March 14-17, 2013.  This conference assembles scientists from industry and academia to discuss the latest research developments on many areas encompassing  maize genetics  The 2013 conference will have an outstanding program consisting of four plenary speakers: Michael J. Scanlon (Cornell University), Julia Bailey-Serres (University of California, Riverside), Jen Sheen (Harvard Medical School), and James Holland (USDA-ARS/North Carolina State University).  The core program will consist of 35 18-minute oral talks scheduled in the morning sessions and two afternoon poster sessions with the four plenary talks held in the evening.  The 2013 MGC meeting will have a special drought workshop consisting of oral presentations by scientists from academia and industry [Marc Cooper (Dupont Pioneer), Roberto Tuberosa (University of Bologna) and Dan Dyer (Syngenta Seeds) followed by a panel discussion on future strategies to enhance drought tolerance in this major cereal crop. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Maize Genetics Conference is not only an exciting scientific meeting but provides outstanding opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral scientists to interact with outstanding scientists within and outside the maize community.  The meeting actively emphasizes and supports the training of students and postdocs in developing their communication and interpersonal skills.  The conference is unique in that it attempts to support the hotel and meal costs of all student attendees.  Detailed efforts are planned to broaden the participation of women and members of groups under-represented in the sciences. The funding provided by NSF will broaden participation and help defray the costs of participation of students from the U.S. scientific community.</AbstractNarration>

Broader impacts  Attracting fresh young talent to the maize genetics field will be critical for the continuing improvement of the number one U.S. crop. Funding from NSF was used to broaden participation at the meeting through outreach and recruiting efforts that sought to support Conference attendance by first-time attending students, and students, postdocs and young faculty from underrepresented groups with an interest in exploring research possibilities in maize genetics.   40 students who were first-time attendees to the Maize Genetics Conference were supported by having their conference package costs  paid. They represented 37 different laboratories at 22 different institutions. They were all U.S. citizens, 21 were females, 19 were males. 37 were Caucasians, 2 "other" and 1 did not report ethnicity. NSF funds were also used to support the MaGNET (Maize Genetics Network Enhancement through Travel) program which seeks to bring in underrepresented minority students, early career scientists, and mentors accompanying minority students. MaGNET awards provide conference packages, registration fees and travel support for successful applicants. The 10 MaGNET awardees included 5 graduate students, 3 undergraduate students, 1 early-career scientist, and 1 Faculty Mentor accompanying an eligible student. 8 were U.S. citizens and 2 permanent residents. There were 3 Native Americans, 3 African Americans, 3 Hispanics and the Faculty Mentor was Asian. 7 were males and 3 females.
