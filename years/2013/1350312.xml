<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project, which is jointly supported by Molecular Biophysics in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Division of Physics in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, is to employ simulations to identify ways that biomolecular machines convert chemical energy into mechanical work. In particular, this project seeks to reveal how disorder is utilized to increase efficiency and accuracy in the cell. The molecular system of interest is the ribosome, a large complex responsible for building proteins. Within the ribosome, large-scale conformational rearrangements facilitate the transfer of energy between chemical and mechanical steps. To identify the molecular origins of these steps, this project will investigate the dynamics of Elongation Factors, the molecules that serve as the ribosome's "engine." By identifying the functional properties of these molecules, these studies will reveal the physical principles that control biological function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This  project will have societal impacts, at both the local and international level. This work will engage undergraduate students from underrepresented groups and expose them to a diverse range of topics in the life sciences and physical sciences. As members of the research team, these students will be tightly integrated within the scientific community, having opportunities to present their work at conferences and other public venues. Additionally, the methods used in this project will be incorporated within the undergraduate curriculum, which will instill an understanding of the connection between basic science education and real-world research. This project will also provide nationally-accessible training workshops in molecular modeling to the broader scientific community. This will enable trainees to apply theoretical approaches when designing more-precise experimental studies. Internationally, this project will contribute to the growth of biophysics research abroad through direct scientific collaborations with Brazil. Further, these collaborations will enrich the scientific and cultural experience of students in the US by immersing them in an international research environment. This will give them opportunities to develop a global network of colleagues, which will help them become internationally recognized scientific leaders.</AbstractNarration>
