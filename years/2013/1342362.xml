<AbstractNarration>Technical description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grant in Engineering (BRIGE) will support the design, implementation, and validation of an innovative framework for the development of chemical models tailored for Computational Fluid Dynamic simulations of complex reactive flows. This research program will (1) devise and implement a strategy combining reaction network analysis and model optimization to generate chemical schemes that optimally and simultaneously satisfy accuracy and computational cost requirements, as dictated by the user's application and available resources, (2) benchmark this approach against conventional chemical model development techniques, (3) apply the resulting tools to the modeling of practical transportation fuels combustion, and (4) establish an effective feedback mechanism between model development and actual performances in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to enable further algorithm improvements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader significance and importance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Novel energy conversion technologies show an increased sensitivity to the chemical kinetics and their interaction with flow dynamics, a trend that has to be carefully considered to enable computational design of these systems in the near future.  In this context, the proposed research and education program aims at establishing a practical connection between the recent outstanding progress made in fundamental molecular chemistry, computer power, and CFD. In particular, this research provides a path forward to address the ubiquitous issue in CFD, faced by researchers and engineers alike, of finding chemical models appropriate for specific applications and computational resources. A strong educational effort will be established to raise awareness of the benefits and limitations of using low-order chemistry description in CFD. This effort initially will take the form of undergraduate-level course material development, and large-scale dissemination of models and training material through a dedicated online platform.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadening participation activities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coincidently with our research and general education program, outreach activities will be initiated to specifically attract and retain women in advanced curriculum in energy sciences with strong high-performance computing (HPC) components. Our specific goals are to (1) introduce a series of hands-on initiatives at the undergraduate level, directly inspired by our research activities, to transform the outlook female students have on large scale computing technologies in the context of energy science, (2) provide undergraduate research and mentoring opportunities in HPC and energy through summer internships with industrial collaborators, and academic year individual research projects, and (3) create a strong online presence and a sustainable networking infrastructure at the national level through active participation at selected events and conferences. The success of our broadening participation activities will be quantified through events attendance and surveys, class enrollment numbers and feedback, and the use of Google Analytics to track online impact.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has been funded through the Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grants in Engineering solicitation, which is part of the Broadening Participation in Engineering Program of the Engineering Education and Centers Division.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Predictive simulations of combustion systems to accelerate the design of novel, more efficient reactors require the careful consideration of the chemical kinetic processes involved in converting a liquid fuel into heat, desirable products such as carbon dioxide and water, and undesirable products such as nitrous oxides or particulates. In this context, the overall goal of the project was the formulation, implementation, and assessment of a novel framework for the development of compact chemical models for complex fuels combustion, so that the combustion characteristics and dynamics of real fuels, from conventional diesel or jet fuels to advanced, renewable fuel mixtures, can be captured in Computational Fluid Dynamics of combustion systems. To address the need for flexibility in the fuel definition and broaden potential application areas, we developed an automatic methodology that combines the definition of appropriate surrogate fuels, which are simple, well defined mixtures of a few components only, with efficient model reduction algorithms and the capability to robustly assemble multi-component kinetics mechanisms from existing single-component kinetic schemes with limited user input. To test the resulting algorithm, we assembled a model for a jet fuel surrogate containing three components: dodecane, xylene, and methyl-cyclohexane. The model was validated against a very broad database of experimental data, yielding overall a very good agreement between simulation results and experimental data. The work is described in two publications, one of them still under preparation, and has led to several conference posters and presentations. The research activities supported through the grant have been accompanied by an educational effort aiming to alleviate specific cultural and training barriers significantly restricting participation of women in graduate degrees in Computational Science and Engineering. This effort has resulted in the development and submission of several collaborative proposals to broaden and promote diverse student involvement and training in Computational Science at Cornell, both at the graduate and undergraduate level, through new courses and improved mentoring and networking.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/21/2016<br>      Modified by: Perrine&nbsp;Pepiot</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1342362/1342362_10263459_1458551282659_jetfuel_ignition--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1342362/1342362_10263459_1458551282659_jetfuel_ignition--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Ignition delay times of jet fuels"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1342362/1342362_10263459_1458551282659_jetfuel_ignition--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Ignition delay times of jet fuels"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Ignition delay times of jet fuels: comparison between existing models and the automatic model development framework developed in this project.
