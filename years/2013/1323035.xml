<AbstractNarration>This project is taking advantage of the previously-untapped synergy between extremely rapid microwave-assisted organic synthesis (MAOS) techniques and new pedagogical approaches to develop and evaluate a student-centered instructional approach for the sophomore-level organic laboratory. With the laboratory time gained through the use of MAOS, students now use a laboratory period for experimental design, analysis, debriefing, troubleshooting, and optimization, allowing for inquiry cycles that are both reflective of typical scientific practice and effective in promoting desirable cognitive outcomes. This approach has transformed organic laboratory instruction at Allegheny College, St. Mary's College, and Queensborough Community College, shifting the focus from verification to experimental design and collaborative construction of knowledge. Laboratory modules being developed and refined include an array of content designed for easy adoption and implementation, including student lab companion materials, pre-lab activities, and case studies; reagent and instrument prep sheets; instructor's guides; spectra of relevant compounds; and assessment rubrics. The project team is evaluating student thinking during lab, content learning, and attitudes toward science associated with the new instructional approach via analyses of pre- and post-treatment survey responses, classroom observations, student and faculty interviews, and student laboratory reports.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported the development and dissemination of new laboratories designed to foster greater student involvement and ownership of their work by incorporating in-lab time for student trial, analysis and redesign.  It was anticipated that allowing students the time to analyze results, think about how they could adjust reaction conditions and rerun the experiment would lead to an increase in higher order thinking about the chemistry.  To gain this time, students would need to have thought deeply about what they were going to accomplish during the lab period before coming to lab, then be able to speed up reaction time so as to allow time for running an experiment multiple times. Pre-laboratory activities were created to better prepare students before lab, and microwave assisted technology was introduced to decrease reaction time so that students could run initial reactions quickly, analyze the results, and make decisions regarding modification of the experiment.  Finally, external reviewers with expertise in collecting, analyzing and interpreting data on student engagement and learning were used to evaluate the success of these new laboratories.  One challenge we faced in achieving this goal was to introduce new labs with greater responsibility placed on the students with regard to design, and how they would spend their time in lab.  A concern was that students receive little credit for work in lab, yet the amount of work students must put into preparing for a lab is substantial.  We wanted to strike a balance between increasing student responsibility for design, and overall workload.  We decided to make laboratories multi-week experiences, focus on the introduction of the standard techniques through isolation of natural compounds during the beginning and then move into more reaction-based labs later.  One of these labs went even further by incorporating a collaboration between lower level General Chemistry students and upper level Organic students.  In addition to introducing research activities into these academic labs, students had to effectively communicate results to other students who did not have the same level of training. Students were graded on these communications.  This along with Organic students having enough time to run multiple experiments proved to be a richer learning environment; we saw a 44% increase in students? higher order thinking, as measured by trained external evaluators who compared lab reports from students before and after these labs were introduced.  There was also an increase in students? behavior during labs as determined through external trained observers.  These observers noted students spending more time analyzing their data and designing their experiments, with a decrease in waiting, asking questions and collecting data.  Though differences in performance on exam questions remained insignificant, students? general attitude toward science and the usefulness of science education was more positive among students who experienced the new laboratories.  This was determined through pre and post lab interviews with randomly selected students.  Interviews with laboratory instructors who were not involved with this study, but who had instructed these labs both before and during the study felt that the faster reaction times did free up lab time for other learning activities, that repetition of techniques cemented skills, and that moving away from "cookbook" labs to open-ended, student-driven experiments led to more engagement and critical thinking.  Students arrived better prepared and more interested in the lab due to the new pre-lab materials, and using smaller quantities encouraged students to handle chemicals with greater care.  This project also supported the development of a free access website (miblabs.omeka.net) where faculty can upload and download laboratories and supporting material for easy adoption by any institution of higher learning.  To bring awareness of this resource, three workshops were held where attending faculty first ran one of the new labs, and then worked on developing their own labs.  The investigators also presented these new labs and results on student engagement and learning at national and regional meeting, and feel that they are on their way to building a community of scientists who are willing to better prepare our next generation.  We believe that this new style of lab has revealed that more student-centered design and engagement in the academic laboratories better prepares students for jobs that require higher order thinking, being a constructive member of a team and using effective communication skills.  While building these skills, there does not need to be a trade-off on learning fundamental concepts.        Last Modified: 11/30/2017       Submitted by: Andrew S Koch]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
