<AbstractNarration>The most significant performance and energy bottlenecks in a computer are&lt;br/&gt;often caused by the storage system, because the gap between storage device&lt;br/&gt;and CPU speeds is greater than in any other part of the machine.  Big data&lt;br/&gt;and new storage media only make things worse, because today's systems are&lt;br/&gt;still optimized for legacy workloads and hard disks.  The team at Stony&lt;br/&gt;Brook University, Harvard University, and Harvey Mudd College has shown that&lt;br/&gt;large systems are poorly optimized, resulting in waste that increases&lt;br/&gt;computing costs, slows scientific progress, and jeopardizes the nation's&lt;br/&gt;energy independence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, the team is examining modern workloads running on a variety of&lt;br/&gt;platforms, including individual computers, large compute farms, and a&lt;br/&gt;next-generation infrastructure, such as Stony Brook's Reality Deck, a&lt;br/&gt;massive gigapixel visualization facility.  These workloads produce combined&lt;br/&gt;performance and energy traces that are being released to the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second, the team is applying techniques such as statistical feature&lt;br/&gt;extraction, Hidden Markov Modeling, data-mining, and conditional likelihood&lt;br/&gt;maximization to analyze these data sets and traces.  The Reality Deck is&lt;br/&gt;used to visualize the resulting multi-dimensional performance/energy data&lt;br/&gt;sets.  The team's analyses reveal fundamental phenomena and principles that&lt;br/&gt;inform future designs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Third, the findings from the first two efforts are being combined to develop&lt;br/&gt;new storage architectures that best balance performance and energy under&lt;br/&gt;different workloads when used with modern devices, such as solid-state&lt;br/&gt;drives (SSDs), phase-change memories, etc.  The designs leverage the team's&lt;br/&gt;work on storage-optimized algorithms, multi-tier storage, and new optimized&lt;br/&gt;data structures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we investigated how computers can use their hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state disk drives (SSDs) as efficiently as possible.  Our goal was to save both time and energy.  Disk drives (of both types) are the slowest parts of computer systems, so making them faster has a direct effect on the performance that users see.  As it turns out, improving speed also saves electricity, so we were able to concentrate on making things faster and more efficient at the same time.  One of the most important things that affect disk-drive performance is the question of precisely where information is stored on the disk, in relation to what has already been used.  The situation is analogous to a room full of filing cabinets: if you have already opened the top drawer of the third cabinet from the left, it is easy to look at other files in that same drawer.  It is slightly more work, but still fairly easy, to look for files in other drawers from that same cabinet, or from the cabinet right next to it.  But if what you want is on the other side of the room, you have to waste time walking there before you can see the file.  In the same way, computer disk drives "like" to read and write data that is "close" to what they are already using.  In our project, we investigated the problem of how to arrange data on the disk drive so that the computer can get to it quickly.  Returning to the filing-cabinet analogy, it is as if we had an assistant who could predict which files we were going to be interested in on a particular day.  The assistant would then rearrange the files in the cabinet so that the first thing we wanted was at the front of the top drawer, the second was just behind it, and so forth.  Thanks to the assistant, we wouldn't have  to waste time walking back and forth in the filing room.  The trick, of course, is to find a way to automate the assistant's work.  Although we did not completely solve this difficult problem, we gained significant understanding of how to approach it, which will help future researchers invent a complete solution.
