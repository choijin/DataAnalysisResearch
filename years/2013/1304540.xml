<AbstractNarration>Aerosol feedbacks represent one of the highest uncertainties in the dynamics of the Earth system (IPCC, 2007). Paleoclimate records show significant fluctuations in dust associated with changes in climate. However, the role of dust as a feedback to climate change in the past and into the future remains highly uncertain. The proposed working hypothesis is that a positive feedback between dust, radiation, precipitation and temperature is an important driver for abrupt climate change. Researchers from the University of Miami will focus on two periods of abrupt climate change in the Atlantic: Heinrich Event 1 and the termination of the African Humid Period. These are two periods of abrupt climate change for which the source of the abruptness is still a matter of debate. PIs will run transient paleoclimate simulations using the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Earth System Model (CESM) coupled to an interactive dust model, synthesize paleo-dust and drought records, and test the sensitivity of their results to changes in dust optical properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will advance our understanding and knowledge of forcing and feedbacks associated with desert dust in past periods of abrupt climate change, and determine if climate change is more abrupt when dust is an interactive component. Through model-data synthesis, the PIs will analyze if the inclusion of dust climate feedback in paleoclimate simulations bring models into better agreement with observations. Results from the transient paleoclimate simulations will be made available online to facilitate paleoclimate model-data intercomparisons. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The project will establish linkages between the University of Miami, NCAR, and Cornell University through the use of CESM and the participation in the CESM Paleoclimate Working Group. Research activities will be presented at scientific conferences, workshops, and community outreach events, such as the science caf√© (http://www.rsmas.miami.edu/info/seminar-archive/msg01683.html). Knowledge gained from this work will be used to prepare curriculum material for undergraduate and graduate courses taught at the University of Miami. The PIs participate in the Earth Science Women's Network (ESWN), a group that promotes mentoring, support, professional collaborations, and career development with other women working in science and technology. In addition, the PIs participate in the annual RSMAS Women in Science day. This program targets sixth and seventh grade girls, and female scientists from the Rosenstiel School lead hands-on activities in their scientific field to engage the young participants.</AbstractNarration>

We hypothesized that significant changes in the amount of atmospheric dust loading could lead to abrupt changes in past climate. To examine this, we performed a set of global climate model simulations with and without dust as an interactive component of the climate system. We focused on two past periods in which dust emission from North Africa was much different than present: the last Heinrich Event 1 (H1; ~18-15 kyrs before present) and the African Humid Period (~8-6 kyrs before present). During H1, increased ice discharge in the North Atlantic severely reduced the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). A weaker AMOC is believed to cause cooling throughout the North Atlantic (due to less heat transport), which would then shift the tropical rainbelt southwards into the warmer Southern Hemisphere. Paleoclimate records indicate Heinrich events were marked by severe aridity and dustiness in the northern tropics. Murphy et al. (2014) was the first to use a global climate model to simulate the climate and dust response to a Heinrich event. We found that changes in surface winds had the largest influence on African dust emissions and that enhanced African dust fluxes led to greater ocean cooling and decreased regional precipitation (Murphy et al., 2014). Our simulated Heinrich dust fluxes, were used to estimate the amount of soluble iron deposition to the oceans since the Last Glacial Maximum (Albani et al., 2016), and to examine the impacts on ocean circulation (Murphy et al., under review). We found that enhanced H1 dust loading has a positive amplification on Heinrich events by further cooling and freshening the North Atlantic and enhancing sea-ice coverage.
