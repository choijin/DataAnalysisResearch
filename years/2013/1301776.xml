<AbstractNarration>The PI would like to study scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory by using two recently developed mathematical theories: theory of mixed motives and theory of cluster varieties. The PI wants to develop further the on-shell approach to scattering amplitudes related to the geometry of  Grassmannians, and to find effective ways to calculate the scattering amplitudes. The PI wants to study a Feynman integral description of the derived category of mixed real Hodge sheaves. The PI wants to study canonical bases in representation theory and geometry, and relate them to the mirror symmetry. He wants to continue his work on moduli spaces of local systems on 2D-surfaces and its quantization, and relationship with representation theory and mirror symmetry. The theory of hyperbolic 3D-manifolds can be viewed as the study of certain local systems on 3D-manifolds with values in one of the simplest complex Lie group. He wants to develop a similar theory for all complex reductive Lie groups, as well as its quantum analog.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;During the last years several new ideas in pure mathematics had a big impact on theoretical physics, and vice verse, many ideas coming from physics had a tremendous impact on pure mathematics. In particular, the ideas of one of the most sophisticated areas of mathematics, theory of motives, found its applications in the problem of calculation of scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory - the data observed in experimenters. On the other hand, the general idea of quantization found its concrete realizations in many of areas of pure mathematics. The PI wants to investigate several concrete problems of number theory, algebraic geometry, and representation theory by using quantum dilogarithms, quantization, quantum cohomology and Feynman integrals, and other tools inspired by physics. The PI wants to pursue the newly found links between the quantum field theory and algebraic geometry to find, in particular, effective ways to calculate the scattering amplitudes.</AbstractNarration>

Such integrals appear not only in Mathematics, but also in Physics, e.g. as scattering amplitudes.     We suggested a new approach to Hodge theory which incorporates in a crucial way several ideas and tools from Theoretical Physics, such as Feynman integrals, Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, Chern-Simons theory. This approach makes manifest hidden Galois type symmetries of the Hodge theory.     We call the emerging theory Quantum Hodge Field Theory (QHFT). It can be viewed as an analog for  complex manifolds of the perturbative approach to the Chern-Simons theory, developed more then 25 years ago by Witten, Kontsevich and the others. The Chern-Simons is a topological quantum field theory assigned to three dimensional topological manifolds. In contrast to this the QHFT does depend on the complex structure on a manifold in a crucial way, and is developed for a complex manifold of an arbitrary dimension. The QHFT is defined by its correlstors, called the Hodge correlators. They are assigned to collections of holonomic D-modules, that is system of algebraic differential equations with finite dimensional spaces of solutions.     Another crucial direction of research was theory of cluster varieties and its applications to Representation Theory and Algebraic Geometry.     It was discovered by Lusztig and Kashiwara that many  vector spaces  in Representation theory have canonical linear bases. Jointly with Fock we suggested a much wider set-up in which canonical bases should exist.

We suggested that such a description is a manifestation of even deeper mirror duality between the two cluster varieties. We showed that this reproduces several well known results in mirror symmetry due to Givental and others.     Another application of cluster varieties, also joint with Linhui Shen, describes defined by Kontsevich and Soibelman numerical invariants, which generalise the enumerative invariants defined by Donaldson and Thomas.
