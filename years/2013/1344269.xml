<AbstractNarration>This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the Linguistics Program and the Perception, Action &amp; Cognition Program in the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral &amp; Economic Sciences; by the Robust Intelligence Program in the Division of Information &amp; Intelligent Systems in the Directorate for Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering; and by the Algorithmic Foundations Program in the Division of Computer and Network Systems in the Directorate for Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discrete, combinatorial systems of structured symbols permeate human cognition in domains such as language, motor control, complex action planning, learning, and higher-level vision.  Nonetheless, the computational apparatus that the brain exploits is based on continuous, activation-based propagation of information through complex networks of neurons. A fundamental problem of the cognitive sciences is how to integrate gradient, continuous neural computation with the discrete combinatorial dimension of cognition. The solution to this puzzle will provide a deeper understanding of the mind and may also serve as the basis of a new generation of computing systems capable of authentically brain-like behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the direction of Dr. Smolensky, the research team will develop an approach to this puzzle by exploring and testing the predictions of their theory of Gradient Symbolic Computation (GSC) in the domain of language. Their efforts will include the development of the formal, mathematical foundations of GSC. In parallel, the PIs will develop a framework for modeling Gradient Symbolic Processing. To that end, the PIs will use computational modeling and experimental psycholinguistic studies of phenomena that typify the morpho-phonological, syntactic, and semantic characteristics of language and language processing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the work include the potential to transform general computing for future approaches to computer design, to provide innovations in computer language processing, and to empower major advances in our understanding of human language, its impairment in disease, and its learning and remediation. The project also strongly engages STEM education. Undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral researchers will all play key roles in highly interdisciplinary STEM research integrating experimental, theoretical, and computational methods. The new type of computation created will provide an integrative framework for developing courses bridging computation theory, psychology, and linguistics. Pedagogical materials developed in these courses will be made publicly available to facilitate undergraduate and graduate program development at other institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><div class="page" title="Page 1"> <div class="section"> <div class="layoutArea"> <div class="column"> <p>Two seemingly contradictory fundamental ideas underpin work in the cognitive sciences. Linguistics and artificial intelligence traditionally rely on discrete <em>symbols</em>: hard-edged categories, with precise rules specifying how symbols are combined in complex arrangements. In contrast, neural computation -- as understood by neuroscience, psychology, and machine learning -- describes the mind, as well as the brain, in terms of continuous <em>activation levels</em>.&nbsp; This NSF INSPIRE project defines an amalgam of these two views: <strong>Gradient Symbolic Computation</strong> (<strong>GSC</strong>). In GSC, data consists of structures built of symbols that have continuously varying activation values. Computations over these Gradient Symbolic Representations are defined by continuous, dynamical neural network algorithms.</p> <p>We have used GSC's partially-activated symbols to advance the understanding of patterns in sound, word, and sentence structure, as well as sentence meaning. GSC provides traction on a frequently-occurring problem in the language sciences: apparent contradictions between two theories remain unresolved because each theory explains data the other cannot. In many cases, GSC allows such theories to be <em>blended together,</em> creating a single analysis that covers a wide range of data not previously explicable within a single theory.&nbsp;For example, in French, certain consonants appear only at the juncture of two special types of words. Theories of French phonology have long debated whether these consonants are at the end of Word1 or the beginning of Word2: each theory accounts for data that the other does not. GSC allows both possibilities to be partially true. Partially-active consonants appear both at the end of Word1 <em>and</em> the beginning of Word2. When the two words are brought together, these partial activations combine to form a single fully-active consonant. Algorithms for automatically learning the partial-activation values of these consonants from data have been developed and demonstrated to be effective. Other blended analyses we have developed address long-standing unresolved theoretical disputes concerning sentence structure (e.g., how event representations are built when verbs combine with phrases describing participants and properties, or small 'particles' like <em>up</em>) and bilingual code-mixing (where multiple linguistic systems are blended together within a single sentence). This work has appeared in prominent journals, and the general framework has been adopted by a growing number of researchers in the international scientific community: more than two dozen GSC analyses in formal linguistics were developed over the course of the grant period, and the number continues to grow.</p> <p>GSC has also substantially advanced our ability to computationally model human linguistic abilities. Using dynamic neural network algorithms, we have developed models that exploit Gradient Symbolic Representations to gradually build up complex representations of sentence structure. These models provide new insight into how brain-like systems can maintain partially activated sentence structures until the reader or listener has received enough information to commit to a particular sentence representation. GSC dynamic models have been proven to achieve their computational goals in principle, and many of the practical challenges arising in particular instantiations of these models have been overcome by innovative computational mechanisms.</p> <p>Models have also been developed, some in collaboration with researchers at Microsoft Research AI, that use Deep Learning in specially-designed neural networks to learn Gradient Symbolic Representations that are optimized for the needs of specific Natural Language Processing tasks in Artificial Intelligence. These tasks include question answering, image captioning, and problem-solving in mathematics and computer programming, and inference of missing information in knowledge bases. This new generation of model exhibits performance that sets a new state of the art in several problem domains. More importantly, the use of Gradient Symbolic Representations yields models that are more <strong>interpretable</strong> than standard Deep Learning models, which are notoriously opaque. New methods have also been developed to use GSC to interpret the learned encodings of information in key <em>standard</em> Deep Learning models, achieving a groundbreaking level of understanding of how particular deep models actually work.</p> <p>The substantial intellectual impacts of the award have gone hand-in-hand with development of technical &nbsp;and human resources. Publicly-available software for GSC modeling has been released. Training and research experience has been provided to undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows at multiple institutions across the United States and Europe. This occurred both in the context of conducting research within the project and through courses and tutorial workshops we held at both national and international venues. Students have received in-depth, hands-on training in linguistic analysis, computational modeling, experimental design, manuscript preparation, and statistical analysis techniques.
