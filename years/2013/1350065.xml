<AbstractNarration>The objective of this EArly-concept Research Grant (EAGER) project is to collect a comprehensive set of fundamental sustainable design principles that will, for the first time, combine existing international sustainable design standards and analytical quantitative models for sustainable design decisions, in order to advance sustainable design theory. With this information, an extensive database of sustainability knowledge will be developed from which novel quantitative metrics can be derived that connect design attributes to sustainability impact. The end result will address sustainable manufacturing and product development needs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this work will give researchers and product developers essential insight into the sustainability of early phase engineering designs by means of a transparent, cohesive system analysis that can be used during the early design phase, leading to a greater dissemination of environmentally friendly design and the availability of more sustainable products in the marketplace. The work will enable designers to better understand sustainable design in both quantitative and qualitative terms, determine ways to manufacture increasingly sustainable products, and communicate sustainability across the supply chain in a standardized way. Giving developers the tools to measure the sustainability of a potential product from the early design phase will facilitate the development of countless new sustainable products, reducing the global environmental impact of product manufacturing, use, and disposal.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this research is to create a preliminary framework for understanding the environmental impact of products throughout the conceptual design phase. Currently, most methods that help engineering designers understand product environmental impact are performed retrospectively, sometimes years after design decisions are made and implemented.

This framework&mdash;called The GREEn Quiz, or Guidelines and Regulation for Early Design for the Environment&mdash;provides users a mean of iterative feedback of the potential environmental impact of design decisions. This method was tested using novice and more expert engineering designers, and its application was shown to increase the number of sustainable design decisions made during the conceptual redesign of an existing consumer product (a toaster), as compared to a control group (see Figure 1).

Broader Impacts: This work is beneficial to stakeholders as the resulting sustainable design framework will be freely accessible to facilitate broad use and applicable to widely varying design?areas, leading to substantive reevaluation of traditional, less-sustainable designs.
