<AbstractNarration>The objective of this award is to develop theories and methods for the control and optimization of bio-manufacturing systems. The research will address issues related to upstream bio-manufacturing processes (where cell cultures secrete proteins through fermentation) and downstream bio-manufacturing processes (consisting of purification steps such as chromatography and filtration). At each step, the yield, throughput, and quality of individual production runs are subject to significant variability due to time varying nature of the cell lines, complex nature of the underlying biological reactions, and stochastic failures due to process uncertainty. The goal of this research is to integrate the theories of the underlying chemical and biological processes with the principles from uncertainty theory and optimization, and develop a knowledge base that will enable improvements yield, quality and throughput of bio-manufacturing operations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will provide decision support to help bio-manufacturers improve efficiency, reduce timelines, and costs. For the upstream bioreactor operations, new stochastic optimization models will be developed to capture the trade-offs related to operating policies and their impact on quality, yield, and total costs. For the downstream operations, new performance evaluation models will be developed to analyze trade-offs related to downstream parameters, such as, the quality of the batch, the resin binding capability, purification cycle times, and efficiency. Leveraging the functional relationships obtained from specialized models for upstream and downstream operations, the research will develop mathematical models for optimizing system design and production schedules. All models will be validated with industry partners and insights obtained from this research will be incorporated into practice. The methodologies developed in this research have potential applications in other emerging areas of advanced manufacturing such as bio-fuels and nano-manufacturing. The research will also train several students and influence university curricula in related areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Recent advances in genetics, genomics and proteomics have led to the development of novel biologic drugs for diseases like cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and many others. Unlike traditional "small molecule" drugs that are chemically synthesized, "biologics" (mostly proteins or peptides) are synthesized using live systems such as bacteria, viruses, or mammalian cells. The manufacture of biologic products using biotechnology is often referred to as biomanufacturing. While the sales of biologics are expected to surpass $140 billion by 2020, biologics are fast becoming the victims of their own success and a looming deficit in biomanufacturing capacity threatens to restrict the commercialization of these products.
