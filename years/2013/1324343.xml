<AbstractNarration>Property concepts (PCs) are a class of stative notions relating to speed, age, dimension, color, value, etc. PCs are consistently lexicalized as adjectives in languages which have this category.  However, PCs may also be lexicalized as nouns or roots, particularly in languages which lack a robust class of adjectives. In an array of typologically diverse and genetically unrelated languages, non-adjectival PC lexemes are found to systematically surface with possessive morphosyntax. It has recently been suggested that lexical category assignment thus reflects variation in the semantics of PC lexemes.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The Niger-Congo language Wolof splits its PC terms between nouns and adjectival verbs and exemplifies both possessive predication and direct predication strategies. Under the direction of Dr. Christopher Kennedy, Ms. Rebekah Baglini will conduct primary fieldwork in Senegal to investigate the two PC constructions in the language and how they pattern together or diverge semantically. Several aspects of PC expression in Wolof will be given special focus. Of particular interest is the interpretation of scalar properties associated with the two types of PC expressions, and whether they behave similarly with respect to degree modifiers, measure phrases, comparative constructions, and the formation of degree achievements. Baglini will also investigate whether particular semantic subclasses of PCs are predictably assigned to one lexical category or another and evaluate whether the Wolof facts are consistent with generalizations made in the typological literature on PCs.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will employ a mix of field methodologies, including elicitation, production and comprehension tasks, and the collection of spontaneous speech. The findings on Wolof will be linked to longstanding questions in the theoretical literature about the nature of properties and their representation in the model theory. Moreover, this project contributes to the growing need for evaluating semantic theories against data from under-represented languages. This award also contributes to the training of a promising graduate student.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Rebekah Baglini successfully defended her dissertation, titled "Stative predication and semantic ontology: a cross-linguistic study," in 2015.  The empirical core of the work is based on linguistic fieldwork which Baglini undertook in Senegal between October 2013-April 2014, funded by grant BCS-1324343.  The majority of the linguistic data was collected among monolingual Wolof speakers in Ronkh, a rural community along the Senegal River near Mauritania.

Given the increasing urbanization of Senegalese society--correlated with a shift towards a more simplified Wolof variety featuring heavy mixing with French and English--the recorded audio and video materials from the village represent an important record of Wolof bu x&oacute;&oacute;t, or 'deep Wolof'. Comparative analysis of Ronkh and Saint Louis varieties has been the topic of invited talks in 2015, and hold broad appeal to scholars in Linguistics, Anthropology, African studies, and beyond.    The research has had positive outcomes in several domains.  It provided an in-depth study of the expression of so-called property concepts like '(be) red', '(be) hungry', or '(be) tall' in a language without adjectives.  Wolof was found to assign property concepts to both nominal and verbal categories: interesting differences as well as characteristic patterns were found between these two grammatical strategies.  Although languages with marginal or non-existent adjective systems are widespread and well-documented in the descriptive literature, typological findings are rarely brought to bear on questions of linguistic theory. The Wolof research provided the empirical basis for the larger theoretical claims developed in Baglini's dissertation, which have been shared with audiences at major conferences in the field of semantics in 2014-2015.
