<AbstractNarration>A microlab is a form of active learning where students are asked to complete a 5-10 minute conceptual or programming activity during lecture. These labs can be delivered on tablets, laptops or desktops. In a logical microlab, students are asked to solve a conceptual problem by arranging and connecting on-screen icons and submitting their solutions to an automated grading system (the exploration phase of the microlab learning cycle).  Then the instructor helps students discover an algorithm to solve the problem (the invention phase). In the application phase, students are asked to implement this algorithm by dragging and dropping program statements, known as code magnets, to form a method that is then compiled and tested. This approach had been evaluated over the last two years by an independent evaluator and proved to be both educationally effective and popular with students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a collaboration among three universities: Appalachian State University, SUNY Stony Brook, and UNC Greensboro. The goals are (1) expand the development of microlabs as an effective form of active learning and (2) in workshops organized by the collaborative universities, train other faculty at regional universities to use existing microlabs and develop new microlabs. Independent assessment of learning outcomes is continuing for these new activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit includes further development of the microlab approach and expanded application to new courses in the computer science curriculum. Broader impact involves the development of cost-effective on-site workshops to train other faculty to adopt the microlab approach and develop new microlabs, implementation of a microlab repository for sharing these materials nationwide, and development of a proactive model using small stipends to encourage new contributions to the repository.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project <strong><em>Innovative Active Learning Using Tablets</em></strong> started September 1, 2013 and ended August 31, 2016. Three universities, Appalachian State, Stony Brook, and UNC Greensboro, have collaborated to promote the use of microlabs in Computer Science education. A microlab typically lasts 5-10 minutes and can be completed inside or outside the classroom on desktops, laptops, tablets, or mobile devices (Image1). When using a logical microlab, a student solves a conceptual problem by arranging icons on a screen to represent a solution; an example from a data structures class is shown in Image2. When solving a code magnet microlab, a student constructs a method by dragging and dropping code magnets inside the skeleton of the method; control structures can nest other magnets, including nested control structures. Extra magnets may be included to force students to choose between options, such as a &lt; and a &lt;= comparison. Image3 shows a Java method to solve the logical microlab presented in Image2. The method is compiled and subjected to unit testing. An example code magnet lab for an introductory programming class using Python is shown in Image4 and an example for a programming languages class using Prolog is shown in Image5. With both types of microlabs, students are given feedback to guide them to a correct solution and they can repeat the lab until it is correct.</p> <p>The learning cycle is an instructional technique used in science education for over fifty years.&nbsp; There are three phases: Exploration (students explore a particular problem and see whether they can discover a solution), Invention (using student input the instructor helps develop a formal solution to the problem), and Application (students solve similar problems in the same domain). For several topics, particularly in data structures, microlabs can be organized into a learning cycle, as shown in Image6. The example shown is building a binary tree using the preorder and inorder traversals. The logical microlab (Image 2) is the exploration phase and the code magnet microlab (Image3) is the application phase.&nbsp; Knowledge retention by students can be measured by asking similar problems with different data on an exam.&nbsp; Application can be expanded by asking students to write a program to solve a similar problem, such as building a binary tree based on the inorder and postorder traversals.</p> <p>Microlabs have been tested in the classroom at seven universities (including two HBCU), three community colleges, and one high school. The success rates during one semester at Appalachian State are typical. &nbsp;In four sections of an introductory programming course taught by three instructors the success rate for 647 attempted labs was 89.7% correct.&nbsp; In the follow-up second level course where the labs were much more challenging the overall success rate was 81.4%.&nbsp; In a data structures course that used logical microlabs the average score was 95.7%.&nbsp;&nbsp; The average for code magnet labs for the same course was of 93.6%. &nbsp;Our external evaluator visited with students in these seven classes; she also met with each of the instructors. Her evaluation is presented below verbatim.</p> <p><em>There is a direct relationship between exposure to Microlabs and how positively students view them. Students who had been exposed to the greatest number of Microlabs found them the most useful, liked them the best, and had much fewer complaints about having to log in, the interface, or how much time they took to complete. </em></p> <p><em>Students noted multiple positive aspects of Microlabs, including that they provide opportunities for practice; are hands-on; provide feedback; engage students in problem-solving; and give the form of coding while allowing students to see the "bigger picture".

Since dissemination is critically important, nine workshops have been presented so that other faculty can adopt the microlab approach and help develop new microlabs.  Faculty members were allowed to bring one student with them to the workshop.  A total of 86 faculty members and 48 students attended these workshops from 30 different institutions.  The evaluations of these workshops were highly positive.  Additionally papers have been published and presented at international and national conferences on using microlabs to promote active learning throughout the computer science curriculum.  Microlabs continue to be used at five different universities in the Fall 2016 semester after support recently expired.
