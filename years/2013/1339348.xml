<AbstractNarration>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI: Dan Nettleton (Iowa State University) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Senior Personnel: Roger Wise (USDA-ARS),  Adam Bogdanove (Cornell University), Roger Innes (Indiana University), Fredy Altpeter (University of Florida),  Adah Leshem (Iowa State University) and Jaquelyn Jackson (Tuskegee University)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ERA-CAPS Collaborators: Patrick Schweizer [Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research (IPK), Germany] and Pietro Spanu (Imperial College, United Kingdom)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crop loss caused by disease remains one of the greatest agricultural challenges in both developed and developing countries. Obligate fungal pathogens, i.e., pathogens that require their host to survive, are a major threat to crop production worldwide. Effector proteins secreted by these pathogens suppress host defenses to promote nutrient acquisition and colonization. However, the molecular mechanisms by which these effectors manipulate these processes are poorly understood. This project aims to fill this knowledge gap by identifying the networks of interacting host and pathogen proteins in the well-characterized barley-powdery mildew, host-microbe system. Previous joint NSF-BBSRC funded research identified a collection of novel effectors secreted by the powdery mildew fungus, Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei, that contribute to pathogen virulence. This group of effectors will be used to identify host target proteins, using yeast two-hybrid screens, with the goal of identifying proteins that are targeted by multiple effectors. These host targets, as well as key effectors, will be evaluated for their roles in host immunity by silencing via RNA interference (RNAi) and by overexpression in a bacterial type III delivery system. Those that impact host immune regulation will be further characterized using TAL effector nuclease (TALEN) mutagenesis or RNAi-mediated gene silencing in stable barley transgenics. Among the fungal effectors identified and characterized thus far is a predicted metalloprotease (BEC1019) that is required for virulence, suppresses host defenses and is evolutionarily conserved among at least 96 other diverse fungi, including economically important plant pathogens, animal pathogens, and free-living non-pathogens. As a proof of concept, barley will be engineered with a newly discovered system that will activate defense responses upon detection of BEC1019 activity, which is predicted to confer resistance to a wide range of fungal pathogens. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deciphering the molecular functions of evolutionarily conserved fungal effectors and understanding the host genes that respond will elucidate plant defense mechanisms and promote broadly applicable disease control strategies. All research objectives will be incorporated into training and mentoring opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, and K-12 teachers. International research exchanges with the European ERA-CAPS (http://www.eracaps.org/) companion project, "Functional characterization and validation of nonhost components in Triticeae species for durable resistance against fungal diseases (DURESTrit)", will enhance the training of students and postdocs. An inquiry-based Research Experience for Teachers on "Inheritance of Traits and Genes in Barley" (iTAG Barley) will be disseminated to serve underrepresented groups in secondary schools, community colleges, and 1890 land-grant institutions, providing hands-on training in genetics as it applies to agriculture and human health. Public access to project data will be fostered through a project website, the PLEXdb (www.plexdb.org) on-line database for gene expression for plants and plant pathogens, as well as NCBI-GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), Ensembl Genomes (http://ensemblgenomes.org/), and GrainGenes (wheat.pw.usda.gov). Thus, this project will promote research, education, and dissemination to a broad audience, while developing a new generation of agricultural and computational scientists.</AbstractNarration>

Pathogenic fungi, oomycetes, viruses, bacteria, insects, and nematodes negatively impact agronomic and horticultural crops, as well as commercial and recreational forests. Despite these continual threats, a comprehensive view of the regulatory programs that render a plant resistant to pathogens has yet to emerge, especially in small-grain temperate cereal crops that are vital to food security and the agricultural economy.   This project exploited the barley-powdery mildew, host-microbe interaction, building on resources established with previous federal funds to examine the mechanisms underlying molecular communication between disease agents and their hosts. The presented outcomes focus on genome-wide identification of host targets of pathogen effectors, characterization of a new disease resistance receptor, designated PBR1, and an innovative educational outreach program.  Selected Outcomes-  1) Next-generation screening for pathogen-effector, host target interactions:   Pathogen effectors interact with plant proteins to suppress plant defenses. The fungal pathogen that causes powdery mildew disease secretes over 500 of these effector proteins, and while many of these effectors contribute to infection, the mechanisms by which this occurs are largely unknown. Next-generation sequencing was used to identify interacting host partners from high-throughput yeast two-hybrid assays, using powdery mildew effectors as baits, and as preys, a time-course cDNA library from infected barley and isogenic immune mutants. We developed a robust informatics and statistics pipeline to evaluate the interacting proteins and subsequently integrated the top ranked effector targets with a predicted barley protein-interactome to identify barley-powdery mildew interaction hubs. Immune modules exhibited enrichment for genes associated cellular chaperones, immune signaling proteins, transcriptional regulators, as well as proteins of unknown function.  2) Convergent evolution of a novel plant disease resistance receptor:   Plant disease resistance is often mediated by intracellular immune receptors known as nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat proteins (NLRs). Most crop resistance genes deployed in agriculture encode NLRs. The primary function of NLRs is to detect the presence of pathogen-secreted effector proteins. We discovered that multiple barley varieties recognize and respond to a conserved protease activity mediated by the bean pathogen effector, AvrPphB. Response to AvrPphB was mapped to a single segregating locus identified as a novel NLR gene, designated AvrPphB Response 1 (Pbr1). Lastly, it was shown that wheat varieties also recognize AvrPphB protease activity and harbor two copies of Pbr1, suggesting that this disease resistance system could be deployed in Triticeae grain crops. These results provide the first evidence that host targets of AvrPphB have essential immune functions in both monocot and dicot crops. This knowledge will be used to expand protease effector recognition, creating disease resistant crops.  3) iTAG Barley STEM training enables hands-on science for high-school students:   Most students decide to pursue STEM careers in secondary school rather than college. Thus, we need to help these students, and their teachers, better understand the important impact and satisfaction that comes from "doing good science". The project team further developed the STEM outreach program, iTAG Barley (Inheritance of Traits and Genes), using the diverse Oregon Wolfe Barley population as the model. This system connects genotype and phenotype with lab exercises that are taught to iTAG teachers during a six-week summer research experience, subsequently enabling their students to learn concepts in plant development, phenotypic diversity, genetics, and genomics. iTAG Barley is available with teacher and student versions in PDF or digital textbook format (iTAG for iPad), and includes NSF-funded thermal cyclers, microcentrifuges, gel boxes, transilluminators, pipetteman, seed, and reagents.
