<AbstractNarration>This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the University of Oklahoma Norman provides eight undergraduate students each summer the opportunity to participate in research on topics in astrophysics, atomic, molecular and optical physics, condensed matter physics and high energy physics. In addition to participating in research with an experienced mentor, the REU students will engage in activities such as seminars and lectures. Students will give two oral presentations on the research, one after two weeks and a final twenty-minute talk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) site, where each summer two high school teachers from nearby school districts participate in a research project. The teachers will develop and build small scale experiments that can be transported or replicated in the high school classroom.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU/RET site will have a number of broader impacts. The site has a strong plan to recruit undergraduate students from institutions offering little or no research opportunities and from groups underrepresented in physics. The site has a strong evaluation plan which is designed to give feedback and to improve the project on an on-going basis.</AbstractNarration>
