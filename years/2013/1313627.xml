<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the management of small natural features with large ecosystem functions in urbanizing landscapes.  Many landscapes have small natural features that are far more important for maintaining biodiversity or for providing ecosystem services than one would expect based on their size.  Examples include small pools in upland landscapes and coral heads in an extensive bed of sea grasses.  Many landscapes are becoming more urban as communities grow and their development patterns change, so effective management of smaller natural features presents important challenges and opportunities.  The small size of these features often means they can be conserved while allowing activities like development, forestry, or agriculture to continue.  Prevailing conservation strategies do not fully take advantage of these opportunities, however, often because managers have limited scientific knowledge, especially of mechanisms linking ecological and social processes.  In northeastern forests, vernal pools provide a model system in which to study the dynamics of small natural feature management.  Building on numerous ecological and economic theories, this interdisciplinary research project will examine dynamic interactions associated with vernal pools (seasonally inundated wetlands) in forested landscapes of the urbanizing northeast of the U.S.  Their overarching goals are (1) to explore the biophysical and socioeconomic components of vernal pool ecology and management as a coupled-systems model and (2) to improve strategies for conserving vernal pools and other small natural features with large ecosystem service significance.  The investigators will couple spatially explicit ecological and economic models within a dynamic system simulation model to examine the interactions among regulator, community, and landowner decision-making and the resulting landscape impacts on vernal pool species and broader-scale ecosystem functions.  Results from the simulation model will provide information to assess the efficacy of strategies for conserving natural resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide the intellectual foundation for advances in amphibian meta-population theory and microeconomic theories of land use and institutions.  It also will assess the utility of a relatively novel approach for managing natural resources that extends far beyond vernal pools to analogous systems around the globe, from prairie potholes in central North America to desert springs in southern Africa.  By focusing on small natural features with disproportionate significance in urbanizing landscapes, the project will offer insights to help transform the way society approaches resource conservation, especially on private lands. By examining the merits of alternative management strategies, the investigators will provide stakeholders with more efficient and flexible management tools.  They will test these tools by supporting policy experiments on the ground in Maine.  Sharing the experiences of Maine communities with communities throughout New England and eastern Canada as well as with academics and practitioners from around the globe will broaden the impact of these activities.  This project will support and mentor high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, and it will facilitate in-service training of teachers from rural and Native American schools.  This project is supported by the NSF Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH) Program.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Many landscapes have small natural features that are far more important for maintaining biodiversity or providing ecosystem services than one would expect based on their size (for example, vernal pools, old large trees, or bat caves). Effectively managing these features presents interesting challenges and opportunities, in part because they are small relative to the usual scale of managed natural resources. Our team of researchers from University of Maine, Clark University, and Bowdoin College collaborated on a project to advance scientific understanding of small natural features and their roles in providing ecosystem services, and to strengthen the scientific support for management of small natural features. While much of our research focused on vernal pools, we also collaborated with researchers from around the world to improve understanding of and management approaches for small natural features more broadly. We collaborated extensively with over 40 stakeholders, including federal, state, and local governments, and mentored 30 undergraduate, 3 M.S., and 3 Ph.D. student researchers and 1 postdoctoral research fellow. Key outcomes from our project included the following.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>(1) Our research provides strong evidence that vernal pool breeding amphibians at all stages of development are negatively impacted by fragmentation of their breeding pools and post-breeding forested habitats where they summer and hibernate. These findings underscore the importance of working with local landowners to improve pool conservation in developing landscapes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>(2) Our research illustrated that amphibian populations are isolated genetically at large geographic scales by barriers such as highways, cities, and rivers and at smaller scales by fragmentation of life-history habitat elements. This work provides the foundation for engaging stakeholders to rethink conservation planning for pool-breeding amphibians at multiple scales.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>(3) Our research demonstrated associations between place attachment, stewardship beliefs, &amp; forest production objectives and private landowners&rsquo; decision-making. Landowners with different motivations, objectives, and beliefs hold varying intentions with respect to conservation and development activities. These findings provide support for work with local landowners and for policy simulations and evaluations.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>(4) Our research shows that differences among community characteristics, both social and biophysical, influence natural resource management outcomes. These findings, coupled with our research on amphibians and landowners, improve knowledge of how people as individuals and communities affect landscapes and small natural features at multiple scales. Owners, land markets, institutions, and landscape contexts influence the viability and cost-effectiveness of alternative conservation strategies. This work offers support to natural resource managers as they consider alternative conservation approaches.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;(4) We mentored and trained early career faculty, post-docs, graduate students, and undergraduate students. Our graduate students have all secured either academic posts or work at federal and state agencies and private consulting firms. Many undergraduates who served as research assistants have themselves gone on to pursue graduate degrees. Our team is proud to be contributing to STEM education pathways. We shared insights with colleagues to support innovations and advances in training in conservation science at University of Maine (e.g., a new Conservation Science certificate).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>(5) Our research has provided useful scientific information, encouraged collaborations between researchers and various stakeholders, and supported the development of new management tools. Our team&rsquo;s research is supporting the development of a new vernal pool mitigation conservation tool developed by a diverse array of stakeholders (i.e., from developers and economists to ecologist and professional planners). At its core, the primary purpose of this tool, the Maine Vernal Pool Special Area Management Plan, is to increase the mitigation options available for vernal pool protection using an approach that balances aquatic resource protection and economic development. This tool has the potential to simplify the federal permitting process for projects involving vernal pools, which in turn, will benefit the regulated public through enhanced streamlining and a general reduction of regulatory burdens. For the resource, it has the potential to enhance the sustainability of vernal pool ecosystems on a landscape level</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>(6) Another broader outcome of our project is the development of regional working groups to carry this work forward and to address a broader array of conservation challenges. The working groups were an outgrowth of a regional workshop we held on project results that was targeted to wetland practitioners from the northeastern US and Atlantic Canada. As a result of this workshop, four regional working groups were formed to continue to address, through collaborative research and outreach, vernal pool conservation issues.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>(7) Lastly, our team hosted an international workshop on small natural features that brought together researchers from around the world that study different small natural features. Engaging with scholars studying features from vernal pools to bat caves to natural springs to temporary streams created new research collaborations, networks, and educational tools to sustain research on and increase public awareness of these special resources.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/27/2019<br>      Modified by: Aram&nbsp;J&nbsp;Calhoun</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1313627/1313627_10261774_1574861072191_vernalpoolMaine--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1313627/1313627_10261774_1574861072191_vernalpoolMaine--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Maine vernal pool"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1313627/1313627_10261774_1574861072191_vernalpoolMaine--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Maine vernal pool"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Research on vernal pool functions, ME, USA</div> <div class="imageCredit">Dawn Morgan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Aram&nbsp;J&nbsp;Calhoun</div> <div class="imageTitle">Maine vernal pool</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1313627/1313627_10261774_1574861246027_WoodFrogwithTransmitter2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1313627/1313627_10261774_1574861246027_WoodFrogwithTransmitter2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Wood frog with belt transmitter"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1313627/1313627_10261774_1574861246027_WoodFrogwithTransmitter2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Wood frog with belt transmitter"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Radioed wood frogs were tracked in their post breeding habitat to determine conservation needs</div> <div class="imageCredit">Thomas Hastings</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Aram&nbsp;J&nbsp;Calhoun</div> <div class="imageTitle">Wood frog with belt transmitter</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1313627/1313627_10261774_1574861748922_Cnhstakeholderworkshop--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1313627/1313627_10261774_1574861748922_Cnhstakeholderworkshop--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Of Pools and People Stakeholder workshop"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1313627/1313627_10261774_1574861748922_Cnhstakeholderworkshop--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Of Pools and People Stakeholder workshop"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Vernal pool managers gather to hear CNH results and craft next steps for vernal pool conservation, Ashland, MA, USA</div> <div class="imageCredit">Aram Calhoun</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Aram&nbsp;J&nbsp;Calhoun</div> <div class="imageTitle">Of Pools and People Stakeholder workshop</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
