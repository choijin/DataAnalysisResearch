<AbstractNarration>This project at The College of New Jersey (TCNJ) improves mentoring and student support structures within the Departments of Computer Science, and Mathematics and Statistics. Dissemination of these results both within TCNJ and in the respective disciplines is leading to improved advising and mentoring practices by other departments and institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project forms the basis of a sustainable initiative to recruit, retain and graduate more students in computer science and mathematics at TCNJ. All students in the program engage in research, belong to a learning community, and are focused on computational science.  These experiences form a common theme for the students in the program.  Students are organized into project teams that work on research problems as part of their coursework from the start of their college career. The projects are structured to create a sustainable learning community that improves students' self-efficacy. The project provides significant advising, mentoring, and tutoring services that supplement those already provided by the college.  The project funds approximately 27 scholarships per year for computer science and mathematics students at TCNJ.</AbstractNarration>
