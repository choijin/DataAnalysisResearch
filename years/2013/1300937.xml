<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms - B Program of the Division of Chemistry supports Professor Dasan M. Thamattoor of Colby College, in an undergraduate-driven research program, to investigate alkylidenecarbenes generated from new photochemical sources based on cyclopropanated phenanthrene and indan systems. The program includes the study of acyclic alkylidenecarbenes with alkyl and aryl substituents, the investigation of cycloalkylidenecarbenes, with a particular emphasis on their ability to generate small- and medium-ring cycloalkynes, the study of dihalovinylidenes, and the domino generation of two alkylidenecarbenes from a single precursor and the formation of C2.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program provides a research experience for undergraduate students, which trains them in the synthesis of organic molecules and in the physical methods used to characterize these molecules and determine their structures.  The work will continue an outreach program that provides research opportunities to high school students over the summer months. Also, the implementation of new partnerships with math and science teachers at local elementary and middle schools, to deliver quality instruction in STEM subjects, will be sought and existing ones strengthened.</AbstractNarration>
