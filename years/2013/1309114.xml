<AbstractNarration>Technical Summary&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a research program dedicated to exploring novel multifunctional tin-containing oxide materials, where the 2+ oxidation state of tin is associated with the presence of electron 'lone pairs.' Large ionic displacements induced by these sterically active, but chemically inert electrons lead to large elastic deformations and strong polar properties. The PIs' synergistic approach includes both materials theory and computation, and growth and characterization as essential interconnected parts of the project. Utilizing the combination of these tools, the PIs will: (a) investigate complex coupled phenomena - including elastic, polar and electronic ones - in bulk, thin-film and nanostructured forms of tin-based oxides, (b) identify rational pathways for achieving enhanced or yet unknown new properties in these compounds that will lead to advanced functionalities, (c) develop synthetic processes to grow tin-based oxides utilizing atomic layer / chemical vapor deposition as well as processing technologies to incorporate them into a variety of nanostructures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a collaboration between the University of Connecticut and University of Illinois at Chicago, and includes a collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory. The PIs will use a unique atomic layer / chemical vapor deposition reactor to fabricate new multifunctional oxide materials with dimensions ranging from bulk-like multi-micron to nanometer, while preserving a high degree of structural conformality. The pertinent electroactive and electrochemical properties of these materials will be investigated as functions of not only composition and structure, but also film thickness from the micron length scale to the atomic, sub-nanometer regime. The utilization of an integrated simulation approach with established information flow from atomic / molecular scale to mesoscale will provide both support and guidance for the experimental growth and characterization efforts. Theory-and-simulation tasks include initial selection of candidate structures for synthesis, predictive evaluation of their properties, identification of optimal growth conditions and coarse-grained evaluation of functional behavior of nanostructures of different shapes and sizes made out of these materials. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research program will be integrated into educational and mentoring experiences for undergraduate and graduate students by training them in experimental and computational materials science techniques and incorporating the research results into courses in Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science. Both PI institutions are located in areas with large populations of underrepresented minority students and provide well established programs for disseminating research findings and methodologies to middle and high school students and teachers either in the form of new physics, chemistry and engineering modules, or through series of workshops in science, math, and technology. The PIs will use both of these routes to encourage students from underrepresented minority groups to participate in science and technology activities related to this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical Summary&lt;br/&gt;This award supports a research program dedicated to exploring novel multifunctional tin-containing oxide materials, intended as environmentally benign replacements of lead-based compounds for a variety of technological applications including energy harvesting, storage and conversion, for example between mechanical and electrical forms of energy. The PIs' synergistic approach includes the use of materials theory and computation, and growth and characterization as essential interconnected parts of the project. The combination of these tools will help investigate elastic and electronic properties of bulk, thin-film and nanostructured forms of tin-based oxides, and develop synthetic processes to grow these structures with layer-by-layer deposition techniques as well as processing technologies for their potential incorporation into a variety of electronic devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is a collaboration between the University of Connecticut and University of Illinois at Chicago, and includes a collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory.

The simple idea of utilizing self-limiting surface chemisorption has bestowed ALD with several great advantages compared to other deposition techniques, e.g., physical vapor deposition and sputtering.

Ferroelectric ABO3 perovskites, where A and B are two metal cations, have been widely used in numerous applications, thanks to their robust spontaneous polarization and associated functional properties. However, the best and strongest ferroelectrics are usually Pb-based, such as PbTiO3 or PbZr1-xTixO3 (PZT). The toxicity of lead poses potential threats to environmental and human well-being. Thus, it was theoretically proposed that perovskite SnTiO3 can be used as a replacement for Pb-based materials since Sn is isoelectronic to Pb. The challenge of growing SnTiO3 lies in the stabilization of divalent tin. Bulk synthesis attempts have not been successful so far, and thin film samples yielded from pulsed laser deposition were found to be nonpolar.  In this project, the progress on depositing perovskite SnTiO3 is reported. ALD of this ternary oxide combines two binary oxide processes, namely, ALD of SnOx and TiO2. Thus, before attempting ternary ALD, binary processes for both oxides must be studied and optimized. The ALD of TiO2 has already been investigated in our group, but thin film properties and annealing effects are yet to be well established for ALD SnOx. Since the presence of divalent Sn is crucial for forming the perovskite structure, this work was focused on obtaining and maintaining tin in the divalent form. The as-deposited SnOx films were first subjected to annealing in reducing environment, which is the fastest and most economic way to convert Sn(IV) to Sn(II). It was found that after annealing in H2 atmosphere above 450 C and below 650 C, more than 20 at.% of tetravalent tin converts to divalent, while annealing at higher temperature promotes the formation of metallic tin. An optimum temperature interval of 450 - 500 C was established for maximize the Sn(II) output, which provides a reliable solution when partial Sn(II) is needed.

Several characterizations were then performed and their results analyzed in order to explain the reduction in deposition densities.  The fabricated SnTiOx films were annealed and measured by piezoelectric force microscope, and the one annealed in O2 at 350 C exhibited a piezoresponse hysteresis loop with a coercive voltage of 3.04 V, which indicates the presence of ferroelectric polarization in the film.
