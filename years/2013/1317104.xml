<AbstractNarration>This action funds Tyler J. Massaro of The University of Tennessee, Knoxville to conduct a research project in the Math and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.  The project title is "How to best use resources to mitigate devastating bushfires." The host scientist is Dr. Daniel Spring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In severe weather conditions there is potential for devastating wildfires to occur.  Early detection and response increase the chances of preventing such fires, but minimal research has been done on the optimal allocation of resources between surveillance and response.  This project develops analytical methods and numerical optimization models for determining investments in surveillance and response infrastructure that minimize the total costs of preventing fires from becoming a serious detriment to local economies and ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, this project aims to immediately benefit fire-pacted communities in Australia and elsewhere by supporting local fire management with ecologically sound, economically feasible surveillance and response strategies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The state of Victoria (VIC) occupies approximately 22.7 million hectares (ha) of land in southeastern Australia (1 ha is roughly 2.5 acres).  Within the state, 7.2 million ha is forested public land, with another 700,000 ha of forested private lands.  This gives a total of just under 8 million hectares of forested land in Victoria.  Since 2002, Victoria has lost more than 3 million ha of land, with 1.91 million ha destroyed by the Big Desert (181,400 ha), Alpine (1.3 million ha), and Black Saturday (430,000 ha) fires alone.  Further, the Black Saturday Fires (7 Feb 2009) resulted in the deaths of 173 people, and a total economic cost estimated at over $4 billion.  The Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) was developed in 1967 by scientist A. G. McArthur in an attempt to quantify the potential for various weather factors to contribute to bushfire spread.  McArthur originally intended for indices to range from 1 - 100, with 100 being roughly consistent with conditions during the 1939 Black Friday fires in Victoria.  On days experiencing an FFDI of 50 or higher, officials will issue a total fire ban.  Many parts of Victoria experienced an FFDI of 200 or more on Black Saturday.  On days with FFDI of 100, spotfire distances range from a minimum of 2 km in a fire with 5 tonnes/ha available fuel, up to nearly 10 km (25 tonnes/ha available fuel).  A spotfire occurs when firebrands are carried beyond the forward head of a source fire and, upon landing in a fuelbed, ignite a secondary fire.  Black Saturday bushfires caused spotfires as far as 35 km beyond the leading front of the fire.  The current fuel-reduction program in Victoria addresses a maximum of 10% of forested lands annually, leaving over 6 million ha unreduced.  And on FFDI days of 100 or higher, firebrands from a bushfire can be expected to cause spotfires at least 2 km away in these unreduced regions, if not further.  It is exactly this type of scenario which not only contributed to the devastation on Black Saturday, but moreover can be expected to contribute to similar devastation in the future if not properly addressed.  The Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission (VBRC) made 67 recommendations after a thorough investigation of the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires.  Many of these recommendations specifically pertained to improving access to and availability of information concerning bushfire outbreaks.  Never lost in the VBRC recommendations is the central tenet that "fire is an integral part of the Australian environment."  This is a progressive take on the role of bushfires in Australian communities, and it speaks to the importance of constructing our model framework in close collaboration with the fire managers who are best positioned to implement changes based upon our research.  Dr. Daniel Spring, from Monash University in Melbourne, VIC, and I set out to immediately benefit Victorian communities by supporting local fire management with ecologically sound, economically feasible control strategies.  With the assistance of my advisor at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville (UTK), Dr. Suzanne Lenhart, as well as numerous fire managers, fighters, investigators, and researchers, we developed a coupled system of partial differential equations that simulates the spread of fire and subsequent fuel consumption.  We also derived the optimality system describing the control of this system with simulated water suppression.  This formulation served as the basis for my dissertation proposal defense here at UTK, which advanced me to PhD candidacy.  Over the next few months as we continue to work on this project, we expect to obtain results that will provide useful insights for Victorian fire managers about how much water will be required to contain fires on high fire danger index days.  The fact that I was able to completely immerse myself in Australia, specifically, Melbourne, was so incredibly valuable to this project.
