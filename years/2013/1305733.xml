<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program supports the collaboration of Profs. Daniel Burden and Lisa Keranen Burden at Wheaton College (IL) to investigate novel modifications of single protein nanopores.  The research systematically explores a series of chemical additions to alpha hemolysin, a nanopore-forming protein with potential applications in ion and small molecule sensing, polymer characterization, DNA sequencing, and biomedical analyses.  The interdisciplinary work gains broad impact by addressing fundamental questions in single-nanopore transport theory, membrane protein structure and dynamics, synthetic biochemistry, and protein purification.  A host of biophysical techniques, including atomic force microscopy, single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, single ion-channel electrophysiology, Langmuir trough monolayer measurements, and cell lysis assays are employed to characterize the structure and function of the nanopore constructs.  Computer modeling tools are used to generate a theoretical understanding of novel nanopore design principles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because certain proteins form small holes or pores in cell membranes, scientists have recently begun devising ways to detect various chemicals as they pass through the pore interior.  This project advances the field of nanopore sensing by investigating the relationship between structural changes to the nanopore and molecule transport. Beyond contributions to nanopore science and engineering, the program enables high quality undergraduate research education by creating a unique environment that fosters integration among students and faculty from different scientific disciplines, including chemistry, biology, physics and computer science.  The work has potential commercial relevance for biomedical sensing and involves under-represented minorities from the greater Chicago area.  Aspects of the program will be incorporated into the undergraduate curriculum, including courses in biochemistry, advanced analytical chemistry, and the general biology laboratory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Intellectual Merit:  This award enabled two senior investigators from the Chemistry and Biology departments at Wheaton College to lead a team of researchers in: (1) the creation of novel cap modifications for the alpha-hemolysin (&alpha;HL) ion channel; (2) the behavioral characterization of these cap-modified compounds; (3) the development of computer simulations to model the characteristics of the new molecules.  Applications of these investigations range from chemical sensing to clinical medicine.  The team employed a variety of instruments to characterize the new materials, including an atomic force microscope (AFM), confocal fluorescence microscope, single ion-channel recording apparatus, and a Langmuir trough.  Results from these studies generated a broader theoretical understanding of nanopore-design principles, providing a platform for extending both protein-based and synthetic nanopore technologies.  Investigators from Wheaton shared the novel compounds with collaborators at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) who used the materials to pursue parallel investigative trajectories in nanopore-based metrology. During the award period, three scientific papers were published, one patent application was granted, seven national conference presentations were given, and numerous web-based documents were produced and published.  In addition, funds were used to involve more than 16 undergraduate research positions, both during the summer and the academic year.  See the following link for more detailed laboratory-wide information: http://burdenlab.org Broader Impacts:  During the award period, 16 research students (including chemistry, biology, computer science, and physics majors) participated in intensive, multiple-year long research experiences. These students and the supervising faculty capitalized on new infrastructure that Wheaton brought online to support the aims of this grant (e.g., a new computational cluster).  This award also helped promote an ongoing collaboration with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, located in Gaithersburg, MD.  One publication was specifically directed towards a broad audience.  The manuscript aims to connect scientists and educators, policy-makers and researchers, and the public and private sectors.  It includes both traditional print versions, as well as an audio podcast. https://doi.org/10.26320/SCIENTIA34     During the award period, team members were involved in outreach to minority students through Wheaton?s BRIDGE program (Building Roads to Intellectual Diversity and Great Education).  This program provides scientific opportunities for first-generation college-bound, low-income or African-American or Latino students from the Chicagoland area on Wheaton?s campus.  Activities included the development of chemistry curricular materials, lab tours, and student mentorship. Some of the most successful research projects were developed into exercises for advanced Analytical Chemistry teaching laboratories, which expanded the impact of research to many dozens of students each year.
