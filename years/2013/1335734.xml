<AbstractNarration>1335734&lt;br/&gt;PI: Wu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The field of colloidal suspensions consisting of sub-micron sized anisotropic particles, i.e., particles whose surface is asymmetrically functionalized or whose shape is non-spherical, has seen a rapid growth in recent years. These colloids are interesting both from fundamental point of view and from their potential in new applications to health care, energy, or consumer products industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide partial support towards travel to attend American Chemical Society (ACS) Symposium ?Anisotropic Colloids.? to be held at Indianapolis on September 8-12, 2013. The symposium is expected to attract scientists from diverse disciplines (Chemistry, Materials Science, Engineers, and Physicists) and will cover wide range of topics, from the synthesis to new physical phenomena, to new applications of anisotropic colloids.</AbstractNarration>
