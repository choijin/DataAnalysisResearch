<AbstractNarration>This mixed methods research project investigates the puzzling problem of variations in student learning gains that are observed at different institutions of higher education when implementing the same research-based instructional method in highly interactive classrooms. The study investigates model implementations of algebra-based studio physics to identify and analyze the critical features of this instructional method.  The study is guided by the following questions.  Research Question1: How is algebra-based studio physics implemented at a variety of institutions and for what types of students?  Research Question2: Why are departments implementing algebra-based studio physics in those ways?  Research Question3: What factors are associated with student outcomes that indicate student learning gains? Algebra-based studio physics comprise the physics experience for many students who enroll in introductory physics courses.  However, this approach to teaching physics remains understudied relative to calculus-based studio physics. Therefore, the research takes advantage of a unique opportunity to examine student learning gains.  The study examines how different types of students respond to interactive teaching strategies in model implementations of this instructional method to teach physics and how institutional types influence teaching and learning. Three initial institutions serve as the basis for Phase 1 of this multi-phase study. One of the institutions has reported high student learning gains in the algebra-based studio physics courses.  The other two institutions have observed low student learning gains. Phase 1 is designed to establish baseline measures for the research.  During Phase 2 the research team is examining a total of twelve additional institutions that utilize algebra-based studio physics.  The twelve institutions represent a range of those in the U.S. implementing this approach. Institutions that are included in Phase 2 provide settings in which the research team tests emergent hypotheses and the robustness of findings from Phase 1. Specifically, the project is investigating (a) characteristics of model implementations of algebra-based studio physics by faculty at different institutions and (b) the characteristics of students engaged in these types of courses, to investigate and explain the observed variations in student learning gains.  Research methods include classroom observations, interviews, surveys, and student outcomes assessments.</AbstractNarration>

We found that, even considering only a single institution, instructors are discussed changes to most SCALE-UP components; We also examined the changes instructors across the study discussed making to aspects of lecture and group work, and found that they discussed making changes to some similar components as those discussed at the single institution (e.g., the amount of class time spent on lecture; how student groups are formed; use of roles in student groups) as well as how students are trained to work in groups and how frequently groups are changes.

We found that students' approach to learning could be described by five distinct learning profiles: strategic (15% of students); knowledge building (23% of students); learned helpless (27% of students); surface (19% of students); and apathetic (17% of students) [3]. Both strategic and knowledge building are considered "adaptive" learning profiles, while learned helpless, surface and apathetic are considered "maladaptive" learning profiles. We examined trends across demographics and found: 1) men were more likely than women to adopt apathetic and knowledge building profiles, and less likely to adopt the learned helpless profile; and 2) students with prior high school experience were more likely to adopt the knowledge building profile and less likely to adopt the strategic profile than students who did not take a high school physics course. We also found differences based on major and grade expectation. Finally, we found differences in profile adoption across the three universities.

Buy-in is of interest in SCALE-UP courses because the format can be different than students' expectations and student expectations can shape instructional choices. We found that many students did not agree with the instructors' perception of how much class time had been spent on activities such as lecture, step-by-step labs, investigative labs, small group work, and individual work [4]. This was surprising as these activities make up most of the class time in SCALE-UP courses. Students most frequently disagreed with the amount of time spent on lecture, but were fairly even distributed as to whether they would prefer more or less time spent on lecture. Additionally, students disagreed with the importance placed on "extra reading" outside of class, which suggested instructors need to do more work to get students to buy in to this part of the course.
