<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for students to attend the OSG User School and the XSEDE-13 conference in San Diego.  The participants will&lt;br/&gt;learn about the advances and increased sophistication of research that are being enabled by XSEDE and OSG.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts will be through the direct engagement of students who may, in the future, become&lt;br/&gt;researchers, including underrepresented students, including those at Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs)&lt;br/&gt;and smaller colleges and universities across the country</AbstractNarration>
