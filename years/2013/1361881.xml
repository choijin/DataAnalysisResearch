<AbstractNarration>Non-Technical abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fluid flows play a crucial role in the behavior of many physical, chemical, geological, astrophysical and biological processes.  During the past ten years, the PI's research group has done numerous experiments on the behavior of reaction fronts in simple, two-dimensional (2D) fluid flows.  Results from those experiments have led to development of a theory that predicts the existence of "burning invariant manifolds" (BIMs) in the flow that act as invisible barriers that block the motion of reaction fronts. The experiments funded by this grant will extend those studies to three-dimensional (3D) flows. In particular, we will explore whether BIMs in 3D flows still act as barriers that impede the motion of reaction fronts. Ultimately, these experiments may lead to a better understanding of blooms of plankton in the oceans; more efficient chemical reactors, especially in micro-scale devices; processes in plasma flows that might lead to economical fusion-based electrical generation; the role of cellular-scale flows in biological processes including morphogenesis in a developing embryo; detonation of supernova explosions; and the effects of moving populations on the spreading of a disease. This is an RUI (Research at Undergraduate Institutions) grant; consequently, all of this research will be done with undergraduate students who will play an active role in all aspects of the studies, including experimental design, building and testing of the apparatus, data collection and analysis, and publication and presentation of the results.  These will be the first real research experiences for most of these students, and will play an important role in their development as scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will fund experiments that will study the behavior of reaction fronts in three-dimensional (3D) fluid flows.  This is an issue with applications to a wide range of front-producing systems in physics, chemistry, biology and geology. The PI has extensive experience doing similar experiments (all with undergraduates) in 2D flows. Results from those experiments led to the development of a theory that identifies "burning invariant manifolds" (BIMs) in the flow that act as barriers that block reaction fronts.  The proposed experiments will extend those studies to 3D flows composed of nested chains of vortices.  Reaction fronts will be produced by the excitable Belousov-Zhabotinsky chemical reaction which has been shown to exhibit dynamics similar to those for a wide range of front-producing systems. Questions addressed by this research will include:  (a) whether the BIM theory can be extended to the full 3D problem; (b) whether barriers similar to the BIMs in the 2D flows still exist to front propagation in 3D flows; and (c) whether reaction barriers in 3D flows can be destroyed by weak time dependence. This is an RUI (Research at Undergraduate Institutions) grant; consequently, all of this research will be done with undergraduate students who will play an active role in all aspects of the studies, including experimental design, building and testing of the apparatus; data collection and analysis; and publication and presentation of the results.  These will be the first real research experiences for most of these students, and will play an important role in their development as scientists.</AbstractNarration>
