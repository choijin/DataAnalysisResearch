<AbstractNarration>PROGRAM DIRECTOR'S RECOMMENDATION &lt;br/&gt;1338925 George Mason University; Chaowei Yang &lt;br/&gt;1338914 Harvard University; Peter Bol &lt;br/&gt;1338902 University of California-Santa Barbara; Keith Clarke &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;George Mason University (GMU) as the lead institution, Harvard University (HU), and the University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB) are proposing to establish a center for spatiotemporal thinking, computing and applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal seeks to establish an I/UCRC for spatiotemporal thinking, computing and applications as a collaborative platform among industry, university, government agencies, and other organizations to advance this domain of knowledge. The proposed center will be established based upon the previous successes at each of the three sites including: a) the Center for Intelligent Spatial Computing (CISC) at GMU for spatiotemporal computing/software development; b) the Center for Spatial Studies (CSS) at UCSB for spatial thinking and analyses; and c) the Center for Geographic Analysis (CGA) at Harvard for spatiotemporal applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mission of the new Center would be to integrate these technologies into a comprehensive spatiotemporal theory and applications. Research results and success stories will be disseminated through publications in relevant spatiotemporal venues as well as among the center member sites for adoption and outreach. The PIs plan to use their established relationship with leading organizations to broadcast the research results and recruit new members through the organization channels. The PIs plan to develop new curriculum within existing degree programs at the three sites, and to continue their diversity traditions to include minorities and other underrepresented groups in center activities</AbstractNarration>

Built a prototype platform for interactive query and visualization of a billion streaming spatiotemporal objects.

In addition, the Harvard team in the Center devoted much effort in education and knowledge dissemination, including:   Hosted five conferences and symposiums at Harvard University, each with 60-120 participants and 10-30 speakers. Co-organized seven symposiums, five of them as a special track at the American Association of Geographers (AAG) annual meetings from 2014-2018, and two at George Mason University in 2015 and 2016. Published seven peer-reviewed journal articles, two proceeding papers, two technical reports, one book, and one book chapter. Gave 42 oral presentations in national and international conferences. Trained eight undergraduate research fellows in five summers.        Last Modified: 01/02/2020       Submitted by: Jason A Ur]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
