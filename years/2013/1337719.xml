<AbstractNarration>Objective: To acquire a nano-imprint lithography system to support device and materials research in the Houston area.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Nano-imprint is a power tool enabling 50-100 nm technologies and eliminating the need for e-beam lithography. Incorporation of nano-imprint in an educational facility will enable students to gain insight into the imprint process. &lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact: The proposed research has a broad impact in micro and nano-fabrication technologies. A "nano-engineering minor" exists in the university and they aim to enhance this program, and the acquisition of this new instrument will help their program. The existing team is quite large consisting of over sixty (60) graduate and undergraduate students, whose research projects will benefit from nano-imprint lithography capabilities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the course of the project, the team has devoted significant effort to carefully evaluate several commercial dedicated nanoimprint lithography systems from several manufacturers to 1) meet required technical specifications, 2) appropriateness for the University environment (user-friendliness, maximized up time, and moderate maintenance costs), and 3) acquisition costs.  The team has identified Nanonex NX-2004 Nanoimprinter as the nanoimprint system of choice. The system was acquired through the competitive bidding process and installed in the UH Nanofabrication Facility.  Nanonex NX-2004 Nanoimprinter is installed in the University of Houston Nanofabrication Facility (http://nanofab.uh.edu/equipment/pattern-making/ nanoimprinter) and readily available for users in the Greater Houston area to support their research projects.  Today, a new user with no prior experience with nanoimprint lithography can be trained to use the system in one 2-3 hour training session.  We have developed in-house capabilities and respective user training to fabricate nanoimprint templates using readily available set of tools including JEOL JBX 5500FS eBeam writer acquired using NSF MRI program and state-of-the-art reactive ion etching equipment. It takes a new user about one month to reach the needed level of competence and skills to independently design and build nanoimprint templates with critical dimensions as low as 10-20 nm across a 3" wafer. This level of productivity is the result of meticulously designed standard operating procedure by the Nanofabrication Facility personnel, the bank of nanofabrication recipes readily available to all users, and the readily available instrumentation for the patterning quality control housed on the premised of the Nanofabrication Facility, including scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy systems.  In summary, a genuine easy-to-use nanoimprint lithography capability is now available to a large back of users in the Greater Houston area, the sixth most populous in the country, and the home to numerous research-intensive universities, the Texas Medical Center, NASA, and active industrial research. Houston Universities receive more than $900M a year in federal funding for science and engineering research, and a significant percentage of these programs represent high-impact research in nanoscience.  Nanoimprint lithography is among the key enabling tools to support nanoscience research.       Last Modified: 11/30/2017       Submitted by: Dmitri Litvinov]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
