<AbstractNarration>The project is designed to engage Hispanic students in grades K-5 in STEM in afterschool programs within community-based organizations (CBOs).  The project builds on the foundation of an NSF-supported afterschool science program?APEX (Afterschool Program Exploring Science).  In collaboration with National Council of La Raza (NCLR), and ASPIRA, the project adapts APEX into a bilingual English/Spanish format and, using a train the trainer model, disseminates it nationally, using a train the trainer model.  Each of the ten local project sites will build on a partnership between a science museum and a CBO affiliate of NCLR or ASPIRA.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is designed to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Build the organizational capacity of partner science museums to work with CBOs and the Hispanic community.&lt;br/&gt;2.  Strengthen links between science museums and Hispanic serving CBOs in their communities.  &lt;br/&gt;3.  Engage the expertise, involvement, and collaboration of national Hispanic-serving organizations, NCLR and ASPIRA, in STEM education.&lt;br/&gt;4.  Increase the engagement of Hispanic children and families in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project evaluation will investigate how effectively the project builds the organizational capacity of partner museums and CBOs in engaging Hispanic children and families in STEM; the types and strength of science museum/CBO partnerships; the effectiveness of the project in increasing Hispanic student and family engagement in STEM, and the types of contributions the project makes to the field of informal STEM learning.  The evaluation will use qualitative and quantitative methods, including surveys, interviews, case studies, social network and collaboration analysis, observations, activity tracking, embedded assessment, photo elicitation, and focus groups.</AbstractNarration>
