<AbstractNarration>Redshifted emission from the 21cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen has gained considerable attention as a unique tracer of the primordial intergalactic medium. This award will enable the PI to develop the foundation of a next generation of 21cm cosmology instrumentation, incorporating techniques and principles learned from his current Precision Array to Probe the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) experiment. The PI will construct three prototype multi-element experiments that will allow him to study three distinct cosmological epochs: the cosmic dark ages, the epoch of reionization, and the onset of baryon acoustic oscillations. The antenna designs and digitization electronics from these experiments will in turn provide invaluable information on techniques to remove contaminating astrophysical foregrounds in future instruments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The birth of the first luminous objects (stars, black holes) in the universe that ultimately stems from the Big Bang is one of the last unexplored phases of cosmic evolution. The instruments that will be produced as part of this award will facilitate transformational science in this area, and will provide key constraints on the large-scale structure of the universe, as well as the evolution of cosmological expansion. The award will also enable the PI to train the next generation of instrument builders by offering internships for students at UC Berkeley's Radio Astronomy Laboratory. Finally, the PI will produce numerous public-domain pedagogical videos, which will enable a cadre of instrumentalists and students to quickly acquire basic proficiency in radio-astronomy instrumentation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project provided critical support for developing new instrumentation for accessing redshifted 21cm emission from neutral hydrogen in the early universe. This field represents the next frontier in precision cosmology, but it is still in its infancy, owing to the faintness of the cosmological signal and the difficulty of differentiating it from astrophysical foregrounds.  Key outcomes of this project include the development of the 14-m parabolic dish that anchored the design of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA).  Because of this work, HERA successfully secured funding through the competitive Mid-Scale Innovations Program and has emerged as a global leader in 21 cm cosmology.  This project also discovered a heretofore overlooked capability of interferometers for measuring monopole signals, examined novel approaches for low-frequency RF absorber in interferometers, established expertise for evaluating and critically assessing the potential detection of the 21cm global signal by the EDGES team, and developed a concept for a next-generation array based on FFT correlation that was proposed to the 2020 decadal survey.  In its broader impacts, this project produced a pedagogical website that has over 3,600,000 views and videos with over 497,000 views.  This represents a substantial educational impact on the broader community.  This project has also supported several undergraduate researchers, graduate students, a postdoctoral researcher, several Junior Specialists, with a higher that average ratio of women and under-represented minorities.  This is helping to address gender balance and diversity in STEM fields and helps advance the careers of these individuals. The materials developed in this grant also contributed significantly to a summer school program run as part of the annual CHAMP project, which pairs with the HERA project for training and engaging underserved populations in scientific research over the summer.
