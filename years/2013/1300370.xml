<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a three year standard award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering Site program at the University of Arizona (UA) entitled, "RET Site: Research in Optics for K-14 Educators and Teachers (ROKET)", under the direction of Dr. Supapan Seraphin. This is a continuation of a successful RET Site program conducted during the summers of 2010, 2011, and 2012.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The University of Arizona, Engineering Research Center (ERC) for Integrated Access Networks (CIAN) is partnering with UA's American Indian Language Development Institute (AILDI) to create a program customized for science educators working in Native American communities. CIAN's research addresses photonic materials and devices for optical communication, which will replace current electronic technology. Eight pre-college teachers and community college faculty in STEM disciplines (24 over three years), working in a Native Community will actively particpate in the ROKET program for six weeks in the summer where they will join research teams working on improved fiber optics, waveguide materials, short-pulsed lasers, micro-fabrication, and silicon photonics. Employing CIAN's systems-level approach impresses upon beginning researchers the connection between innovative experimental-based research and practical application to popular communication devices. Consequently, great attention will be paid to collaborating with the teachers on creating a lesson plan that relates to everyday experiences of technology and inspires their students' curiosity to build upon their existing knowledge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The training of science educators, from primarily Native American communities, will promote ambitions to pursue science and engineering education among Native American students and thus create potential for local economic growth. The establishment of a cohesive program, through partnerships with the UA's College of Optical Sciences, CIAN and AILDI, a program dedicated to Native American language preservation, exhibits to the academic community and local Indigenous communities nationwide that many stakeholders are working to address the need for Native American students in higher education.</AbstractNarration>

Attending this conference and networking within a strong Native American STEM community is an invaluable experience that provides resources to drive Native American youth toward college attendance in STEM majors.  Ratings and Outcomes  Survey responses from ROKET participants from 2013 &ndash; 2016 indicate a broad impact on Native American classrooms. In the most recent alumni survey, 100% of the respondents indicated that their research experience in the program enhanced their approach to teaching science. ROKETeers share that after presenting their ROKET curriculum in their classes, their students report higher interest in research, more motivation and enthusiasm for their science classes, and greater excitement for attending college. Also, these students show that they make more connections between science and their indigenous culture, making STEM subjects more relevant to contemporary tribal issues.  However, proof of ROKET success is in the outcomes. Inspired by her ROKET experience, Martha went back to her school and established an after-school STEM club where 3rd graders learn about nanotechnology. This was the first program of its kind at her school, and has resulted in a burgeoning partnership between CIAN and her school to spearhead an afterschool program called American Indian Student &amp; Parent-Involved Research Experience (AISPIRE). Through collaboration with AISPIRE, the first annual CIAN family stem night was held, enabling parents and students in grades 3 through 8 to experience optical demonstrations and present science fair projects.  A ROKET community college instructor reported excitement after his ROKET experience transferred to his students and led several of them to apply and be accepted into CIAN and other REU opportunities to study STEM.  Another ROKET teacher shared that the lesson plan she created during her RET enabled her to add several technology-based activities to her curriculum and expose her students to industry technology.  One ROKET participant and his students are involved with CIAN?s partnership with the UA chemistry department and Frontiers for Young Minds. His students are working with the UA chemistry department to peer-review scientific journal articles for Frontiers for Young Minds, a collection of scientific journal articles intended for younger audiences. This allows for a unique experience for his students that they would not have had otherwise.  Another result of the ROKET program is the exposure and recruitment of students to other CIAN programs. One ROKET teacher at a community college worked with CIAN to promote the CIAN undergraduate research program for Native American students (IOU-NA). This lead to several of his students joining this summer STEM program.  ROKETeers consistently report improvements in attitudes and beliefs about their confidence in teaching STEM to Native Americans, and overall, 100% of ROKETeers rated their experiences as "excellent" or "good." This program and the broad impact on Native American youth nationwide would not have been possible without the funding and support provided by NSF?s RET programs.
