<AbstractNarration>This project studies Internet censorship using novel measurement techniques, ranging from low-level packet filtering on Internet Protocol (IP) networks to high-level censorship of social media content.  Collectively these techniques can provide greater situational awareness of censorship dynamics. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project focuses on a suite of advanced inference techniques for when ?direct observation? is unavailable or impractical such as, for example, methods for detecting IP tunnels based on per-hop Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) inference techniques in order to reason about the physical characteristics of a given IP network and, for example, measurement on social media postings of redactions and the speed of redactions. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This research has broad implications on studies of methods to provide awareness of restrictive control of information and content on networks, which would be of interest to software developers, system administrators, and policy makers alike.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Internet censorship and surveillance often target activities that support U.S. domestic and foreign policy, such as journalism, activism, and engaging in the democratic process.  Measuring Internet censorship is important so that the public and lawmakers can understand, and therefore more effectively address, this global phenomena.  However, the methods of measuring Internet censorship and surveillance before our work supported by this award were very limited.  As part of this award, we developed:  A high-fidelity method for tracking deletions of social media posts.  We were able to show that Weibo deleted messages in minutes, not hours, and document some of the automation that made this possible.  This was a collaborative effort with Rice University. A methodology for extracting complete censorship and surveillance blacklists via reverse engineering.  In this way we have been able to test hypotheses about how much autonomy companies have in implementing the censorship and surveillance, and provide the research community with a rich dataset of hundreds of lists from hundreds of companies across three different market segments. TCP/IP side channel techniques for measuring IP layer censorship anywhere on the Internet.  That is, if there is a firewall stopping any two machines on the Internet from communicating, our technique can detect this without needing special access to either of the two machines or any infrastructure or measurements within any particular country.   The project also supported many middle school and high school outreach activities, the develpment of educational technologies (including Werewolves, a game that teaches cybersecurity), and Pi Crandall's involvement with Net Alerts, a site that targets at-risk populations, such as journalists and activists, with easy-to-understand materials about threats to their online freedoms:     https://netalert.me     The project produced two Ph.D.'s (Roya Ensafi, now on the faculty at the University of Michigan, and Peiyou Song, now at Google), as well as one Bachelor's Honors Thesis (Benjamin Mixon-Baca, now a Ph.D. student at the Univ. of New Mexico).  Three more Ph.D. students supported by this project will defend their dissertations in the 2017/2018 schoolyear.  Several undergraduates involved with the project are now in graduate school, including Danny Adams, a McNair Scholar who is now in the Ph.D. program in Computer Science at Cornell University.
