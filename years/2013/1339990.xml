<AbstractNarration>The project, Noyce at Montclair: Preparing the Effective Elementary Mathematics Teacher (PE2MT), is a Capacity Building project designed to increase the number of elementary teachers with a strong preparation for teaching mathematics. It draws on shared resources and ongoing collaborations between faculty in the College of Science and Mathematics and the College of Education and Human Services.  An enhanced degree program leading to a bachelor of arts in mathematics with a concentration in K-5 teaching is being developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  The enhancing feature of the degree program is an integration of coursework and the following: (a) academic support for advanced content courses, (b) enriched methods and specialized content courses, (c) early and ongoing field experiences, (d) undergraduate research experience, and (e) in-service induction support. These experiences are designed to support pre-service teachers' steady progression through a set of challenging mathematics courses, to develop their mathematical knowledge for teaching, and to inform their beliefs about mathematics and what it means to know and teach it.  Students will be recruited from within the university and also from among students completing associates degrees at local community colleges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broad Impact:  This project is developing a program that prepares teachers not only to engage students within high-needs classrooms and cultivate their STEM interests, but also for additional department-, school-, and district-based opportunities such as mentoring other teachers, modeling lessons, collaborative planning, conducting professional development, attending and presenting at conferences, and making contributions to the development of curriculum, assessment, or policy.  The local infrastructure being developed to support this program will subsequently be in place to support the development of additional STEM elementary degree programs at Montclair and can serve as a model to other colleges and universities. All program and curricular materials developed to support and sustain this program will be made available to interested colleges, universities, school districts, and policymakers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Organized in relation to the intellectual merit and broader impacts of this Capacity Building project, we provide the results of our work in relation to each of its four overarching goals.  Intellectual Merit.  Goal 2: Establish Inquiry-Oriented Academic Support and Research Experiences That Prepare Preservice Elementary Teachers for Effective Mathematics Teaching.  We concluded the development of a workshop model of inquiry-oriented supplemental instruction. We developed problem sets for Calculus I and II, as well as a model of Peer-Facilitator professional development. We piloted this workshop in the fall and spring semesters of the 2014-2015 academic year approximately 20 students enrolled in Calculus I.  We designed, developed, and received approval for a course called MATH 491: Research in Mathematics Education. The course had been piloted in the fall of 2014 and was piloted for a second time in the fall of 2015 with a student who analyzed algebra curriculum and then, as a case study of how curriculum can be informed by student interest, revised that curriculum so that it better incorporated connections to content that were particularly meaningful to her.  Goal 3: Establish Early and Ongoing Field Experiences That Prepare and Support Elementary Teachers for Effective Mathematics Teaching.  Field Experiences. An expanded model of field experiences has now been constructed from existing teacher preparation courses at Montclair that are embedded with field experiences as well as our own additional extracurricular community-based experiences. In addition, we have established partnerships with schools that will host our students for these experiences.  To further promote Scholars? understanding of the these high-need communities, course-based field experiences will be supplemented with new community knowledge-building efforts, including templates for written journals focused on methods for integrating cultural and community knowledge into the classroom and protocols for interviewing an elementary student?s parent or family member. In addition, Scholars will use an app called GeoTagger (Fails, et al., 2014, 2015) with students in high-need elementary schools to identify points of personal meaningfulness within their community. Using the app, Scholars will "pin" these points on a map and describe them. Then, we use the app to establish community walks using these pins as guideposts. We have made the institutional arrangements to pilot that app in an afterschool program in Newark, NJ, in the fall of 2016.   For Scholars? use inside the classroom, we collected samples of practitioner journal articles about culturally responsive teaching (e.g., Gay, 2010, Ladson-Billings, 1995), student and parent interview protocols, and classroom observation protocols.  Induction Support. The research on induction suggests that a comprehensive package of quality induction support holds the potential for further promoting effective teaching and for improving teacher retention. In order to leverage this potential, we have devised a one-year induction program that will support each Scholar?s transition into full-time teaching and promote their retention. Although a Noyce Scholarship grant can only provide the resources to support Scholars in their first year of teaching, we realize that three years of induction support is optimal if we want to ensure successful bridging from pre-service teacher preparation to effective in-service teaching. Accordingly, we secured permission for them to participate in second- and third-year induction programs administered by a collective of teacher preparation programs at MSU.  Goal 4: Establish the Infrastructure and Institutional Collaborations Necessary for Program Recruitment and Sustainability.  In order to establish and enhance institutional collaborations, in the past year we hosted our second one-day outreach conferences at MSU with mathematics faculty, education faculty, and transfer counselors from seven two-year colleges in NJ.  To promote and facilitate the recruitment of Noyce Scholars from our seven partner institutions, we crafted Transfer Plans for each institution that specifically correlate the courses from the MAEL plan with their institution?s corresponding, transferrable courses.    Broader Impact. The innovative teacher education program we?ve designed will serve as a model to other colleges and universities interested in the extraordinary preparation of STEM elementary teachers. The IBIS workshop and research course can be used to engage undergraduate mathematics students across the country in inquiry-oriented and authentic learning and research experiences. Further, given that community-based experiences in teacher preparation can be formative for teachers? beliefs about students and teaching in high-need settings, the design of our field experiences can serve as a model for other programs that seek to provide pre-service teachers with meaningful forms of community-based experience.
