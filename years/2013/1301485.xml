<AbstractNarration>With the support of this award from the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Michael Haley of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Oregon will prepare and study molecules based on or inspired by the indenofluorene skeleton to answer fundamental scientific questions as well as to explore their materials properties. The Haley research program will develop facile synthetic methods for the assembly of these strongly electron-accepting molecules. Once in hand, the Haley group will examine the optical and electronic properties of all new molecular scaffolds with an emphasis towards organic field effect transistor (OFET) and organic photovoltaic (OPV) applications and use in devices. The study of such molecules answers fundamental questions regarding the electronic structure and properties of non-benzenoid organic materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The molecules developed in these studies present opportunities for practical applications, particularly in the area of nanotechnology and low-cost electronics.  Moreover, this project serves as an excellent training ground for graduate and undergraduate researchers in fundamental and applied chemical synthesis. The studies will provide the researchers with broad experience in organic synthesis, computational chemistry, x-ray crystallography, and the interplay between electronic structure and molecular architecture. The broader impacts of this program include industrial internships of graduate students at local and regional companies and national labs, the exchange of graduate students with those of foreign collaborators in Germany, Denmark, and Japan, the hosting of extended stays of visiting scientists including professors from PUIs, and continued substantial involvement of undergraduates in state-of-the-art chemical research via programs which promote the participation of underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the last quarter century, research on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has seen a remarkable renaissance in the literature as compound accessibility and characterization has been made easier with the advent of modern laboratory synthesis methods and modern instrumentation, respectively. One key motivation for this resurgence lies with the unique optical and electronic properties that PAHs possess due to their inherently high levels of pi-electron conjugation and delocalization. These attributes make PAHs useful as organic semiconducting molecules for a variety of materials applications such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). While a majority of studies have focused on acenes and their derivatives, these systems are nonetheless susceptible to oxidative and photolytic degradation; thus, there is a pressing need for alternative, more stable, acene-like topologies.   Nontraditional structures that incorporate five-membered cyclopentane rings (CP-PAHs) such as fullerenes and buckybowls have undergone rapid growth as well. This NSF grant focused on the pentacyclic indenofluorenes (IFs), another reemerging class of CP-PAHs, where the B and D rings are each a five-membered ring. With NSF support, we have adapted and/or developed general methods for the assembly of a variety of fully conjugated, highly colored IF derivatives (see Figure) and initiated exploration of their materials properties. What makes the study of these novel molecules so rewarding is that IFs, in addition to being challenging synthetic targets, are providing fundamental answers about structure, bonding, and reactivity in expanded, conjugated structures, and have the potential to act as rigid, planar, electron-accepting cores for the formation of advanced materials with novel electronic properties.  Work on this NSF grant has led to several key findings regarding indenofluorenes: (1) ALL indenofluorene-related structures are do NOT fluoresce because of the presence of a 5-6-5 fused ring indacene core unit; (2) substitutung the outer rings from benzene to benzothiophene allows the antiaromaticity of the indacene to reassert itself; (3) expansion of the central 6-membered ring to anthracene afford molecules with unpaired electrons (biradical) yet these exhibit remarkable stability in solution (e.g., half life of two months); and (4) reduction or oxidation of IFs causes the cetral ring also to regain aromaticity.  All of these findings permits researcher to "tune" molecule properties to those desired or deemed useful for organic electronic applications.  The broader impacts of this program have included industrial internships of graduate students at local and regional companies, the exchange of graduate students with those of several foreign collaborators, the hosting of extended stays of visiting scientists including professors from primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs), and continued substantial involvement of undergraduates in chemical research via programs which promote participation of underrepresented groups.

Moreover, this project has served as an excellent training ground for graduate and undergraduate researchers in fundamental and applied chemical synthesis.
