<AbstractNarration>An important topic of research today is how temperature affects the diversity of life on earth. At the same time as the climate is rapidly changing though, there is also rapid expansion of highly invasive, exotic species that additionally threaten biodiversity by displacing native species. The combined effects present an enormous challenge to land managers, as they may threaten established ecosystems and undermine the services they provide to humans.  One way to meet this challenge is to study the effects on what are called foundation species. This study focuses on Fremont cottonwood, a foundation tree species that creates unique habitats along streams in the southwestern United States. These habitats support a high diversity of microbes, insects and animals, but are threatened by climate change along with a major invasive tree species, tamarisk, that displaces the native cottonwood and drastically alters the habitat and the beneficial ecosystem services it provides. The project uses genomic techniques, plus experiments that involve planting the same tree species in a range of areas, and computer modeling to determine gene flow among the cottonwoods along streams, to figure out how the cottonwood interacts with tamarisk, and to determine how tamarisk invasion changes all of the plants in these habitats and the services they provide. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;As environmental conditions change, foundation species must either adapt or go extinct. The loss of streamside habitats that are based on Fremont cottonwood is important because they are hotspots of biodiversity and provide services to local human populations in the region. This project may transform how we think of foundation species and how they respond to major disturbances, along with the other plants, animals and insects they harbor. This is useful for conservation planning.  The project will provide lesson plans and teaching materials for elementary and high school teachers and opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.  It will also expand outreach to the public on how to approach the impacts of climate change and invasive species. The field experiments will be installed in collaboration with the Southwest Experimental Garden Array, which is focused on using genetics to address climate change impacts. The results will also be made available on a public outreach website.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The over-arching goals of this project have been three-fold: 1) Examine how genetic connectivity in a widespread forest tree (Populus fremontii; Fremont cottonwood) influences associated arthropod and fungal community composition and diversity; 2) Evaluate how increased mean annual temperature affects P. fremontii, and relate these findings to both exotic tamarisk invasion and P. fremontii?s interactions with fungal and arthropod communities; 3) Assess the impacts of climate change on P. fremontii and associated impacts of tamarisk to develop specific recommendations for future conservation management of riparian areas.   To accomplish these goals, we established a series of three experimental common gardens distributed across a broad environmental gradient, consistent with the range of climatic regimes across the species? range.  Each garden consists of 4000 trees, derived from cuttings obtained from trees in the wild and reciprocally transplanted in all three gardens for a total of 12,000 trees.  We found that Populus fremontii is genetically structured into three different ?ecoregions? across its range, each of which is defined by populations that are both genetically and climatically distinct.  We also found that genetic structure in P. fremontii accounts for up to 17% of the compositional structure and diversity of its dependent arthropod and fungal communities across the three ecoregions, with environmental variation also playing a major role in determining community structure across the species range.   In response to increased temperatures we found that P. fremontii has evolved different responses to different climatic regimes, corresponding to the three ecoregions.  Populations in the hottest ecoregion (Sonoran Desert) exhibited substantially higher leaf transpiration (evaporative cooling) rates as compared to population in the coolest ecoregion (Utah High Plateau).  Populations in the mid-temperature region (California Central Valley) had evaporative cooling rates that were intermediate to tree in the hot and cool ecoregions.  These results suggest that P. fremontii is locally adapted to different environmental regimes across its range, which supports the idea that there is potential for the species to evolve novel adaptations in response to warming and drying caused by climate change.  In response to tamarisk invasion we compared our findings of local adaptation in P. fremontii to anatomical changes in tamarisk across the three ecoregions to determine if it, too, was locally adapted to different climate regimes.  We found that tamarisk in the Utah High Plateau ecoregion has smaller xylem vessels, greater below-ground allocation and greater resource allocation to carbon storage than populations from the hot, Sonoran Desert ecoregion.  In response to drought, we found that stomatal sensitivity to soil water depletion is lower in tamarisk from the cool ecoregion, than ones sourced from the Sonoran Desert.  Our results are consistent with the evolution of a swarm of ?generalist? ecotypes in the southwestern US, suggesting that tamarisk may be able to outcompete P. fremontii for habitat in a warming/drying environment.  Since arthropod and fungal communities do not colonize exotic tamarisk, we expect declines in biodiversity of these communities if tamarisk mitigation is not made a high priority for conservation management on public lands.  In greenhouse experiments we manipulated soil (tamarisk soil vs. native soil) and temperature (warmed by 3 C and ambient) and source population (tamarisk-experienced cottonwoods and tamarisk-na?ve cottonwoods), and found that cottonwood performance was reduced in tamarisk soil.  However, we found that this could be alleviated by inoculating cottonwood trees with soil fungi that typically colonizes the roots in native soil. Furthermore, tamarisk-experienced cottonwoods were the most responsive to this inoculum, ultimately growing larger than cottonwoods in the other treatment groups.  We also found that cottonwoods grown in typical temperatures had larger shoot mass, which led to a significant difference in root to shoot ratios. Cottonwoods grown in heated conditions had significantly smaller leaves and higher root area to leaf area ratios. Warm temperatures alone did not affect cottonwood growth substantially but heating altered key functional traits and the ability for fungi to colonize cottonwood roots. Together, these results indicate that native soil fungi are critical for cottonwoods experiencing environmentally stressful conditions (warming, drying and exotic invasion by tamarisk) in terms of the overall growth and performance of P. fremontii, likely affecting its ability to function as a foundation forest tree species.   Overall, our results indicate that: P. fremontii is: 1) adapted to different climatic regimes across its range; 2) genetically structured into three distinct ecoregions; 3) able to jointly determine arthropod and fungal community composition along with environmental variation; 3) capable of adapting to different environments, but is also threatened by tamarisk, which typically invades riparian environments; and 4) responsive to colonization by native soil fungi, which enhances its performance in the presence of tamarisk.  These results emphasize the importance of managing riparian ecosystems as critical niche space for Fremont cottonwood, which supports high levels of biodiversity, and underscores the need to control invasive tamarisk, which is rapidly spreading across the Southwestern U.S.       Last Modified: 06/04/2021       Submitted by: Gerard J Allan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
