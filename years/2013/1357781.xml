<AbstractNarration>From a macroeconomic perspective, one of the most puzzling aspects of the 2007-09 financial&lt;br/&gt;crisis and the ensuing slow recovery is the relative stability of inflation. Despite a large and sharp&lt;br/&gt;contraction in output in the second half of 2008 and the persistently high level of resource slack&lt;br/&gt;over the past several years, the U.S. experienced only a modest degree of disinflationary&lt;br/&gt;pressures-both at the wholesale and retail levels-behavior that is difficult to explain with&lt;br/&gt;canonical models of aggregate inflation determination. This project studies the extent to which&lt;br/&gt;the massive tightening of financial conditions at the height of the crisis in the latter part of 2008&lt;br/&gt;may help explain why inflation did not fall as much as expected during the financial crisis and the&lt;br/&gt;subsequent recovery. The underlying hypothesis posits that some firms may strategically set low&lt;br/&gt;prices to attract customers, behavior implied by the "customer-markets theory," which&lt;br/&gt;emphasizes the idea that price setting is a form of investment that builds the future customer base.&lt;br/&gt;According to this theory, firms will in normal times maintain low prices relative to their&lt;br/&gt;competitors in order to attract new customers. In turn, this implies low current mark-ups and&lt;br/&gt;hence lower cash flows.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;However, in times of widespread financial distress-when external finance becomes prohibitively&lt;br/&gt;costly or even unavailable-financially vulnerable firms will sacrifice their customer base by&lt;br/&gt;raising prices to stabilize current revenues and bolster their liquidity positions. Thus in periods of&lt;br/&gt;acute financial distress, inflation may actually rise despite a drop in economic activity and the&lt;br/&gt;emergence of a significant degree of resource underutilization. The possibility that inflation and&lt;br/&gt;output move in opposite directions in response to an adverse demand shock also challenges&lt;br/&gt;conventional thinking regarding the appropriate course of action for monetary policy during&lt;br/&gt;financial crises.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To examine this hypothesis empirically, the project merges firm-level financial data with the&lt;br/&gt;corresponding firm-level inflation rates computed from the confidential price data collected by&lt;br/&gt;the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Preliminary results indicate that financial factors had a&lt;br/&gt;significant effect on inflation dynamics during the 2007-09 crisis. Consistent with the hypothesis,&lt;br/&gt;financially "weak" firms raised prices in the latter part of 2008, whereas their financially "strong"&lt;br/&gt;counterparts lowered prices in response to a drop in aggregate demand. To date, the implications&lt;br/&gt;of this mechanism for aggregate inflation dynamics have remained largely unexplored, and this&lt;br/&gt;study provides some of the first systematic evidence on how financial conditions influence the&lt;br/&gt;price-setting behavior of firms through the incentives to set prices in a manner that preserves their&lt;br/&gt;liquidity and balance sheet capacity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the extent that this channel is quantitatively important, the analysis in this project has a direct&lt;br/&gt;bearing on gauging the likelihood of destructive large-scale disinflations during financial crises. It&lt;br/&gt;also has important implications for the conduct of monetary policy by arguing that policy makers&lt;br/&gt;should take into account the interaction between changes in the quality of the firms' balance&lt;br/&gt;sheets and their price-setting behavior when deciding on the future course of nominal interest&lt;br/&gt;rates. In addition to developing the matching algorithm that links BLS' researcher databases with&lt;br/&gt;outside firm-level data sets, the project also provides a new measure of local bank credit-supply&lt;br/&gt;conditions based on the GPS coordinates that may be used in conjunction with future BLS&lt;br/&gt;studies, opening up a whole new set of research possibilities on the spatial interaction between&lt;br/&gt;financial conditions and firm behavior.</AbstractNarration>
