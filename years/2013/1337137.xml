<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemistry Major Research Instrumentation Program, Professor Isaac VonRue from King's College and colleagues Julie Belanger, Karen Vavrek, Ronald Supkowski and Trent Snider will acquire a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) polymer science for polymer characterization to investigate thermoreversible gelation and measure glass transition and melting temperatures of new polymers;  (b) biochemistry for characterization of new lipids and liposomes; and (c) silica characterization for catalyst science to study water molecules that are chemically and physically attached to the surface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The DSC instrument allows the measurement of the difference in the amount of heat required to increase the temperature of a sample and reference as a function of temperature. This technique provides information on the chemical composition of various materials. The basic principle for this technique is that when a sample undergoes a physical transformation such as melting or freezing more or less heat will need to flow to it than the reference to maintain both at the same temperature. Whether less or more heat must flow to the sample depends on whether the process releases or needs heat (exothermic or endothermic processes, respectively).  The instrument measures the heat flux versus temperature or versus time.  This information can be used to calculate enthalpies of the processes. The instrumentation will be used not only in research but also in research training and teaching of undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The received NSF grant was used by King?s College to purchase a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) that enabled the users to perform thermoanalysis in a more controlled and reproducible way. The DSC was used to enhance the educational curriculum and independent research experience of King?s College undergraduate students.     In the first semester physical chemistry lab, students are routinely assigned a chemical species and utilize a properly standardized DSC to determine its melting point (or boiling point) and enthalpy of fusion (or vaporization) and compare this experimental data to that found in the chemical literature.  In the second semester physical chemistry lab, students are expected to analyze the temperature-composition phase behavior of a more complex binary system.  These systems range from commonly investigated tin-lead alloys to binary organic benzene-naphthalene mixtures, where the eutectic temperature of these species is below room temperature.      The DSC was also used in independent research projects to study polymer thermogels made from poly(&epsilon;-caprolactone) and dimethylformamide. These gels that are made up mostly of organic solvent behave like solids at low temperatures and melt to form homogeneous solutions at high temperatures. When cooled back down, they form uniform gels with solid-like properties. It was found that under certain conditions these gels exhibit a multiple-melting behavior, i.e. they show more than one melting temperature.
