<AbstractNarration>The Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) is part of an international effort to develop and evaluate technologies needed for a muon-based neutrino source and a future muon collider. MICE is located at the ISIS accelerator facility at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK. This award provides partial support to the University of California Riverside and the Illinois Institute of Technology to complete ongoing efforts in hardware and software development and commissioning, prior to data taking. A broader impact of the program is to engage graduate students and postdocs in forefront accelerator physics research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[NSF Award Project Outcomes Report: Collaborative Research:  Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment There is increasing interest in using particle accelerators to form very intense beams of high-energy muons.  Discovered in 1937, the muon (a more massive "cousin" of the electron) is a subatomic particle whose simple and well-understood interactions with matter make it a useful probe for a variety of purposes.  However, due to its short average lifetime (2.2 microseconds), it has not been possible to accelerate muons to high energies.  A key step in demonstrating the feasibility of muon accelerators is the Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE).  The main obstacle to accelerating an intense muon beam is that the way such beams are created makes them too large to fit into the vacuum chamber of a cost-effective accelerator, and the short muon lifetime leaves little time to shrink the beam.  Ionization cooling is a new technique to shrink, or "cool," a muon beam quickly.  In this, a beam of muons passes through material in which it loses energy by ionizing nearby atoms.  This reduces all three components of a muonÆs velocity (horizontal, vertical, and longitudinal).  The beam is then accelerated by radio-frequency cavities, replacing only the longitudinal component.  As the horizontal and vertical components are increasingly reduced while the longitudinal component is maintained, the muonsÆ trajectories become more nearly parallel, allowing focusing magnets to reduce the beam size.  The MICE experiment is under construction by an international collaboration at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire, England.  The apparatus that forms the muon beam to be studied in MICE has been installed and is working well, as have most of the particle detectors that are used to measure the muons.  The next step involves commissioning of the various superconducting magnets that will allow precise measurements of the muonsÆ momentum vectors before and after the cooling cell, and that will keep the muon beam properly focused as it passes through the cooling cell.  These magnets are currently being trained for operation at the full design magnetic field.  We anticipate that the program of measurements needed to demonstrate muon ionization cooling will be completed by about the year 2017.  Results from MICE will allow the design of muon ionization cooling channels for future neutrino facilities and particle colliders to be optimized.  Such future muon accelerator facilities may be built in the US or elsewhere in the world during the next decade.  The long lead time for design of such novel accelerators makes the expected results from MICE timely.       Last Modified: 09/01/2015       Submitted by: Daniel M Kaplan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
