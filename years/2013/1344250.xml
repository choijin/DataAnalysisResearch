<AbstractNarration>This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the Oceanographic Centers and Facilities Program in the Division of Ocean Sciences in the Directorate for Geosciences, the Transforming Undergraduate Education in STEM Program in the Division of Undergraduate Education in the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, and the Robust Intelligence Program in the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems  in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This  project is aimed at expanding the ways scientists conduct field work from oceanographic research platforms. To do so, the team will assemble a cohort of 12 undergraduate students who will be involved in a telepresence-based research cruise, whose mission is to investigate greenhouse gas exhalation from the seafloor. The students will be active in all phases of the planning, execution and conclusion of the project. The students will be mentored by the PIs as well as a group of early-career scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the ocean science objectives, the PIs will conduct an evaluation of the effectiveness of the activity for recruiting and entraining undergraduate students in STEM. They will also assess the impact the experience has on the learning experience of the students. They will also improve the capability of researchers to utilize increasingly advanced robotic systems for this activity, and in the future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another important aspect of the project is integrating an ethnography component, defined as the study of the practices through which a community makes meaning. The PIs will compare ship-based versus telepresence interactions, paying attention to where conflicts arise and how they are resolved. They will evaluate the cultural processes involved in human-machine interactions for this activity. They will assist in developing the best practices for this approach to science and help communicate the outcomes broadly.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project investigated how Telepresence could be used to broaden the access of scientists and students to deep ocean research beyond the traditional limitations of voyaging to sea aboard a research ship.  Telepresence can be defined as the use of virtual reality technology for apparent participation in distant events.  In our case we provided an opportunity for a voluntary team of both early career research scientists and their undergraduate students to participate in a research cruise to the Caribbean Sea without ever setting foot on the ship.  Instead, the team worked together from a pair of research installations on shore, at the Inner Space Center at the University of Rhode Island and a satellite telepresence center at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.  From those bases, using a combination of real-time video and audio communication technologies, they were able to work with a team of engineers at sea to operate a remotely operated vehicle at the deep ocean floor.  In exchange, this oceanographic research team agreed to be part of a larger investigation in which social scientists and educational researchers both observed and interacted with the team, over the lifetime of the project, to study the way in which telepresence was used and to make recommendations on how it could be taken advantage of more profitably in the future.   The three year project evolved in phases.  During the first year, the team became familiar with the use if video-conferencing techniques that allowed scientists and students across 6 academic institutions and three time-zones to come together once a week to participate in a seminar series.  At the outset, senior members of the team led those discussions, to explain the technologies that would be used in the Y2 field program and also the research opportunities that would be available.  Next, the early career scientists led a series of weekly discussions in which they presented their research ideas, ranging from geophysical studies to biological studies, to the team as a whole.  Lastly, the undergraduate students led discussions that closed out the Y1 seminar series, presenting their ideas for research projects they would undertake that could then be worked up as part of their senior year honors project undertakings.    The start of the second year of the program saw our joint participation, from shore, of a research cruise that investigated two sites of seafloor fluid flow &ndash; at the Kick ?Em Jenny underwater volcano in the Grenadines, and at a mud volcano south and east of Barbados.  This cruise, during which teams ashore worked 24/7, matching the scientific watches typically observed by scientists at sea, represented the primary data-gathering opportunity for our Education and Social Science researchers as well as for our Scientific Team.  During the remainder of year two, the students and their early career Professors worked up their scientific data ashore.  Preliminary results from the projects were presented back to the entire research team via video-conferencing at the end of Year 2 and then, during Year 3, more complete presentations were given to an international audience in a dedicated session of the bi-annual Ocean Sciences meeting held in New Orleans.  Two oceanographic research papers have since been submitted for peer review and students involved in this project have subsequently participated in active seagoing expeditions and applied to continue their research careers via graduate school.   The field program for Year 2 of the project also provided the main data-gathering opportunity for both the Education researchers and the Social Scientists working on the program.  For the Education research team, the results were compelling.  There was clear evidence that the undergraduate students were able to gain real and meaningful engagement in the scientific process via telepresence.  Two peer-reviewed publications and a white paper have resulted from that study providing clear documentation of the successes already achieved as well as valuable recommendations on how telepresence could be used even more effectively  in the future.  The social science team also obtained a rich data set on the work-practices associated with telepresence, focussed particularly on human-technology interactions.  The outcomes from this research are threefold.  First, a telepresence laboratory at WHOI was reconfigured using recommendations provided during the lifetime of the project, which was then used successfully for a series of follow-on cruises of opportunity.  Second, the results of the social sciences study have been captured in a research paper that is being prepared for submission to a specialist research journal.  Third, recommendations from the research are being fed forward into both technical operations and research aspects of deep ocean investigations which are being worked up to both document the successes demonstrated by the project and to provide detailed recommendations on how telepresence could be used even more productively by the US Ocean research community into the future.
