<AbstractNarration>This project will use a new N-body integrator to perform global simulations of self-gravitating rings and ringlets around Saturn.  The work is motivated by recent observations of Saturn by the Cassini spacecraft which showed unexpected non-equilibrium orbital states of the ringlets, which appear to be in free normal modes that are not forced or excited by any known resonances.  Comparisons of mode simulations with Cassini data will be used to determine physical properties, such as surface density, of the ringlets, and to explore non-equilibrium orbital dynamics in general. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include training a graduate student in all aspects of the proposed research and providing the N-body integrator code to the planetary rings community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit of project outcomes: Theory plus numerical simulations are used to demonstrate that narrow eccentric planetary ringlets are likely self-confining. Narrow planetary ringlets are common around giant planets, and possibly also around other small Solar System bodies such as Centaurs, which are distant comets. Narrow eccentric planetary ringlets also have several puzzling properties that deserve explanation: these ringlets have very sharp edges, and they also have sizable eccentricity gradients (ie the orbits of the ring particles at the ringlet's outer edge is significantly more non-circular than the particles in the ringlet's interior).  Note that prevailing theory asserts that narrow ringlets are thought to be straddled by a pair of small shepherding satellites whose gravitational perturbations are expected to confine the ringlet and prevent its rapid radial spreading due to the effects ring particle's collisional viscosity. But that theory has been cast into doubt by Cassini spacecraft observations that failed to detect any such shepherds among the ringlets at Saturn.  Our numerical simulations show that ringlet self-gravity instead tends to raise an initially narrow but unconfined ringlet's eccentricity gradient until that gradient is large enough to reverse the ring particles' relative angular motion at periapse (which is that portion of the non-circular ringlet that orbits closest to its host), which in turn slows and then ceases the ringlet's radial spreading due to particle-particle collisions, all while preserving the ringlet's sharp edges.  These findings also account for the Cassini null result by showing that self-gravitating narrow ringlets can naturally evolve into a self-confining state, and that unseen shepherd satellites are no longer required to maintain ringlets' narrow widths or their sharp edges.   This work's broader impacts: This grant also provided partial support to PhD student Thomas Rimlinger during the past 3 years; Thomas is on track to defend his PhD thesis in 2020, with the grant-supported portion of his research comprising 33% of his thesis.  This grant also supported Yuxi Lu during her gap year between graduation with her bachelors degree and her first year as a graduate student at Columbia. Yuxi also won the Ray Duncombe prize for the talk she gave on her research at the 2019 AAS/DDA conference. Yuxi has since been admitted to Columbia where she pursues her astronomy PhD.
