<AbstractNarration>Numerical methods are taught by many engineering disciplines throughout the nation and therefore more engaging and effective teaching of these methods could result in better prepared engineering graduates.  When teaching numerical methods it is critical to cover not only theoretical concepts required for algorithm development and selection but also the precise language of computer programming required for algorithm implementation.  This project is evaluating the efficacy of using an inverted classroom methodology to teach these diverse concepts.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this project will include on-line materials that encourage and support use of active in-class pedagogical methods and assessments of these materials and methods. These results will inform the education community regarding the efficacy of teaching numerical methods using an Inverted classroom methodology.  The materials will be readily available to engineering departments nationally and assessment results will help faculty better understand what aspects of numerical methods can be taught using an inverted methodology and also will give them the resources needed to teach in similar ways.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multiple universities with diverse student populations are implementing the methods and materials of this project.  Assessment and evaluation is performed by another university not affiliated with the implementers; therefore, evaluation is independent of the instructors.  Evaluation of student performance is partially being assessed using a numerical methods concept inventory which is being developed by the program.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful results in this research could transform the way engineering programs teach numerical methods nationally.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Background  Studies analyzed for college courses taught in STEM fields show that active learning increases average grades by half-a-letter grade and that failure rates in classes with traditional lecture are 55% more than the rates in classes with active learning incorporated (https://www.wired.com/2014/05/empzeal-active-learning/).  One approach to include active learning is by flipping the classroom, where initial topic introduction and instruction takes place in the student?s own space (i.e., homework), while the topic concepts are applied and active learning exercises are done in the classroom, in place of the traditional lecture format. Another alternative approach is the "blended" classroom, which integrates the benefits of both flipping and traditional lecture formats. The impact of these approaches needed to be studied further on students in engineering, and in particular on under-represented and non-traditional groups.   Intellectual Merit  As part of the course material development and assessment plan, the project investigators developed 1) a valid and reliable concept inventory to measure understanding of Numerical Methods, thus facilitating instructors? evaluation of the efficiency and effectiveness of their instructional methods, 2) online self-assessment quizzes to allow students to become engaged with the information and their learning of Numerical Methods, with features including multiple-attempts, algorithm-based, ability to integrate with course management systems, instant feedback, and automatic grading, and 3) clicker quizzes to discuss and assess conceptual knowledge of course topics in the classroom.   The project team also developed, used, revised, and improved existing resources including 1) a final examination to assess procedural and higher-order levels of learning, 2) problem-based exercises to foster higher-order learning, and 3) survey and focus group instruments to assess affective learning components and self-efficacy of students towards mastery of numerical methods under the two treatment conditions &ndash; flipped and blended classrooms.   Results  The differences between the flipped classroom and blended classroom were found to be small based on examination data from the three schools combined, although there were some large differences for the schools individually (suggesting further research with different demographics).
