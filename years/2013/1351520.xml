<AbstractNarration>Shen&lt;br/&gt;1351520&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overview: The research in this CAREER proposal addresses two fundamental issues in the emerging powered above-knee (AK) prosthetics area -- Actuation and Control -- with innovative biologically-inspired robotic approaches. The objective is to provide sufficient power output, long duration of operation, and reliable volitional control capability for powered AK prostheses to enable their use in the amputee users- daily life. By addressing these fundamental issues, this project will lay a solid foundation for the PI's long-term research goal of creating powered prosthetic devices with comparable functionality and appearance as biological limbs, so that amputee patients can enjoy life like healthy persons. The educational activities in this proposal aim to generate a synergistic impact with a series of activities under a common theme of "Using Robotics to Help Persons with Disabilities!" These activities will build a basis for the PI's long-term education goal of creating a comprehensive robotics education program that integrates education and research on multiple levels (graduate, undergraduate, and K-12), with the emphasis on recruiting, retaining, and mentoring students with disabilities.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Despite recent technological advances, the majority of state-of-the-art AK prostheses are still unpowered. Biomechanical studies show that these devices are unable to restore the normal locomotive functions. The research in this project aims at bringing powered AK prostheses to reality with a novel chemo-fluidic sleeve muscle actuation system, which provides a significant advantage relative to the traditional battery-DC motor system. The actuator in this new system, sleeve muscle actuator, provides a superior power density compared with DC motor (at least 10 times higher). It also enables the use of an innovative design philosophy - integrating joint actuator with load bearing structure -- and thus can potentially generate a highly compact AK prosthesis suitable for daily use. The new system also incorporates a new energy-storing medium, namely monopropellant, to provide ample energy supply for the AK prosthesis. As a unique class of liquid fuel, monopropellant releases energy through catalytic reaction (instead of combustion). The safe reaction products, oxygen and water steam, can be used directly as the high-pressure working fluid to drive the sleeve muscle actuator. As such, monopropellant can form the basis of a highly compact pneumatic supply to support the desired long duration of operation for powered AK prostheses.  The new actuation system will be complemented with a novel prosthesis control approach, namely fault-tolerant EMG direct control. This new approach enables volitional (i.e., according-to-the-intent) control of the prosthesis through the neural interface provided by electromyography (EMG).  Furthermore, to address the reliability issue of EMG interface, a fault-tolerant control structure will be created, which reconfigures the controller in the event of EMG failure.  As such, this novel approach is anticipated to allow the user to control the prosthesis according to his or her intention while avoiding the hazards from a complete controller failure, such as falling and the resulting injuries.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Currently, there are more than 400,000 AK amputees in the U.S., and this number is expected to double by 2050. The proposed research has the potential to benefit society by significantly improving these amputees' mobility and quality of life. Furthermore, based on the PI's ongoing educational efforts, new education activities will be conducted in this project by integrating research into education. These activities include: (1) Establish a comprehensive plan for the recruitment, retention, and mentoring of students with disabilities; (2) Contribute to graduate education in both engineering and prosthetics &amp; orthotics with the efforts towards bridging the gap between biomedical engineering research and clinical practice; (3) Promote undergraduate research with a multi-year research project aiming at developing a robotic arm exhibit for a science museum; (4) Outreach into K-12 education system to promote science and engineering with robotics-themed activities, collaborating with the first STEAM-accredited elementary school in the world.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this CAREER project, our research was dedicated to the goal of developing more powerful and user-friendly lower-limb prostheses through advanced actuation and control approaches.  For individuals living with lower-limb losses, restoring the lost knee and ankle functions with powerful robotic joints may significantly improve their mobility and quality of life, but they also prefer their prostheses to be compact and lightweight.  To meet such challenging requirements, we investigated various technical approaches to power the prosthetic joints.  A unique method we developed is the sleeve-type artificial muscle actuation, which mimics the human?s biological muscle-bone structure with an integrated design of the actuator surrounding the load-bearing supporting tube.  The muscle actuator is similar to the biological muscle as it contracts and drives the robotic joint through an artificial tendon when activated, and it generates a large pulling force when the membrane is inflated with internal gas pressure.  On the other hand, the whole package is relatively long so it may not be able to fit individuals with short leg lengths.  We also tried to use pneumatic cylinders to power the prosthetic joints, but its practicality is limited by the short period of operation with the onboard energy source.  To maximize the possibility of obtaining a practical robotic prosthesis in the near future, we decided to shift the focus to the electric motor-based actuation.  Our unique technical approach is called Common-Core-Components Knee-Ankle Prostheses (C3KAP), which allows the knee and ankle joints to share a common structure to facilitate the future manufacturing at a reasonable cost.  We developed two generations of robotic prostheses under this framework, and the latest design has shown great promise in providing the desired performance while reducing complexity and device weight.  We have also developed new methods for the control of prosthesis motion.  Robotic prostheses, with their powered joints, may enable the amputee users to regain the capability of conducting power-demanding movements.  Leveraging this capability, we developed a controller to provide smooth control experience in climbing stairs as well as a smooth transition between walking and stair climbing.  We have also developed machine learning approaches to recognize the amputee user?s intent of locomotion utilizing simple wearable inertia sensors.  Finally, we investigated the prosthesis control and intent recognition problem in amputee users? daily-living scenarios, using multi-modal data collected in real-world environments (i.e. outside research labs).  The results from this project may benefit the large population of individuals living with lower-limb losses, with the estimated number exceeding 200,000 in the United States.  We have also conducted multiple education and outreach activities in this project.  Three Ph.D. students were supported by this project and completed (or are about to complete) their research work.  Undergraduate students were involved in the attractive robotic projects to develop robotic arms/hands and mobile robots, which can be used in the K-12 outreach.  Many of them were active in the outreach activities, mentoring middle/high school students for robotics competition and demonstrating robots in schools and museums.  With these activities, we were able to reach many young children, make them excited about robots, and encourage them to take future careers in science, technology, and engineering.
