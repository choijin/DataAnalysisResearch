<AbstractNarration>Dissolution of excess anthropogenic CO2 into the ocean is causing the marine environment to decrease in pH. This "ocean acidification" is predicted to threaten a broad variety of marine organisms, particularly calcifying animals such as the thecosome (i.e., shelled) pteropods. These pelagic gastropods form an aragonite shell, are prey for a number of commercially important fish, and are significant contributors to carbon biogeochemistry. Their ecosystem importance, abundance, and sensitivity to dissolution position them as an important group for investigating the impacts of acidification. Our understanding of the effect of high CO2 on pteropods and the pelagic ecosystem, however, is limited primarily to short-term studies of adult calcification and respiration response in the polar ecosystems. There have been no seasonal studies of sensitivity and our understanding of the effect of CO2 on pteropod early life stages is limited. Limacina retroversa is a particularly abundant thecosome pteropod in the North Atlantic, where it is prey for a number of fisheries species and other top predators. This species is also the most common pteropod in the Gulf of Maine (GoM) where it is present year round. L. retroversa thus offers the prospect of a useful model pteropod species, given both its ecological importance and its abundance in readily accessible waters. The investigators will conduct a series of short cruises to sample L. retroversa on a seasonal basis from local waters of the GoM near Cape Cod. The carbonate chemistry of the GoM fluctuates seasonally, proving them with the opportunity to assess the response of wild caught pteropods to natural changes in CO2. By characterizing the carbonate chemistry of the water column and measuring the metabolic rate, shell quality, and gene expression of pteropods throughout the year, the researchers will achieve a time series of pteropod sensitivity to CO2. Subsequently, using experimental manipulations the investigators will explore the effect of seasonal acclimation on pteropod response to short- and medium-term exposure to enhanced CO2. Pteropods frequently lay eggs in captivity, and at WHOI there is institutional expertise in maintaining these individuals in the laboratory. Building on these strengths, the researchers will also study the effect of CO2 on embryonic and larval development in L. retroversa. These earliest life-stages of marine calcifiers are thought to be especially sensitive since initial shell precipitation and the highly energetic processes of growth and development are impeded by CO2 exposure. They will also document mortality, shell production, abnormality, and developmental rate of clutches of pteropod embryos exposed to increased CO2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  Thecosome pteropods are an abundant group of calcifying zooplankters that have been chronically understudied, particularly in temperate regions. Due to its accessibility and ecological importance, L. retroversa can be developed as a valuable model, interesting both as the dominant pteropod in the commercially-important GoM region and also an abundant pteropod in the temperate waters of the North Atlantic. The goal of this research is to augment our knowledge of the distribution of L. retroversa, to attain an understanding of their seasonal sensitivity to natural variability in CO2, and to see how this exposure impacts responses to both short- and medium-term CO2 exposure. Using powerful transcriptomic technologies, the research will transform our understanding of this group by investigating the molecular mechanisms of response in L. retroversa to both seasonality and varying durations and intensities of acidification, contextualized by ecosystem- and organism-level metrics. Furthermore the study &lt;br/&gt;will examine the effect of CO2 on the eggs of pteropods for the first time, providing insight into their sensitivity to an acidifying &lt;br/&gt;environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Ocean acidification is increasingly appreciated as an urgent societal concern. Thecosomes are important in biogeochemical cycles and as key prey for a variety of commercial fish and as such, the improved understanding we seek of pteropod ecology will have important implications for our understanding of the effects of ocean acidification on marine resources. The project will integrate research with education in a number of ways, including the training of undergraduate students as well as serving as a seminal experience in the career development of postdoc (and co-PI) Dr. Maas. Furthermore, taking advantage of the aesthetic appeal of these charismatic microfauna, the researchers will pair with journalists, artists, and photographers to continue to develop images and exhibitions aimed at increasing public awareness of the impacts of ocean acidification.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Ocean acidification (OA) is a change in water chemistry that occurs as anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) equilibrates from the air into seawater. In temperate areas, water chemistry, including acidity, can show a strong seasonal cycle, due to changes in sunlight (used for photosynthesis, which absorbs CO<sub>2</sub>) and temperature. OA can have serious impacts on marine animals, especially those that form shells or skeletons from calcium carbonate, such as corals, oysters and clams. In this project we studied the effects of ocean acidification on a shell-forming planktonic pteropod (a group of marine snails) called <em>Limacina retroversa. </em>We were particularly interested in whether the biology of the animal changes over the course of the year in relation to seasonal changes in water chemistry.&nbsp;</p> <p>We sampled pteropods from the Gulf of Maine during all four seasons and studied their shell condition, locomotion, respiration rate, reproduction and gene expression patterns. We found that these pteropods can reproduce throughout the year but appear to have a predominantly seasonal cycle. They showed natural seasonal variability in both shell condition and gene expression. Shells condition was worst in January, when water is naturally most acidic. We conducted experiments throughout the year exposing pteropods to different CO<sub>2</sub> levels for up to two weeks. Importantly, we found evidence that animals varied in their sensitivity to CO<sub>2</sub> across the year, which indicates a response (acclimatization) to the seasonal environmental conditions.&nbsp; For example, respiration rates were most sensitive to CO<sub>2</sub> exposure in the lab in April, when environmental CO<sub>2</sub> is naturally lowest. Gene expression varied more across seasons within the natural population than in response to either captivity or experimental CO<sub>2</sub> exposure. These seasonal differences appear to be related to lipid metabolism and biomineralization that may be linked with developmental progression and overwintering strategies. In the lab, as the duration and severity of CO<sub>2</sub> exposure increased, we observed consistent gene expression changes related to biomineralization, acid-base regulation, metabolism and neural signaling transcripts. Several of these genes can serve as biomarkers of acidification stress responses. Six scientific papers have been published describing these results, and a seventh is currently in review. Multiple presentations have been given at domestic and international meetings describing these results for scientific audiences, and three students have completed Ph.D. dissertations related to this project. All of the molecular and environmental data are publicly available.</p> <p>Broader impacts of the work included training of three Ph.D. students and one postdoctoral investigator. The postdoctoral investigator assumed substantial leadership responsibilities and has since accepted a faculty position and established her own lab. Multiple photos from the research cruises and experiments, with associated informative captions, have been featured as the &ldquo;Image of the Day&rdquo; on WHOI&rsquo;s main website and in the WHOI Oceanus Magazine.&nbsp; These venues are the main portals by which WHOI interacts with the public. Additional outreach included public talks at the Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (Plankton, and Ocean Acidification), inclusion of the material in popular science TV episodes (the Water Brothers and NOVA) and as educational content in the 2014 National Ocean Science Bowl and a PBS Learning Media video.
