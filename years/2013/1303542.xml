<AbstractNarration>This project considers the generation of North African and Mediterranean climate anomalies by El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and Eurasian snow cover fluctuations. Two causal mechanisms are examined, one involving tropospheric teleconnections produced by Rossby wave generation and propagation (a "horizontal" mechanism), and the other involving stratosphere-troposphere interactions (a "vertical" mechanism).  The horizontal mechanism is hypothesized to consist of 1) a canonical northeastward propagating wave train that emanates from the eastern equatorial Pacific, and 2) an ultra-low frequency Rossby wave that is excited over the Pacific, trapped within the North African-Asian (NAA) jet and propagates upstream to the Mediterranean region. The vertical mechanism begins with an expansion of Eurasian snow cover, which leads to colder surface conditions and lowering of mid-tropospheric geopotential height. This in turn amplifies the wave-1 stationary wave pattern, which propagates into the stratosphere and reduces the strength of the polar vortex, resulting in a negative anomaly of the Arctic or North Atlantic Oscillation, which shifts the jet stream and storm track southward. The southward shift of the jet and storm track allows colder temperatures to invade the middle latitudes, including the Mediterranean region.  These influences will be examined through statistical analysis combined with a suite of models including a Rossby wave ray tracing calculation, a linearized barotropic model, a state-of-the-art global atmospheric model (CAM), and an atmospheric model with a well-resolved stratosphere (WACCM).  In addition, an empirical prediction scheme will be developed and tested using Eurasian snow cover and ENSO as predictors for seasonal Mediterranean precipitation and surface temperature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work has societal broader impacts due to the agricultural and other consequences of climate variability in the Mediterranean region.  More specifically, the empirical prediction scheme will be provided to operational centers including the International Research Institute at Columbia University.  In addition, a website will be developed to provide public information regarding the role of atmospheric teleconnections in producing climate anomalies.  The project will also support and train a graduate student, thereby providing for the future scientific workforce in this research area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of the project was to explore how Mediterranean climate is affected by some major climate patterns including El-Nino, snow cover over the sub-arctic, and Arctic and North-Atlantic climate variability. The project used both observations and a hierarchy of models of varying complexity, to contribute to an improved understanding of these connections and to an enhanced seasonal forecast skill.     We explored the initiation of the wintertime dominant climate mode known as the Arctic Oscillation, which strongly affects the climate of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. We found that Arctic sea ice variability, in turn, strongly affects the AO via a path affecting first the stratospheric polar vortex through vertical atmospheric wave propagation. We also showed that fall sea ice and snow cover are highly skillful for predicting winter temperatures in the Mediterranean and Middle East. Finally, we developed a new statistical model based on these new understandings that demonstrates skill in predicting winter precipitation in the Mediterranean and Middle East regions.     Atmospheric waves propagate climate and weather influences between forcing factors such as El Nino?s warming of sea surface temperature, high latitude snow cover, or Arctic sea ice on the one hand, and remote responses such as the Mediterranean climate on the other. Such waves can propagate in different directions and travel large distances over the globe to the affected area. The large distances covered, and the fact that these waves can arrive to the affected regions via several different paths, make it difficult to find the exact path of propagation and distinguish different influences. In parallel to the observational analysis of such wave connections, we have therefore developed a scheme that can be used in comprehensive climate models to selectively shut off different propagation paths. This scheme has been used to characterize the way in which El Nino-related wave activity impacts North Africa and the Mediterranean, and can be used for decipher additional such remote influence paths.     Overall this project contributed to our understanding of how the Mediterranean climate is affected by remote forcing, contributing toward an improved future ability to predict Mediterranean seasonal climate.
