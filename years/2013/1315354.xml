<AbstractNarration>This is a 3-year observation and modeling research project aimed at characterizing incident, energetic protons from ground-based wide-field spectroscopic observations of H emissions, the so-called proton aurora.  The modeling effort will combine a comprehensive proton transport code with a radiative transfer model to assess the contamination of H Balmer Doppler profiles from nearby proton aurora.  Two high resolution (&lt; 0.1 nm) imaging spectrographs (CESAR and HiTIES) will be deployed, first at Poker Flat and then separated by 325 km, and data from these will be combined with measurements from the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR) as well as from the PFISR facility spectrograph to verify the theoretical predictions. This will allow for accurate derivation of mean energy and energy flux of the incoming protons from the H Doppler profiles and this result will be validated with complementary radio and space-based observations.  The improved analysis technique will be employed, specifically, to quantify the energy changes of the incoming protons during active times such as during substorms.  The research project will be mainly conducted by postdoctoral fellow in collaboration with and under the guidance of an international team of senior scientists with a broad range of expertise.  An interdisciplinary team of modelers and experimentalists from several institutions in the United States and the United Kingdom will work together on this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this research project was to study and increase knowledge and understanding of auroral processes through modeling and data analysis with data collected from a new, novel instrument.  Charged particles in the upper atmosphere cause the aurora, the beautiful light displays seen from the ground at high latitudes.  The details of these charged particles and their energy is an area of active study.   We designed and developed a specialized instrument to study auroral emission.  This instrument, called the High Throughput and Multi-slit Imaging Spectrograph (HiT&amp;MIS), is capable of imaging specific wavelengths of light from various particles in the atmosphere simultaneously.   This enables a direct comparison of the atoms and molecules that create this light and their behavior during aurora.  The HiT&amp;MIS instrument can observe continuously both daytime and nighttime, and therefore can track the variability and temporal evolution of auroral emissions.  The intensity ratios of the different wavelengths of light detected by HiT&amp;MIS carry information on the energy of the particles of interest, making this a powerful instrument to enhance the communityÃ†s knowledge on these auroral processes and energetics.   Two copies of the HiT&amp;MIS instrument have been assembled, tested, and deployed for observations by the research team.  The instrument was placed at Millstone Hill Observatory in Massachusetts where it observed both normal space weather conditions and auroral conditions.  Comparing data during an "active" aurora day and a "quiet" day indicates that the instrument observed a bright aurora with significant spatial structure.  Both HiT&amp;MIS instruments were deployed in Kiruna, Sweden as part of a ground-based campaign in support of the NASA BARREL balloon mission where aurora was again observed.  A detailed analysis of the energy and energy flux of incident particles detected by the instrument using a physics-based model is underway.  In addition to the development of the HiT&amp;MIS instrument and subsequent observations, the team has conducted several studies on ionospheric and auroral processes.  Ground-based optical and radar measurements, particle data from the NOAA 16 and DMSP F14 satellites, and images of hydrogen emission from the IMAGE satellite were analyzed and the results have been published.  Another investigation was conducted and published on ultraviolet light in a region in the upper atmosphere, called the ionosphere, using data from an instrument on the International Space Station and Incoherent Scatter Radar data from Millstone Hill Observatory.  The modeling and data analysis already completed and published by this team have advanced the understanding of ionospheric activity and the aurora.  The HiT&amp;MIS instruments will continue to continuously observe and monitor these emissions from New England and from around the world and will be a powerful tool for furthering our understanding of this field.
