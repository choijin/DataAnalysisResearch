<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to establish the feasibility of a novel assay which would enable the culture-free identification of sepsis inducing pathogens and their resistance traits. Sepsis is a one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the US with over 210,000 annual mortalities. The key to treating sepsis properly is rapid and accurate identification of the causative pathogen. Unfortunately, given the wide range of potential pathogens which can induce sepsis, the ?gold-standard? today for diagnosis remains culturing; which typically requires up to 3-5 days for accurate identification leading to a significant delay in the initiation of a targeted treatment protocol.  The technical research will demonstrate the ability of using synthetic DNA analogues in a specific manner which could provide a method to circumvent the need to culture in order to properly identify the causative pathogen.  If successful, this assay would provide a significant improvement to the current norm ? reducing the extremely high mortality rates as well as reducing healthcare related costs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to address a major barrier to improving patient outcome in cases of sepsis ? the need to culture.  Over 700,000 patients will be diagnosed with sepsis this year, and roughly 30% will not survive ? the need is apparent. The economic impact is likewise exceedingly high, roughly $24B, due to the prolonged hospital stay. As the primary determinant of patient outcome is the timely choice of the appropriate therapy ? by reducing the time to pathogen identification to hours instead of days, patient outcome will be drastically improved as well as a reduction in hospital related costs due to a reduction in disease severity. The assay proposed in the project has been designed to utilize instrumentation and technical competencies already in place in the hospital lab. The combination of improved patient outcome, a reduction in hospital related costs, and a product design facilitating a straightforward adoption, promises significant and rapid market penetration. There are no other methods available that offer the range of capabilities, the simplicity of use, and the compatibility to test for multiple pathogens and resistance genes like the proposed assay.</AbstractNarration>

This disease is commonly referred to as the silent or hidden epidemic, as until recently few outside the medical profession have been truly aware of the magnitude of this epidemic.  Today, septicemia has become the 6th leading cause mortality in the US.  Every year more than 1.6 million annual cases occur leading to over 210,000 mortalities and accounts for over 25% of all ICU usage and 17% of all hospital deaths. Perhaps even more worrisome is the current trend: Hospitalization rates due to septicemia have doubled, from 11.6 to 24 per 10,000 patients from 2000 &ndash; 2008.  In septicemia, early targeted treatment is life-saving, and considering the rate at which the disease develops, is considered perhaps the most crucial factor to improving patient outcome.  Unfortunately the current diagnostic process, which hasnÆt truly changed since the time of Pasteur (mid-1800s!) requires 2-5 days for accurate identification of the infection, and hence septicemia is typically recognized too late. Given this delay in diagnosis, clinician typically opt for an empirically designed broad-spectrum antimicrobial æcocktailÆ which is not only less effective, but likewise increases complications, and significantly increase the prevalence of drug resistant microorganisms. The goal of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is to establish the feasibility of a rapid diagnostic for diagnosing septicemia with the sensitivity and accuracy the clinician requires for proper treatment.     The research supported by this award was designed to establish that, through the use of newly developed and fully-engineered nucleic acid æmimicsÆ, a novel approach to rapid septicemia diagnosis could be realized. The results of this Phase I project support the prospect that these newly developed nucleic acid æmimicsÆ are suitable for adoption into a diagnostic approach.  Our results highlight that these nucleic acid æmimicsÆ facilitate a substantially faster diagnostic assay as well as one that is more sensitive and more accurate than current, more conventional, approaches.  These three key characteristics are highly sought after as current diagnostics have not yielded the clinically required results.     In light of our Phase I findings, future work will emphasize both the expansion of the diagnostic panel to additional microorganisms, as well as the transition of the processing steps into a fully-automated cartridge-based consumable. In parallel to the development of the fully automated cartridge, we will develop a bench-top instrument to enable, post-specimen collection, a hands-off approach to diagnosing the disease.

The need is apparent, there is not a single FDA cleared diagnostic available that can identify the disease within the clinically required timeframe.
