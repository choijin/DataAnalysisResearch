<AbstractNarration>Humans typically rely on vision as their primary sense in their interactions with the world. Understanding how higher-order cortical brain processes contribute to human visual perception is a critical issue in cognitive science. Color offers a unique opportunity for understanding the brain mechanisms of perception because the very first step in color processing, the absorption of light by cells in the retina (photoreceptors), is fully understood. This knowledge allows the color scientist to manipulate early signals in the nervous system and measure the perceptual result. Perceptual and neurophysiological experiments have shown that signals from the different photoreceptors in the eye are combined, approximately by addition and subtraction. Our ability to see colors and to discriminate one color from another are the result of these neural sums and differences. For about the past half-century, perceptual scientists have tried to understand the number and nature of these neural color mechanisms: Are there few color mechanisms or many? Do they just add and subtract photoreceptor signals or do they perform more complex calculations? The present work combines computational modeling with novel experimental techniques and strategies. In some cases, random visual flickering elements will appear over a test stimulus. If the noise and test are processed through the same color mechanisms, the noise should hinder the ability of a person to see the test color (by a process like camouflage). If the noise and test are processed in separate mechanisms, the noise should have no effect on the ability to see the test at all. The properties of the color mechanisms will be quantitatively studied by varying the color of the noise relative to the test.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding how the brain processes color information is an important part of the more general understanding of how we perceive the world around us. There are practical applications of this research as well: Color is an important part of signaling systems and information displays. Having a quantitative model of color vision will help the designer of cockpit and automotive displays, medical information and imaging displays, and even digital television systems, to more efficiently and accurately convey information to users.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Humans rely on vision to identify objects at a distance.  Color vision plays an important role in this process, helping people search for a car in a parking lot, find fruit in a tree, identify the health and emotional state of other people via skin tone, respond to signal lights, and many other day-to-day tasks -- not to mention helping to enjoy great works of art and the beauty of a sunset.  Much is known about the earliest stages of color visual processing, and about high level phenomena such as naming and categorizing colors, but there has been a lack of understanding of the proceses that are intermediate between these low- and high-level processes.  This NSF-funded project used perceptual and computational methods to develop a quantitative theory of how neural signals in the retina of the eye are transformed into a limited set of so-called "color mechanisms."  These mechanisms can explain how we detect signals generated in the cone photoreceptors of the retina; sample data are shown in Figure 1.  The colored lines represent constant responses from six different color mechanisms, and the circles are the stimuli that a person can just detect.  The model corresponds very closely to the perceptual responses.  The colors of the circles (and the lines) represent the colors that people see when each of the different mechanisms is stimulated by itself.  The new theory predicts human sensitivity and the colors that are seen nearly perfectly.  An important property of these mechanisms is that they only have one sign of response, rather than responding positively for some colors and negatively for others as many textbook descriptions of color suggest.  This "unipolar" nature of color mechanisms is created at the very first neural connection in the retina of the eye, where signals from the photoreceptors are split into "ON" and "OFF" neural pathways.  This NSF-supported research has explored perceptual consequences of having unipolar color mechanisms. One example is shown in Figure 2: the upper panel shows perceptual color responses from one human subject when exposed to flickering colored lights.   The actual physical average of the flickering light is always "yellow", but the perceived average color is reddish or greenish depending on how the light flickers: the bands of red and green represent how often the person called the light red or green.  This illusion can be predicted by a mathematical model of color processing: those predictions are shown in the bottom panel, and they correspond very well to the behavior of the human subject.  The theory describes how light-generated stimuli that vary over time are processed by the human visual system.  The broader impacts of this project include training 11 undergraduates, 10 of whom were women, in quantitative behavioral science.  Almost all of these students are going on to careers in medical or scientific fields.  In addition, the theoretical knowledge gained in terms of understanding color vision may lead to better information displays that use color.   This NSF-funded project has made significant strides towards a full understanding of the way humans respond to color, and in particular the results help link the first responses in the eye to the later aspects of color perception such as color appearance, preference, and categorization.
