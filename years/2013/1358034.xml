<AbstractNarration>1358034&lt;br/&gt;Ju &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is an urgent need to minimize or possibly eliminate industrial usage of freshwater.  It has been estimated that thermoelectric power production withdraws close to 40% of freshwater in the US.  Currently available dry cooling methods with zero water consumption have found very limited usage (&lt; 2%) due to the high capital cost, large footprints/weight, and low thermal efficiency. Therefore, research toward developing innovative alternative dry cooling methods that are economical are need to facilitate their broad adoption. This will eliminate the water withdrawal for cooling in power generation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research at UCLA will develop a new class of technology called DIrect-contact Liquid-on-String Heat Exchangers (DILSHE) for dry cooling of a steam power plant.  A key feature of the DILSHE is the use of inexpensive and light-weight materials, making it highly economical and easily transportable.  High heat transfer effectiveness is achieved using thin films of non-volatile liquids flowing over a dense array of parallel strings while reducing associated gas flow pressure drop.  Another feature of DILSHE is its modular design; this allows multiple units to be stacked together to form large cooling units, with each module being field readily serviceable and/or replaceable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research proposes to conduct systematic experimental and theoretical investigation to establish scientific and engineering foundation for rigorous design and optimization of the DILSHE.  It will improve and apply advanced fluid mechanical and thermal metrology tools and techniques for studying the instability of gravity-driven thin liquid film flows and associated enhancement in mass, momentum, and energy transport.  Comprehensive survey and preliminary screening of non-volatile heat transfer liquids will also be conducted to facilitate exploration of their novel use not only in the proposed DILSHE but also other heat transfer applications.  The research will also build and test a lab scale prototype (25 kW capacity) to validate the proposed design and to facilitate further commercial development of the technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will also include dedicated efforts to involve undergraduate and graduate students from under-represented groups. K-12 STEM education will be promoted by developing innovative programs for high-school students based on a cradle-to-career philosophy that leverages the research components of the project in coordination with UCLA's outreach offices.  The project will also include efforts to promote engineering business opportunities, which, when instilled early on, will help promote an entrepreneurial spirit that resonates with the youth in the United States.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Economic and light-weight heat exchangers are an important enabling technology for a wide variety of engineering applications.  One important example is dry cooling of thermoelectric power plants.  The current wet cooling method requires significant consumption of fresh water, which presents major challenges as droughts become more frequent and severe in many parts of the nation and the world.  Heat exchangers developed so far for dry cooling have found limited adoption due in large part to their high capital cost and heavy weight of metal fins.  Alternative heat exchanger technologies that can circumvent these limitations are urgently needed to enable wider adoption of dry cooling of power plants.  In the project, we performed comprehensive fundamental studies of one promising heat exchanger design, termed a DIrect-contact Liquid-on-String Heat Exchanger (DILSHE).  Each DILSHE unit consists of a dense array of aligned polymer strings with a diameter of the order of 1 mm.  A heated non-volatile coolant is fed into the top reservoir of the DILSHE unit.  Driven by gravity, thin films of the liquid coolant flow along the strings and form liquid beads due to flow instabilities.  The coolant is cooled by counter-flowing ambient air.   We conducted systematic experiments and theoretical analyses to establish firm scientific foundation for rigorous physics-based design of the multi-string heat exchangers.  Our related studies of mass transfer also provide experimental data and theoretical models to improve understanding of complex transport phenomena.    In the course of our project, we also realized the potential of our multi-string heat exchangers for other applications that require highly effective and energy-efficient heat and mass transfer.  These include waste heat capture, atmospheric CO2 capture, and thermal desalination and water treatments.  To demonstrate such potential, we conducted a preliminary experimental and theoretical study to explore potential use of our multi-string heat and mass exchangers in a thermal desalination method called the humidification-dehumidification process.  All our technical results have been published in archival journals and/or presented at technical conferences.   The project also played integrals roles in educating our students.  The project has served as bases for PhD dissertation research for 3 students and helped train multiple other MS and PhD students.  The PI's lab also hosted 12 high school students, most of whom from underrepresented groups, as part of its summer research programs.  With a focus on today's engineering and environmental problems, these summer programs helped excite and prepare young students to pursue college education and future careers in areas of science and engineering.
