<AbstractNarration>Crystal growth from high temperature solutions is used to create new oxide materials with complex structures and desirable luminescent properties.  Several approaches to the crystal growth from high temperature solutions are being pursued to create different classes of luminescent materials for solid-state lighting applications, including the use of high temperature solutions to grow new complex rare earth containing oxides for solid state lighting and upconversion applications; and the use of fluxes stable under highly reducing conditions for the crystal growth of complex Eu2+ containing phosphors. In addition, this research investigates the process of crystal growth in fluxes using in-situ at the Diamond beam line in the UK, aiming to reveal the materialization of intermediates that are typically neither observed nor isolated, and the formation of the final product. In the short term, the information gained from the in-situ work is used to optimize the crystal growth experiments, while in the long run this understanding transforms flux crystal growth from an empirical method to a more deliberate process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The area of solid state lighting materials is focused on the development of energetically more efficient and visually more pleasing light emitting phosphors.    To accomplish these tasks, undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers are being trained in cutting-edge techniques for synthesizing and characterizing these materials using state of the art instrumentation.  This project provides education and research training to students (including women and underrepresented minorities) and helps to prepare a skilled workforce for academia and industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The discovery of new materials and associated desirable properties has been a driving force behind chemical innovation for centuries.  To advance this process we have used one method&mdash;crystal growth from high temperature solutions&mdash; that resulted in the targeted synthesis of new compositions with complex structures and desirable luminescent properties. Moreover, our ability to prepare these new materials as high quality single crystals is extremely important for structure determination and physical property characterization.   We succeeded in synthesizing new luminescent oxides, the light emitters that are used in fluorescent and LED light bulbs, and have greatly expanded the number of known light emitting materials.  In addition, we determined that some of these light emitters also scintillate.  Scintillators, materials that are able to both absorb high energy radiation and convert this energy into excited states in active luminescence centers for light emission, have many uses ranging from X-ray photography, to X-ray phosphors, to PET and CT scanners, X-ray and neutron detectors, and, more recently, by homeland security for improved nuclear detection systems.  The discovery of these materials will help make America a safer place.   Exploratory flux mediated crystal growth, the method that we have been employing, has been tremendously successful at discovering interesting inorganic compounds; however, the method does not reveal the existence of intermediates, as only the final products are isolated at the end of the reaction.  Uncovering the presence of any potential intermediates is, thus, of great interest and can be achieved via in-situ neutron diffraction crystal growth studies to observe, in real time, the processes occurring, including phase formation and crystal growth.  We have worked closely with staff at the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory to develop the infrastructure and methodology to perform the in-situ measurements.  We have successfully carried out the in-situ measurements and have learned much about the processes that take place during crystal growth.  The knowledge that we gained from these experiments has helped us to identify the optimal growth conditions for preparing new luminescent materials in our laboratory, and begun the process that will transform crystal growth from an empirical to a deliberate process.
