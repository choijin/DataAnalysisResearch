<AbstractNarration>Many of Earth's ecological systems face substantial future warming that could cause loss of species, erode ecological functioning, and jeopardize environmental services that support human livelihoods. Ecological theory predicts that some species may be resilient to warming if individuals in warmer parts of their distribution have already evolved greater tolerance of high temperature and can migrate to cooler parts as they warm. Less clear is whether these immigrants will be able to play the same functional roles as the former residents; if not, ecological functions could still erode. To test this question, this study will study populations of spider predators and insect prey across a temperature gradient similar to the predicted change in global climate. The thermal tolerances of spiders from north to south will be measured, spiders and prey populations will be experimentally transplanted between parts of the regions to mimic the mixing that might occur due to warming and migration, and the differences in functioning between these experimentally mixed communities and existing communities will be tested. The study will thus improve understanding of the potential for evolution to confer the ability to tolerate changes in climate and thereby increase the resiliency of species to environmental change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enhance participation of women and minorities in STEM research in the context of environmental problems. It will also help to train a globally diverse and competitive STEM workforce through coursework and hands-on research experiences in evidence-based, applied environmental science. The research infrastructure will be leveraged to develop New Haven Public School STEM curricula on environmental services, biodiversity, and effects of climate change.</AbstractNarration>
