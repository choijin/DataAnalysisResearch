<AbstractNarration>This project will build upon prior research to improve upon a natural polymer-based scaffold technology for implant applications.  Researchers have developed a mechanically competent bioactive biodegradable fixation device using cellulose, which is a polymer of natural origin. This polymer class has a long medical history as dialysis membrane, wound care system and pharmaceutical excipient. The research team previously evaluated cellulose-based scaffold systems for bone regeneration applications and has determined the biocompatibility, mechanical competence and osteoenic properties of cellulose scaffold system applications.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional metallic fixation devices such as plates and screws have several limitations and eventually may require additional surgery for removal. The biodegradable fixation devices developed through this project are designed to degrade completely, eliminating the need for a removal operation. This material platform is potentially stronger, more biocompatible and may meet the versatile needs in biological science and biomedical engineering. These products may also find applications to deliver bioactive molecules, antibiotics and pain medications to treat various aliments within the musculoskeletal system.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview:   The NSF I-Corps proposal is aimed to identify opportunities and realize commercialization potential of natural polymer based scaffold technology for implant applications. Our motivation to apply for this highly competitive award was to translate the strong technologies that we have developed under prior NSF funding into commercial reality with guidance from entrepreneurship educators and mentors. We conceptualized the commercialization of orthopedic fixation devices fabricated using bioactive natural polymer systems. This unique material platform we have developed is potentially stronger, more biocompatible and can be customized to meet needs in biological sciences and biomedical engineering. We identified several product segments for which there exists a need for degradable and a biocompatible material platform combined with mechanical competence which is a must for successful musculoskeletal applications.  Intellectual Merit:  Orthopaedic fixation devices built on biodegradable cellulose material platform, in particular screws, rods, plates, interbody spacers have several advantages over existing products and address many clinically unmet needs. Patent applications US20100249931A1, WO/2010/096199, US20110208190 A1 and WO/2011/106,387 cover several aspects of the technology.  Broader Impacts:  The success of this innovation program will address fundamental issues facing translation of academic research into commercial reality. Based on the tested hypotheses, strong IP portfolio and the feasibility of 510(k) clearance route, it was decided to proceed with the development of the identified product. The cash flow from the initial product base will allow the new company to re-invest in its R&amp;D efforts to develop subsequent products and to identify other new opportunities. This approach will create an academic-based innovation ecosystem and develop products of high commercial impact. Educationally, this unique grant opportunity exposed the Entrepreneur Lead (EL) and the PI to the needs of technology commercialization and product development which would not have been possible through the regular research grants. The EL plans to foster his career through corporate development and head the efforts to commercialize the product and technology.     Summary of the Award Outcomes:   This program helped us in realizing that our proposed product segments were good, however we must prioritize them based on the time, cost and resources necessary to reach the market. Under the strong mentorship of the I-Corps instructors and educators, we got out of the building and conducted more than 100 interviews during the course duration (Oct 7 &ndash; Nov 19).

We attended several conferences (Congress of Neurological Surgeons, Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine International Society, and Medical Device and Manufacturing Minneapolis) meeting with device manufacturers, distributors, contract service providers, buying agents, hospital decision makers and doctors. The customer discovery process taught by this program helped us realize that our MVP is a syndesmosis screw used for lower extremity fracture fixation. The current products in this segment are non-degradable and all require a second surgical procedure for removal. A syndesmosis screw based on our natural material technology platform would alleviate a second procedure completely. This product presented the most efficient use of monetary resources in...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
