<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating an efficient bioprocess for domestic production of fatty acids from renewable biomass sugars.   The translated advanced bioprocess has the following unique features: it is heterotrophic fermentation based and not land based, which provides exemplary high yield, and high efficiency. Furthermore, it is weather independent, environmentally friendly and will enable a low cost supply of fatty acids when compared to the fatty acids production from palm and coconut plants.  The project accomplishes this goal by rapidly developing the microbial strain and bioprocess resulting in scale-up in the near future.  The partnership engages Technology Holding to provide guidance in the process development and other aspects including future financing, commercialization trajectory and market strategy as they pertain to the potential to translate the advanced bioprocess technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality.  The technology has potential to have a significant impact on a $50 B consumer products market in the next 7-10 years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the consumer products industry. The societal impact, long term, will be reduced dependence on foreign countries, high-value jobs creation by creating a new domestic industry, access to cheaper products and environmental sustainability.</AbstractNarration>

In this collaborative project between Rice University and Technology Holding LLC, university-industry collaboration resulted in the development of advanced technology. Microbial fatty acid production strains were tested at various settings. Specially, the scalability of the microbial free fatty acid production technology was successfully demonstrated from laboratory scale shake flask to larger scale bioreactors. Key bioreactor operating parameters influencing the process performance were identified. Techno-economic analysis performed for this process showed feasibility at larger scale. Completion of this project developed integrated platform for production of free fatty acids from biomass to the final product. Furthermore, this funded project provided training opportunity for three post-doctoral research associates and two undergraduate students. In particular, seamless technology transfer between Rice University and Technology Holding LLC was successfully accomplished with a post-doctoral research associate working at both entities (first at Rice University then transferred to Technology Holding LLC). The new knowledge generated during this project period will accelerate the development of microbial free fatty acid based consumer and advanced fuel industry. The results of this project demonstrated the feasibility of lignocellulose based technologies for chemicals and other products. The results successfully demonstrated possibility of growth of biomass industry in rural area and creating new jobs.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/04/2015<br>      Modified by: Ka-Yiu&nbsp;San</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
