<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Isabell Thomann of Rice University is developing novel instrumentation to follow the often complex, multi-step reaction pathways of heterogeneous photocatalytic reactions that are relevant for solar fuel generation, environmental remediation, and chemical synthesis in general. Femtosecond time-resolved Raman techniques will be developed to probe the chemical identities of short-lived reaction intermediates. These will be complemented by concomitant analyses of the reaction products via electrochemical mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. Using these techniques, novel concepts for efficient carbon dioxide photoreduction will be investigated. Both plasmonic and dielectric photoelectrode nanostructures will be explored for their potential to open up distinctive reaction pathways and to overcome limited conversion efficiencies and product selectivities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental knowledge about photocatalytic reactions gained in this work will, among many other applications, aid in improving the selectivity and efficiency of CO2 reduction. The technological capabilities developed here will in addition serve to recruit, educate and train students (both undergraduate and graduate) in a highly interdisciplinary research field. As part of this award, an outreach program is being developed that includes opportunities for K12 teachers and undergraduates to learn about and contribute to this research in the Professor Thomann's lab.</AbstractNarration>
