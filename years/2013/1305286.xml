<AbstractNarration>This infrastructure proposal supports the acquisition of a personal robot and a high-end multi-&lt;br/&gt;GPU workstation to develop a new robot testbed for designing and evaluating the next generation of parallel&lt;br/&gt;robot algorithms and open-source software systems on modern commodity computing platforms. The robot&lt;br/&gt;platform will be based on a Meka M1 robot, a state-of-the-art robot with compliant, dextrous arms plus&lt;br/&gt;camera and range sensors. This robot will be used to develop a new set of motion strategy and planning&lt;br/&gt;algorithms and evaluate the capabilities of the robots for two driving applications: (1) assisting older adults&lt;br/&gt;and people with disabilities with activities of daily living and (2) active tele-presence to give people in a&lt;br/&gt;remote environment the ability to physically interact with people in the robot?s environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This robot testbed could lead to novel technologies for the development of personal&lt;br/&gt;robots for assistance with tasks of daily living and active telepresence. These new capabilities could significantly&lt;br/&gt;improve the quality of life for the elderly, people with disabilities, and other individuals. The development&lt;br/&gt;of real-time motion strategies could also benefit other areas, such as surgical simulation, CAD/CAM,&lt;br/&gt;virtual prototyping, and virtual reality environments. The software libraries developed under this project&lt;br/&gt;would be made widely available through the public-domain release for all research and educational activities&lt;br/&gt;across science, engineering, and medical domains. Teh research team will also integrate research with education, reach out&lt;br/&gt;to under-represented groups via programs such as the IBM-sponsored Girls? summer camps, actively involving&lt;br/&gt;undergraduates in the proposed research, and organizing workshops on many-core computing for real-time&lt;br/&gt;motion strategies. Finally, the team expects the new robotics curriculum enabled by the proposed equipment acquisition&lt;br/&gt;to help increase enrollment in Computer Science.</AbstractNarration>
