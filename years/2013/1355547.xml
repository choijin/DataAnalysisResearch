<AbstractNarration>This award will fund the creation of an Online Ethics Center for Engineering and Science (OEC) which will be an expansion of  the existing National Academy of Engineering?s (NAE) Online Ethics Center for Engineering and Research (OEC) to include resources for all the fields that NSF supports. Collaboration with the Ethics Education Library (EEL) of the Center for the Study of Ethics in the Professions (CSEP) at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) will provide access to a wider array of materials than will be housed in the OEC and promote interactions with other repositories of ethics-related information. The OEC will develop best practices in ethics training, foster research on ethical issues in science, mathematics, and engineering in both national and international contexts, and serve as a living resource of multimedia materials that may be used to train current and future generations of scientists, mathematicians, and engineers in ethics and responsible conduct of research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Online Ethics Center will help educators, researchers, administrators, undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and practicing scientists and engineers understand the scope of existing knowledge about both ethics and ethics education in science, mathematics, and engineering. One of the intents of this resource center is to help scholars and institutions meet NSF's implementation of Section 7009 of the America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science (America COMPETES) Act by providing easy access to high quality case studies, best practices, and original scholarship in ethics in all of the fields that NSF supports.</AbstractNarration>
