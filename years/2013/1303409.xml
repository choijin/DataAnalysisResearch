<AbstractNarration>As part of a new CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service program, the Information Assurance Center at  Hampton University through the Hampton University Graduate Education and Training Scholarships in Information Assurance (HU GETS-IA) program is supporting at least 19 students to earn Masters of Science degree in Information Assurance.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project enhances underrepresented minority and women students' understanding of Information Assurance to prepare them for the nation's workforce at a more competitive level; and significantly expands the department Information Assurance research capacity and teaching experience by offering a rigorous cybersecurity course curriculum coupled with mentorship and required professional development activities to the student population.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A unique feature of this program is that students are serving as program ambassadors at high school recruiting events and are mentoring K-12 students in the Virginia Junior Academy of Science.  Additionally, students are participating in the Hampton University annual Information Assurance Symposium and the annual Association of Computer/Information Sciences and Engineering Departments at Minority Institutions (ADMI) Symposium. HU works with its partners, Spelman College, Winston Salem State University, Elizabeth State University and other HBCU institutions, to recruit highly-qualified computing students with interest in cybersecurity into HU GETS-IA program.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Department of Computer Science at Hampton University proposed to continue and expand its participation in the CyberCorps(R): Scholarship for Service (SFS) program to prepare highly qualified cybersecurity professionals for entry into the government workforce. This CyberCorps: SFS: Hampton University Graduate Education and Training Scholarship in Information Assurance (HU GETS-IA) Program allowed Hampton University to continue to produce highly skilled cybersecurity workers and address the lack of students (particularly from underrepresented communities) that are pursuing graduate degrees. The goal of the scholarship program was to support the development of cybersecurity professionals, both undergraduate and graduate levels at the Information Assurance and Cyber Security Center at Hampton University (IAC@HU). The IAC@HU is a designated National Center of Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense Education (CAE-CDE).&nbsp; The SFS program funded projects that address cybersecurity education and workforce development, including funding to award scholarships to students in cybersecurity.&nbsp; Over the past 7 years, we offered the scholarship to 14 students (6 females and 8 males). The program has a 100% placement in both summer internships and full-time employment. Seven students have graduated with both a BS degree and MS in Information Assurance (IA), six (6) students have graduated with their MS in IA, and one (1) with a BS degree. Upon graduation, 100% of SFS scholars have secured their full-time employment including NSA, NGA, DHS, DISA, CISA, US Army, US Navy, SPAWAR, MITRE, and City of&nbsp; Philadelphia (86% Executive Federal, 6% STTL, and 6%FFRDC). Our SFS scholars completed their internship at NSA, DHS, DSS, NPPD, ICE, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, MITRE, and Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.&nbsp; All SFS scholars participated in cybersecurity competitions, cyber-security research projects and for the past 7 years produced 1 journal paper, 24 conference proceeding papers (3 of 24 were international conferences), 8 oral presentations (only abstracts), and 8 poster presentations (only abstracts). The project received a renewal award to continue scholarship for services for MS in IA (now called MS in Cyber Security) and also to expand to include only the BS program.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/31/2021<br>      Modified by: Chutima&nbsp;Boonthum</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1303409/1303409_10225588_1622516785842_SFSFair2018--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1303409/1303409_10225588_1622516785842_SFSFair2018--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2018 HU SFS with Sen.
