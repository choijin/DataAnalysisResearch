<AbstractNarration>The proposed research program provides an approach to Kontsevich?s homological mirror symmetry conjectures (HMS) for the large class of mirror pairs of toric hypersurfaces discovered by Batyrev and Borisov. The approach uses constructible sheaves, especially the microlocal theory of sheaves developed by Kashiwara and Schapira, in a fundamental way, and leads to new constructions in sheaf theory.  At the large volume limit of the symplectic side of HMS, the project aims to exhibit an explicit combinatorial skeleton over which the Fukaya category is expected to localize -- i.e. form a sheaf of dg categories.  Another aim is to show that these spaces, and more general singular Lagrangians and Legendrians, all carry a canonical sheaf of dg categories, the "Kashiwara-Schapira sheaf."  It is defined by microlocal sheaf techniques, and amenable to computations.  Thus the conjectural "sheaf of Fukaya categories" can be defined and computed even in advance of a rigorous symplectic geometry construction, which is expected to be equivalent.  A third aim is to show that the global category of the Kashiwara-Schapira sheaf is equivelent to the category of perfect complexes on the large complex structure limit of the complex side of HMS.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research program provides an approach to Kontsevich?s homological mirror symmetry conjectures (HMS) for the large class of mirror pairs of toric  ypersurfaces discovered by Batyrev and Borisov.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ While supported by the grant, the PI wrote four papers.  Two have been accepted for publication, one in Geometry and Topology, and one in Annals of Math.  The other two are submitted for publication.  The central conjecture raised in the proposal, to give an explicit combinatorial skeleton for an affine hypersurface, was solved in one of these papers (paper 1 listed below).  Later on over the life of the proposal the PI found two unexpected applications of its main themes (microlocal theory and mirror phenomena): one in number theory (paper 2 listed below) and one in Legendrian knot theory (paper 3 listed below).  1. In the PI's prior work on mirror symmetry for toric varieties, a certain singular Legendrian played a central role.  In the project description, the PI raised the conjecture that this Legendrian was homotopy equivalent to an affine hypersurface that arises in the mirror geometry, the fiber of the superpotential. This conjecture was proved in "Skeleta of affine hypersurfaces,'' written with Helge Ruddat, Nicolo Sibilla, and Eric Zaslow.  The paper appeared in a 2014 issue of Geometry and Topology.  2. In "Functoriality, Smith theory, and the Brauer homomorphism, written with Aksahy Venkatesh, the PI applied Smith theory to Langlands functoriality, giving new results for torsion forms.  This paper appeared in a 2016 issue of Annals of Math.  3. In "Legendrian knots and constructible sheaves,'' written with Vivek Shende and Eric Zaslow, the PI used microlocal sheaf theory to give a powerful Legendrian isotopy invariant of Legendrian knots.  Among the results obtained were that the invariant can distinguish the famous Chekanov pair of Legendrian knots with the same classical invariants, and that it can recover the HOMFLY homology of a topological knot.  This paper has been submitted for publication.  4. The methods used in paper (2) above rely on Smith theory, an old subject in algebraic topology that relates the mod p cohomology of a space to the mod p cohomology of its fixed points by an automorphism of order p.  To extend these methods will require more from algebraic topology, e.g. to work with K-theory in place of cohomology.  In some sense this requires understanding the action of p-adic and adelic groups on spectra.  The paper "Representations of finite groups on modules over K-theory," which is submitted for publication, is the PI's first effort to understand a toy model of such actions.
