<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program in the Chemistry Division supports Professor Scott Gronert of Virginia Commonwealth University for the study of organic reaction processes in the gas phase.  Using an ion trap mass spectrometer with variable temperature capabilities, fundamental processes such as the competition between SN2 and E2 reactions as well chiral recognition are examined.  Also, the mechanisms and reactivity of synthetically important organometallic species, including copper and gold carbenes, are being investigated. Third, the reactivity of aryl halides with nucleophiles is being explored.  Preliminary work indicates competition between several pathways including an unusual SN2 reaction on a halogen center.  The rationale for this work is that gas-phase studies allow one to probe the bonding characteristics of specific, isolated intermediates and gain mechanistic information that is not readily available from experiments using conventional techniques.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The information gained from this research can be very valuable in the development of more effective chemical processes in the synthesis of new materials or the remediation of hazardous materials.  The grant also focuses on developing new scientists and is designed to offer many research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.  As a part of an outreach program, students from local historically black universities (Virginia State and Virginia Union) are recruited to participate in summer research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The general aims of this project focused on developing new methodologies and instruments and using them to examine important reaction processes in organic chemistry.  During the grant, the development and testing of a variable-temperature ion trap mass spectrometer was completed.  In addition, we developed a mass spectrometer that is capable of sequential ion/ion and ion/molecule reactions.  These instruments were used to examine the mechanisms of three reaction processes that are important in synthetic chemistry and relevant to the production of pharmaceuticals and other fine chemicals.  In the first, we examined the nature of intermediate species in the processes that involve metal carbenes.  Using copper as a model metal, we demonstrated that an alternative intermediate, namely a metal ylide, is more likely, and suggested how this information could be used to improve the process.  We also discovered a new iridium-containing compound that exhibited high reactivity with simple hydrocarbons and therefore could be used to convert these cheap materials to more valuable, functionalized molecules.  Finally, we have examined a series of dehalogenation reactions that could have applications in the remediation of poly-halogenated hydrocarbons.  These studies also included collaborations with scientists at the University of Rochester, University of Sheffield (UK), and San Francisco State University.  The other major aspect of the project was training of undergraduate and graduate researchers.  Thirteen participated in the grant including three from under-represented groups. To broaden the impact of the grant, the project included recruiting students from nearby historically black universities to participate in a summer research experience.  All of the students who worked on the grant received hands-on experience with mass spectrometry, a key technology that spans many research fields.   This training will provide them with important skills that can be used in the future to support research in areas of national need.
