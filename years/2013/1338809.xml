<AbstractNarration>Land use is a major driver of global change and is intimately connected with ecosystem structure and function, and with human well-being.  Natural and managed landscapes are called upon to supply food and fiber, support climate change mitigation and adaptation, alleviate poverty, and support human well-being.  Yet, the knowledge base for understanding and promoting sustainable land-use trajectories is highly fragmented and oftentimes isolated from its social context and from the human communities who represent the principle agents of change.  This Research Coordination Project will create an interdisciplinary network of scientists, decision makers and other stakeholders to synthesize existing information, and produce science products to understand and advance sustainable land-use trajectories. The major activities will be to: generate a suite of qualitative land-use scenarios co-developed with stakeholders that depict a range of possible future social, economic, and environmental realities for the New England region of the United States; simulate the land-use scenarios as they interact with multiple environmental stressors using existing modeling frameworks; evaluate these scenarios in terms of ecosystem services that are defined together with the stakeholders; and share knowledge with the broader public and decision makers to advance sustainable land-use trajectories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will integrate multiple broader impacts throughout its five-year duration. By including post-docs and students at all levels as participants in the network, this project will contribute to STEM workforce development by offering direct experience in managing collaborative, interdisciplinary research networks.  The network will also provide training for scientists of all ranks in techniques of stakeholder engagement, linking science with action, and science communication.  This project will sponsor regional workshops for developing stakeholder-defined land use scenarios and for linking these to practical solutions that can be put into action.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Scenarios, Services, and Society (S3) RCN engaged New Englanders in envisioning the future of land use in New England. First the S3 RCN convened gatherings of New Englanders concerned about the future of the land. Participants met in all six New England states and discussed their visions and concerns. A research team based at Harvard Forest in Petersham, MA compiled the visions from across New England and used the visions to parameterize four alternative futures, or scenarios for New England. The four scenarios are intended to capture changes to the land as driven by forces that participants identified as very important and also highly uncertain. The highly important and uncertain drivers of land use identified by participants are socio-economic connectedness (local vs. global) and technology &amp; innovation (low vs. high). The research team parameterized models to develop GIS-based maps of the six New England states under all four scenarios at a 10-year timestep from 2010 to 2060. The research team also modeled a business-as-usual alternative based on recent trends. The outcome of this modeling effort is a set of 25 maps (five alternatives each mapped at five timepoints) that can be used by conservation professionals, municipal planners, resource managers, and educators to visualize and plan for the future of the land. These 25 maps form the basis of a new interactive online mapping tool for land use planning, the New England Landscape Futures Explorer, or NELF Explorer (<a href="http://newenglandlandscapes.org/">http://newenglandlandscapes.org</a>). Concurrent with the scenario development workshops, the S3 RCN hosted a series of workshops for scientists using scenarios to examine alternative land-use futures.&nbsp; The first was &ldquo;Scenarios to Solutions&rdquo; where scientists and policy-makers convened to determine the outcomes and tools that could result from a scenario analysis that would meet the needs of both communities. The second was &ldquo;Scenarios to Simulation&rdquo; where a group of more than 30 landscape modelers met to synthesize the various methods for translating qualitive, stakeholder-defined scenarios into quantitative representations of land use. The third and final workshop was &ldquo;Scenarios for Services&rdquo; where scientists met to develop methods for modeling differences in ecosystem services under alternative land use scenarios.&nbsp; The S3 RCN team developed workshops on how to use scenarios, the associated maps, and the NELF Explorer for planning, management, and education, and the team offers workshops and support to New Englanders using the NELF Explorer and the scenarios. In addition, the research team has engaged many collaborators in using the scenarios to model the effects of different land use futures on ecosystem services including wildlife, maple syrup, fall foliage, water quality, and flooding. Related research is also underway on conversion of forest and farmland for solar projects in the Pioneer Valley of Massachusetts.
