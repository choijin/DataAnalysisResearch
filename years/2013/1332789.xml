<AbstractNarration>Grain boundaries are defects in metals and ceramics that often control failure mechanisms such as corrosion and cracking. However, a vast number of different grain boundary types are found in a given material specimen. By controlling the types of grain boundaries present in a material through a process called grain boundary engineering, dramatic enhancements in materials performance, including corrosion and cracking resistance, can be achieved. The aim of this project is to advance the field of grain boundary engineering by investigating the properties of different types of grain boundaries in order to determine which grain boundaries are most important in preventing or causing materials failure. To accomplish this, a variety of different types of grain boundaries are investigated using a computational method called the activation-relaxation technique. This method provides essential information regarding the kinetic properties of grain boundaries, which are inherently related to the mechanisms of material degradation and failure.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research results produced in this work will advance the field of grain boundary engineering?telling materials designers what the most critical defects in a material structure are allows them to focus on removing those critical defects, thereby extending the lifetime of a variety of engineering materials. The toolbox for materials design at the microstructural level will thus be greatly augmented, with societal benefits in reducing materials failures, enhancing product reliability, and thereby reducing materials usage. The project also focuses on the training of Ph.D.-level experts and B.S.-level practitioners in the newest tools of microstructure design.  Combined with significant exposure of the research to industrial concerns, these newly-trained students are poised to carry the research results into the field and effect their implementation in advanced materials technologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many materials are made up of small crystals, packed together in a space-filling configuration with a great many interfaces between the individual crystal grains, which are called 'grain boundaries'.  These grain boundaries are critical to the properties of materials, because they can be weak points for damage development, resistance points for electrical conductivity, and so on.  Increasingly, advanced materials require that we design those boundaries at the atomic level to maximize their properties.  And while there are many simulation methods that work at the atomic length scale and help with the design of new materials structures, a major challenge in modeling such interfaces in materials is that it is hard to model time scales that match experimental time scales; whereas most experiments last seconds to hours, and product lifetimes may stretch to many years, most atomic simulations only cover a few nanoseconds of time.  The purpose of this project was to develop new simulation tools that intend to acelerate simulations to the point where they may match up with experiments, thus advancing our ability to design new materials with complex grain boundary structures.  The intellectual merits of this project pertained to the development of new codes and algorithms for the simulation of materials defects for long times.  New methods were developed to completely map the energy landscape of a material defect, that is, the way in which the energy of a collection of atoms changes if any given individual atom is moved a small amount.  Knowling the energy landscape, it becomes possible to statistically understand the rate at which individual atoms will move, and to simluate their motions sequentially over long times.  Additional innovations were developed in understanding how applied mechanical stresses and strains affect such energy landscapes and the motion of atoms at defects.  The project lasted for three years, and its broader impacts centered on the training of two young women at MIT on their way to advanced degrees (one M.S. and one Ph.D.).   In addition, these students published scientific papers in scholarly journals, and delivered numerous scientific presentations to share their results with the community.  The methods they developed have been made freely available, and it is hoped that this will accelerate further work by other scientists around the world.
