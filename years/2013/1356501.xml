<AbstractNarration>This project at Bay Path College is having a significant impact on the size of the pool of qualified workers who are capable of pursuing careers in science in the Western New England Region.  One of the goals of the project is to increase the retention and baccalaureate degree attainment of women, including minority and first-generation college students, who will graduate well-prepared to pursue careers or graduate programs in the life sciences.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program is providing scholarships to 40 students based on financial need and academic eligibility.  Group tutoring offered through the grant augments tutoring already offered on campus.  This project is providing opportunities for student research, mentoring, co-curricular activities, and STEM career exploration and development.  The project is improving retention in the first two years, increasing participation in research, increasing degree attainment, and preparing graduates for work in the life sciences after graduation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF-STEM Final Outcomes Report ? 1356501  Christine A. Bacon, PI  8/2/19  The project goal was to increase the retention and baccalaureate degree attainment of women who will graduate well-prepared with the knowledge, skills and experience to successfully pursue careers in science or graduate programs in science to meet the growing demand in our region.  We set out four specific objectives to accomplish these goals:     1)  Increase the second year retention rate in the sciences of NSF Scholars to 90% and of all first-year full-time science majors by 25% above the current rate (59.8% to 70%).  2)  Increase participation in research by NSF Scholars to 100% and all other science majors to at least 30%.  3)  Increase the participation in career development activities in the first two years to 100% for NSF Scholars and all other science students to 50%.  4)  Increase the 4-year graduate rate of NSF Scholars who graduate with a science major by at least 25% above the current rate (from 70% to a minimum of 87.5%).     Objective 1:  Increase Retention ? NSF Scholars 2-year retention rate to 90% and All first-year full-time (FYFT) science majors by 25% (59.8% to 70%)     While we were unable to achieve this ambitious objective for NSF Scholars and All FYFT students (69.55% and 60.25% 2014-2018 respective averages), we did achieve a two-year retention rate of 73.25% for All STEM Science Majors during the same timeframe.  The most recent retention rate of 89.7% reported in 2017-2018 for these students marks an increase of 26.8% compared to our 2012 baseline rate of 62.9%.  The rationale for the lower than goal retention rates include:  student ineligibility to maintain NSF Scholarship due to change in qualifying criteria, enrollment status change from full-time to part-time, and personal.     Objective 2:  Increase Research Participation ? NSF Scholars to 100% and all other science majors to at least 30%.     This objective was achieved and exceeded.  100% of NSF Scholars participated in faculty-mentored research and 100% of all science majors participated in course embedded research activities (CURE) provided through the enrollment of science major required courses.  These activities, established through NSF-IUSE funding, provides students with an authentic research experience during their first through fourth years and better prepares students for faculty mentored research supported through the WiSH, Honors and Sterns Scholar Research programs.  Students enrolled in WiSH and Honors programs participated in research through program seminars during the first and second years of enrollment and progress to individualized faculty mentored projects during their third and fourth years.  Students present their research to the Bay Path community through formal departmental defense events and at the University?s annual Academic Achievement Day.      Objective 3:  Increase participation in career development activities in the first two years to 100% for NSF Scholars and all other science students to 50%.     This objective was achieved and exceeded. 100% of NSF Scholars and 74.8% of all science majors participated in career development activities during AY18-19. This increase of participation during the first two years is due to the greater number of enrolled students in the course WEL310 during their second academic year versus third year as previously practiced.    WEL310, ?Strategies for Career and Personal Growth? is taught by Sullivan Center for Career and Life Planning staff and serves to prepare students for internships, field research and career related experiences. Course focus is upon workplace professionalism, resume and cover letter preparation, presentation and interview skills. This course is a graduation required for all students.  All NSF Scholars and all science majors participate in a minimum of two career development activities including professional shadowing, field trips to local laboratories and businesses, professional conferences, CEWS Distinguished Speaker Series, internships, Career Networking Events and faculty mentoring during their enrollment at Bay Path.     Objective 4:  Increase the 4-year NSF Scholar graduation rate by at least 25% above the current rate (from 70% to a minimum of 87.5%).     This objective was achieved.  61.5% of AY14-15 NSF Scholars have graduated with a STEM major. 56.3% of AY15-16 NSF Scholars are currently on track or have graduated with a STEM major. 66.7% of AY16-17 NSF Scholars are currently on track or have graduated with a STEM major.  90.1% of AY17-18 NSF Scholars are currently on track or have graduated with a STEM major.  100% of AY18-19 NSF Scholars are currently on track to graduate with a STEM major.
