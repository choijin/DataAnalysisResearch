<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to design, synthesize, characterize, and model a spider silk like fiber for vibration control. The high damping synthetic fiber will mimic the microstructure of spider silk. In this project, the composition of existing melt-spin polyurethane fiber will be modified by tailoring the hard phase domain and soft phase domain, molecular chain rigidity, molecular weight and distribution, hydrogen bond, and cross-link density. The synthetic fiber will be strengthened and hardened by cold-stretching and by reducing fiber diameter during the melt-spinning process. Once the fiber is fabricated, its chemical, physical, and mechanical properties will be characterized and feed-back will be given to further refine its composition and polymerization, as well as cold-tension, until it is competitive with dragline spider silk. Its vibration damping capability will then be evaluated. Physics based multi-scale modeling of the synthetic fiber under dynamic loading will be developed. The model will link the microstructure of the fiber with its damping properties over a wide range of temperature and frequency. The result will provide guidance for further improvement in fiber design.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this project will create fundamental knowledge and provide basic understanding of a novel synthetic fiber mimicking dragline spider silk. It may eventually make it possible to manufacture a large amount of synthetic fibers that have mechanical and damping properties comparable to those of spider silks. It is expected that this project will open up new opportunities for application of polymeric fibers in lightweight load-bearing structures. The derived knowledge can also be extended to other materials such as fiber reinforced cement concrete for vibration damping in bridges and buildings. This project will support advanced training for undergraduate and graduate students, including minority students at Southern University, and high school students through hands on laboratory work and Science and Engineering Fair projects.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Vibration induced structural failure is not uncommon. Collapse of buildings and bridges during earthquake is typical examples of vibration induced catastrophic structural failure. Therefore, vibration damping has become one of the most crucial requirements when designing structures which may be subjected to vibrations. One of the most common damping mechanisms used to address vibration problems is viscoelastic damping. Viscoelasticity means that the material exhibits both elastic and viscous behavior. This study is inspired by spider silks. Spider silks possess remarkable mechanical properties such as high specific strength and toughness, and excellent damping capabilities. A falling spider suspending with a single silk can stop immediately and exactly where it wants, suggesting superior damping capabilities of the spider silk. An in-depth study shows that spider silks are made of two-phase semi-crystalline proteins with hydrogen bonded crystalline molecules as hard phase and amorphous molecules as soft phase. Motivated by this unique microstructure and morphology, the objective of this project is to design, synthesize, characterize, test, and model a spider silk-like fiber for vibration damping. In this project, we synthesized shape memory polyurethane fibers, ionomer fibers, and poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (PEVA) fibers. We demonstrated that these fibers have damping capabilities similar to or higher than dragline spider silks. In particular, we revealed the unique two-phase microstructure of the polyurethane fiber and modeled the effect of design parameters such as glass transition temperature, shape recovery stress, etc., on the damping capabilities. We also modeled general shape memory polymers (either amorphous or crystalline polymers) by considering their mechanical and functional damage. We further provided a physical explanation for some popular models based on phase evolution law. In addition, we developed multi-length scale frameworks and modeled a new artificial muscle formed by twisting and coiling polymeric fibers, and created a new artificial muscle based on two-way shape memory polymer fibers. Applications of the spider silk-like shape memory polymer fibers or muscles have been extended to self-healing composites. In this application, pre-tensioned spider silk-like fibers or muscles are embedded in a polymer matrix. When a macroscopic crack is induced in the matrix, for example by impact loading, constrained shape recovery or actuation of the fibers or muscles leads to closure of the wide-opened cracks in the polymer matrix, and subsequent molecular scale healing of the closed or narrowed cracks either intrinsically by the polymer matrix itself or extrinsically by a healing agent. This project also achieved its broader impact objectives. Eleven graduate students and five postdocs, among them three are minority and three are women, have been involved in this project. Besides, three minority faculty members at Southern University have collaborated with the PI on related research. Furthermore, this project has leveraged other educational programs at Louisiana State University and Southern University, and has involved several summer REU students from California, Vermont, Florida, and Alabama in related research.
