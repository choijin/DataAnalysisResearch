<AbstractNarration>This project will examine the response of Dosidicus gigas (Humboldt squid) to an El Niño event in 2009-2010 that was accompanied by a collapse of the commercial fishery for this squid in the Guaymas Basin within the Gulf of California. This large squid is a major predator of great ecological and economic importance in the Gulf of California, the California Current, and Peru Current systems. In early 2010, these squid abandoned their normal coastal-shelf habitats in the Guaymas Basin and instead were found in the Salsipuedes Basin to the north, an area buffered from the effects of El Niño by the upwelling of colder water. The commercial fishery also relocated to this region and large squid were not found in the Guaymas Basin from 2010-2012, instead animals that matured at an unusually small size and young age were abundant.  A return to the large size-at-maturity condition has still not occurred, despite the apparent return of normal oceanographic conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The El Niño of 2009-2010 presented an unforeseen opportunity to reveal an important feature of adaptability of Dosidicus gigas to an acute climatic anomaly, namely a large decrease in size and age at maturity. Now these investigators will have the opportunity to document recovery to the normal large size-at-maturity condition. The specific aims of this project are: 1) continue a program of acoustic surveys and direct sampling of squid that has already been established in the Gulf of California in order to assess distribution, biomass, life history strategy diet, and migratory and foraging behaviors relative to pre-El Niño conditions and 2) conduct analogous surveys in Monterey Bay, California in conjunction with long-term remote operated vehicle surveys of squid abundance.  The data from these studies will provide a comparison of recovery in the two different squid populations and yield valuable insights into what ecological effects an area is expected to experience with an invasion of either small or large Humboldt squid. As long-term climate change progresses, squid of both forms may expand northward into the California Current System.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training will be provided for participating graduate and undergraduate students and an established collaboration will be continued with a technical college in Mexico that involves Mexican undergraduates in local sampling and developing public outreach aimed at the local squid fishing community. Squid abundance (biomass) and foraging (diet) data will be incorporated into NOAA fishery-management models being developed for Humboldt squid.  Findings of the project concerning El Niño, climate change, and squid fisheries will be incorporated into an established outreach program with NOAA (Squids4Kids), the Google Science Fair Science Hangouts program, and a NEH Summer Institute on John Steinbeck at Hopkins Marine Station. The investigators will continue to contribute exhibits being developed on squid at both the Monterey Bay Aquarium and Hatfield Marine Science Center.</AbstractNarration>

A major focus of this award was to study recovery from El Nino. Squid size at maturity in the Gulf of California incrementally increased between 2012 and 2014, and in July-August of 2014 "large" squid (&gt; 50 cm mantle length) reappeared (Fig. 2). But "recovery" was short-lived, and squid throughout 2015 were smaller than at any time since 2010. During this same period the Santa Rosalia (and Sonora) fishery continued to decline, and in 2015 there were zero landings. This lack of recovery contrasts to the full recovery of squid landings (Fig. 1) and size (not illustrated) within 3-4 years after El Nino 1997-98, a much stronger event than that in 2009-10.

This change has also disrupted the previously established seasonal migration of squid across the Gulf, greatly decreasing recruitment to the Santa Rosalia fishery from Sonora and vice versa. Rapid recovery after El Nino 1997-98 appears to have been facilitated by unusually strong winds and upwelling.  A second factor is that temperature at depths to 75 m in Sa...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
