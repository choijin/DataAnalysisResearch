<AbstractNarration>Ninety-five percent of all convictions in American courts are the result of guilty pleas, yet very little research is currently conducted on the plea process.   This Research Coordination Network (RCN), organized around three cores, will use a set of meetings and papers to create a new interdisciplinary dialogue about plea decision making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The first core, entitled Prosecutorial Decision Making: Modeling the Process that Generates Plea Bargains, will grapple with one of the central puzzles of plea bargaining in the criminal justice context -- what motivates prosecutors and judges.  The second core, entitled Defense Decision-Making: Understanding the Defendant's Role, will focus on the perspective of the defendant and the defense attorney. This core will explicitly focus on other factors besides expected punishment that might affect these decisions.  The third core, entitled Workgroup Decision Making: Modeling Organizational Influences, will focus on how the courtroom workgroup as a social entity with its own norms and pressures that exists within a political and social context approaches plea bargaining.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Across all cores, a special emphasis will be placed on understanding how institutional structures and policy choices affect plea outcomes.  Empirical studies focused on institutional features have the potential to create better scientific understanding of plea bargains and lead directly to recommendations for policies that will generate fairer and more efficient sentencing outcomes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will start with two steering committee meetings in 2014 to set the agenda for the network and identify key areas of overlap.  Small workshops will be held at disciplinary conferences for groups such as the American Society of Criminology, American Psychology-Law Society, and Society of Empirical Legal Studies during 2014 and 2015.  Important new research on plea bargaining will be highlighted during interdisciplinary workshops at the University at Albany in 2015 and 2016.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Understanding Guilty Pleas  Over 95% of people convicted of crimes in the United States plead guilty to the crime.  However, prior to 2013, very little social science research had focused on understanding the underlying mechanics behind guilty pleas. The goal of this Research Coordination Network was to invigorate guilty plea research by: 1) resurrecting the earlier focus on plea bargaining that sparked in the 1970s but failed to ignite; 2) expanding the pool of researchers who study the plea bargaining process to better understand the decisions made by prosecutors, judges, defendants and defense attorneys; and 3) sharing methodological, theoretical and practical insights across disciplinary boundaries. The leadership team of the RCN met these goals by creating a diverse network of scholars of different ranks and disciplines, organizing two major conferences featuring research on guilty pleas in 2015 and 2016, authoring major reviews and concept papers in psychology and sociology, creating symposia and panels for the study of plea bargaining at major disciplinary conferences, and editing new special journal issues and books on guilty plea research.    The RCN was successful in meeting its goals.  For example, there were twice as many papers on guilty pleas at the most recent national conference of the American Society of Criminology as there were in 2013.  Just as noteworthy, some of the guilty plea panels included economists and psychologists who had never before presented at a criminology meeting.  Members of the RCN have also been key players in a number of efforts to create new datasets based on administrative records that allow researchers to follow cases from arrest through conviction.  The growing number of datasets across different jurisdictions clearly addresses what Ulmer (2012) identified as the single largest obstacle for research on guilty pleas. The RCN has also contributed to new theoretical development aimed at creating more realistic models of the goals of prosecutors during the plea bargaining process, and it is has also begun to address a key empirical puzzle in the literature &ndash; the role of factual innocence in the plea bargaining process.  The study of guilty pleas is finally becoming a well-established area of research in a number of different academic disciplines, and we believe it will contribute significantly to ongoing policy discussions and new debates surrounding plea bargaining reform both nationally and internationally.
