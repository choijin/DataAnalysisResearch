<AbstractNarration>The second annual KUMUNUJr conference will take place April 6-7, 2013 at the University of Nebraska--Lincoln. KUMUNU is an annual weekend conference anchored by the University of Kansas (KU), University of Missouri (MU) and University of Nebraska (NU), which focuses on current research in commutative algebra, algebraic geometry and related areas of mathematics. KUMUNUJr is geared toward graduate students and recent PhDs working in these fields and provides an opportunity for young mathematicians studying commutative algebra in the Midwest to share their research and expertise with one another.  Commutative algebra is an active discipline, with connections to algebraic geometry, cluster algebras, combinatorics, homological algebra, representation theory, statistics and other disciplines. Midwestern commutative algebra research continues to reflect the activity and diversity of the larger commutative algebra research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Regular interaction with other researchers is essential to a mathematician's professional development, and participation in research conferences is a crucial part of the development of a mathematician's research program. KUMUNUJr will provide an opportunity for these young mathematicians to exchange ideas, to encounter new ideas, to develop new collaborative research projects, and to find mentors among their peers. The relatively small size of the meeting and the focus on work carried out regionally will create an atmosphere that will enhance each of these research and mentoring activities.
