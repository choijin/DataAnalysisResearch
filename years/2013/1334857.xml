<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to introduce a new design paradigm in structural engineering that employs topology optimization for generating optimal structures that are resistant to multiple forms of damage and thus lead to robust designs. Previous topology optimization research has generally ignored the topic of damage, and assumed purely elastic behavior, thereby limiting the applicability of this technique to a relatively narrow class of engineering materials and structures. This objective will be achieved through (i) creation of a novel computational framework that simultaneously combines topology optimization and continuum damage mechanics, considering a wide range of material damage models such as brittle damage, creep damage and damage due to impact loading, (ii) application of these algorithms to existing structural design problems to uncover novel design concepts not seen in conventional designs, and (iii) development of an educational program for students and postdoctoral fellows focused on damage modeling and structural optimization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will expand the range of applicability of topology optimization to a wide range of disciplines, leading to more robust structures that are less susceptible to failure due to material damage. Educational activities and dissemination of the research will impact the engineering community by generating interest in engineering design and promoting creativity and innovation in the next generation of engineers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main objective of the project was to create computational design tools for use in the design of damage-resistant structures.  The secondary objective was to use the design tools we developed to investigate and uncover new design concepts that differ from conventional designs found in both the academic literature and within the structural engineering community.  Major research activities undertaken during this research were:   Derivation and implementation of a Topology      optimization method accounting for damage localization in brittle      materials such as concrete: We have derived the mathematical formulations required to model multiple      crack formations and coupled it to topology optimization of structures. The      approach was implemented in an original computer code and a two papers      were published.    Derivation and Implementation of a Topology      Optimization method with consideration of long term creep behavior of      viscoelastic structures: We have derived the mathematical equations for creep deformation due to      viscoelastic effects observed in structures subject to sustained loading      and have combined the approach with topology optimization. These equations      were implemented and solved using original computer code that we developed      and two papers were published.   Derivation and Implementation of topology optimization      methods for hyperelastic materials: We have derived the mathematical equations for topology optimization of      hyperelastic materials to design bi-stable structures for snap through      instabilities. Two papers have resulted from this work.    Writing of      scholarly articles:  Six      total papers were written with the support of this funding program, in      which we presented our new design techniques along with the results from      the numerical experiments we carried out.    These activities resulted in a productive research with six published papers in top journalsin the field and three conference presentations at important meetings.  Furthermore, based on the work done, the postdoc (Dr. Kai James) working on this research under the PI?s guidance has become a faculty member at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the department of Aerospace Engineering.  Hence, the research program was extremely successful and the PI is grateful for the NSF support that allowed him to do this high quality work !
