<AbstractNarration>The proposed project will support student participation in the 2014 International Microwave Symposium (IMS), which will be held in Tampa, FL from 1-6 June 2014. Support will be provided in conjunction with a new educational program called IMS Connect which has as objective to increase the participation of students from underrepresented minorities in the 2014 IMS. The project aims to develop the technical interests of the student participants, motivating them to be more involved in undergraduate research, being interested in graduate school and improving their long-term professional success. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2014 IMS meeting addresses research areas in RF/microwave engineering and is the largest conference in the world in this field. IMS has played a key role in identifying new directions for research and development. Topics to be discussed at IMS span a broad range in related emerging areas of research, from advanced synthesis, microwave devices, signal generation, emerging technologies, and system applications. IMS is one of the few conferences where participation from both the industry and academia is extremely strong. The participating students will share their experience with others through video diaries, helping to increase awareness of the opportunity for other students in future years. The program will also be described in professional magazines with the potential to encourage other conferences to adopt a similar type of program.</AbstractNarration>
