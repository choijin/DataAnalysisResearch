<AbstractNarration>This workshop on "Airborne Networks and Communications" in conjunction with the annual American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) Infotech@Aerospace Conference will be held in Boston, Massachusetts, on Aug. 21, 2013.  The workshop will provide a discussion forum for researchers in disciplines important for airborne networking, including wireless communications, autonomous air vehicles, routing planning, cyber-physical security, and test beds, and important to real-world situations such as in disaster relief during which communications, coordination, and sensing are critical.  This project provides travel support for invited speakers and for U.S. graduate students.</AbstractNarration>
