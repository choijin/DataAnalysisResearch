<AbstractNarration>The processes that promote species diversity are of central importance in evolutionary biology.  Suture zones are defined as geographic regions of overlap between multiple pairs of species or lineages that may hybridize in the zone.  These areas are of great interest as natural laboratories to study speciation.  The leading hypothesis explaining the formation of suture zones is that past changes in climate caused lineages to be isolated in refugia and subsequently expand into areas of overlap.  It is unclear, however, whether suture zones are a general phenomenon across all species.  This project will combine recent advances in sequencing technology and geographic information systems to: (1) test whether predicted patterns of suture zones exist across multiple frog species in the Southeastern U.S., and (2) test the leading hypothesis explaining their formation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will apply a novel method of data collection, anchored phylogenomics, to sequence hundreds of genetic markers across four co-distributed species.  This will develop the foundation for future studies to build on a comparative dataset by including the same genomic regions for additional species, providing a powerful way to test the factors underlying spatial genetic variation.  The project provides opportunities to promote training of graduate and undergraduate students, assist state wildlife agencies with monitoring amphibian populations, and contribute knowledge to issues of societal concern such as the organismal response to climate change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project allowed for significant improvements to the dissertation research of co-PI Barrow, which focuses on understanding the historical and contemporary factors that influence frog populations.  The goals of the project were to collect a genome-wide sequence dataset for four frog species sampled from the same localities in the Southeastern U.S., directly compare the evolutionary history and patterns of genetic structure across species, and test hypotheses about historical climate change and its effects on the distribution of populations and species.  The scientific outcomes of the project include the successful implementation of an approach to collect and analyze genome-scale data at the within-species level across geographic space (i.e. phylogeography), an approach which can be applied to numerous other species to allow broad-scale comparisons of the factors that influence whole communities.  This project resulted in one of the largest phylogeographic datasets to date and produced several interesting biological results.  First, the four frog species studied exhibited different levels of genetic structure that may relate to their different natural histories, dispersal abilities, or breeding habitats.  Second, the genetic patterns for these species did not, for the most part, correspond to well-established geographic features that are thought to represent barriers to dispersal in the Southeastern U.S.  Third, the genetic patterns appear to correspond to results from modeling using historical climate data:  two of the species have more stable ranges through time and lower genetic structure, while the other two species seem to have experienced range contractions during glacial periods and exhibit deep genetic divergences (i.e. a long period of isolation between populations).  Overall, the results of this project suggest that different responses to historical climate change and variation in natural history characteristics influence patterns of genetic structure across species.  The project provided several opportunities to promote training and learning and contribute knowledge to issues of concern to society including biodiversity conservation and global climate change.  The graduate student co-PI gained skills in genomic data collection and analysis, geographic information systems and species distribution modeling, project design and management, mentoring undergraduates and forming collaborations, and communicating results to both scientific and non-scientific audiences.  Throughout the project tenure, co-PI Barrow gave 11 talks at local, national, and international conferences or seminars.  The project facilitated mentoring of one undergraduate researcher in field herpetology and lab research, and allowed the student to attend and present results at her first national meeting.  The collection localities and information from fieldwork for each species were provided to state wildlife agencies to assist with population monitoring and vouchers were deposited in a museum to be made available for future research.  The overall outcomes contribute knowledge about the response of wildlife populations to climate change and the factors influencing frog distributions over time, which is important for preserving global biodiversity.
