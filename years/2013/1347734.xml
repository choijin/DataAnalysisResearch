<AbstractNarration>What is good research? How can it be encouraged and promoted? While these are fundamental questions for any discipline they are also clearly questions that are very very difficult question to answer. How their efforts are measured and rewarded is fundamental to individuals and their actions. Wide distribution of best practices for evaluating research productivity will have significant impact on researchers and, hence, on the research undertaken. Given computing's impact on the entire nation, improving computing research will significantly impact the nation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Computing Research Association has established a committee to explore the meaning of scholarship within the computing fields and to bring best practices for evaluating and promoting high quality scholarship to departments and individuals. This project will bring together leaders of the computing research community to explore answers to these questions and to provide advice to the community on how best to foster research that has high impact. CRA Best Practices papers have traditionally had high impact on how the community proceeds it is highly likely that this activity will make a significant contribution to improving both the quality and impact of computing research in the future.</AbstractNarration>

Sheer numbers of publications (or derivative bibliometrics) should not be a primary basis for hiring or promotion, because this does not encourage researchers to optimize for quality or impact. Other proxy measures are similarly problematic. For example, whether program committee service indicates an individual?s stature in the field depends on the conference. As another example, securing research grants (even when proposals are peer reviewed) does not necessarily signal research quality or even a researcher?s visibility. What ultimately should matter when it comes to hiring, tenure, and promotion is the quality of the research.
