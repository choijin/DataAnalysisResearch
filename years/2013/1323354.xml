<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project is examining the remote operation of analytical instruments, specifically a scanning-electron microscope and electron microprobe analyzer housed at Florida International University (FIU), to facilitate inquiry-based approaches to learning in undergraduate geoscience courses. The effectiveness of remote instrument use is being assessed across different course levels and audiences at four diverse institutions: FIU, Valencia Community College, Florida Gulf Coast University, and the University of South Florida. Faculty at each institution are adapting instrument use to their courses and students, and using common methods to assess learning gains and changes in students' attitudes along a novice-to-expert trajectory. Instrument use and learning assessment at the four partnering institutions is being supplemented by national-level outreach to engage further partners, using hands-on workshops and follow-on individual training and consultation for faculty who commit to pilot use in their own courses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project lies in its well-formulated plan to leverage fixed-location, high-end analytical instruments to enable authentic research and inquiry within the undergraduate curriculum at remote institutions. The embedded educational research addresses important questions of a) how much and what type(s) of remote instrument-aided inquiry enable targeted student-learning outcomes, b) what factors determine effectiveness as institution type, curricular level, and student audiences vary, and c) what challenges exist for widespread propagation of the approach and how might these be overcome. Broader impacts of the project include a) the production of insights and practices that promote remote use of research-grade analytical instrumentation at multiple levels of the undergraduate curriculum, providing a model that could be used at other research centers to enable heretofore inaccessible analytical capabilities at a wide range of undergraduate institutions, b) engagement of a diverse range of students (from seniors in majors' classes to first-year non-majors in introductory classes) and institutions (from research universities to community colleges) in authentic research, a high-impact practice for retaining students in STEM disciplines, and c) professional development for faculty at the partnering institutions and beyond, as well as for a postdoctoral scholar and graduate student engaged in discipline-based educational research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This TUES funded project resulted in the expansion of remote use of an electron micro probe analyzer (EPMA) at Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU).  The EPMA was utilized remotely for a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE) in an upper division Mineralogy &amp; Petrology course which engaged 61 undergraduate students during three years.  A number of these undergraduates went on to continue remote use of the EPMA as one-on-one senior research or for service learning credits.  Many of these students presented their research at national scientific meetings.  Assessments of student learning and benefits to the students were created using the creative exercises of Lewis et al. (2010) and the CURE survey of Lopatto (2010).  Assessment was given as a pre- and post-test.  The learning assessment demonstrated the students received positive learning gains of course content and remote use of the EPMA.  However, assessment of learning also revealed course content that fails to meet desired outcomes (e.g., poor connections between magmatic systems and their volcanic products).  These missed content connections in the undergraduate are being addressed through course modification.  Benefits assessment displayed the students had greater confidence in their abilities to understand research data, an increased awareness of how minerals were studied, a greater desire to conduct more research, and had increased confidence in their scientific abilities.  These finding suggest that CUREs result in all of the same learning gains and benefits to students as one-on-one research.  However, the impact of these benefits are expanded to a larger number of students.  Remote use of advanced instrumentation as a CURE is now fully developed at FGCU.  This can be a model of how a number of different STEM disciplines can overcome the barriers of conducting research with undergraduates when a college or university does not have access advanced instrumentation.
