<AbstractNarration>In this five-year project, New Mexico Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (NM EPSCoR) addresses one overarching question that has great potential to transform research in NM and to promote sustainable energy development: How can NM realize its energy development potential in a sustainable manner?  The vision for the project is two-fold: first, to build and strengthen the scientific enterprise that will enable NM to harness its abundant renewable energy resources (e.g., solar energy and biofuels), and sustainably capitalize on other resources such as geothermal and uranium reserves, without adversely affecting the environment and water resources; and, second, to improve the state's science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) pipeline and research and development capacity, thus creating new businesses and industry that build upon the state's human and geographic diversity and intellectual capital.  The major participants in this proposal are the University of New Mexico, New Mexico Institute of Mining &amp; Technology, and New Mexico State University.  Other partners include: Eastern New Mexico University Main Campus, Santa Fe Community College, Santa Fe Institute, Explora!, the Global Center for Creative &amp; Cultural Entrepreneurship, the National Museum of Nuclear Science and History, and the New Mexico Museum of Natural History Foundation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to further NM's energy development, integrating basic and applied science and engineering.  The research is enabling new technologies to be expanded to commercially viable enterprise scales.  Resource utilization research focuses on: (1) generating new knowledge in algal ecology, physiology, agriculture and biomass process engineering that supports next generation biofuel production; (2) creating more efficient solar energy harvesting and photovoltaic devices, as well as developing methanol as a transportable fuel alternative to conventional fossil fuel-derived hydrocarbons; and (3) solving scientific and engineering challenges related to membrane properties and fouling that currently prevent osmotic pressure systems from becoming commercially viable.  Results are enabling industry to make better use of NM's abundant sunshine, large brackish water aquifers, and vast quantities of high salinity produced waters from the oil and gas industry.  Achieving a sustainable energy future for NM requires a complete and balanced suite of extractive and renewable energy sources that are socially adoptable, water-resource achievable, and environmentally benign.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The Energize NM project supports diverse, interdisciplinary, and inter-institutional partnerships that include national laboratories, industry, education (including community and tribal colleges), and other stakeholders.  Additionally, the project activities holistically address clean energy challenges.  Research results are communicated via user-friendly cyberinfrastructure, innovative education and workforce development programs, and broad-ranging stakeholder engagement activities.  Project activities are designed to engage faculty from research universities, and tribal and community colleges, and support the STEM pipeline by training teachers, undergraduate and graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows.  Project outcomes are communicated broadly through new partnerships with NM's museum network, a citizen-centric web portal, and experiential programs targeting K-12 students.</AbstractNarration>
