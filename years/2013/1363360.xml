<AbstractNarration>Civil infrastructure systems form the backbone of the economic well-being and progress of any nation. The field of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) addresses the proper maintenance and timely rehabilitation of such systems, thereby ensuring their continued functionality. In SHM, having a reliable model of the structure is essential. Usually, Finite Element models are used to predict how actual systems, e.g. bridges and buildings, behave under various conditions, from day-to-day service conditions (e.g. traffic) to extreme events (e.g. earthquakes, hurricanes). However, there is a certain level of uncertainty inherent, for example, to the modeling assumptions used by the engineer. In addition, a system changes its characteristics with time due to aging and seasonal effects, and/or sudden extreme events. The aim of model updating is to correct the physical parameters of a model of a structure using information obtained from the real structure so as to get an updated model accurately describing the current condition of the system. This updated model can then be used for predictive, health monitoring and reliability analyses purposes. The importance of this project is in its treatment of constraints related to practical implementation, e.g. not having a sufficient number of sensors, which could have serious implications and could consequently invalidate the results of the entire representation of the model. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the project, a model updating strategy will be conducted according to the following steps. First, tests for global ascertaining and consequent constraints on instrumentation requirements will be formulated, providing minimal instrumentation set-ups to guarantee unique identification. Next, a mode shape normalization scheme will be developed to estimate the complete normalized modal information, which will then be used to estimate the system's physical parameters. Efficient modal parameter comparative measures will be used for mode matching purposes and ways to account for unobserved modes will also is investigated. To account for the uncertainties introduced by uncertain information about the system, environmental fluctuations and the inevitable presence of measurement noise, the algorithm will be extended into a stochastic framework using Bayesian inference as well as an alternative sensitivity based approach to characterize the uncertainty propagation at different steps. The goal of the project is to represent the structure in its present condition for analysis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The problems tackled in this research project are associated with the attempt of assessing structural damage in buildings and bridges using measurements of the structural response. The first research issue discussed in this project rises from the fact that, in real life applications, typical civil engineering structures like buildings and bridges do not have sensors at every degree of freedom (e.g. at every floor in the case of a building or at every joint in a bridge).  Hence, measurements of the structural response are available only at few locations on the structure and consequently the structural mode shapes can only be identified at those few locations.  However, to have a reliable estimate of the structure?s stiffness matrix, matrix whose variations can be used to assess structural damage, requires the identification of a set of entire mode shapes and so, from here, the need to expand the measured mode shapes from the observed to the unobserved degrees of freedom.  In this project, novel methodologies were developed to normalize and expand the measured mode shapes to the entire structural model for both the "forced vibration case" (when the input forces are known) and the "ambient vibration case" (when the input forces are unknown).  In developing these methodologies, the issue of "uniqueness of the model" was also addressed: this issue is linked to the fact that, for a given incomplete set of measurements, there could be two different structures that provide the same dynamic response at the measured locations.  In this case, it would be impossible to differentiate in the identification between the two models.  In this work, rules were developed to locate a set of actuators and sensors so to guarantee identificability of the structure.  For the case of base excitation and of output only cases, an additional problem had to be addressed: in this case, the identified mode shapes are not mass-normalized and so additional information, usually in term of the mass, is needed. In this project, three possible scenarios were considered: 1) when some floor masses are known, 2) when some new measurements are available for the case of some known added masses, and 3) when the total mass of the system is known.     Another issue investigated in this project is linked to the fact that measurement data can come from different environmental and operational conditions and so it is necessary to account for a certain limited variability of the identified structural parameters, variability that is not linked to damage but to different environmental conditions, e.g. summer vs winter. Accounting for the case of limited instrumentation, the previous approaches, derived in a deterministic framework, were extended to a probabilistic framework.  Instead of identifying a single value for a mass or a stiffness, now the vector of the means and the covariance matrix of the mass and stiffness distributions are obtained.  Such identified distributions can be used in further structural dynamic analysis, e.g. to estimate the response variability and safety assessment under expected loads, in collapse and reliability analysis, etc., while accounting for the structural variability due to environmental/operational fluctuations.
