<AbstractNarration>The researchers will analyze data already in hand from the Kepler satellite of sdB stars, obtain new ground-based high-speed multicolor observations of these stars to supplement the observations for further analysis, and generate perturbed atmospheric models to interpret all the observations. Finally, they will generate evolutionary models which match the data and test the physics within sdB stars. Subdwarf B (sdB) stars are horizontal branch stars that are low mass white dwarf precursors. They are envelope-stripped objects which are very blue and UV bright yet retain sufficient mass to be core helium burning stars. Their progenitors are stars like our sun and are responsible for the UV excess detected in some elliptical galaxies and globular clusters.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students will take part in the proposed research program by obtaining, reducing and analyzing data and then disseminating results at conferences and in papers. The PI will work to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields.  Additionally, the PI and his team (including undergraduate students) will collaborate with scientists on a national level (including in Iowa and with the Whole Earth Telescope), and international level (including N. Ireland, Belgium and Poland, and the Nordic Optical Telescope).</AbstractNarration>
