<AbstractNarration>The data requirements of many current research projects -- ranging from cancer genomics to radio astronomy to brain imaging -- have far outstripped what most campuses can handle. Progress in these and other important fields is significantly hampered by the inability of researchers to rapidly transfer their extremely large datasets. The problem lies not only in the bandwidth in the underlying links, but also in the overall network architecture which limits the ability of network administrators to deploy new functionality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Extensible Cyberinfrastructure for Enhancing Extreme-Data Science (EXCEEDS) project is accelerating scientific discovery at the University of California, Berkeley by improving the university's ability to support extreme-data science. The infrastructure improvements being implemented include: increasing border bandwidth to 100Gb/s, arranging for an end-to-end 100Gb/s data path from Berkeley to the University of California at San Diego, establishing a modern Science Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) architecture, and deploying a 100Gb/s capable Bro Intrusion Detection System (IDS) -- currently a critical piece in Berkeley's security architecture -- on this new high-speed network.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;In the short run, the improved infrastructure will speed progress at Berkeley in several scientific areas, most notably cancer genomics but also in radio astronomy and other fields. Longer term, the research on more extensible campus architectures will lead to more flexible network designs that can enhance scientific progress on campuses throughout the nation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal for the project was to enable future data science-oriented research via advanced network capabilities with cancer genomics research as our pilot "customer". Specific milestones to achieve this goal included the deployment of a high throughput Science DMZ for the UC Berkeley Campus, achieving 100Gb/s capability at the UC Berkeley Campus Border, building 100Gb/s network backbone through Campus, enabling OpenFlow/SDN for exploration of advanced network management and configuration, and bringing 100Gb/s Science DMZ to EECS Research. Through these changes, the project aimed to accelerate research via faster access to data and mitigate staff time spent on work at remote sites.  Key outcomes of the project include the successful establishment of a 100Gb/s Campus Border link to CENIC/HPR network, the deployment of a Campus 100Gb/s SciDMZ / Data Science Network that is now in regular use, a new Campus "Savio" compute cluster that is now connected to the 100 Gb/s SciDMZ, and the deployment of a 100Gb/s link from the EECS department to Campus SciDMZ which is now operational.   These advances have yielded the expected benefits in cost sharing, operational collaboration, and training. In addition, the project has had significant impact on researchers and the practice of research. As the Science DMZ comes to production status, it has provided new access to data sources used by UCB researchers that they never even knew to ask about. Users across campus now realize, primarily via the Campus Compute Cluster, that they can retrieve and access large remote data sets more or less "on demand" without haing to plan out multi-day or multi-week workflows around lower speed downloads. This has enabled researchers (in areas outside ours) to deal with their data sources much more interactively, allowing research questions rather than research limitations to drive the course of investigation.
