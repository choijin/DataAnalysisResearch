<AbstractNarration>This proposal is to support a conference on Combinatorial Stochastic Processes, to be held at U.C. San Diego on June 20-21, 2014. The conference covers topics such as exchangeable random partitions, models of coalescence and fragmentation, and tree-valued processes. The conference organizers are committed to trying to help advance the careers of young mathematicians, women, and minorities.   The conference will include sessions in which participants will have an opportunity to give ten-minute presentations or discuss open problems. These sessions should facilitate interactions between young researchers and more senior researchers. Priority for financial support to attend the conference will be given to graduate students, postdocs, women, and minorities, as well as to faculty at smaller institutions who do not have other sources of financial support.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Combinatorics is the branch of mathematics that deals with counting, while stochastic processes are used to model random systems that evolve over time.  The field of Combinatorial Stochastic Processes emerged in the 1990s when it was discovered that the behavior of certain large finite objects that are studied by combinatorialists, such as random trees, random permutations, and random partitions, could be related to the behavior of certain continuous-time stochastic processes.  Results in the field have been applied to a number of different areas, including population genetics and the analysis of algorithms.  Jim Pitman's lecture notes on the subject, written in conjunction with his 2002 lectures at the St. Flour summer school, were instrumental in summarizing existing work in this field and identifying possible new directions for research.  A two-day conference on Combinatorial Stochastic Processes was held in June, 2014, at the University of California at San Diego.  The conference included eight invited lectures on the subject, featuring speakers from Canada, England, France, Hong Kong, Switzerland, and the United States.  In addition, there were eleven short talks given by new researchers who benefitted from the opportunity to present their work to an audience which included many leading experts in the field.
