<AbstractNarration>Analysis of the recently-acquired multi-channel seismic (MCS) data will address a series of topics that relate to the structure of the lithosphere and the margin evolution along the central WA portion of Cascadia subduction zone, and how these relate to current seismicity patterns. Advanced processing of the MCS data is expected to identify the depth and character of the plate boundary and the amount of sediment currently being subducted will be assessed. Deformation of strata within the accretionary wedge will be mapped to track longer-term evolution of the plate interactions. Estimates of crustal hydration will be obtained from assumed seismic velocity-porosity relationships and, along interfaces, reflectivity. Maps showing the distribution of methane hydrates in the region will be produced.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results will provide a framework within which other Cascadia geoscientific studies are conducted, both for seismic processes and tectonic evolution, and are likely to have implications for hazard assessment. While this subduction zone currently has less earthquake activity than other zones around the world, onshore evidence of repeated megathrust events is clear, so it is important to understand the history of of stress buildup (strata deformation) and the extent to which fluids along faults might enable periods of 'lubricated', slow release.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Cascadia subduction zone encompasses both onshore and offshore regions of the Pacific Northwest of the U.S. and Canada. The potentially hazardous subduction zone fault, known as the Cascadia megathrust, principally lies beneath the offshore region, where the oceanic Juan de Fuca tectonic plate collides with and dives beneath the North American plate, producing earthquakes of up to magnitude 9 accompanied by dangerous tsunamis. Using new geophysical images of the geological structure of the fault zone beneath the seafloor off the coast of the Grays Harbor region of Washington state, generated by seismic reflection sounding to depths of as much as 10 kilometers, we have analyzed the fault geometry, geologic history, and present-day stress conditions in the Cascadia fault and surrounding rocks.  Our study has shown that there is a layer, 2 to 3 kilometers thick, of sediment overlying the igneous crust of the ocean plate, and that layer is almost entirely scraped off and transferred to the continental plate edge when it reaches the subduction zone, forming an "accretionary wedge." Previously, it was unknown how much of the sedimentary layer might be sliding beneath the fault and under the wedge. This study has shown that only 10-20% at most of that layer goes beneath the wedge. In the southern half of our study area, little to none of it does. This informs our geophysical understanding of what materials are present in the fault zone and how much water-rich sediment gets pushed down the subduction zone to where the earthquakes occur. This in turn sheds light on how the megathrust fault stores up and releases the strain energy during earthquakes.  We also investigated the amount of water (pore fluid) in the sedimentary rocks of the wedge and at its base, and the stress and pore fluid pressure trapped within them. The conditions under which faults slip &ndash; and faults stop slipping &ndash; at depth in the earth, during major earthquakes, is governed by these stresses and pore fluid pressures in the rock.
