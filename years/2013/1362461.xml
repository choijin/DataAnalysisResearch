<AbstractNarration>AWARD ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Rodrigo B. Andrade of Temple University (Department of Chemistry) is studying the development of new chemical reactions to quickly build complex nitrogen-containing molecules.  An overarching goal is increasing the efficiency of making complex molecules having broad societal impact by minimizing the overall number of synthetic steps.  An overwhelming number of such molecules are biologically active, and can be employed in molecular biology to understand biochemical pathways or directly applied in medicine to better understand disease on a molecular level.  The chemical insight can then be applied in therapeutic regimes.  To test the scope of these new methods, several complex molecules derived from nature are being prepared in the laboratory. During the  development and application of these new methods,  undergraduate and graduate students, including those from underrepresented groups, are being trained in the discipline of complex molecules synthesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project systematically studies and applies a novel domino Michael/Mannich [4+2] annulation method to the synthesis of complex molecules.  In Aim 1, the nucleophilic and electrophilic components of the method are being examined to determine the reaction scope.  In Aim 2, the method is applied to the asymmetric total syntheses of the Aspidospermatan-type alkaloids (+)-epi-condyfoline, (+)-condyfoline, (+)-lagunamine, (+)-epi-lagunamine, (+)-condylocarpine, (+)-isocondylocarpine, and (+)-tubotaiwine.  In Aim 3, the method is used to develop the asymmetric total syntheses of the bis-Aspidosperma alkaloids (-)-conophylline and (-)-conophyllidine.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A. Intellectual Merit            The overarching goal of the funded project was to study and apply novel chemical reactions to synthesize useful building blocks (i.e., fine chemicals) and a class of natural products called alkaloids from simple, commercially available feedstocks.  These naturally-derived molecules, which are often isolated from plants, microbes, etc., boast complex architectures and possess nitrogen that often imparts biological activity.  During the project period the following complex alkaloids were synthesized:  melotenine A, alstolucines A, B, and F, echitamidine, N-demethylalstogucine, sungucine, isosungucine, strychnogucine B, leucoridines A and C, and epi-condyfoline.  We also made significant progress toward the first synthesis of a bis-alkaloid, melodinine K.            The funding of this project also enabled the discovery of additional novel reactions that were used to prepare a potent antibiotic, albocycline, in 14 steps.  Previously, this complex molecule was prepared in 40 steps.  Thus, the development of new chemistries allows for a marked increase in the efficiency by which complex molecules are prepared.  The novel reactions discovered during this funding period are now being investigated and would not have been made possible without financial support from the NSF.  Such support is vital for the evolution and development of the sciences.     B. Broader Impacts            The funded project served to help advance the fields of organic and medicinal chemistry by introducing novel reactions for the preparation of useful fine chemicals and natural products.  A central mission of the project was to vigorously support student training.  The rigors of synthetic organic chemistry stimulate creativity (right-brain activity) and critical thinking (left-brain activity).  Temple University is one of the most culturally diverse urban campuses in the country and home to diverse underrepresented groups in the sciences, which greatly facilitates the inclusion and exposure of those students to STEM activities.     C. Summary of Findings            As a direct result of NSF funding, the Andrade laboratory has developed novel reactions and applied them toward the syntheses of several complex natural products that possess biological activity, most of them alkaloids. The significance of these findings is that the molecular complexity associated with naturally-derived compounds is often intimately tied to their biological activity.  In other words, the discoveries made during this funding will pay dividends in the fields of organic and medicinal chemistry, the latter of which affects the health and well-being of the greater public.  Over 50% of all medicines are inspired or directly derived from natural sources.  Therefore, the development of reaction methodology that speeds up the preparation cuts down on both the cost and waste.            It is important to also acknowledge the impact of training both undergraduate and graduate students.  First, the inclusion of research in an undergraduate curriculum vastly enriches the educational experience.  Second, these students represent the future of the American Research Enterprise.  In order for the US to remain competitive in a fast-paced global competition, it is critical that Science Education is a high priority.
