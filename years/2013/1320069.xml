<AbstractNarration>As society becomes increasingly reliant on software systems to help&lt;br/&gt;plan medical treatments, predict the future climate, guide investments&lt;br/&gt;in financial markets, and mine noisy data to infer scientific facts,&lt;br/&gt;the risk that uncertainties in the input data and defects in the&lt;br/&gt;software can create false alarms, or a false sense of security, is&lt;br/&gt;high. This project will help address the gap between highly complex&lt;br/&gt;probabilistic programs and tools for reasoning about them.&lt;br/&gt;Probabilistic programs arise in important everyday applications that&lt;br/&gt;include medical, engineering and financial risk analysis/decision&lt;br/&gt;making systems, large-scale simulations, data mining, sensor noise&lt;br/&gt;filtering algorithms for cyber-physical systems, and randomized&lt;br/&gt;algorithms. The presence of input uncertainties and randomness built&lt;br/&gt;into the behavior of the programs can cause undesirable behaviors and&lt;br/&gt;variable performance.  Therefore, it is important to accurately&lt;br/&gt;predict the probabilities of such undesirable behaviors, and expected&lt;br/&gt;values for important performance measures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates automatic program analysis tools for&lt;br/&gt;probabilistic programs that will model the sources of uncertainty&lt;br/&gt;appropriately, and infer bounds on the probabilities of assertions and&lt;br/&gt;expectations of performance measures. Two flavors of inference&lt;br/&gt;procedures are being investigated: symbolic procedures&lt;br/&gt;combining decision procedures with the theory of martingales and&lt;br/&gt;statistical procedures using statistical hypothesis testing&lt;br/&gt;methods to infer probabilistic annotations with statistical&lt;br/&gt;guarantees.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project investigated the fundamental problem of reasoning rigorously about static analysis of programs that involve probabilistic statements. Such programs are increasingly ubiquitous as models of uncertain processes used in many areas including  medical devices and autonomous systems.  The key achievements included:  a) Drawing parallels between martingale theory and the proofs of qualitative and quantitative analysis of programs with probabilities. This connection opened up interesting connections between the use of concentration of measure inequalities from mathematics to reason about program analysis problems.  b) Connections between parameter synthesis problems and chance-constrained optimization. This connection led to tools that use simulations and statistical hypothesis testing to systematically search over a design space of parameters to improve the performance of the system as a whole under uncertainty.  The project resulted in 8 peer reviewed papers, including one PhD thesis awarded to Aleksandar Chakarov, who worked on this project. Furthermore, the work done under this project received two best paper awards including the prestigious Radhia Cousot Outstanding Young Researcher award to PhD student Aleksandar Chakarov. The project also supported two post-doctoral researchers, who used the work done to obtain employment in the industry and academia, respectively.  The work was also disseminated through a series of lectures at the foundations of programming summer school held in Braga, Portugal during June 2017.
