<AbstractNarration>Cognitive biases cloud effective decision-making. These irrational strategies lead to inefficiencies in everything from large-scale economic systems (such as the health-care industry) to personal choices (such as picking unhealthy snack foods). This research investigates one specific bias, the Endowment Effect (EE), in which individuals tend to ask for more to sell an item in their possession than they would pay to buy it. For instance, people demanded more money to part with a Final Four basketball ticket won in a raffle than they offered to pay for such a ticket some time earlier (e.g., $2400 to sell vs $160 to buy; Carmon &amp; Ariely, 2000). This is true even in cases where the object has accrued no additional value, even sentimental value, since it was acquired.  The EE is important because over-valuing possessions leads to less efficient transactions; people demand too much in exchange for what they currently have. For children, this bias may complicate social interactions that involve possessions, such as sharing with siblings and peers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will investigate the emergence and development of the EE by testing how children and adults make decisions. Our first goal is to document any differences in the EE across these age groups. Our testing procedures will produce results that are comparable to existing data on the EE in non-human primates. This means that we will understand both how the EE develops in humans and how it evolved across the primates. This combined approach will help measure the degree to which biased decision-making is a result of experience and culture.  Our second goal is to investigate how different features related to possession influence the EE.  In particular, we will test the importance of physical versus "legal" possession (e.g., having an object vs. being told that you will receive an object) and the degree to which the EE is determined by possession of the actual object (as compared to a photo of or symbol representing the object). Finally, our research will have two broader impacts.  First, these results will address the development of decision-making biases and thus help to inform the debate about how to best minimize the impacts of faulty decision-making.  Additionally, we will engage students at all levels in the scientific process, including sharing these results in academic venues as well as with parents and other members of the community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The endowment effect is the striking finding that individuals are likely to value objects that they possess more than they value the chance to acquire the same object.  This bias has important practical significance for society, as it can impede the efficient exchange of goods and property, and has also been implicated in problematic behaviors such as unhealthy food choices.  The goal of our project was to understand how this bias develops in young children and what factors influence how strong it is so that we can better predict when the bias will impact decision-making and develop interventions to ameliorate those impacts.  To do so, we explored whether children chose to trade toys that we gave them for a different toy, and how the willingness to trade was influenced by factors such as how long they had possessed it, whether it was the real item or a token that could be exchanged for the item, and how useful it is.  Children showed a strong endowment effect, but they were much more likely to keep their toy when they were able to hold on to it than when they had merely seen it or briefly touched it, suggesting that actually physically possessing the object is important to children's sense of ownership.  To our surprise, however, they were less likely to keep the toy when given the actual toy rather than a token they could later trade for it, possibly because trade is difficult to understand for some younger children.  Finally, children also showed a stronger effect for toys than for non-toy objects, suggesting that preferring to keep what they have is not simply a reflex, but differs in strength depending on how much the children want the item.  Intriguingly, this latter result reflects those found in other work in non-human primates, suggesting that the factors influencing the endowment effect may have deep evolutionary roots.  This project also provided substantial opportunities for training and outreach.  During the course of this project, six undergraduate and four graduate students participated in the project, receiving training in developmental psychology, experimental methods, data analysis, and dissemination of results through presenting talks and writing papers.  Finally, much of the data were collected at the Fernbank Museum of Natural History, where we are involved with outreach to young children and their families.  Aside from the children who participated in the study, we interacted with more than 500 additional children and their families, and from 2015 to 2019 we participated in the annual "Science at Hand" day, where local scientists set up booths explaining their research and engage with museum visitors.  We used these opportunities to explain the importance of studying the development of decision-making and scientific research in general.
