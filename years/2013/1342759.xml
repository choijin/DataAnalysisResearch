<AbstractNarration>The latitudinal gradient in species diversity is one of the most striking biogeographic patterns in nature, with species richness peaking in equatorial regions for nearly all groups. Despite considerable effort to understand the origin and maintenance of latitudinal gradients in species diversity, a multitude of potentially interacting, non-mutually exclusive hypotheses exist, and no single over-riding explanation has emerged. However, multiple hypotheses link the latitudinal diversity gradient to a presumed gradient in the strength of biotic interactions between temperate and tropical environments. While biotic interactions are believed to play a major role in the origin and maintenance of diversity and may drive increased rates of adaptation and speciation in tropical regions, this hypothesis remains virtually untested. To bridge this gap, a comprehensive analysis of the evolutionary mechanisms underlying adaptive phenotypic variation in color, vision, and smell across a rapidly diversifying lineage of butterflies will be performed together with field-studies. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Understanding the ecological and evolutionary processes that shape temporal and spatial patterns of biodiversity is a central goal of biology, and an increasingly important facet of the endangered species management, particularly in a time of rapid global climate change. This proposal links biodiversity researchers across the US and Latin America, and will lead to sustained international collaboration; broadened access to STEM fields for women and minorities through targeted recruitment; substantial employment opportunities across institutions and countries; and an enhanced public understanding of biodiversity science and threats to global biodiversity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Batesian mimicry is a biological phenomenon in which a palatable species mimics an unpalatable species, known as the model.  Adelpha butterflies are members of a large and speciose genus which contains many species that mimic other species, some of are Batesian mimics. Field predation experiments were conducted using artificial butterfly paper replicas to test the strength of Batesian mimicry between Adelpha iphiclus (model) and Adelpha serpa (mimic) butterflies in Costa Rica and Ecuador.  In Ecuador, where Adelpha iphiclus (the unpalatable Batesian model) is significantly more abundant than Adelpha serpa (the mimic), both species are equally protected from predation by birds. By contrast, in Costa Rica, where both species are about equally abundant, the benefits of mimicry break down and birds more readily attack the mimic, Adelpha serpa.  This result highlights the frequency dependence of mimetic relationships.     In addition to investigating the impact of visual predators like birds on the evolution of mimicry in this colorful genus of butterflies, the color vision system of these butterflies was also investigated. In surveys across the genus, it was found that the adult compound eyes of these butterflies contain ultraviolet-, blue- and green-sensitive photoreceptor cells, but no red-sensitive photoreceptor cells. This implies that the butterflies are color blind in the green-to-red part of the visual light spectrum, including in some species of Adelpha, the orange patches of coloration on their own wings.  In considering the significance of mimetic coloration through the eyes of both birds and butterflies, the work is an important contribution to our understanding of the forces shaping biological signals and receivers.     This award supported the training, professional development, and research of two postdocs, three graduate students, and two undergraduates, including three Latina women. The research from this project has been disseminated to the public in the form of several research articles in peer-reviewed journals, and has been the subject of commentaries in two science magazines.
