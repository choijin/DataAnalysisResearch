<AbstractNarration>Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;This project will analyze data from the Earthscope Transportable Array (TA) using a novel three-dimensional, seismic wave imaging method called plane wave migration.   This method has produced what is arguably the highest resolution image produced from the TA to date.   It accomplishes this with a technology derived from the seismic reflection method, which is the primary technology used in oil and gas exploration.   The project will use this technology to address three main scientific questions.  (1) What is the geometry of the Farallon Plate that North America has been overriding for at least 100 million years?  (2) Are dipping interfaces in the upper mantle we have imaged in previous work markers of mantle flow processes?   (3)  What do these high resolution images tell us about the nature of the region of Earth?s mantle called the transition zone that lies between two global discontinuities at depths of 410 and 660 km?   The project will address these questions through four approaches.  (1) 3D visualization using tools commonly available for interpretation  seismic reflection data in the oil and gas industry.  (2) Application of forward modeling methods to appraise the reliability of our imaging results and to test more detailed hypotheses that will arise form approach (1).  (3) Comparison of our results with different approaches produced by other scientists.  (4) Further technical developments of the imaging technology that will be applied in the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader significance and importance&lt;br/&gt;The USArray element of Earthscope was built to provide the data to provide a new understanding of the processes that have shaped the North American continent.   Seismic imaging technologies were the main approach to addressing this large issue.   This project is important for providing the highest resolution images yet obtained with these data and relating them in true geometry to related work by others.   This has the potential to dramatically change our perspectives on many elements of North American geology by being able to see what was previously not possible.   This has broad impacts for the oil and gas industry as fundamental work that can impact understanding of geologic processes that shape North American geology.   We also plan to produce a number of data products that can be used for science education at all levels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project we produced the highest resolution images ever produced of the part of Earth's mantle under the lower 48 states of the U.S.   The results were possible only because of data from the Earthscope Transportable Array (TA).   We processed distant earthquakes recorded by the TA to produce a 3D image of where waves are scattered in the top 1000 km of the Earth under the U.S.   The concepts used are similar to methods of seismic imaging used in oil and gas exploration, but modified to work with earthquake data and geometry limitations of the TA.   Major scientific results from this work were:  A region of the mantle called the transition zone is defined by two globally continuous discontinuities in seismic velocity structure at nominal depths of 410 and 660 km.   Scattered waves imaged from these horizons show both surfaces are rough at all scales we observe from the size of the entire U.S. to our resolution limit controlled only by the limits of wave diffraction.  The amplitudes we resolve are highly variable consistent with what could be expected for an irregular surface.   Both amplitudes and discontinuity topography show a structural grain perpendicular to Noth American plate motion over the mantle. We found new, compelling evidence for extensive volumes of water stored with the mantle transition zone.   We make that inference from the presence of pervasive negative polarity scattering seen everywhere inside the transition zone with variable amplitudes.  We infer these results as mapping water content because results from mineral physics show when hydrogen atoms are incorporated in transition zone mineral seismic wave speeds are strongly reduced.  Our results add weight to an argument advanced for a number of years that water is present on earth because plate tectonic processes top reserves stored in the transition zone. The seismic imaging method we have developed requires a precision earth model to properly map scattered waves to their true position in 3D space.   We examined all available 3D seismic wave speed models created from the Earthscope TA data.   We found most may recover the pattern of seismic wave speed correctly, but underestimate strongly the size of the wave speed variations.   We found the best seismic tomography models for 3D imaging with our technique were those that utilized surface wave data to constrain crust and upper mantle structure.   We also found our earlier result on roughness of the 410 and 660 discontinuities at the largest scale were heavily dependent upon the tomography model used for imaging, but the shorter wavelength structure did not depend upon the choice of the earth model.   In particular, we found a strong difference in the depth to 410 and 660 between eastern and western North America was a pure velocity model artifact.   Mineral physics data indicate the mantle discontinutiies at 410 and 660 are created by phase changes in mantle minerals.  The phase changes at 410 and 660, however, have opposite temperature dependence.  As a result, hotter areas of the mantle are expected to have a thinner transition zone and colder temperature areas a thicker transition zone. By filtering our latest maps of these discontinuities and converting them to thickness we find a strong correlation with the temperature field that would be expected for a relatively simple flow geometry based on project of pure rigid plate motion.  In particular, we see evidence for a thin transition zone under the southwestern U.S. linked to upwelling linked to the opening of the San Andreas fault a plate tectonic concept called a slab window.   We also see a strong thickening of the transition zone in the central U.S.  That thickening is updip from one of the largest lower mantle anomalies seen globally under the eastern side of both of the Americas.   That structure is commonly linked to plate convergence on the west coast of North and South America.   In North America that structure is commonly called the Farallon plate.   Plate tectonic models indicate the Farallon Plate was consumed on the western margin of North America over a period of around 300 million years.  The remainder of Farallon plate is what we now call the Juan de Fuca/Gorda plate offshore from Washington, Oregon, and Northern California.   We thus argue that the thickened transition zone in the central U.S. reflects downwelling of the mantle above the old Farallon slab now descending into the lower mantle.   We developed a method to quantitatively compare seismic tomography models produced by other groups to better sort out common features found in different models.   The result is a novel way to visualize common features of 3D structures under the U.S.  Final results from this part of the study are part of an M.S. thesis in final preparation.
