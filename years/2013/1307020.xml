<AbstractNarration>This award supports projects in the area of astrophysical interpretation of gravitational-wave (GW) signals from binaries with two compact objects, black holes or neutron stars, through both GW data analysis, GW source modeling and interpretation. The proposed work focuses on developing a concrete framework for the processing of GW detections (or event rate upper limits) in order to extract the maximal available astrophysical information for binaries with compact objects with any mass and spin configuration. Specifically the following three main research projects are targeted: (i) parameter estimation for binaries with two compact objects using advanced applied mathematics methods, including the advancement of algorithms and computational tools, so that we can measure masses and spins of black holes and neutron stars and localize their GW emission on the sky so we can understand their physical origin; (ii) development of a quantitative framework for using GW event rates to derive constraints on astrophysical models of compact-object binary formation and evolution; and (iii) the astrophysical interpretation of multiple GW detections and associated mass and spin measurements, accounting quantitatively for GW observational biases and selection effects. Furthermore, the involvement in public outreach activities is intended to strengthen the connection between astronomy and GW physics, by focusing on projects that explain the formation of GW sources to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is of interest to the broader community of compact-object astrophysics in a wide range of contexts: e.g., stellar and binary system evolution, neutron star and black hole formation, gamma-ray bursts, stellar dynamics of globular clusters and galactic centers, as in the coming years LIGO observations can provide uniquely reliable answers to some of the long-standing questions in astronomy and astrophysics. The computational tools to be developed will be made available within and outside the LSC, and hence can benefit other LSC projects and enhance the research infrastructure for parameter estimation in other scientific and engineering contexts. Outreach activities take advantage of the existing collaboration with the Adler Planetarium &amp; Astronomy Museum with hundreds of thousands of visitors per year; this connection ensures the broad dissemination of research understanding in the diverse, urban environment of the Chicago metropolitan area. Our group also has an active history and interest in involving undergraduate students in research projects and promotes a framework of peer learning in tutoring and mentoring.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award has funded the continuation of Professor Vicky Kalogera's Gravitational Wave astronomy group at Northwestern University, which focuses on support of the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (aLIGO).   With this funding, Dr. Kalogera and her group have worked on two main tasks.  First, they have concentrated on modeling the extraordinary diversity of stars in galaxies, including detailed studies of the lives of those stars, with an eye to understanding the wide variety of ways that those stars can be progenitors for gravitational wave events that aLIGO can "hear."  Her group also works with advanced statistical methods to try to decipher, from those complex gravitational wave signals, details about the astrophysical events that caused those gravitational waves.  Both of these tasks involve working with High Performance Computing systems, and many of her group members have become experts in working with these computer systems, and with these complex statistical methods.   With the recent detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes and neutron stars (the dense remains of collapsed stars) with aLIGO, all of these methods have become even more critical.  Professor Kalogera and her group have contributed, as a result of the work funded by this grant, to identifying the sources of gravitational waves that aLIGO has observed, and also understanding what those observations imply for the population of the similar sources, throughout the Universe.  Dr. Kalogera's group has also worked hard in communicating the value of gravitational-wave science to the wider community; her group has, every summer of this grant, hosted (on average) about a dozen high-school and undergraduate students who learn the basics of gravitational-wave astrophysics and high-performance computing.  In selecting students for these experiences, Professor Kalogera and her group have sought out female students and other students under-represented within the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) communities.
