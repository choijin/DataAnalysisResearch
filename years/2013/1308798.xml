<AbstractNarration>Experiments are just now reaching the level where the true effects of single light quanta can be seen. The work will contribute to the fundamental understanding of these procedures with a focus on nonlinear effects and explore potential applications in fields ranging from quantum information science to extreme low-light level engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum optics and quantum information science appeals to both physics students and the general public. This work will attract and train talented students and postdocs in this active area of research. Particular effort is made to attract women and minorities to those fields. In addition, many of the effects studied in this work have the potential to impact future applications of quantum computing/simulation as well as nano-engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit and impact:     Sensing of quantities important to cosmology to commercial ventures as well as quantum information is now increasingly done in ensembles of atoms or atom-like structures, because there can be an improvement with higher numbers. Unfortunately, often the interaction within the ensemble due to dipole-dipole interactions in this case can also decrease accuracy. The work in this project improved understanding of these processes and suggests methods ("squeezing") to use the interaction for actual improvement.  The dynamical Casimir effect is a fundamental process where the vacuum enables the production of light energy out of mechanical motion. This is an old idea that is difficult to show experimentally. This project succeeded to propose a potentially much easier regime to achieve this effect. Ultracold chemistry has the potential to bring chemical processes to the next level: while traditionally chemical processes are given by an equilibrium between reactants and reaction products, neither a true one-way process nor a deterministic way through intermediate products has been possible. This project built on our earlier work to use coherent quantum processes in order to suggest deterministic chemical processes and suggest ways for true one-way processes.      Broader impact:   In addition to the impact of the research outcomes described above, there has been a strong human resources component: Several students have been educated/brought to their Ph.D. through this project. In addition, the research informs the teaching of the PI, taking into account that independent of the students? choice of a career inside or outside of academia the art of problem solving is perhaps the most crucial goal of learning in physics. Also, the PI served in several aspects as a role model for underrepresented groups in the physics research community.
