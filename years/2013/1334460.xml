<AbstractNarration>The project aims to find a powerful new route towards exfoliated clay/polymer nanocomposites at high clay loading. A recently discovered self-organizing process is able to disintegrate (exfoliate) clay particles into their individual thin sheets (leaves) when being gently mixed into a suitable polymer. The phenomenon is called self-exfoliation,  since no external energy input is required. In the resulting nanocomposite, the clay leaves were found to distribute uniformly throughout the polymer matrix (i.e., random leaves), which can be beneficial for many applications that require high connectivity (mechanical, electrical, and thermal). While such self-exfoliation has great potential as a novel nanocomposite synthesis process, it has not yet been applied due to the lack of a better understanding of the self-exfoliation mechanism. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned research has the objective of explaining the origins of the self-exfoliation so that it can be utilized systematically as a new path for creating novel polymer nanocomposites at high loadings of random leaves including graphene. The synergistic expertise of the PI and co-PI will allow a full characterization of the nanocomposite formation. Diverse experimental methods will probe the four relevant length scales of this system. The macro-scale bulk properties and their mechanical evolution during exfoliation, which are most relevant industrially, will be studied through rheology. Rheology will also provide the time scales of the exfoliation dynamics and will guide the other experiments in this way. The micron-scale will be probed with optical microscopy to observe aggregate swelling and the homogeneity and randomness of the final exfoliated state. The nano-scale structure/dynamics will be observed with SAXS (small angle x-ray scattering), USAXS (ultra-SAXS), and SANS (small angle neutron scattering) to monitor clay gallery spacing and a polymer conformation anchored to a clay leaf, and AFM (atomic force microscopy) to test for the presence of an entropic-pulling force from the tethered polymer chains. The bonding at the atomic scale will be probed with NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy to confirm the presence of hydrogen bonds and determine if hydrogen bonds form on the face and/or sides of a clay leaf. The initial part of the research will be guided by hypothesizing two possible self-exfoliation mechanisms and by following up with experiments on several different self-exfoliating clay/polymer systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on these research findings, other self-exfoliating material combinations (graphene instead of clay; semicrystalline polymers instead of amorphous polymers) and their processing conditions will be explored. Research results from the two research groups will feed into each other and lead to a broad education of graduate and undergraduate students of the two research groups. This includes the co-PI's SAXS/WAXS beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source, which will provide undergraduate/graduate students with an unusually broad perspective on scientific research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Materials with layered structure (clay, graphite, some zeolites, black sulphur, for example) develop an entire new range of properties when getting exfoliated into their single leaf building blocks. These materials are abundant in Nature but are not readily accessible as single atom thick leafs. Reasons are the internal cohesive forces that hold naturally occurring stacks of material leafs together. Overcoming these cohesive forces in high yield exfoliation processes has remained a challenge which prevents large-scale industrial use of exfoliated materials. An exception is clay, which self-exfoliates under suitable conditions. The goal of the research under this NSF grant was to gain a deeper understanding of clay exfoliation and expand this very promising process to other materials besides clay. For clay, a diverse set of well-defined exfoliation experiments gave new insight and could be abstracted into an empirical model of clay exfoliation (Figure 1). &nbsp;Clay self-exfoliation is not only attractive because of its ease of use and its high yield, but also because exfoliated clay sheets are un-oriented since now shear is used for the exfoliation. Shear orientation, as in classical exfoliation processes, would reduce the connectivity of the nanocomposite structure (Figure 2). The generalization of the experimental findings on clay resulted in a novel process for high-yield graphite exfoliation (Figure 3). A further challenge was the exfoliation of zeolite into 2-dimansional zeolite sheets (Figure 4).&nbsp; Both novel process (graphene and 2D zeolite) are practical and result in superior yield of exfoliated material. Exfoliation processes of these layered materials involve soft solid states, for the most part. Handling of these soft solids lead the way to a new classification, which allows to distinguish between gels and glasses (Figure 5), to a criterion for the onset of instabilities under shear, and to an improved understanding of reverse gelation as generated by yielding.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/30/2017<br>      Modified by: H.
