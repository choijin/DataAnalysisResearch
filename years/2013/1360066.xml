<AbstractNarration>Wildfires transform and transport large amounts of organic carbon across landscapes at regional to continental and even global scales. The burning of vegetation and soil organic matter, followed by increased runoff of water and erosion, can have big effects on lakes. In addition, smoke plumes from wildfires may even influence lakes much farther away indirectly through what are called teleconnections. The 2013 Rim Fire was the third largest fire ever in California and presents an opportunity to examine these different types of movements of carbon and their impacts on lakes. This project rallies a team of experts from across the country to apply advanced optical and acoustic technology in order to examine the responses of lakes in the Sierra Nevada Mountains to changes in the quality and quantity of dissolved organic carbon (that colors water) and the consequences for the biology of the lakes. Two main questions are:  What characteristics of lakes respond to changes in organic matter due to fires within their watersheds, and can such responses also be detected in lakes in distant watersheds through teleconnections? To address these questions, eight larger lakes and a suite of smaller lakes will be sampled over one year. The watersheds of two of the larger lakes have been extensively burned and influenced by smoke plumes from the Rim Fire. Three other larger and several smaller lakes are located about 150 miles north of the Rim Fire itself, but were still under the smoke plume from the fire. Finally, three lakes are outside of both the smoke and burn areas and will serve as control sites.  Intensive sampling of the lakes themselves, data from satellite remote sensing, and detailed chemical analyses will be used to determine the exposure of all the lakes to either fire in the watersheds or just the smoke, as well as the effects on lake ecology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide support for two postdoctoral fellows and three graduate students, who will study various aspects about tracing the flow of carbon from the land and air into and through lakes. Collaborations will enable the exchange of information between the research team and managers of the San Francisco water supply and reservoirs, as well as the general public.  Other outreach opportunities will happen through collaborations with the Tahoe Environmental Research Center.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ California is undergoing one of the most severe droughts in history.  Large wildfires have increased in frequency in recent years, and tend to occur under more severe drought conditions.  While many studies have investigated the impacts of wildfires on lakes, most have been limited to direct effects within the burned watershed.  The major goals of this project were to examine the more indirect effects of wildfire on lake ecosystems, and in particular assess the potential for long-distance effects through connections between changes in climate (e.g. drought conditions) and smoke plumes.  We looked at the effects of two California wildfires (Rim Fire and King Fire) on lakes outside of the burned area.  Results from these sampling efforts were analyzed to discern not only the effects of distant wildfires on lakes, but also the impact of drought on lake transparency.   We show that there are some important interactions between climate, through extreme events such as drought and fire, and a lakeÆs exposure to UV radiation and visible light. Specifically, during droughts the amount of color-absorbing substances, such as dissolved organic carbon entering the lake decreases, leaving the lake more transparent to both UV radiation and visible light.  We saw these effects in our measurements of water transparency&mdash;during drought years, water transparency increased as compared to historically non-drought periods. Climate change can also alter exposure to UV radiation and visible light indirectly as increased lightning strike frequency may lead to more wildfires, which can change light conditions in lakes via smoke plumes.  Our findings show that the consequences of wildfires extend beyond the watershed boundaries through the light-altering properties of this smoke plume even at great distances (Figure 1).  We found a strong decrease in UV exposure relative to visible light during both the Rim Fire and King Fire events due to the movement of the smoke plume.     The changes to the light environment during drought and wildfire events can have significant impacts on organisms living in the lake.  UV radiation is known for its damaging effects, causing mutations and cancer in humans and other organisms, though UV radiation also has beneficial effects such as stimulating vitamin D production. Thus these changes in UV exposure have important, though invisible (to our eyes), effects on living organisms.  We found that the decrease in UV: visible light ratios resulting from smoke plumes decreased the downward migration of zooplankton, as measured on days with and without the smoke present. Zooplankton were found shallower in the water column when smoke was present (lower UV: visible light ratio). Globally, smoke plumes from fires extend across lakes as weÆve described here, but also across oceans (Figure 2).  These globally extensive smoke plumes could have impacts on the food web and fisheries as the predators and prey respond to fluctuations in the UV: visible light ratios in sunlight under changing drought and wildfire conditions.
