<AbstractNarration>Professor Miller and his group will study the spatial distribution of galaxy clusters, paying specific attention to the bias of cluster-sized dark matter halos. Such a bias results from massive dark matter halos forming within the largest fluctuations in the primordial matter density field. This induces a correlation between the halo mass and the amplitude of the clustering itself. Observational constraints on bias are a prerequisite to high precision cosmology using galaxy clusters.  The program will publish a sample of approximately 1000 clusters with measured masses and well characterized errors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of a graduate student, building tutorials for web-based astronomy tools which lead non-specialists through some of the greatest astronomical discoveries, allowing non-scientists to discover for themselves the fundamental laws of the Universe.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit: This project addresses fundamental questions about the growth of structure. Our current cosmological paradigm of LambdaCDM makes clear and observable predictions about how galaxy clusters trace the peaks in the underlying matter density field. This project highlights that carefully chosen datasets and algorithms can produce the needed precision to delineate between current collapse models for clusters. This project is grounded by using a single high quality observed dataset and by incorporqting an end-to-end simultaneous analysis using modern semi-analytic galaxy catalogs that closely resemble the observed low redshift universe. This project produced algorithms and data products that can be used for pressing challenges in other areas, like determining galaxy masses and understanding how galaxy properties might depend on their environments.  The three goals for this project were to: 1) collect new spectroscopy of galaxies in SDSS-C4 galaxy clusters in order to create complete samples and fix SDSS fiber collision issues; (2 Measure the escape velocity (caustic) masses of SDSS-C4 galaxy clusters; 3) Measure the mass dependent bias function using the SDSS-C4 cluster abundance and/or power spectrum.  Using the MDM/OSMOS and Magellan/IMACS multi-object spectrographs, we filled-in the missing data from the SDSS spectroscopy for the SDSS-C4 cluster sample.
