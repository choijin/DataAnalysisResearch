<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a new type of thermal interface material (TIM) composed of arrays of &amp;#960;-conjugated polymer nanotubes with remarkable thermo-mechanical properties to fill a critical electronic device cooling technology gap, especially at high temperatures.   The translated pure polymer TIM has the following unique features: thermal conductivity greater than 10 times bulk polymer, excellent chemical stability at 200 Â°C, ultralow effective shear modulus, and excellent dry adhesion to surfaces that provides an exemplary combination of low thermal contact resistance and joint durability when compared to the leading competing TIMs in this market space.  The project accomplishes this goal by developing a new fabrication approach that eliminates a difficult to control and complex step and improves bonding to the substrate resulting in a functional product prototype and a scalable fabrication process.  The partnership engages Carbice Nanotechnologies, Inc., a small start-up company focused on commercializing TIM solutions, to provide guidance in the high-temperature electronics market (e.g., military equipment, automotive systems, oil exploration systems, etc.) and other aspects including customer-driven product development, intellectual property positioning, and financing as they pertain to the potential to translate the polymer nanotube TIMs along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality.  The potential economic impact is expected to surpass $1 million in annual sales in the next 7 years with a concurrent indirect economic impact of $100 million by enabling new electronic device performance capabilities and resulting products.  This will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the power electronics and high-temperature electronics market spaces.   The societal impact, long term, will be to enable reliable thermal management of high temperature electronic devices while concurrently training and preparing young entrepreneurs to establish successful technology companies.</AbstractNarration>
