<AbstractNarration>This TUES Type 2 project is establishing the Center for Infrastructure Transformation and Education (CIT-E) as the centerpiece of a community of practice.  The aim is to facilitate the transformation of undergraduate civil and environmental engineering programs by incorporating infrastructure topics into their existing curriculum.  This project builds upon the sophomore-level courses and other modules on civil infrastructure developed by the Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) Department of the University of Wisconsin-Platteville and the Civil Engineering program at West Point Military Academy.  The six collaborating institutions are of varying sizes, student population, and settings (Arizona State University, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, Norwich University, Portland State University, Rowan University, and University of Toledo).  The project objectives are to: 1) establish and sustain the Center for Infrastructure Transformation and Education (CIT-E) as the source for infrastructure education materials that can be continuously improved by a community of practice, 2) develop educational expertise in infrastructure topics and in pedagogy in faculty at collaborating institutions, 3) deliver, assess, and institutionalize infrastructure-themed courses or modules for CEE and other majors at collaborating institutions, 4) enhance the ability of CEE students to view components and systems designed in CEE sub-disciplines as integral parts of the larger infrastructure system, and 5) enhance the ability of CEE students to view infrastructure challenges from a societal, rather than solely technical, perspective. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project employs a creative model that engages collaborating faculty in roles of content creators and module maintainers of the infrastructure-themed course material to develop and sustain the community of practice.  In addition, a structured plan to facilitate the adoption and institutionalization of infrastructure curricular material at the six collaborating institutions, and provide faculty development and support is used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than 500 students and fifteen faculty at eight diverse institutions, including some with large numbers of underrepresented minority students, are directly impacted by the project activities, increasing the number of students and faculty with knowledge and expertise in sustainable infrastructure topics.  A community of practice centered on CIT-E and multiple faculty development workshops is employed to facilitate the dissemination and adoption of the curricular material and practices developed in this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Rowan University began offering a new two-credit course called Introduction to Infrastructure in Spring 2015.  This course is required for all freshmen in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Rowan.  The course was developed as part of a collaborative project entitled "Collaborative Research:  Training the Next Generation Faculty and Students to Address the Infrastructure Crisis," which was funded by the National Science Foundation?s Transforming Undergraduate Education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (NSF-TUES) Program.  The collaborative group of colleges and universities involved in this NSF-TUES project is led by the University of Wisconsin-Platteville (UW-P) and is called the Center for Infrastructure Transformation and Education (CIT-E).  The topics covered in the course include an introduction to infrastructure, public financing and economics, social impacts of infrastructure, water resources engineering, environmental engineering, geotechnical engineering, structural engineering, and transportation engineering.   The key outcomes of this project that are specific to Rowan University are the pre- and post-surveys that were conducted in the new Introduction to Infrastructure course at Rowan University.  Many of the questions used for these surveys were based on a similar on-campus survey used at UW-P.   Four of the quantitative questions (1, 2, 9, and 10) that were included in the surveys will be discussed here and graphs depicting the results are included in the supplemental materials:  Question 1 &ndash; Which is the most appropriate definition of "sustainability" as used by engineers?  For this question, the correct answer is "b" &ndash; "meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs."  In Spring 2015, 42.2% of students got Question 1 correct before the class began and 74.6% got the question correct after the class ended.  In Spring 2016, however, 45.8% of students got Question 1 correct before the class began and 46.3% got the question correct after the class ended.  As a result of this change in the Spring 2016 results versus the Spring 2015 results, much greater emphasis was placed on sustainability beginning during Spring 2017.  In response, in Spring 2017, 49.4% of students got Question 1 correct before the class began and 88.3% got the question correct after the class ended.  Thus, the greater emphasis placed on sustainability in Spring 2017 was rewarded by increased student knowledge regarding sustainability.  Question 2 &ndash; If you were to characterize the state of the nation?s infrastructure (roads, bridges, sewers, water supply, etc.) using a typical grade scale, what grades do you think would be most appropriate?  For this question, the correct answer is "c" &ndash; "mostly C?s and D?s."  In Spring 2015, 39.1% got Question 2 correct before the class began and 88.9% got the question correct after the class ended.  In Spring 2016, 29.2% of students got Question 2 correct before the class began and 89.6% got the question correct after the class ended.  In Spring 2017, 44.9% of students got Question 2 correct before the class began and 87.0% got the question correct after the class ended.  Thus, the results for all three years for Question 2 were quite consistent and satisfying.  Question 9 &ndash; Which area of civil engineering are you most interested in working in?  For this question, the answers were a) environmental engineering, b) water resources engineering, c) geotechnical engineering, d) structural engineering, e) transportation engineering, and f) other (explain). For Spring 2015, there was some movement away from the most popular areas of environmental engineering and structural engineering and toward the less popular areas of geotechnical engineering, transportation engineering, and other areas. For Spring 2016, there was some movement away from water resources engineering, structural engineering, and other areas and some movement toward environmental engineering, geotechnical engineering, and transportation engineering.  For Spring 2017, there was some movement away from water resources engineering, structural engineering, and other areas and some movement toward environmental engineering, geotechnical engineering, and transportation engineering.   We assume that the changes in student preferences for all three years were a result of student knowledge gained during the course, especially in areas, such as geotechnical engineering and transportation engineering, that students may not have known as well before the course began.  Question 10 &ndash; What is your current level of interest in pursuing a career in civil engineering?  For this question, the answers included a) very high, b) high, c) moderate, d) low, and e) very low.  For all three years, there was an increase in the student level of interest in civil engineering from the beginning of the course to the end of the course.
