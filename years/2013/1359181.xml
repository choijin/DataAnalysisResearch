<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities. Professors Philippe Buhlmann and Steven R. Kass will train undergraduates from institutions with limited research opportunities, sophomores, under-represented minority groups, and the economically disadvantaged. These students are targeted to lead students to consider careers in chemistry-related fields who might otherwise have chosen different career paths.  To increase the program impact and sense of community among the participants, students are encouraged to volunteer on weekends for an outreach program that gives children the opportunity to perform hands-on chemistry experiments at local community libraries, many of which are in neighborhoods with large minority communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The REU Site whose theme is "Challenges of the 21st Century" will fund ten undergraduate students per year over a period of three years to carry out individual research projects in interdisciplinary areas. Participants will gain research experience in a nurturing environment at a major research university, with particular emphasis on addressing critical challenges in environmental, materials, and biological chemistry. This broad research exposure is supplemented with extensive mentoring and hands-on training. Students have the opportunity to work on environmental, sustainable and health-related chemistry problems of critical societal importance.</AbstractNarration>

At the latter meetings, faculty members gave informal seminars, and towards the end of the summer each student gave a formal oral presentation. On the 2<sup>nd</sup> day of their summer, all students attended a day-long symposium attended by the majority of graduate students, postdocs, and faculty of the department as well as judges from industry. At this symposium, all 3<sup>rd </sup>year chemistry PhD students gave a 25-minute presentation of their research (in 4 parallel sessions), giving the NSF-REU/Lando participants an outstanding overview of what it is like to be a graduate student. Many participants volunteered on two Saturdays for the Chemists-in-the-library program at a local community library. All of the students presented a poster at an event for chemistry students from across the UMN and several local colleges at the end of the summer. Social events attended by most of the students included a welcome reception and dinner, weekly ice cream socials for the first 3 weeks of the summer, a play at the Guthrie, a farewell dinner at the end of the program, and (optionally) trips to a Minnesota Twins baseball game and the Science Museum in St. Paul.

Similarly, over the summer self-assessed experimental skills and technique improved from 2.49 to 2.04, experi?mental data interpretation skills from 2.72 to 2.19, and scientific presentation ability from 2.77 to 2.27. The end-of-summer scores of 2.18, 2.24, 2.59, and 2.29 from 2018 show almost the same improvement on all fronts.</p> <p>At the end of the REU, we can also update our statistics for the whole 4 years of the program. We received 825 applications for the 4 years of this REU (426 from women, 397 from men), and due to special efforts to broadly advertise the program noted 432 applications in 2018 alone. The selected participants came from 18 states and 31 different colleges (none from the University of Minnesota). Of the 35 students, 33 came from schools with limited research opportunities. To enrich the program for all participants, UMN foundation support was used to also sponsor students from 8 different countries. <strong>The 2015-2018 NSF-REU fellows included 63% women, 20% underrepresented minorities, and 34% sophomores</strong> (note that among the applicants there were 32% sophomores, i.e., rising juniors). <strong>In 2017 and 2018, the program included 4 Hispanic and 3 community college/economically disadvantaged students</strong>.
