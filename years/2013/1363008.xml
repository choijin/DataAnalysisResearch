<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Warren Warren of Duke University and his post-doctoral and graduate student researchers are conducting experiments to develop very long-lived nuclear spin states in molecules for use in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  The results from these experiments are of fundamental interest to the scientific community, but they also open up new possibilities for use in clinical applications of MRI.  Postdoctoral and graduate students working on this project will receive training.  Prof. Warren also participates in significant scientific outreach to the broader community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Warren and his research group are continuing work to develop long-lived (singlet) spin states for use in magnetic resonance applications. His group has developed pulse sequences to excite very long lived (minutes!) states in biologically interesting molecules.  Prof. Warren and his group will continue a multi-pronged effort at: (1) using natural abundance (13C, 15N) species to identify long-lived states; (2) conduct basic theoretical extensions of the density matrix understanding of magnetic resonance; (3) conduct detailed quantum mechanical and molecular dynamics simulations in these systems; (4) synthesize macroscopic quantities of promising candidate compounds for further study; and (5) significantly expand the list of candidate molecular motifs (including strategies which completely avoid labeling).  Young researchers working in the group of Prof. Warren will receive training in both experimental and theoretical magnetic resonance spectroscopy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a premier spectroscopic technique in chemistry, physics and materials science, and its clinical counterpart magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revolutionized medical diagnosis, but in both NMR and MRI sensitivity is often a severe limitation.  As a result, an exciting new frontier involves "hyperpolarization" methods which can increase the observable signal as much as 10,000 times in virtually any organic molecule. However, hyperpolarization disappears at a rate given by the nuclear spin lifetime, which in solution is commonly seconds, and the short relaxation times drastically limit the processes that can be studied by the method.  In addition, the apparatus is complicated and expensive (ca. $2.5M for clinical systems).  Without solutions to both the long-lived state and technology problems, hyperpolarization will be destined to have only a specialized niche role.  Our work in the last grant period has demonstrated that excellent solutions do exist for both of these problems.  Pulse sequences can load and unload long-lived states in many molecules, effectively lengthening relaxation times to many minutes. We have also demonstrated a variety of new hyperpolarization approaches which, in less than a minute, created 15N or 13C polarization 104-105 times larger than normal, in about 150 different molecules with very different structures.  The apparatus is simple (it can literally be built by undergraduates). We have demonstrated a wide variety of binging motifs, explored the fundamental physics behind this method, and created new strategies for further enhancing signals. The intellectual merit of the proposed activity comes from addressing fundamental questions about spin dynamics in ways that could not have been envisioned even three years ago. Ultra-low field NMR is not new, but this work brings it in the mainstream: our methods use it to enable better high field experiments. The systems reflect a new class of "reactive intermediates" which go back to their original state, yet create a useful product (spin polarized nuclei).  Other extensions of our activity focus on the complex role of molecular symmetry in isolating states from their environment, and on developing the tools to access ever-better protected states.  Broader impacts arise, most obviously, from the potential this work has to revolutionize medical imaging by creating a wide variety of MR-trackable molecular targets. Development of a family of such reagents would have a major impact on clinical imaging, metabolomics, rational drug design, and metabolic pathway elucidation.  A likely outcome is "hyperpolarization for the 99%" who do not use current methods because of cost and complexity.
