<AbstractNarration>Technical Description &lt;br/&gt;IRES: The US-India Collaborative Research in Mechanical, Biomedical, and Materials Science Engineering for Undergraduates is a joint research project between Ohio State and Colorado State Universities, and the Jaipur Engineering College and Research Centre in India. US-students will conduct research on a prosthetic device that was pioneered several decades ago at the Dr. P.K. Sethi Rehabilitation and Jaipur Limb Training Centre. It continues to be used throughout India due to the low-cost, cultural appropriateness, and magnitude of the amputee population. At present, the number of amputees in the world is significant, particularly in the developing countries. &lt;br/&gt;          &lt;br/&gt;This IRES project will provide internships for five talented US-undergraduate engineering students each year over three years to conduct research and development activities that will provide a thorough understanding of this prosthetic device. At present, little is known about the properties of the individual components that comprise the device. The goal of this research is to improve the product for wider distribution within India and for eventual mass production so that it?s potential for relieving the suffering of amputees in the developing world and beyond may be realized. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Description&lt;br/&gt;This project will make significant advances in prosthetic devices for the developing world. Although much is known in the U.S. regarding prosthetic devices, understanding the various design and production constraints for developing countries is less well-known. The project evaluation will lead to a better understanding of the impact of humanitarian projects on the development of engineering students. The research has the potential to transform the way that prosthetic devices are made in non-western regions in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The benefit to society accrued through this project is significant. Researchers will target women and underrepresented students for participation, encouraging them to pursue advanced degrees in engineering. This will serve to broaden participation in STEM fields. The results will be broadly disseminated through a variety of journals and conference venues. The impact on the World?s poor who are amputees is potentially significant.</AbstractNarration>

Through participation in this project, all students learned valuable skills as researchers, collaborators, and scholars.  They were fully engaged in the project and were required to be self-reliant in order to perform their duties while in-country.  Several of the student researchers have indicated an interest in pursuing further graduate studies upon completion of their undergraduate degrees.  We believe that this project has provided them with an excellent background in conducting research as well as an excellent foundation for understanding multi-cultural issues.
