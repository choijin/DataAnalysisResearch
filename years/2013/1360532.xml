<AbstractNarration>This award provides funds for the conference "Contemporary Combinatorics 2014",  which will be held at the University of Memphis during March 27-29, 2014.  The aim of this conference is to bring together a group of outstanding mathematicians who work on topics loosely related to combinatorics, probability and combinatorial number theory so that they can present their latest research results, and also interact with other conference participants, including young researchers and even high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics is an area of mathematics that studies discrete structures. It has applications to computer science, chemistry, and many areas of engineering. The conference aims to promote interaction between senior and junior researchers, to allow for the dissemination of recent research results, and to publicize the importance of combinatorics in the general public.</AbstractNarration>

The poster session and Research Students' Day was also a resounding success as students had a chance to share their blossoming research and get feedback not only from peers but from senior researchers as well.  Many collaborative connections were made on a number of levels.     Intellectual Merit and Broader Impact. The Contemporary Combinatorics meeting in Memphis continues to go a great way towards redressing the historical deficit of high level mathematical conferences in the mid-south area. Ideas shared and interactions initiated at these conferences have provided significant foundation for beginning and continuing collaborations, graduate student dissertations, workshops, classes and seminars.     Participants and Speakers. Including speakers, there were 115 total participants in the conference. The roster of the speakers included:  Paul Balister, University of Memphis  J&oacute;szef Balogh, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign Vitaly Bergelson, The Ohio State University Enrico Bombieri, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton Tristan Denley, Tennessee Board of Regents Dwight Duffus, Emory University Ron Gould, Emory University Cecilia Holmgren, Stockholm University, Sweden Alice Hubenko, Eucalyptus Systems, Inc.

This talk is well attended by high school students, undergraduates and others with some interest in the history and culture of mathematics.  This year's talk entitled "Recent Progress on Prime Numbers and Sieves" was delivered by Fields Medalist Enrico Bombieri. It discussed the theory of prime numbers and the fact that it has seen very recently memorable progress with the astonishing solution of the problem of existence of infinitely many prime pairs with bounded gap, obtained independently by Yitang Zhang and James Maynard.  The talk gave a bit of the history of the problem, a description of the progress in obtaining better and better sieving tools and a quick outline of new ideas in the works by Zhang and Maynard.     Research Students Day. Consistent with the NSF goals of cultivating and producing new mathematical minds and providing them avenues for exploration and challenges, this year's event included Research Students Day and the end of the conference which allowed students to present their research and receive feedback from senior researchers and peers.     Below are titles and speakers of the nine talks given:  Disjoint Subgraphs of the Same Size -- Bhargav Narayanan, University of Cambridge. On Chorded Cycles -- Megan Cream, Emory University.
