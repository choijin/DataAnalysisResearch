<AbstractNarration>The goal of this WIDER planning grant program is to enhance the educational experience of STEM majors at Georgia State University (GSU) by encouraging the faculty to make evidence-based changes in their pedagogy. GSU is notable as a highly diverse campus, with strengths in the STEM disciplines. Four strategies are being employed in this project.  First, the current pedagogical knowledge, educational goals, and career motivations of GSU instructors (both tenure track and non-tenure track) are being assessed in order to help the University support the faculty in their efforts to implement pedagogical change. Second, the data "dashboard" needs of instructional faculty are being assessed, in order to create readily accessible quantitative data sets that allow rapid assessment of changes in teaching practices.  Third, forums for sharing ideas, expertise and pedagogical help with GSU faculty members via outside mentors are being established.  Finally, four Faculty Learning Communities centered on peer-led team learning, the hybrid classroom, training and support of graduate teaching assistants, and integration of science concepts into the mathematics curriculum are being created, to provide sustained engagement and feedback for the reform efforts underway.  In all four of these areas, the goal is to nucleate change starting from interdisciplinary groups of faculty with similar pedagogical goals.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broad goal of this program is to significantly increase GSU's institutional commitment to evidence-based teaching and learning in the STEM disciplines.  Increased student engagement should in turn increase both retention and progression toward the degree. Full-time non-tenure track faculty have a significant role in STEM education at GSU and increasingly in the nation as a whole.  A detailed study of the pedagogical knowledge, educational goals, and career motivations of these key instructional players is therefore important to all institutions that use a specialized faculty model. A model of a "dashboard" of readily accessible quantitative data of student performance will be of broad interest as the United States seeks to encourage evidence-based pedagogical innovations throughout the STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our WIDER program was designed to enhance the undergraduate STEM experience and increase the percentage of students who graduate with STEM degrees at Georgia State University.  Our specific approach toward this long-term goal was to empower the non-tenure track (NTT) faculty.  One strategy was to make quantitative data on student success far more readily available to faculty.  Via a combination of programs started with this grant funding, and progress made independently by the University, faculty now have far greater access to data that can be used to further student careers.  A second strategy was to formalize another rung on the career ladder for NTT faculty and help the faculty to apply for promotion.  The third strategy was to gather the faculty in groups to work on topics of specific interest.  Faculty learning groups focused on the hybrid classroom, training and support of graduate teaching assistants, integration of sustainability into the classroom, peer mentoring, and course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs).  Peer mentoring was a central focus of the efforts, including Peer-led Team Learning in Organic Chemistry as well as Learning Assistants in Physics and Calculus for the Life Sciences.  Peer tutoring efforts were consolidated across the STEM disciplines into a central renovated space.  CUREs have given our NTT faculty the opportunity to pursue research ideas either on their own or in collaboration with tenure track faculty.  CURE students are engaged in problem-solving experiences; they learn the excitement of discovery, the necessity of understanding the literature, the challenge of accurate experimentation, and the value of teamwork.  We now have significant dedicated space for undergraduate STEM research and will offer more than 20 CURE courses each year.  The WIDER-sponsored efforts have expanded the roles and responsibilities of NTT faculty at Georgia State, leading to a stronger academic culture for the University and expanded opportunities for our students.
