<AbstractNarration>This research is about better understanding the mechanisms involved in the lubrication of porous polymer-based surfaces or coatings with ultra-low coefficients of friction.  These mechanisms arise from the partial hydrodynamic repulsive forces that act between shearing compliant surfaces.  A combination of tribology experiments and simulations will be used to guide the design of a macroscopic porous polymer-based surface to attain minimal coefficients of friction.  Specifically, the project will involve the determination of the optimal geometrical parameters of pores within a polymer through simulations and supported by experiments, the determination of the lubrication performance through longevity studies, and the fabrication of a macroscopic prototype of the ultra-low shearing surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the research will improve the performance and durability of artificial knee and hip replacement devices. Specifically, these low friction polymer surfaces have the potential to be used as a biocompatible mimic for cartilage and synovial fluid in diseased or damaged joints, which affects a large fraction of the elderly population.  Furthermore, these ultra-low friction surfaces may be used as lubricating surfaces in a wide range of machinery involving moving parts.  From an educational standpoint, this project will involve underrepresented K-12 students in open house events held at Tulane University.  These events will expose scientific principles to middle and high school students in the greater New Orleans area through hands-on demonstrations and experiments with the ultimate aim of encouraging the students to consider science and engineering as future fields of study.  In particular, a module involving the friction between shearing surfaces will be included.  At the undergraduate level, students from underrepresented groups will be offered research opportunities based on this project.</AbstractNarration>
