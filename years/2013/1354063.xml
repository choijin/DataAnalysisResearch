<AbstractNarration>Environmental change produced by human activities is widely recognized as having major negative effects on our planet's biodiversity. Two of the resulting scientific challenges are to determine how reductions in biodiversity influence the health of ecosystems, and how biodiversity can be maintained. Genetic variation found within populations of species is a critical component of biodiversity and is essential for population adaptation and persistence in the face of changing environmental conditions. Little is known about the effects of this variation on natural communities and ecosystems. This project combines outdoor experiments in freshwater ponds with mathematical models to identify these effects. The investigator will determine if genetic diversity among individuals can stabilize natural communities, allowing them to persist in the face environmental change, and if the transport of individuals among communities can maintain genetic diversity and thus promote this stabilizing effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide research opportunities in aquatic ecology for undergraduate and graduate students at Wayne State University. With a minority enrollment of 37%, Wayne State University has the most diverse university student body in Michigan. This diversity increases the investigator's opportunities to involve under-represented groups in hands-on research experiences. This project will also provide support for graduate students who will carry out experiments during summers, supervise undergraduate research projects, and have the opportunity to develop their own independent research projects. The research focuses on freshwater ponds, and these habitats provide diverse ecosystem services to society. Results will inform land managers and conservation biologists who strive to maintain these habitats in a healthy state.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Biologists have long recognized that evolution can allow species to persist when faced with environmental change. However, there is increasing evidence that evolutionary change can occur at such a rapid pace that it can alter and stabilize the dynamics of populations at short time scales - what are termed eco-evolutionary dynamics. Using experimental ponds, we showed that rapid genetic change occurring over a single summer can enhance the stability of populations of the zooplankter, <em>Daphnia pulex</em>, reducing their variability over time. We further demonstrated experimentally that such effects were enhanced by dispersal (i.e. movement of individuals among ponds). In a companion study, we examined <em>Daphnia pulex</em> populations in natural ponds and found that they&nbsp;also show rapid changes in genetic composition over a single growing season. Moreover, increasing genetic turnover was associated with greater population stability, paralelling patterns observed in our experimental system. We believe this is one of the first studies to show that rapid adaptation can stabilize natural populations experiencing natural environmental variation. Taken together, our findings show that evolutionary processes play an important role in the persistence of populations and that such effects can play out over very short time scales (months instead of years). This project also provided research opportunities in aquatic ecology for undergraduate and graduate students at Wayne State University. Four undergraduates participated as REUs (research experience for undergraduates) over three field seasons at our study site (the Kellogg Biological Station). These students pursued their own independent research projects and took part in career development activities at the field station. An additional seven undergraduates participated in the project for research credits. These students aided with laboratory-based activities associated with the grant and four pursued independent projects.
