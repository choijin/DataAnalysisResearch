<AbstractNarration>The conference Texas-Oklahoma  Representations and Automorphic forms IV will take place on March 23-24, 2013, at the University of North Texas.  Additional information can be found on the confernce website: http://www.math.unt.edu/~richter/TORA/TORA4.html&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the last century, the theories of automorphic forms and  representations have grown enormously. Important applications impact various fields of research, ranging from number theory, coding theory, algebraic geometry, and topology to Kac-Moody algebras and quantum field theory. The interplay of automorphic forms and representation theory has been especially fruitful, and many surprising and deep results have emerged. The TORA conference series will emphasize the interplay between automorphic forms and representations, both in the classical and adelic languages, and related topics like analytic number theory and harmonic analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The TORA mathematics conference series consists of semi-annual meetings hosted by the University of North Texas, Oklahoma State University, and the University of Oklahoma on a rotating basis. This award provides support for three weekend conferences, one at the University of North Texas in Spring 2013 (TORA IV), one at Oklahoma State University in Fall 2013 (TORA V), and another at the University of Oklahoma in Spring 2014 (TORA VI). Each conference will feature two or three prominent guest speakers from outside the Texas-Oklahoma region, in addition to other participants including students, post-doctoral researchers, and junior faculty. Regional graduate students and  researchers will also give talks describing their work. These conferences will facilitate collaborations and interactions among the students and researchers in the region who work in the areas of Automorphic Forms, Representation Theory, and Number Theory.</AbstractNarration>

A series of meetings has been held twice a year for the past 3 years in rotation by the Oklahoma State University, the University of Oklahoma, and the University of North Texas. Each TORA meeting features two prominent guest speakers from outside the Texas-Oklahoma region to present cutting-edge results. Regional researchers and graduate students also give talks describing their work. Number theorists and algebraists from diverse perspectives will glean new techniques and ideas during the talks and the informal interactions surrounding each meeting.  TORA VI was held at the University of Oklahoma from March 7-9, 2014.  There were 52 registered participants from 16 institutions, consisting of 13 tenured/tenure-track faculty, 7 post-docs, and 32 graduate students.  There were 3 plenary speakers: William Duke (UCLA, Professor), Fiona Murnaghan (University of Toronto, Professor) and Vita Kala (Purdue University, graduate student).  There were 10 regular length talks of 30 or 50 minutes each (4 by tenured/tenure-track faculty, 3 by postdocs, 3 by graduate students), one "Speed TORA" session consisting of a dozen 5-minute talks in quick succession, and 4 sessions specifically geared towards students.  The 4 sessions for graduate students were a new feature tried for the first time at TORA VI.  (Speed TORA was also an experimental feature begun in TORA III, and continued since then, based on positive feedback.)  The graduate student sessions consisted of one 60-minute preliminary preparatory session and one 30-minute follow up question-and-answer session for each of the first 2 plenary talks.  A follow-up survey sent to graduate students and postdocs resulted in very positive feedback on things including Speed TORA, the sessions for graduate students, and the opportunity to meet and talk with other researchers.     TORAS I ("TORA Student") was held at the University of Oklahoma from March 28-29, 2015. As a novel feature, this TORA meeting was entirely organized by graduate students, with the PIs only providing oversight over the process. There were 36 registered participants from 6 institutions, consisting of 7 tenured/tenure-track faculty, 1 post-doc, and 28 graduate students.  There were 2 plenary speakers: Amanda Folsom (Amherst College, Associate Professor), Jennifer Johnson-Leung (University of Idaho, Assistant Professor).  There were 9 regular length talks of 50 minutes each (4 by tenured/tenure-track faculty, 1 by postdoc, 4 by graduate students).
