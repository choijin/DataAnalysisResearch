<AbstractNarration>The Intellectual Merit of this project is the CrossCloud design for a practical, open, federated data base system, based on existing web technologies including Linked Data.  CrossCloud's design solves longstanding database federation challenges in a simple and effective way using the Linked Data vision of RDF data sources which use URLs as object identifiers.  CrossCloud includes a "data registration" mechanism to create a distributed search service for data and a vocabulary mapping system to connect applications developed independently with these components.  CrossCloud is decentralized, capable of managing queries and updates from across the internet with no central bottleneck. The Broader Impact of this work begins with making it easier for developers to share users across an industry and then be able to reach a critical mass.  Nearly any situation calling for coordinated work among people can benefit from multi-user software and with CrossCloud changing the software market, the needed solutions can finally be put into widespread use. This EAGER grant proposal is being made at a critical time, as the underlying technologies fall into place and enterprising developers begin to settle into working with mobile devices and cloud infrastructure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this EAGER project was to investigate and demonstrate options for shifting the architecture of multi-user software toward decentralization.  This shift will help students, researchers, vendors, and others to create powerful and open software tools for collaboration, coordination, and cooperation, unconstrained by the requirements of centralized services.  At the same time, it should give users more control over their data and reduce vendor lock-in, bringing healthy competition and increasing confidence in the multi-user software market.  The grant ran four years, during which decentralization grew dramatically as a concept in the industry and application development technologies continued to evolve rapidly. Our work on this grant was closely coordinated with progress in the Linked Data/Semantic Web technology stack, particularly its application to decentralization through the W3C Social Web Working Group. In this context, we primarily explored and developed two fundamental architectural concepts throughout this period of change:  1. The Datapages Architecture provides a model for web application developers to work with simple, familiar JSON-style objects, while also having the data synchronized across devices, servers, organizations, and users, with access control and provenance tracking.  We implemented this model in multiple contexts and partially validated it with a variety of demonstration applications in these contexts. The model is a variation on the RDF/Semantic Web model, intended to be easier for software developers to use, particularly with its inclusion of features needed for building practical decentralized applications.  2. The use of natural language Template Sentences for structured data provides a novel alternative to vocabulary definition documents and ontologies. This approach addresses major barriers to the adoption of Semantic Web technologies, where developers wait for stable, properly hosted vocabularies with a long-term-support commitment, but there is insufficient motivation to develop high-quality vocabularies and support them until there is a successful application base. Template sentences address this by dramatically lowering the cost of revision, making iterative development more practical and eliminating the need to trust a central authority for each vocabulary.  Finally, we had the insight that decentralized applications can be built on top of existing social networking platforms, making use of existing online social graphs, established user identities, and existing authentication mechanisms.  Doing so should provide a simpler, more comfortable, and more trustworthy user experiences, while the use of Datapages and Template Sentences makes the process simple for developers.  We implemented this, combining all these elements into a demonstration system we call SocDB (for "Social Database").  SocDB provides Datapages service to applications while sharing the actual data via existing social networking systems (Twitter, in our initial version).  With SocDB, JSON-like application data is encoded for sharing using template sentences, so that it remains completely open and self-documenting, welcoming to interoperable implementations and free from key vocabulary and data-format management issues.  This work is likely to affect society broadly, as centralized multi-user software is now heavily used in nearly every industry and by individual consumers, with increasing investment and still unmet potential.
