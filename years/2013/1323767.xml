<AbstractNarration>In this Cyberlearning: Transforming Education DIP (Development and Implementation) project, the PIs are investigating how embodied play among elementary school students can be used to help them understand scientific phenomena (e.g., the working of forces, complex behaviors of bees). They are instrumenting elementary school classrooms with advanced tracking. The PIs are building upon the ways that young children engage in socio-dramatic play. Through role play, children explore and reflect upon the complex rules that govern the world, and in this project, they are asked to play roles in a natural system (e.g., bees in a beehive) and identify the rules that would make their role play match the workings of the natural system. Motion capture technology is used to record their interactions, and they reflect together as a class after role-playing experiences. Research focuses on the qualities of reflection and subsequent learning afforded by two aspects of such play -- when children interact to plan their role play (equivalent to modeling) and when they act out the system or phenomenon (equivalent to simulation) and then have a chance to examine their interactions. To understand the affordances and importance of embodied play, reflection and learning outcomes are also compared across conditions of acting out a system or phenomenon (1st person embodied simulation) and running a computer simulation of that same system or phenomenon (3rd person virtual simulation).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is currently little understanding of how to teach science productively in early elementary school. As suits this age group, these PIs are going after how to take best advantage of the kinds of role playing children naturally engage in at this age. Much of their role play discussion has to do with coming up with the rules of the role play; the PIs' insight is that this could be seen as the equivalent of creating a model. This research is developing a model of how to involve kids in grades K-3 in learning science through modeling and, in addition, focusing on the the kinds of reflection on that play that result in learning and how to affect such reflection and subsequent learning with the help of technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In elementary education there is an opportunity to improve how children are taught science.  Misunderstandings of developmental psychology have limited science education to a caricature of scientific practice.  Instead of having children engage in science like scientists do&mdash;questioning, modeling and arguing with evidence&mdash;elementary science education has focused primarily on memorization, unstructured investigations, and concrete experiences.  A core strategy for constructivism is to build on the existing capabilities of children and one such competency is pretend play.  While at first pretend play seems to be an unlikely method for science education, when children engage in pretend play they are also engaging in some of the core practices of science: inquiry, modeling and argumentation. A goal of STEP has been to build upon play to support authentic, and conceptually rich science learning.   Play is a form of informal inquiry.  If you think of childrenÆs pretend play, you often think of playing superheroes, school, or house. Most of these contexts are familiar, but not fully understood. For example, when children play "house" children become mothers, fathers, or babies, and they act out familiar scenarios such as when the mom gets sick.  However, when they begin playing out the scene, they do not fully understand the rules of parenting. It is through play that they make sense of what parents do and why. In STEP we have students "play water particles" become different states of matter or "play bees" foraging for nectar.  Children play at science and inquire into the rules that govern these scientific systems.  An interesting feature of childrenÆs play is that children often spend more time arguing and negotiating the rules of a play situation than they spend actually "playing" and as a result, the rules that govern a situation become visible and explicit for children.   The STEP environment uses mixed reality tools to combine studentsÆ play activities with the power of computer simulations and thus support them in reflecting on scientific content. Mixed reality environments use software to combine elements of the real world with virtual objects and capabilities. As students play in a STEP classroom, Microsoft Kinect sensors (the same that are used in the popular X-Box) track their motion and feed this information into a computer simulation. For example, as students move around the classroom in the states of matter unit they are asked to play-act how they believe water would behave in a range of circumstances such as a freezing cold day. They can see their activity projected into a computer simulation where an avatar of a water particle is displayed over the video display (see Figures 1-6). This avatar not only supports playful activity as a costume might, but also includes a representation of important information necessary for the studentsÆ inquiry such as the temperature in the imagined space or the energy level of the individual particles.  In the states of matter study, students explored how matter is made up of particles whose relative position and distance collectively impact the "state" that we perceive. Additionally, we introduced two contrasting conditions to better understand how play supports scientific modeling. In the first condition, students engaged in open-ended play as a form of modeling. In the second condition, students interacted with a version of STEP that was designed to look more like a video game; the motion of their simulated particles helped to power and control a robot who was attempting to survive a volcanic island. While learning outcomes were similar, this contrast allowed us to demonstrate how the open-ended modeling environment promoted more emergent learning goals, and supported a more positive environment. In contrast, the game-like environment led students to be rushed, and to pursue superficial goals rather than rich scientific explanations.  In the complex systems unit students ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
