<AbstractNarration>This project, carried out by the University of Notre Dame, seeks to contribute to statistics education by developing improved methods for computerized adaptive testing.  These methods use modern versions of item response theory, going beyond older versions that are commonly used in adaptive tests.  Hence, the project has the potential to lead to tests that more successfully measure student knowledge and provide diagnostic feedback, as computerized testing increasing comes into wide use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is a CAREER award, supporting not only research but educational outreach and professional development by a Notre Dame faculty member, Dr. Ying Cheng.  The educational outreach includes providing summer research fellowships to high school and college students, and offering a workshop to high school statistics teachers.  The test items and computerized testing/feedback programs developed in this project will be made available to students and teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves the participation of several hundred students, taking Advanced Placement (AP) statistics classes in high school or introductory statistics in college, as well as about 30 AP statistics high school teachers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work helps the Education and Human Resources directorate, and the Division of Research on Learning, pursue the mission of supporting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education research.  In particular, this project focuses on improving STEM learning, including assessment of learning and use of technology in STEM learning environments such as schools.</AbstractNarration>

In the assessment platform, teachers are able to create assignments by selecting items to cover intended content, or can create an adaptive assignment. Adaptive assignments present items to students in a manner that "matches" the item difficulty parameters with students' estimated ability based on their performance on past items. In creating the assignments, researchers and teachers also have the flexibility to choose deadlines, the number of items on the assignment, and which sections to receive the assignment, regardless of whether it is adaptive or not. For non-adaptive assignments, there is the option to randomize the order in which items are presented to students.   Aside from serving as a platform for researchers and teachers to create formative assessments of student learning the AP-CAT system provides students an opportunity to reflect and learn from their past work. For example, digital logs are recorded when students check the solution to a particularly challenging question or review their progress via a personalized score report.

While students can examine only their individual progress, teachers can also examine student progress in aggregate for an entire class in addition to individual students.    Overall, from this project the research team has:   Created an item bank with 842 items that are mapped to 157 learning attributes in statistics and probability;    Developed and tested a web-based interactive assessment platform for teachers to design, assemble and administer automatically graded assignments and monitor student progress, and for students to take and review their assignments and receive diagnostic feedback;   Built in adaptive item selection and automated scoring algorithms in the backend of the interface (Cheng et al., 2017) as well as scale-up functionalities through cloud for large-scale implementations (Brodersen et al., 2020);    Collected data from five cohorts of students in 7 schools in Indiana taking AP statistics classes and using the AP-CAT system (Spring 2016 - Spring 2020) and based on their feedback iteratively developed and refined the system;     Developed and validated a self-report measure to assess students’ engagement in statistics, the Scale of Student Engagement in Statistics (SSE-S; Whitney et al., 2019), which consists of 24 Likert-type items, with eight items each reflecting the affective, behavioral, and cognitive dimensions of engagement.
