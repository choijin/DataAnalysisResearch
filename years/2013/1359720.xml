<AbstractNarration>The Plains Elevated Convection at Night (PECAN) field campaign is planned for the Summer of 2015 in the central Great Plains.  The scientific focus of PECAN is nocturnal convection, with four separate research topics to be addressed:  1) Nocturnal convection initiation and early evolution of mesoscale convective clusters; 2) Bore and other wave-like disturbances; 3) Dynamics and microphysics of nocturnal mesoscale convective systems; 4) Prediction of nocturnal convection initiation and evolution.  The observational campaign plan calls for three research aircraft, seven mobile Doppler radars, and multiple sounding systems.  A main part of the experimental design is the inclusion of fixed and mobile PECAN Integrated Sounding Array (PISA) units which consists of a variety of profiling instruments.  The broader societal impact of PECAN is to improve forecasts of these nocturnal events for hydrology, energy, agriculture and public safety purposes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given PECAN's four research foci, it is clear that quantification of the nocturnal stable boundary layer (NSBL) structure is mission critical.  This project is unique due to its focus on the NSBL using a suite of in situ measurements, a valuable addition to PECAN's remote sensing capabilities, especially in data validation and calibration.  The instrument package deployed with this project includes tethered balloon based mean and flux systems, flux towers, SODARs, a 915 MHz wind profiler, a LIDAR, a laser ceilometer, a rawinsonde system, and three near-surface flux/profiling systems.  Given the spatial separation of the two sites, this research team is ideally positioned to make coordinated and detailed measurements of the characteristics of the NSBL in different locations relative to the moving Mesoscale Convective Systems and their associated NSBL disturbances (density currents and bores). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project mirror those of PECAN; that is, the advancement of our knowledge base and improvement of forecasts of critical weather phenomena.  In addition, unique of this project is the planned involvement of many undergraduate students in the research.  This project will thus provide extensive opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in cutting-edge research and research training, from project planning and data collection in the field to coauthoring peer-reviewed publications.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The PECAN field campaign assembled a rich array of observations from lower-tropospheric profiling systems, mobile radars and mesonets, and aircraft over the Great Plains during June-July 2015 to better understand nocturnal mesoscale convective systems and their relationship with the stable boundary layer, the low-level jet, and atmospheric bores. The central Great Plains region in North America has a nocturnal maximum in warm season precipitation. Much of this precipitation comes from organized mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). This nocturnal maximum is counterintuitive in the sense that convective activity over the Great Plains is out of phase with the local generation of convective available potential energy (CAPE) by solar heating of the surface. The lower troposphere in this nocturnal environment is typically characterized by a low level jet (LLJ) just above a stable boundary layer (SBL), and CAPE values that peak above the SBL, resulting in convection that may be elevated, with source air decoupled from the surface. Nocturnal MCS-induced cold pools often trigger undular bores and solitary waves within the SBL.
