<AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;The main goal is to develop an understanding of the kinetics of jamming in granular systems, through measurement of jamming fronts and of grain-scale dynamics across the fronts.  The simplest situation is the stationary upward propagation of a jamming front during sedimentary deposition, where the grain concentration profile will be measured by medical x-ray imaging, and the granular temperature profile (Tg) will be measured by Speckle-Visibility Spectroscopy (SVS).  Key interest is in the deviations from step-function profiles, the vanishing of Tg, and spatiotemporally correlated fluctuations of dynamics akin to dynamical heterogeneities but now in presence of gradients and time evolution.  Another situation is the clogging behavior for various grain types discharged from tall hoppers.  Macroscopically, the clogging transition will be studied by the divergence of average discharge mass as hole size increases.  Microscopically, it will be studied by spatially-correlated fluctuations of Tg around the hydrodynamic time-average flow field; unsteadiness of Tg is hypothesized to increase on approach to the clogging transition.  This will be studied by particle tracking and by SVS through the sidewall.  A separate thrust is planned for the dynamics of 2d air-fluidized grains within an array of pinned grains.   These projects will bring modern physics and measurement techniques into the educational experience of graduate and undergraduate students.  And the knowledge to be created will be helpful for understanding and controlling jamming phenomena in industrial and natural settings, where there is often a moving boundary between jammed and unjammed regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;The flow of almost anything other than a fluid has an annoying tendency to "jam" and come to rest in spite of applied forces.  Familiar examples include traffic on a highway, coal in a chute, and sand in an hourglass.  Such problems confound the processing of diverse granular materials like foods, seeds, minerals, ores, building materials, and pharmaceutical pills &amp; powders.  In the natural world, jamming phenomena underlie horrific events such as mudslides and earthquakes.  In none of these cases can the behavior yet be truly controlled.  But thanks to recent theoretical and experimental science, there is now a reasonable understanding of the jamming transition for uniform systems, where all the grains are subjected to the same conditions and are all either jammed or unjammed.  This award will support groundbreaking research on how jams develop in situations where there is an interface or "jamming front" that separates jammed and unjammed regions and that changes with time.  Think of what happens when a clog forms over the outlet of an hourglass, or when grains settle out of from a fluid.  Though the materials may seem mundane, the science and the experimental methods are sophisticated.  This will be ideal for the educational experience of graduate and undergraduate students.  The knowledge to be created will be of interest to physicists, engineers, and geologists, and will help industry avoid inefficiencies and process failures due to jamming.  It may ultimately even help save lives and property through control of mudslides and erosion.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The concept of "jamming" refers to solid-like behavior of a disordered / non-crystalline system of particulates ranging in size from atoms and molecules to grains and bubbles and boulders, all of which have basically the same packing structure as atoms in an ordinary liquid.  Prior work established quite good understanding of a "jamming phase diagram" specifying conditions under which jamming occurs for systems that are spatially uniform and time-independent.  The primary focus of this project concerned the kinetics of jamming, in other words how systems evolve with time when external conditions are changed in order to bring them from an unjammed to a jammed state.  This is a wide-open problem because it involves physics beyond the jamming phase diagram, namely where there are extra effects due to spatial gradients and boundaries and time evolution.  This is important because jammed materials are widespread in nature and crucial industry, but poorly understood and difficult to control.  A useful analogy is crystalline silicon - its phase diagram was well known but much additional new understanding was needed in order to be able to create large single crystal samples that can be used in e.g. computer chips.  In our case, the new physics uncovered to understanding the kinetics of jamming involves the motion of jamming fronts and subtle differences in packing structure for jammed versus unjammed systems.   In terms of "intellectual merit", advances in understanding can be broken down into several categories: [1] Impact, where a projectile unjams a granular system, and a jamming front travels out and then collapses onto the projectile as it comes to rest. [2] Slow deformation and flow for applied forces barely large enough to unjam the system.  Here special interest was in (a) grains driven by the flow of fluid as in a river, (b) grains driven by gravity in a hopper, and (c) grains driven by an upflow of air.  [3] Novel measures of structure.  Here we developed several new means to characterize and identify structural features and defects allowing for localized rearrangements as the microscopic origins of flow.  [4] Development of a novel experimental technique to eliminate stripe artifacts that plague a widely-used "Refractive Index Matched Scanning" (RIMS) method to probe structure in dense disordered granular systems.   In terms of "broader impact", the funded work led to over two dozen peer-reviewed publications, over two dozen invited talks, over half dozen public science cafe style talks, as well as numerous contributed talk and poster presentations by my students and postdocs. The scientific advances are valuable beyond physics: Modern society relies on handling wide varieties of granular materials to secure our food, shelter, transportation, energy, and medicine: food grains, seeds, fertilizers, soils, minerals, ores, coal, building materials, pharmaceutical pills &amp; powders, concrete, powders for casting ceramic / metal / plastic parts, sandstones bearing oil &amp; gas, and more.  Our work has fundamental implications not only on a wide range of industry but also on academic subdisciplines of engineering, geology even astrophysics.  By training students and postdocs on individual cutting-edge projects, our work contributes to building an educated workforce.  And since grains are familiar from everyday life, our work is ideal for engaging the public via science cafe talks and science fair demonstrations.
