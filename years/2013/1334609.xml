<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research project is to develop efficient and robust numerical methods for searching and exploring an environment using a mechanical system, while ensuring that the average temporal coverage reproduces a prescribed spatial distribution. This is achieved by developing methods for controlling mechanical systems so that they are ergodic with respect to the given spatial distribution, and combining them with geometric structure-preserving numerical integrators which have good backward error properties, and preserve geometric invariants like the symplectic structure, energy, and momentum. Furthermore, these methods preserve the nonlinear structure of the configuration manifold, such as the Lie group or homogeneous space structure. The key technical goals include: (i) the development and analysis of structured integrators to accurately predict ergodic properties of a given system; (ii) the development of simulation-based optimization of system parameters, and controls to maximize efficiency of ergodic search; (iii) the generalization of these techniques to Lie groups and homogeneous spaces, enabling ergodic search for a rich class of robotic systems; (iv) experimental validation on realistic systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These techniques will directly be applicable to a broad range of real-world industrial applications, including joint space exploration for robotic systems, fault detection in manufacturing, and optimal search, coverage, and information extraction for autonomous sensor networks. This industrial outreach will be facilitated by the release of public-domain software that will lower the barrier to adapting geometric numerical integration techniques in a variety of applications. Furthermore, we will engage in public outreach activities by teaming up with the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago to develop an interactive exhibit demonstrating search algorithms for mechanical systems. These concrete applications serve to inspire high-school students (in particular, underrepresented minorities and women) to pursue STEM degrees, and this in turn will help to secure the long-term economic innovation and competitiveness of American industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project "Ergodic Trajectories in Discrete Mechanics" (Award 1334609) developed numerical methods for ergodic control, a way to relate decision-making to spatial probabilities. One way to understand the goal of ergodic control is to think of drawing an image and how movement over time makes the sketch look more and more like the original photograph.  Although it will never look exactly like the original image, the sketch will look more and more like the photograph over time. The same idea shows up in other settings, for example finding keys in a bag, or searching for something in a room.  The key insight was that the numerical representation of a mechanical system has a dramatic impact on the quality of resulting motion, which in turn affects the movement strategy.  Moreover, as part of this work, we developed an experimental robotic drawing system that sketches a photograph using ergodic control.   In its early stages, the work determined that specialized numerical methods for information maximization improve a system's ability to adapt to its environment.  Software implementation of information maximization strategies, made available to the public through open source release, was developed in the Robot Operating System.  Moreover, experiments with real robots were performed showing that a robot can use the algorithms to adapt to the physics of an object it is manipulating with very limited sensory data.   Later in the project, numerical methods based on discrete mechanics were developed for ergodic control and then implemented on a robotic sketching system for purpose of experimental validation.  This system was supposed to draw images using a marker, essentially translating the image into motion of the pen, leading to a recognizable sketch over time.  Using famous images (such as those of Abraham Lincoln, Marilyn Monroe, Albert Einstein, the Eiffel Tower) the robot could reliably sketch these photographs without significant image processing or interpretation of the images.   The importance of this work is in the automation of exploration, an area important in all of robotics.  The same techniques as those used for the drawing example have now been used for automating shape recognition based on the sense of touch, which has important applications in manufacturing and in robotic surgery, where touch is a major source of information about an environment. Moreover, search and rescue and intruder detection using drones rely on exploration and can use these algorithms.  During the period of the award, several important broader impact goals were accomplished.  Outreach at the Museum of Science and Industry, Chicago occurred in each year of the award (2014-2016).  Classes at Northwestern (at the freshman level and at the senior level) incorporated some of the results in lectures and in problems in homework and projects. Lastly, the work was featured in the National Science Foundation online magazine Science Nation.
