<AbstractNarration>The purpose of the project is to further develop a technology and methodology in "high pressure" metal organic chemical vapor deposition (HP-MOCVD). This involves a method and technology for high-pressure epitaxial growth of semiconductor crystalline epitaxial layers. The HP-MOCVD reactor was designed with computational fluid dynamics to minimize parasitic gas phase reactions and resulting device-killing particulates. The proposed effort will facilitate availability of new high quality HP-MOCVD semiconductor materials that have applications in optoelectronic devices, in particular, the "deep green" light emitting diodes (LEDs). These LEDs have emission wavelengths near the peak of human eye response and may allow for full color control in future generations of solid state lighting&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successfully developed this project may enable the transition of new HP-MOCVD technology more rapidly into widespread use, accelerating availability of advanced materials and devices to manufacturers and the general population. The HP-MOCVD technology may lead to a fabrication process of III-nitride materials with fewer numbers of crystalline defects. III-nitride materials are used for a wide variety of electronic and optoelectronic devices including LEDs, laser diodes, and high mobility heterostructure field - effect transistors for high-frequency applications and Schottky diodes with high-breakdown field for power electronics. Devices developed using this technology also have the potential to form more energy-efficient lighting and electric power management.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The major goals of this NSF i-Corps project were (1) to utilize lean startup methodology to build a business model to support commercialization of technology recently developed at UNC Charlotte in &ldquo;high pressure&rdquo; metal organic chemical vapor deposition (HP-MOCVD) and (2) to develop a convincing technology demonstration in support of this business model. The HP-MOCVD reactor was developed, constructed, and commissioned earlier under the NSF&rsquo;s Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Instrument Development (ID) program. The three primary participants of the i-Corps program were: (1) Principal Investigator: Professor Edward Stokes of UNC Charlotte&rsquo;s Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) Department, (2) Entrepreneurial Lead: Matthew Conway, ECE Ph.D. Student at UNC Charlotte, and (3) Business Mentor: Keith Evans, CEO of Kyma Technologies in Raleigh, NC. The three primary participants successfully completed the NSF i-Corps curriculum during the July-August 2013 Bay Area cohort. During the i-Corps process, a total of 86 potential customers for the HP-MOCVD technology were identified and interviewed by the primary participants. The initial product idea was high efficiency deep green light emitting diodes (LEDs) for solid state lighting applications. As a result of information gleaned during the customer interviews, this vision pivoted substantially, eventually settling on two classes of initial products: (1) lattice matched InGaN substrates, and (2) multi-color LEDs for the emerging &ldquo;smart lighting&rdquo; sector. The i-Corps technology demonstration consisted of growing and evaluating over 100 samples of InGaN and related InGaN/GaN multiple quantum well (MQW) LED test structures. A second UNC Charlotte Ph.D. student, John Krause participated in the technology demonstration. During the technology demonstration, the viability of the HP-MOCVD technology for high efficiency LEDs was clearly demonstrated. A total of three related small business proposals (STTR) were submitted to federal agencies over the course of this program (one to NSF and two to the Department of Energy). Unfortunately, none of these proposals were selected for funding. Matthew Conway is currently employed in the private sector and is completing a Master&rsquo;s thesis based partly on this work. John Krause, also employed in the private sector, recently published a conference paper based on the i-Corps technology demonstration and is preparing a related journal submission. He expects to defend his Ph.D. dissertation in December 2016.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/21/2016<br>      Modified by: Edward&nbsp;B&nbsp;Stokes</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
