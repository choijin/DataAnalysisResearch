<AbstractNarration>Copper Mountain Conference on Iterative Methods, Copper Mountain, Colorado, April 6 -- April 11, 2014. The purpose of this proposal is to support the participation of 20 students and 10 women, post docs, minorities, and disabled in the 2014 Copper Mountain Conference on Iterative Methods. Begun in 1983 and alternating between Multigrid Methods (odd-numbered years) and Iterative Methods (even-numbered years), with substantial and growing overlap in both programs, this series is an important forum for exchange of ideas in these two closely related fields. The meeting will continue to promote the established tradition of a very high level of student participation and to increase efforts to promote participation by members of groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences. The proposal is to support travel and local expenses for these groups, to foster an egalitarian structure with no invited speakers and all talks of equal length, to continue to organize tutorials and themed evening workshops, and to encourage broad representation of participants from academia, national labs, and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Iterative methods and multilevel algorithms are of critical importance for the development of efficient simulations in all domains of science and technology. The conference series is concerned with all aspects of these methods, including traditional techniques of convergence analysis, implementation and development of mathematical software, and use of such ideas in new settings, including advanced computer architectures and new applications. Building on previous success, the plan is to take a proactive role in recruiting students and female and minority participants. This support will have significant impact on science and technology because, for many simulations performed in these important fields, iterative solvers dominate overall calculation time and constrain capabilities. As simulations continue to grow in complexity, the need for more effective solvers becomes increasingly acute. This conference will facilitate the development of efficient iterative solvers and their dissemination to users in industry and national labs. Moreover, the continued high level of participation of students and other young scientists will create and nurture a community of researchers and practitioners who are welcomed to the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web page:&lt;br/&gt;http://grandmaster.colorado.edu/~copper/2014/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This report describes the outcomes and impact of NSF support for the Thirteenth Copper Mountain Conference on Iterative Methods, April 6-11, 2014.  The success of this series is measured by the tangible scientific contributions that have resulted.  Three maor scientific journals have devoted a total of fifteen Special Issues to papers documenting transactions of the conference series.  The series has also fostered numerous scientific collaborations via both planned and chance encounters occurring at the conferences.  These collaborations have led to many publications, and have contributed substantially to the dramatic expansion of multigrid and iterative methods both as research fields and as tools used in an ever-widening array of implrtant applications.  An important theme of the Copper Mountain Conferences is to engage and connect the mathematical sciences community and to continue to increase the number of its participants.  The conference series is notable in its emphasis on participation by students, who typically account for 35-45@ of the attendees.  Most importantly, these students are strongly encouraged to participate fully in the meetings.  Many present papers.  They are encouraged to do so by an annual student paper competition; additionally, the conference offers tutorials that are designed to introduce newcomers to the methods in these ever-expanding fields.   The conferences have made an effort to attract participation by foreign scientists, women, and other underrepresented groups.  The most notable successes, to date, can be estimated by examining the percentages of foreign students in attendance, often approaching half the total number of students.  These signature characteristics of the conference series, of outreach and inclusion, show how well alighed the series is with NSF objectives and how significant its impact is on the sciences community.  The Conference organizers hae always strived to increase breadth and diversity of the participants by encouraging attendance by students, women, post docs, junior faculty, and minority mathematicians.  Also important to note is that the Copper Mountain Multigrid Methods conference series is the only regularly scheduled international meeting on multigrid methods held in the western hemisphere, and the most frequently held of all international multigrid conferences.  The Copper Mountain Iterative Methods conference series is the only regularly scheduled international conference devoted to iterative methods.
