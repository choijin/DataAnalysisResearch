<AbstractNarration>This I-Corp Team project investigates a high-precision (better than 1m in a 3-dimensional space) indoor location technology that uses only existing WiFi signals. The WiFi signal sensors employed by this technology operate independently, which eliminates the need to physically link sensors to each other and simplifies the installation of the technology. The core of this technology is an algorithm that employs clustered receivers to provide time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) information without requiring timing synchronization of any kind, resolving the major technical challenge of TDOA- based high precision positioning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The clustered TDOA localization algorithm ? the core of this system, may resolve the challenges of existing location-based services (LBS) by enabling high-precision accuracy. For the individual user ? the technology utilizes existing WiFi hardware in SmartPhones, and therefore only requires installation of a software application. Widespread use of this technology could enable rapid growth of indoor LBS, which largely impacts advertising-centric services to consumers at retail points of sale.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the project is to investigate the indoor-location-based retail market and to develop a minimum viable product (MVP) to demonstrate a technology, called Simple, Accurate indoor Location (SAiL), that the PI has developed. SAiL is capable of tracking WiFi devices to within 1-meter of accuracy, an accuracy that has not been demonstrated by existing WiFi-based positioning systems. Additionally, it resolves one of the major technical challenges that existing indoor localization technologies aiming at high positioning accuracies are facing - poci-second-accurate timing synchronization of the receivers distributed surrounding the space where lo tracking is provided. SAiL allows a store to collect real-time data about a shopper and deliver personalized marketing offers to shoppers based on their specific locations. Data collected by SAiL can be used to enhance the function of services such as business analytics, proximity marketing and increase customer engagement.  Research has shown that the use of mobile has become a vital initiative for brick and mortar stores. The smartphone has changed the shopping experience and plays an influential role in shopping behavior. The mobile influence is expected to continue to grow rapidly and by 2016 account for 17-21% of retail sales &ndash; contributing $628&ndash;$752 billion annually. Additionally,  research has shown that "smartphone shoppers are 14% more likely than non-smartphone shoppers to convert in store." (Deloitte) This statistic reveals a mobile deviceÃ†s ability to convert users into paying customers.  The team conducted over 90 customer interviews with a focus on retailers and high-tech companies in the July to Sep. 2013 time frame; after that, a preliminary business plan was completed.  From Sep. 2013 to Feb. 2013, over 30 more interviews focusing on a manufacturers and investors were conducted to refine the business plan. The potential market of SAiL is multi-billion with tremendous business opportunities in three main areas: (a) indoor position market; (b) proximity market, and (c) business analytics market. These businesses are waiting for right indoor localization technologies to mature, but technologies like SAiL that meet the requirements do not exist.  A business plan was finalized: to build a market in three application areas:  1) indoor position market; 2) proximity market, and 3) business analytics market, that are made possible only by the higher-than-1m location accuracy that is not possible with existing WiFi based localization technologies:  a)   Hardware is installed for retailers in their stores for free;  b)    SAiL attract consumersÃ† interest to use SAiL by providing indoor navigation like outdoor GPS, social networking (e.g., through proximity tracking to quickly find people one is interested in meeting), and incentives to receive discounts.  c)    SAiL works with retail application developers who are looking for indoor localization technologies that can provide better than 1-meter accuracies;  d)    SAiL owns the accurate consumer location information to grow its market in the aforementioned three application areas.  An MVP is also completed during this project period, mostly by integrating and optimizing the hardware, software, and algorithms developed before this project started.
