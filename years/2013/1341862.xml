<AbstractNarration>This Early Grant for Exploratory Research (EaGER) will support a collaborative study between mineral physicists and seismologists to try a new approach of combining mineral physics and seismology to provide new perspectives of the deep Earth. Advances in seismic imaging of the Earth's deep interior, from global to local scales, are providing structural information about convective and thermal patterns in the lower mantle. Development of first principles methodologies to tackle key mineral physics problems, e.g., thermoelastic properties, spin crossover in iron in lower mantle minerals, and anharmonic thermal properties, are greatly expanding characterization of mineral properties at deep mantle conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal and primary intellectual merit of the proposed work is to advance understanding of deep mantle structure, temperature, and composition with a transformative multidisciplinary effort to directly link seismological imaging with modeling approaches based on realistic mineral properties. The team will address an unresolved central issue in investigations of deep mantle temperature and composition: the subtle effects of spin state changes in iron in lower mantle minerals and potential seismological detection of this fundamental transition and corresponding implications for bulk chemistry of the lower mantle. Clarification of the seismic signature of spin state crossovers is a major hurdle to be overcome in mineralogical interpretations of seismological data of the deep Earth. The proposed search for spin transition signatures in the deep mantle is not without risks, but this unprecedented joint seismology/mineral-physics enterprise will pave the way for future studies of numerous fascinating structures holding keys to the nature of the deep mantle. It will open a needed first-hand dialogue between these communities and enable elasticity data to be accessible online for use by the seismology community for modeling purposes. The PIs of this study have diverse expertise that will help the team to foster a multi-disciplinary education experience at the interface between seismology and mineral physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have initiated a transformative multidisciplinary effort to directly link seismological imaging and modeling approaches based on realistic mineral properties. In particular, we have been interested in investigating deep mantle structures and their relationship between composition and temperatures.  In the last decade, the discovery of a high spin (HS) to low spin (LS) state change in iron in lower mantle minerals has raised new profound questions regarding the nature of the lower mantle. Under this grant, we have investigated the consequences of the HS to LS spin state change in iron in ferropericlase, the second major phase of the lower mantle, on the elastic properties of lower mantle aggregates and on seismic velocities in these aggregates.  We have obtained a result of tremendous significance: the "softening anomaly" in the bulk modulus, K, throughout the spin crossover in ferropericlase causes an increase in K with temperature in the mid lower mantle. This behavior contrasts with that of the shear modulus, G, which decreases with temperature, as expected, without significant anomaly. The combined effect of these changes in ferropericlase has an extraordinary manifestation in likely lower mantle aggregates with compositions close to pyrolititic: it reduces significantly the sensitivity of longitudinal wave velocities, VP, to lateral temperature changes in the mantle. However, no such dramatic effect is produced on shear velocities, VS [1].  Such insensitivity of VP to lateral temperature variations should disrupt "thermal" structures in the mantle between approximately 1500 and 2000 km depths. In particular low velocity structures associated with plumes flowing through the lower mantle should have their VP, but not VS, structure disrupted within this depth range (see Figure). Such effect has been statistically detected by a joint geodynamics/seismology study of 40 hotspots on 5 global models (2 S- and 3 P-models) [2] and also in some VS models [3]. Such disruption of thermo-chemical structure in VS associated with subducting plates at similar depths is also well-known [4]. However, simultaneous mineralogical and chemical variations complicate their interpretation.                                                These results have a huge impact on interpretation of tomographic models. Anti-correlation between VP and VS can be produced in chemically homogeneous aggregates containing ferropericlase undergoing its spin crossover. Unequivocal detection of chemical/mineralogical heterogeneities must include elastic anomalies caused by the spin crossover in ferropericlase in the analysis of mantle velocity structure. This spin crossover also produces anomalies on thermodynamics and mechanical properties (viscosity) [5,6] which should affect mantle convection [6,7].    In summary, our studies of the spin crossover in ferropericlase have contributed with multi-disciplinary impact in geophysics, and the consequences will be unfolded in the years to come.
