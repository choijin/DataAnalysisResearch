<AbstractNarration>In this project, the PI will test a novel hypothesis that eukaryotic cells use wave fringe counting to measure their lengths and shapes. The project was inspired by an experiment showing that strong alternating electric fields disrupt mitosis in a way that is resonant at radio frequencies. The PI will bring ideas from physics, where it is well understood that fringe counting is the method for measuring lengths stable at large scales. The PI hypothesis that fringe counting work cells uses simulated inertia: a method commonly by human engineers in designing microchips and also playing role in biology in the functioning of the cochlea. The larger objective of the proposed research is to identify the meter sticks of life. The intellectual merit of the proposed research might lead to a fundamentally new understanding of cell regulatory machinery. A potential discovery that cells can and do measure lengths by means of fringe counting would open a new chapter in our understanding of morphogenesis and biology in general and can lead to transformation of medicine.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><pre><pre>This was a theoretical physics work on the problem of the "meter stick"  of biology - the question of how living things measure out the many  lengths required to construct their bodies.  This remains an unsolved  problem over a century after D'Arcy Thompson first published his  treatise on biological growth and form.  The central idea behind the  work was that the length mensuration system of life must involve TIME.   The argument that this is so involves elementary physics considerations  of chemical reactions plus the observation that the length mensuration  machinery of life, whatever it is, is extremely plastic and works over a  wide range of scales. The empirical case for the existence of such  measuration machinery has remained weak (nonexistent) for so long simply  because (2) the powerful tools of biochemistry are all slow and (2) the  signals are small.  The research produced a single work: R. B. Laughlin, "Critical Waves and  the Length Problem of Biology," Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. (USA) 112, 10371  (2015).  This paper explained the above ideas and then proceeded to  demonstrate the engineering principles by which reaction-diffusion waves  could be stabilized.  It had been known since the work of Turing that  chemical reactions can easily manufacture such waves, which are  propagating disturbances, like a chain of falling dominoes, that are  powered by engines, as opposed waves of sound or light, which involve  only inertia and passive forces.  But reaction-diffusion systems are  notoriously unstable. The literature on them mostly concerns the  fantastic patterns they produce. Biology can easily eliminate this this  problem by just throwing out all the reaction-diffusion systems that "do  not work". This paper showed what the engineering principle was by which  they could do so and cause the "well engineered" waves to act exactly  like waves of sound or light. The trick is simply to turn the engine  "gain" up until the system almost oscillates.  This particular  engineering principle is known to be operating in the cochlea. It is the  reason that a microphone placed near an ear detects sound emanating from  it. Once one has constructed a propagating disturbance with a fixed  speed scale, one can measure out lengths by echo timing or by standing  wave frequency resonance detection, like a laser.  The latter is the  principle that enables electron waves to measure out the sizes of atoms.   The different in this case is that the waves are manufactors by the  living system itself, rather than existing in the natural world in the  absence of life.  The work then went further to make a prediction that chemical potential  waves of this nature should be present in eucaryotic cells undergoing  mitosis.  The argument rested partly on observations made by others  (including Thompson) that mitotic spindle patterns look like dipole  oscillations of sound in a round enclosure. Cell division involves length  mensuration, and it is very ancient and highly conserved, so this is a  good place to look for engineering principles that work. But the  argument also used the fact that chemical oscillations of exactly this  form had been observed in E Coli 15 years before, and were known to be  central to locating the midpoint for cell devision.  Subsequent to the publication of this work, chemical potential waves of  the predicted nature were experimentally discovered in a eukaryotic cell  undergoing mitosis: S. Xiao et al., "Mitotic Cortial Waves Predict  Future Division Sites by Encoding Positional and Size Information,"  Developmental Cell 43, 493 (2017).  Xiao et al cited the work of this  research as central to the analysis, and they made the case that timing,  not speed scale, was changing when the cell size upon division changed.</pre> </pre><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/10/2019<br>      Modified by: Robert&nbsp;B&nbsp;Laughlin</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1338376/1338376_10251797_1560205877512_laughlin-1338376--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1338376/1338376_10251797_1560205877512_laughlin-1338376--rgov-800width.jpg" title="laughlin-1338376.png"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1338376/1338376_10251797_1560205877512_laughlin-1338376--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="laughlin-1338376.png"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Illustration of chemical potential wave length mensuration in single cells.
