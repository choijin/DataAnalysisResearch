<AbstractNarration>Researchers have developed an immersive 3D video game to teach programming, where users have to use Java programming language to complete levels. This project to date has expanded the boundaries of educational technology in multiple ways: 1) rather than being a lecture-based system, it is a digital game with an engaging plot, characters, and setting; 2) it includes a competitive multiplayer mode; yet 3) the technology is also a full-spectrum learning platform that includes an interactive textbook, an in-game integrated development environment (IDE), automated IDE support, live chat support, and a storyline that progressively introduces complex programming concepts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project would enable providing scalable computer science education to a large number of middle and high school students. Advances in educational research would be made through this project as it explores what it means to provide engaging game-based education on regional and national scales. There is a known challenge in hiring qualified computer science teachers at the K-12 level, and this project could help bring highly engaging computer science education to the classroom without having to increase instructional costs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to improve instruction and interest in computer science education in American K-12 schools using a game-based approach that began as a research project at UCSD.  CodeSpells began as a simple game developed by two individuals on the project, Stephen R. Foster and Sarah Guthals (nee Esper) under the guidance of Dr. William G. Griswold. Foster and Guthals then founded a company, ThoughtSTEM, with a third co-founder, Lindsey Handley. The goal of ThoughtSTEM was to extend what Stephen and Sarah had learned in graduate school to the general public.  The I-Corps program helped the team evaluate whether CodeSpells could be a viable product. With the guidance of our Mentor, Jennifer Arguello, and the entire I-Corps instructional group at Georgia Tech, we had four main goals to determine the viability:  To determine where the students would be doing the learning (e.g. in school, at home, with friends, etc.). To determine who would purchase the software for the students (e.g. parents, teachers, principals, district personnel). To determine the priorities of the students and the person paying for the software.  To determine an effective way to engage students to keep them learning as the curriculum becomes more difficult.   By the end of the project, we had five principal outcomes:  Each teacher, school, district, city, and state is different in their ability to offer programs to their students. Parents are more likely to purchase access to "enrichment" courses of software to engage their children in something more than what the school can offer. School day hours are limited and with changes to curriculum, it is difficult to embed a new area of study (i.e. programming) into the day.  Teachers who have the ability to bring enrichment to their students will seek them out. Engaging students in a popular video game (e.g. Minecraft) creates a fun experience where they can enjoy learning to program, or play their game, with both activities blending easily.   We completed the grant period with a full understanding of the market and began working on a new version of CodeSpells (codespells.org) and a new software that integrated coding with Minecraft Modding (learntomod.com).  The intellectual merit of this project an effective way to teach coding at scale with the help of K-12 teachers or adults who may or may not have coding experience. Through what we learned about the market, it is clear that facilitators of computing courses can not be expected to be expert coders, and the students will drive the direction of learning. Our software will support this type of environment and will be available to collaborate with universities and interested researchers to evaluate the learning effectiveness and improve the curriculum and delivery.  The broader impact of this project is the availability of both CodeSpells and LearnToMod to the general public around the entire world. With over 15,000 current users and over 600 teachers facilitating courses, both technologies are providing an entry-level path to computer science through a game-based approach.
