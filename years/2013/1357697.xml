<AbstractNarration>The current project, Meeting the Challenge for STEM Gender Diversity, will strengthen the capacity of higher education institutions and federal agencies to work collaboratively to recruit and retain women in the academic STEM disciplines.  Through a carefully constructed protocol, grounded in organizational change theories, a national framework will be developed and utilized as a tactical blueprint for: 1) assessing family friendly policies and practices according to levels of demonstrated institutionalization and inclusivity, and 2) promoting and implementing a flexible workplace environment at the level of precision required for dramatic change and sustained impact.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader significance and importance:  This project will set in motion the deep and pervasive adjustments to institutional policies, procedures and processes that will ensure that all STEM faculty, particularly women and women of color, will be represented in numbers equal to or higher than parity with pools from which they are selected.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of the AAC&amp;U Gender Values Program was to develop an Institutional Policy Matrix for collecting and cataloguing evidence-based family friendly policies and practices as a function of levels of institutionalization and inclusivity. Specifically, the project utilized an evidence-based, organizational change approach to produce a survey instrument that could serve as a tool in empowering institutions of higher education to conduct the self-assessment required for aligning their institutional missions of gender equity in STEM fields with federal agency efforts.&nbsp;To accomplish this goal, we systematically categorized several family friendly policies into an Institutional Policy Matrix. Next, the Matrix was translated into an institutional survey, which was then uploaded as a comprehensive, evidence-based survey that can now be easily accessed through the AAC&amp;U website. To date, nearly 100 institutions of higher education &ndash; including HBCUs, HSIs, women&rsquo;s colleges, and community colleges &ndash; have accessed and completed the online survey. Because of the institutional self-awareness that arises from the completion of this survey, these institutions are uniquely poised to fully impact all institutional recruitment and retention efforts that are aimed at increasing the number of women, particularly women of color, in the academic STEM disciplines. As such, the Gender Values project makes available to the STEM higher education reform community an important tool for diversifying STEM faculty.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/29/2018<br>      Modified by: Kelly&nbsp;M&nbsp;Mack</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
