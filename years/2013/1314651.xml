<AbstractNarration>The Embryology Course at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) has played a pivotal role in the training of American developmental biologists for 120 years. This premier course trains pre-and post-doctoral students for research careers in developmental biology in a unique physical and intellectual environment, not duplicated anywhere else in the world. The course is a hybrid between a conference and an immersive training course in the science and practice of developmental biology delivered over a six-week period in the summer.  It consists of a series of invited talks by internationally acclaimed scientists and associated discussions with the students spending most of each day in the lab discovering how the science can be done. Course students, who are committed to teaching and research careers in the field of developmental biology, are chosen from a consistently talented pool of national applicants. Traditionally, a number of students from each year's class move into positions of leadership in the developmental biology community. The course faculty are renowned scientists in the field. Some of the faculty serve as laboratory instructors in the course, and others give lectures and lead discussions of individual topics. The course introduces students to the embryos of a large number of terrestrial and aquatic species including current primary and diverse animal models. Techniques include molecular, cellular, genetic, and developmental biological methods with extensive use of cutting-edge microscopy. Students are challenged to formulate and test hypotheses in a well-equipped research environment under the guidance of experienced research faculty. The MBL provides a unique learning environment, laboratory and support facilities, an animal collection facility, and one of the nation's finest research libraries. Because of its unique nature, the Embryology Course has and continues to achieve long-term and broad impact in the biological sciences.</AbstractNarration>

Over 60 directional cDNA libraries were generated in total by the students, size fractionated, and later sequenced at the MBLÆs Bay Paul Center. Ou...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
