<AbstractNarration>Everett Community College (EvCC) is awarded a grant to acquire a research vessel to enhance undergraduate research experiences for community college students and other educational partners in the North Puget Sound region. This research vessel provides the platform to conduct basic biological research relevant to two local community college education agendas, leveraging new levels of academic and scientific collaboration. Providing opportunities for students to explore the intersection between research and education while dissecting the biological connections to physical and geological dynamics in an estuary represents powerful teaching and learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vessel will be equipped with a drop down bow for beach landing and swing through davit access for a CTD array and sediment dredge, as well as electronic interface for real-time display of water column profile and benthic surveys. The vessel will expand and enhance the research capacity on longitudinal research conducted by students, increasing research cruises from monthly to weekly, while providing greater research training opportunities for more students. A dedicated research vessel provides flexibility to adjust to weather conditions, allows for anchoring, provides shallow water access for eel grass surveys, increases data collection as well as accessibility, increases collaboration between community colleges, universities and state agencies and provides increased opportunities for community engagement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Emerging partnerships expand the research opportunities beyond EvCC, through the partner institutions of the Community College Undergraduate Research Initiative. Ongoing partnerships with local universities, state agencies, K-12 institutions and community partners provide rich opportunities for increasing the sense of place and the connection to the local ecosystem which helps students make more informed decisions about the environment in which they live.  By providing the tools and access, this vessel represents an innovative platform for teaching and training emerging scientists, many of whom are underserved in STEM fields.

Underserved students that may not have an opportunity to participate in research have the chance to do so on this vessel. An innovative approach within the local community emerged by designing and hosting a week long "camp" for local YMCA My Achievers Program (MAP) participants. MAP was designed to eliminate the achievement gap students may face due to racial/ethnic barriers, immigration status and socio-economic factors. Traditionally an afterschool program, the PI and YMCA executive director pioneered a week long camp designed to reduce summer learning loss and to increase interest in STEM fields.

The MAP camp participants reported:  "My favorite part of the program was the boat trip because it was amazing being on the ocean and seeing sea lions and harbor seals." "My favorite part of this program was the mentors that made me feel welcomed." "My favorite part was taking the plankton tow."      The strength and quality of the undergraduate research experience is enhanced by this grant for a research vessel. The engagement of student research early in the career represents a viable, adaptable pedagogical model.

This project represents biogeochemical research where students are not trying to solve an answer that their professor has posed, but one where the student has asked the question and attempted to answer it with real data that they have identified and collected on board.  The authentic nature of the experience helps students analyze, interpret and synthesize their learning and understand the nature of science as they become scientifically literate and invested in the local region.
