<AbstractNarration>The proposal was submitted as an EAGER grant; it seeks funding for a US-Turkey Collaborative research initiative. The application was entitled, ? Multi-scale material and dynamic thermo-fluid computational models and controls for sustainable buildings using efficient energy harvesting materials,? submitted by Ulrike Passe from Iowa State University.  This one-year grant proposes a comprehensive numerical, analytical, and experimental investigation of the domed Harran houses located in Turkey, with the goal of improving fundamental understanding of how these domed structures lead to improved comfort conditions through passive means. Experimental measurements will be carried out in Turkey on some of these homes, and these data will be used to help develop a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. Reduced-order models will be developed in order to implement a proactive control system, and phase-change materials (PCMs) will be incorporated into the building. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This US-Turkey collaborative effort could potentially have a transformative impact on building design in hot arid climates of the Middle East and southwestern US, thus contributing transformative knowledge to engineering of sustainable high performance buildings through dynamic BIM. The PIs also propose an array of outreach activities, including undergraduate students, community college students, and high school students.</AbstractNarration>

Experimental measurements have helped develop a reduced-order computational fluid dynamics model to implement a proactive control system into buildings.  The motivation of this project lies in understanding how buoyancy and  wind-driven natural ventilation coupled with the effects of thermal mass  provide agreeable thermal indoor conditions under diverse outside  climate conditions of high solar radiation, high wind speeds and low  precipitation levels.  Broader Impacts: The work was presented to architecture and engineering audiences nationally and internationally, has become part of architectural education in undegraduate and graduate classes at Iowa State University and will through Passe?s book, Designing Spaces for Natural Ventilation, an Architect?s Guide reach a worldwide audience.  Outcomes: Experimental measurements were carried out in Turkey on some of these homes, and these data sets were used to develop a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. An OpenFoam Grasshopper plug-in for the 3D software Rhinoceros was developed based on the validation of Low Eddy Simulation turbulence models for natural ventilation and are available as architecture design support tool.
