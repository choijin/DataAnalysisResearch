<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;The Automotive and Energy Research and Industrial Mentorship (AERIM) REU site at Oakland University, supported by the NSF Division of Engineering Education and Centers, will engage 30 undergraduate students, particularly women and under-represented minorities, in 10-week research experiences during the summers of 2014-2016. The program is designed to excite and motivate the students to pursue graduate studies and careers in science and engineering. Working with industrial and academic mentors, student teams will work on timely, automotive and energy-related research topics in mechanical engineering with a special emphasis on automotive materials and tribology, alternative propulsion systems and technologies that aim to improve efficiencies at the vehicle-level. The specific topics of scuffing, piston heat transfer, and alternative propulsion systems such as fuel cells and batteries, are of particular importance to the automotive industry and will be appropriate for undergraduates. Students will be introduced to current problems, modern analytical, experimental and numerical methods, and will contribute to timely on-going research programs in academic and industrial research settings. Key features of this program include: a three-tier mentorship program that involves faculty, industrial mentors and graduate students; an ongoing commitment from several automotive manufacturers (e.g., GM, Chrysler, Ford) that includes mentorship by individuals with extensive industrial experience and access to laboratory and industrial facilities; outreach to K-12 students; and learning, networking and peer support opportunities through coordinated professional activities inside and outside the university.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the Automotive and Energy Research and Industrial Mentorship (AERIM) REU site at Oakland University, supported by the NSF Division of Engineering Education and Centers, is to contribute to the development of a diverse, internationally competitive, and globally-engaged science and engineering workforce, an NSF priority. This program will support the NSF mission by engaging a total of 30 students during the summers of 2014-2016 in 10-week research and industrial mentorship experiences that will excite and motivate them to pursue graduate studies and careers in science and engineering by engaging them in automotive and energy-related research projects and providing opportunities for them to interact with professionals from several automotive manufacturers. The program will focus on attracting women, under-represented minorities and students from institutions with limited research activity in STEM, to encourage and support under-represented groups to pursue STEM careers.  The REU students will also benefit themselves and will benefit others from participation in organized STEM outreach activities to local K-12 students. Further, research and programmatic results will be disseminated in conferences and through peer-reviewed articles.</AbstractNarration>

A total of 92 undergraduate students from 64 different universities across the United States have participated in the program since 2006. 70% of the participants were from underrepresented groups in engineering, with women representing 50% of all student participants. Furthermore, in most years, 40-50% or more of the student participants had at least one parent with no college degree. Each summer, student participants worked in teams of 2-3 on automotive and energy research projects under the guidance of faculty, graduate students and often industry mentors, and also took part in other activities such as industrial research lab and facilities tours, meetings with working engineers, conferences and seminars. The primary automotive focus of this program was a natural choice given Oakland University&rsquo;s close ties to and location near the world headquarters and engineering centers of the Big-Three automakers, as well as over one hundred automotive suppliers in southeast Michigan. Our close proximity to so many companies and our long running partnerships and collaborations with many automotive companies and individuals and executives within these companies has allowed us over the years to tap into a resource for our REU program that we felt was often under-utilized: working and retired engineers and researchers from industry. Over 50 professionals from industry, varying in rank from senior vice presidents to researchers, to program directors, to young engineers, have assisted the program at different levels since 2006. These industry mentors have volunteered to assist the REU students in a number of different ways; some provided guidance or materials for the research projects; others organized laboratory/industrial tours, gave seminars, found speakers, or simply had informal discussions with the students on a variety of topics including the automotive or energy industry, technology and career choices. This involvement of industry professionals has been one of the key features of the AERIM program as they bring with them a wealth of knowledge, recent and past experiences working in the automotive and other industries, and are able to provide the students with a &ldquo;real world&rdquo; perspective that carries a lot of weight in the eyes of students.</p> <p>As a result of their research experience, AERIM REU student participants reported that they learned more about mechanical engineering topics related to automotive and/or energy applications, developed a sense of how their research contributes to scientific knowledge, developed a mentor relationship with faculty on whom they can call for guidance in the future, developed their experimental and analytical skills, improved their oral communication skills and self confidence.
