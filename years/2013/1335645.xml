<AbstractNarration>Technical Description: Solution-processed oligomer-based organic photovoltaic materials are promising candidates for next-generation solar cells due to their low-cost potential, ease of fabrication, and tunable characteristics. The relationship between molecular structure and materials morphology critically affects performance characteristics such as charge mobility. This collaborative project, sponsored by the Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer Our Future (DMREF) program, explores the structure-morphology relationship, and then uses knowledge gained to employ a screening and iterative design approach. The project unites computational, synthetic, and device construction and characterization research labs at UCLA to accelerate development of these materials. A tiered computational approach for multiscale morphology modeling of oligomeric donor material is being developed, using a combination of rapid sampling and accurate ranking techniques using integrated electronic structure calculations, crystal structure prediction, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and charge transport calculations. Crystal structure prediction methods sample possible packing arrangements and provide initial geometries for MD simulations of each arrangement, upon which high-accuracy accelerated MD with a polarizable force field can be employed to simulate local chemical properties and disorder. As part of this approach, known first-principles and charge transport analysis methods predict donor morphology-influenced properties such as hole mobility and bulk electronic structure. From combinations of large libraries of donor and acceptor subunits, screened oligomers with promising electronic structures and morphologies are synthesized via site-selective cross-coupling reactions.  Microscopy and x-ray diffraction methods are used to analyze morphologies, including morphology changes due to annealing, and to compare to theoretical predictions. Photoluminescence quenching, transient absorption spectroscopy, and charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage are used to assess device performance. This tightly knit collaborative effort enables feedback from experimental results to be used for iterative systematic tuning of candidate molecules and improvements of computational methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Description: The need for clean and affordable energy demands the development and improvement of alternative energy sources. The sun supplies the Earth with 9000 times the world's current energy consumption, making solar power an attractive option. Oligomer (small molecule)-based organic solar cells are low cost relative to the current solar technology and have experienced significant increases in power efficiency in recent years. But major improvements are needed to enhance its commercialization potential. In a collaborative project, computational, synthetic, and device characterization research labs at UCLA are developing new methods and models to improve prediction of materials morphology - the way in which many molecules fit together - in these devices. The goal is to predict the performance of oligomer-based organic solar cell performance and to accelerate the discovery of new materials. From vast libraries of candidate molecules, the performance of new high-performance devices is screened computationally to predict promising molecules to be used to create and test devices and then improve performance of these devices. This project involves graduate students in diverse research teams to learn and develop interdisciplinary skills. Students involved gain experience in each aspect of the project. Encouragement of the next generation of scientists to engage in STEM careers is being fostered through mentorship of undergraduate students and through K-12 outreach.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) represent an alternative energy source that has attracted significant interest from the scientific community due to low cost, ease of synthesis, and diverse functionalization.  The structures of OPVs make them more flexible and lightweight than their inorganic counterparts, paving the way for packable solar cells, such as "rollable" cells or printed cells on helmets.  In the past decade, much effort has been put into the development of novel donor materials for OPV applications.  The results are encouraging, but progress is not fast enough to support a viable commercial technology.  Transforming almost purely empirical approaches to electron donor material development into rational design guided by new computational approaches is necessary to allow for accurate, rapid surveys of chemical space, which will be an important step toward efficient, accelerated discovery of OPV materials.  During the lifetime of this DMREF award, the Houk, Yang, and Garg groups at the University of California, Los Angeles, have combined their expertise in computational organic chemistry, device fabrication, and synthetic methodology to address the use and design of conjugated organic materials in solar cell devices.  The research has led to new computational approaches and models to improve prediction accuracy of small molecule and oligomeric OPV device efficiency through the elucidation of molecular structure-morphology relationships to enhance rational design and understanding of these materials.  Experiments and computations were used hand-in-hand to guide the development of a new set of trimeric conjugated scaffolds that show promise as donor materials in OPVs and hole transport materials in perovskite solar cells.  This DMREF award has supported the research of three PIs as well as the education and training of several graduate students and post-doctoral fellows.  One of the graduate students is currently an assistant professor at Northeastern University in Boston, MA, and another is a principal chemist at Dow AgroSciences in Indianapolis, IN. Eleven peer-reviewed papers were published in high-impact factor journals, and another six papers have been submitted or are in preparation.  Collectively, more than 20 invited presentations were given at major international and national conferences by the three PIs.  The work on conjugated trimeric scaffolds was recently presented by one of the graduate students at ACS National Meeting in San Francisco, CA.
