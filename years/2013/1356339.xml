<AbstractNarration>The goal of the Marie Curie Scholars program at the College of Saint Mary (CSM), an all-female undergraduate institution with a high proportion of minority students who are underrepresented in science, is to increase the number of women who not only attain their undergraduate degrees in science, but who go on to pursue careers in science. To achieve this goal, the undergraduate science curriculum immerses the students in active learning environments - including service learning, outreach and research - so that they understand the role of science in the world and their role in science. The program at CSM is uniquely positioned to observe, analyze and document trends and effects of STEM promotion with women and female minorities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program builds on best practices from the STEM education research community. CSM is committed to the explicit education of key scientific skills and abilities such as the scientific method, research design and proposal writing, scientific literacy and scientific writing. CSM will build a cohort mentality in S-STEM students through early team-building and ongoing mentoring programming within the S-STEM cohort. A high quality academic program for the scholars will be provided that includes a learning community structure to ensure peer-to-peer communication through both formal and informal interactions. The project will be assessed using formative, reflective essays from the S-STEM scholars that will deepen their understanding of the goals of the project as well as provide feedback to the management team.</AbstractNarration>

Lessons learned are that students who have participated in MC-II have had wonderful research experiences and strong retention, but overall CSM continued to struggle to increase inquiries about the non-medical STEM degree and students have not been able to connect to workforce opportunities, like career exploration and internships, through CSM.    Strengthen STEM experiential learning  Results: All of the Marie Curie II Scholars completed research. Results: CSM faculty continue to integrate experiential learning activities into their courses. Results: 8 CSM Science faculty over saw the research projects of 14. The faculty currently are involved in 12 discrete research tracks. CSM provided funding for equipment, lab spaces, conference attendance.   Improve Recruitment  Results: Scholars served as navigators/mentors in the STEM Summer Academies each year. Results: The Principal Investigator contacted each qualified applicant via email. Results: All students interested in STEM majors met with the STEM faculty, saw research spaces, and learned about undergraduate research opportunities. Results: All qualifying students were encouraged to apply for the Marie Curie II Scholarship.   Improve Retention  Results: Nearly all scholars participated in the Marie Curie Kick-Start and Sisters’ events which were held each year. Results: All junior and senior scholars served as mentors for the younger cohorts. Results: The CSM Achievement Center provided tutors who were bilingual in Spanish and English. Results: CSM provided over 7,000 tutoring visits for STEM classes. Marie Curie II Scholars visited the Achievement Center 708 times and received 720+ hours of tutoring.   Objective 4: Increase Job Placement in STEM Workforce or Continued Graduate Education upon Graduation  Results: College of Saint Mary has established relationships with many local organizations. College of Saint Mary’s partnership with INBRE has been upgraded to provide additional funds for students and faculty, Results: The Math and Science Club meets regularly and has an ongoing speaker series which is determined by students. Results: Job possibilities, graduate programs, and special interest programs are regularly posted on multiple bulletin boards in the science building and in the CSM achievement center. The Math and Science Club executives also distribute information to members electronically via email and their shared Facebook page. Results: STEM disciplines are represented at job fairs hosted by the Achievement Center.  Results:. The Marie Curie II Scholars were given opportunities to visit graduate schools appropriate to their career aspirations. One visit included touring the University of Nebraska at Lincoln’s Biology and Chemistry Departments, Manter Lab Museum for Parasitology, and Natural History Museum.
