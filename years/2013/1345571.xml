<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will focus on developing a cheaper, more energy efficient route to production of important metals including iron and ferrochromium. Economical separation of these metals from their ores by molten oxide electrolysis (MOE) is enabled by the recent invention of an inert anode material. The essential next step in understanding the behavior of the new inert anode in MOE is longer-duration testing than was possible in the laboratory cell. This test can only be achieved at a larger scale. Achieving this scale-up requires the generation, refinement, and validation of new models. The results of this Phase I project will accelerate innovation in MOE; in addition to the technical objectives in of this proposal, the tools and knowledge created will be applicable to faster screening of new target alloys, faster modifications to the MOE cells, and better definition of the requirements of flexible MOE reactors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact / commercial potential of this project is to advance the state of knowledge and industrial practice toward cleaner, cheaper, greener steel and stainless steel.  Molten oxide electrolysis with an inert anode has been demonstrated at the laboratory scale to produce low-carbon iron and ferroalloys, which are the basis of many high-performance steels.  The current low-carbon metals sell at a premium.  Published cost models show that both the capital and operating cost of MOE will be lower than competing technologies already in the marketplace.  Furthermore, MOE can reduce the environmental impact of primary metallurgy with today?s electricity, and produce even greater gains with renewable energy.  In summary, MOE will produce primary metals of higher quality at a lower cost and with lower environmental impact than current methods.</AbstractNarration>

In Phase I, a series of models and experiments were used to reduce the technical risk associated with scaling of the novel inert anode in Phase II.  Additionally, both top-down and bottom-up methods were employed to refine estimates of the capital cost of a production-scale MOE system.  Revised estimates of the operating costs and energy consumption were also made, based on the models and experiments in Phase I.  The broader impact / commercial potential of this project is to advance the state of knowledge and industrial practice toward cleaner, cheaper, greener steel and stainless steel. Molten oxide electrolysis with an inert anode has been demonstrated at the laboratory scale to produce low-carbon iron and ferroalloys, which are the basis of many high-performance steels.

Furthermore, MOE can reduce the environmental impact of primary metallurgy with todayÃ†s electricity, and produce even greater gains with renewable energy. In summary, MOE will produce primary metals of higher quality at a lower cost and with lower environmental impact than current methods.
