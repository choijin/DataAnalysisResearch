<AbstractNarration>Chitons (Mollusca: Polyplacophora) are ecologically important marine invertebrate animals common on rocky shores. They typically have eight overlapping shell plates supplied with numerous sensory organs, which in certain lineages are further developed into tiny image-forming shell-eyes. Chiton shell-eyes are the only eyes known to focus light using lenses made of the calcium carbonate - mineral aragonite. This study will establish how many times, when, where, and how shell-eyes evolved in chitons, employing phylogenetic analyses from DNA for most living chiton species, plus fossils. Chitons are well suited for investigating the origin and evolution of eyes because there is considerable variation in shell-eye morphology that permits comparative studies, behavioral and molecular experiments are feasible, and chiton shell-eyes evolved recently compared to the eyes of other animals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will benefit society because chitons have unique traits including not only mineral-based lenses but also magnetite-coated teeth used for feeding and a robust and flexible form of natural armor that are of interest to the field of biologically-inspired design. Better understanding of chiton relationships will help researchers use comparative methods to study these traits and others. The grant will help develop a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce by funding the training of undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral researchers and fostering collaboration between research- and teaching-oriented universities.</AbstractNarration>

To test the hypothesis that chitons have the most recently-evolved lensed eye, it is necessary to estimate the ages of other lensed eye origins in animals. In Spring 2018, PI Oakley and Postdoc Cannon co-instructed an honor?s course for undergraduates at UCSB where students directly engaged this question via literature-based research.  The students in the course generated estimates of eight lens eye origins across animal diversity, indicating that these structures evolved in the Precambrian, Cambrian, or as recently as the late Devonian. A significant result of our collaborative research has been the discovery that the aesthetes of the eyeless chitons Chaetopleuraapiculata and Mopalia muscosa genes that indicate that they have the molecular components necessary for light-sensitivity.  We published five research papers, and have given eight conference presentations related to this funding.  We deposited data in public data banks (Dryad, GenBank). We made bioinformatics tools available in the Galaxy platform in a set of phylogenetics tools called Osiris, which are available on the public repository github.
