<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to explore ultracompact graphene optical modulators for future on-chip optical communications. The approach is to systematically explore the unique electro-optic properties of graphene, and to greatly enhance the interaction of graphene with light based on novel waveguides and platforms. In particular, graphene in a waveguide can be tuned with anomalous optical properties with a suitable gate voltage, which will be employed to develop the proposed modulators.&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit&lt;br/&gt;This project will systematically explore novel graphene-sandwiched optical waveguides based on the unique properties of graphene. This proposed research will be one of the first experimental attempts to demonstrate optical modulators at nanoscale, and one of the first systematic explorations of graphene for all-optic modulation. The research results may revolutionize nanophotonic technology and on-chip optical interconnects, and will contribute the fundamental theory and techniques for newly developed Graphene Optoelectronics and Graphene and 2D Semiconductor Physics.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts &lt;br/&gt;Graphene is a topic that is of great interest to the general public. The outreach activity, "From Graphite to Graphene", will help STEM education by introducing K-12 students to the science and fabrication of nanotechnology for a wide range of applications. The students involved in this research will participate in nanotechnology development, and the results developed from the research activities will be incorporated into several college courses. Collaboration with external companies may commercialize valuable products for industrial and military applications. Under-represented students from Women in Engineering and North Star Program will be involved in this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Two of the most important devices in optoelectronic integrated circuits are the electro-optical (EO) modulator and all-optic (AO) modulator, which convert electronic signals into high bit-rate photonic data and perform digital operation in the optical domain, respectively.  In order to meet the demands of future information systems it is critcal to miniaturize these modulators so that bandwidth can be maximized while minimzing power consumption.  Recent work has revealed that graphene is a highly promising electro-optic material. However, the inherently small thickness of graphene has previously limited its role in a waveguide. In this project we have realized high performance EO modulators based on graphene by greatly enhancing its interaction with light based on novel waveguides and platforms.   Specifically, we have demonstrated:  (1)  Devices to enhance light absorption by monolayer graphene up to 43% (~20 times) in ultrabroad band (within the whole visible light to near infrared bands).  (2)  Graphene-electrolyte-gold EO modulators with modulation depth up to 23%.  (3)  EO modulators based on ultrathin conductive films, e.g. indium tin oxide (ITO).  (4)  Design of a high-performance beam steer based on epsilon-near-zero-slot waveguide structure.  (5)  Design of a multi-layer graphene (MLG) sandwiched silicon structure for greatly enhanced light absorption over abroad spectral range (1000nm to 2000nm), which is not sensitive to incidence polarization.  (6)  Photonic MOS based on "optical property inversion".  (7)  The dynamics of photonic MOS based on graphene and ultrathin films.  (8)  The operation of field-effect optical modulators working in the vicinity of epsilon-near- zero.  (9)  The shortest electro-optic modulators with waveguide length less than 1 &mu;m and extinction ratio ~3 dB/&mu;m.  We have also had several broader impacts throughout the project:  (1) Four PhD, 10 MS, and one undergraduate student have been involved in this project.   (2) One experiment has been incorporated into an ungraduated-graduate combined course EMSA- 731 (Integrated Optical Devices and Systems) at RIT.  (3) Throughout this work at RIT, nanotechnology demonstrations and hands-on experiences developed from the research activities introduced K-12 students to the science and fabrication of micro/nanotechnology for practical applications. In addition, "Beyond 9.8" arranged tours as well as hands-on activities as requested by teachers and other organizations. Science teachers from School 43 brought their students to campus for tours and activities, expanding upon what they are studying in the classroom.
