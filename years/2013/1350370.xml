<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this CAREER proposal is to develop a novel class of shape-adaptable materials using pH-sensitive hollow hydrogel microparticles (capsules) of specific shapes, and to gain a fundamental understanding of pH-induced capsule shape transformations. To date, environmental control over materials shape remains a major challenge due to experimental difficulties that hinder integration of stimuli-responsiveness into shaped structures. The key task in this work is to understand how shape responses can be controlled by varying capsule geometry, dimensions, chemical structure, and thickness of hydrogel wall. The objectives of this project are: (i) to develop synthesis of hydrogel capsules of various shapes using a layer-by-layer approach; (ii) to explore pH-triggered dimensional and shape transformations in the shaped capsules; and (iii) to investigate pH-triggered changes in capsule mechanical properties and permeability. In this project a series of pH-sensitive anionic and cationic copolymers bearing cross-linkable amino groups will be synthesized and assembled into ultrathin hydrogel films and shape-specific hydrogel capsules. The effects of hydrogel composition, thickness, and stiffness as well as capsule  geometry and dimensions on pH-triggered volume transitions and on the related capsule physical properties, including wall swelling/shrinkage, capsule size/shape transformations, mechanical properties, and permeability will be studied.  Fundamental correlation between complex shapes and physical and chemical properties will be explored using a combination of in situ techniques such as ATR-FTIR, scattering techniques, ellipsometry, optical and electron microscopy, and nanoindentation. The knowledge obtained in the proposal can be used in controlling size- and shape-transition phenomena in microgels and multilayer capsules. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project on creation of shape-transformable hollow particles (capsules) offers prospects for developing materials with novel actuation characteristics having applications for controlled drug delivery, tissue engineering, and pH-regulating transport in microfluidic devices. These structures may have unique properties as compared to simple spheres including shape-guided interactions, a greater stability in flow, and shape-directed flow behavior and cellular uptake. The educational aspect of this project is to develop a polymer sciences program at U. Alabama Birmingham (UAB) promoting learning and research opportunities from the high school through the graduate level. The program will combine elements of traditional polymer chemistry with developing awareness of the needs of the UAB biomedical research community for specialized polymers. The program will have a strong influence on education in the field in the Southeast, with potentially significant social and economic impact. High school, undergraduate, and graduate students including underrepresented minorities will be trained in modern aspects of polymer science including state-of-the-art synthetic and analytical methods and intensive multidisciplinary collaborations throughout and beyond UAB.  Educational and outreach activities involve developing new B.S. and Ph.D. programs in polymer science at UAB and creating "PolymerBridge" to enhance the impact on and to increase the opportunities for underrepresented minorities in polymer science.  "PolymerBridge I" will be designed for 11-12th graders with instructor-developed demonstrations and include hands-on lab work, while "PolymerBridge II" will target high school science and chemistry teachers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Environmental control over materials shape is essential for many applications but it has been a challenging task due to experimental difficulties that hinder integration of stimuli-responsiveness into shaped structures. The goal of this CAREER proposal was to develop shape-adaptable materials using pH-sensitive hollow hydrogel microparticles (capsules) of specific shapes, and to gain a fundamental understanding of pH-induced capsule shape transformations.  Intellectual Merit  We have developed RAFT synthesis of poly(methacrylic acid) and poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) homopolymers and their (aminopropyl)methylmethacrylate copolymers with well-defined molecular weights and compositions.  Using these polymers we have developed synthesis of multilayer capsules of spherical, cubical, discoidal, and ellipsoid shapes.  We found that the degree of capsule shape transition and interactions with cancer cells were controlled by the pH-tuned volume change, which in turn is regulated by the capsule composition.  We discovered hydrogel capsules comprising interpenetrated networks via multilayer assembly on porous microparticles and demonstrated the potential of these capsules for ultrasound-triggered release of encapsulated DNA.  We also found that shape of these capsules could be recovered after large deformations from a concave buckled inward shape induced by the osmotic pressure difference to their initial spherical shape after the pressure difference was removed.  We developed synthesis of cubical and spherical microgels with biodegradable disulfide crosslinks by 'packing' the network throughout the particle volume.  We discovered that the cubical geometry promoted more efficient interaction of microcapsules with breast cancer cells, while particle elasticity prevents engulfment by phagocytic cells in the tumor microenvironment.  We also showed that the particle size was essential for cell internalization kinetics.  We found that that thickness, surface microstructure, and internal architecture of ionic and non-ionic multilayer hydrogel coating were strongly influenced by polymer molecular weight and chain conformations upon deposition.  We also developed a new type of thermoresponsive hydrogels of poly(vinylcaprolactam) nanogel particles for topical delivery of anti-inflammatory drugs.  Overall, our work demonstrates that stimuli-responsive hydrogels hold considerable potential in design and synthesis of shape-transformable particulates with reversible shape reconfigurations.  The multilayer hydrogels of controlled architecture created by layer-by-layer assembly can be imparted with a variety of stimuli-responsiveness including pH, temperature, light, functional molecules and ultrasound.  Our discoveries show that understanding fundamental relationships between the capsule's geometry (faces, vertices, and edges), size, and the physicochemical properties of the capsule hydrogel walls are crucial for controlling shape transformation so these particles could be developed  into novel adaptable materials.    Broader Impacts  The proposed research became a ground for the development of pH-responsive amphiphilic amino-containing copolymers that can advance understanding of the structure-property relationships of synthetic co-polymers, and, therefore, contributes to polymer and materials sciences.  Synthesis of novel hydrogel microcapsules with well-defined cross-link densities and subsequently highly controlled pH-dependent shapes could lead to novel types of ?intelligent? networks with programmable behavior to be used in nanomedicine.  Discovered fundamental relationships between the capsule?s shape, size, and the physicochemical properties of the hydrogel walls could be transformative to the emerging fields of shape-adaptable particulates in targeted drug delivery and microfluidics.   From the educational perspective, the project was crucial in developing a discovery-driven multidisciplinary polymer sciences program at UAB.  This project significantly expanded the existing Ph.D. platform and develop a new B.S. polymer chemistry program at UAB and promoted diversity from the high school through graduate-level.  The project supported participation of 6 graduate students with 4 students graduated with PhD degrees .  Undergraduate students were actively exposed to the research supported by this grant. Four undergraduates  participated in the research activities related to this project and co-authored 4 peer-reviewed research papers.  Students have been trained in modern aspects of polymer science including advanced synthetic and analytical methods and were involved in intensive multidisciplinary collaborations through and beyond UAB.  This project allowed for the development of highly interdisciplinary collaborative research between the UAB Departments of Chemistry, Biomedical Engineering, Department of Dermatology, the Department of Molecular Biology at the Southern Research, the Department of Nanomedicine at the Houston Methodist Research Institute, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory.  These collaborative efforts will continue to stimulate awareness to the needs of the growing UAB biomedical research community for specialized polymer-based materials as novel platforms for therapies.  The results generated by this project were disseminated through 17 peer-reviewed articles, one book chapter, and via 88 presentations given at national and international scientific conferences and three workshops.  Our research was highlighted on 5 Front Covers of the peer-reviewed scientific journals.  Besides education and research, the results of this project work may benefit the people of the USA (and beyond) through development of polymer materials for biomedical applications including targeting of cancers, and development of artificial cells able to adapt to environmental impulses.
