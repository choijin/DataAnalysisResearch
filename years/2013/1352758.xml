<AbstractNarration>The focus of this project is community-driven coordination and support for the 2014 Campus Cyberinfrastructure - Networking, Infrastructure and Engineering (CC-NIE)  Principal Investigators' (PI) meeting. The workshop, comprising over 80 active award activities in the CC-NIE program, will help the community understand the research and development challenges at the intersection of campus networking infrastructure and innovation, and the science application domains enabled. Activities include community engagement and knowledge exchange generated through CC-NIE project presentations from both main areas of the program, including interactive sessions. Key campus network engineering issues are identified and discussed among networking leaders in research and education. Some sessions focus on the applied research and development elements of the program and funded activities, covering emerging topics in data networking such as Software Defined Networking (SDN) and promising research from the GENI project and the Future Internet Architectures (FIA) program.</AbstractNarration>
