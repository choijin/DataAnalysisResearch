<AbstractNarration>In phishing, an attacker tries to steal sensitive information, e.g., bank/credit card account numbers, login information, etc., from Internet users. The US society and economy are increasingly dependent on the Internet and the web, which is plagued by phishing. One popular phishing method is to create a site that mimics a good site and then attract users to it via email, which is by far the most popular medium to entice unsuspecting users to the phishing site. Because of this modus operandi and the damages caused by phishing, it is important to design efficient and effective classifiers for emails and web sites.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, new techniques, inspired from natural language processing methods, are being designed for phishing email and web site detection. They are then implemented and validated rigorously on realistic data sets. They are also applied to automatic detection of opinion spam. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposed research is expected to:  (i) be useful in pushing the envelope of natural language processing techniques, and (ii) yield new applications of these techniques in cyber security. In the past, the PI has been very successful in involving women and minorities including underrepresented minorities in his research and this effort will be continued in this project. University of Houston has been recognized as a Hispanic-serving institution and the PI will continue his past successful efforts to involve underrepresented minorities including African Americans and Hispanics in this research. This research will be moved into the classroom and broadly disseminated through publications and software on the web.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of this project were to create new techniques inspired from natural language processing for phishing email and web site detection, and to evaluate our techniques rigorously on realistic datasets.     With this funding, we have designed several novel techniques for phishing email, web site and URL detection, which are comprehensive in nature and designed to resist attacks from an adaptive adversary, who learns about our techniques and tries  to defeat them.     For phishing email detection, we proposed the semantic t-test, a comprehensive scheme that includes the user in decision-making, and robust NLP features and classifiers.     For phishing web site detection, we proposed a technique that can deal with both traditional and hijack-based attacks. Subsequently, we pushed the envelope with more than 100 new features based on all aspects of a web site.     For phishing URL detection, we proposed to use new features including KL-divergence,  Kolmogorov-Smirnov test,  and n-grams of characters. We also compared online versus batch classifiers, and showed the effectiveness of the former classifiers with a simple class of features.     All our techniques were tested on diverse, realistic datasets obtained from different sources.  The research team (principal investigator and mentees) also organized the 1st Anti-phishing Shared Pilot at the 5th ACM International Workshop on Security and Privacy Analytics, co-located with ACM CODASPY 2018. For this purpose, the team prepared four datasets for phishing email detection along two dimensions: (i) Emails with and without headers (ii) Training versus Test datasets. Nine teams submitted models, which were compared against two baselines designed by us.       These datasets are now publicly available and have already been requested by approximately 50 faculty, students and researchers from over 10 countries in Asia, Europe and North America. Eleven papers have been published so far using the dataset. We have also rigorously analyzed the quality of this dataset. In this context, we undertook a study of dataset quality for  security challenges such as phishing, malware and intrusion detection.     The research team conducted three user studies to understand: (i) how people determine whether an email is fake or real, and whether they pay attention to the signals planted by us, (ii) how people respond to emails during and immediately after a major disaster such as Hurricane Harvey, and (iii) how people react to professional networks versus regular email clients such as Gmail in the context of a real job offer versus a job scam. Interesting and useful information was obtained in each user study.     We also worked on synthesizing new attacks so that our detectors could be made proactive versus reactive. In this context, we examined two different approaches and studied their relative advantages and disadvantages.     We undertook a systematic review of the phishing, spear phishing detection and related user studies literature in the context of the unique needs of the security field. We found that only a few works have paid attention to these unique needs.     Finally, we have created a new benchmarking framework for phishing and spear phishing detection, which we plan to release so that research can compare their work on standard datasets quickly and easily.     Apart from phishing, the team also researched clustering of malware data, and some key problems with impact beyond security field, including: (i) basic problems of natural language processing (e.g., idiom and collocation identification, automatic summarization, and citance-based information retrieval), (ii) the influence of parents, teachers and professors on student decisions in STEM fields, and (iii) a study comparing social network data with newswire in the context of a major disaster.

Moreover, the PI is the lead author of a forthcoming book on Cybersecurity Analytics, which is based in part on this work, with Chapman &amp; Hall as the publishers.
