<AbstractNarration>The NSF Collaborative grant "Graduate Student Training through Research on Plasma-Based Accelerators", has supported the work of 14 graduate students since September 1, 2009 at seven different institutions. Eight of these students have already graduated and another six are expected to graduate by the close of calendar year 2014. This project supports one of these six students, whose scientific goal is to complete theoretical studies aimed at improving the efficiency of particle acceleration through the use of lasers.  Laser acceleration of proton and ion beams from solid targets is a topic of great interest for a variety of applications, including beam therapy of cancer and fast ignition. While this concept offers the promise of compact treatment facilities, the need for mono-energetic beams at controlled energies with modest laser power has been a challenge. The student has demonstrated an approach to controlling the energy of beams with density gradient and laser rise time shaping. The scheme can surpass the scaling of beam energy with the laser power of current schemes.  This final work will address the scaling of the potential height with laser intensity.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Topic # 1: Laser-Plasma Ion Acceleration - RITA a new acceleration mechanism towards better beam quality  Laser-plasma acceleration of proton and ion beams is a topic of great interest for a wide variety of applications, medical isotopes; beam-based imaging for medical and security applications, producing neutron beams, etc.  While the laser-plasma beams offer the promise of compact treatment facilities that replace the conventional go-ton magnetic gantries for transporting particle beams from cyclotrons, the need for nono-energetic laser-plasma beams at controlled energies with modest laser power has been challenged.  We have demonstrated an approch {1} using analytical theory and PIC simulations to control the beam energy and the spectra of the beams by varing the plasma density gradient and the laser rise-time. This scheme relies on the physical effect of relativistically induced transparency to control the speed of the acceleration structure and the cc-propagating space-charge potential and thus the energy of the ion beams accelerated by reflection of the potential.  The background ions are stationary during the interactions and only the trace concentration lighter ion species is accelerated.  This is essential to the acceleration process as the excited acceleration potential is not high enough to reflect hevier ions but sufficient for the lighter ion.  Also, by controlling the concentration fo the trace ion species, the effect of beam loadiang can be controlled.     ############################################     Topic # 2: Non-linear Ion-Wake excitation by the bubble electron regime and its application for Positron acceleration     It is a well-established fact that posotrpm beam acceleration in homogeneous plasma is not a viable technology due to athe force on the positron-beam.  Hollow-channel plasma is proposed solution {2} where the positron beam driven suck-in electrons collapsing to the axis create a usable plasma wakefield acceleration structure.  We show that the optimal channell radius depends on the positron beam line change density {2}.  The bubble refime of electron acceleration is shown in our work to leave behind an ion-wake channel that is a near-void channel. The plasma ions leave the bubble cavity at later times driven by the asymmetric radial forces of the electron bubble. The ion-wake channel is driven radially outwards in the form of a cylindrical ion soliton.  The temperture os the thermalized wake electrons drives its raial expansion.  The soliton-like propagation is modeled uising the cylindrica Korteweg-de Vries equation (cKdV)   driven by the radia temperture gradient unlide a freely propagating solition {3}.  Using  an ion-wake channel for positron accelerationis shown to be attractive alternative {3}.  [1] phys.rev. e 88, 043105; Phys. Plasmas, vol. 21, iss. 5, 056707 May (2014)  [2] phys. rev.
