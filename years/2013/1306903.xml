<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Bruce Bowler from the University of Montana to test a structure-based hypothesis on the factors that control the peroxidase activity of cytochrome C required in the early stages of apoptosis.  In particular, the project will test the role of the steric bulk of residues at positions 72, 81 and 83 of the sequence of both yeast and human cytochrome C in modulating the accessibility of an alternate conformer of the protein required for peroxidase activity during apoptosis. The effect of mutations at these positions on population of this alternate conformer will be assessed using pH jump and conformationally-gated electron transfer kinetics methods, room temperature X-ray crystallography, peroxidase activity assays and binding affinity for cardiolipin nanodiscs. The distribution of conformers on cardiolipin nanodiscs will also be determined using conformationally-gated electron transfer methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The structure-function paradigm, which indicates that proteins have a unique structure designed for a single function, dominates biochemistry textbooks.  Recent work indicates that many proteins can access more than one structure allowing them to carry out multiple functions.  Cytochrome C is involved in both the electron transport chain, the primary energy storage pathway in aerobic organisms, and in apoptosis (programmed cell death) a key process in the growth and development of higher organisms such as mammals.  This research will provide a molecular level understanding of how the transition between the two structures needed to carry out these two functions is controlled in cytochrome C.  Undergraduate and graduate students will receive specialized training in the preparation of protein variants, in high resolution X-ray crystallography and in methods to measure the relative stability and rates of transition between alternate cytochrome C structures. As part of this project, Dr. Bowler will work with the Native American Research Laboratory, the Sloan Graduate Indigenous Partners program, and the Payne Family Native American Center at the University of Montana to involve Native American students in research in his and other biochemistry laboratories at the University of Montana.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong><em>Intellectual Merit</em></strong>: Cytochrome <em>c</em> is a multifunctional protein, localized in the intermembrane space of mitochondria. A primary function of cytochrome <em>c</em> is as an intermediary in the electron transport chain where it aids in the production and storage of the energy needed for life. It also acts as a signaling agent in the programmed cell death pathway, apoptosis, an important pathway in the growth and development of complex organisms. To carry out both functions, cytochrome <em>c</em> must convert back and forth between two different structures. In the structure used for electron transport, cytochrome <em>c</em> has a methionine amino acid at sequence position 80 (Met80) bound to the iron atom of the heme cofactor of the protein. In the early stages of apoptosis, cytochrome <em>c</em> acts as a peroxidase. In this role, it catalyzes the addition of oxygen to a lipid known as cardiolipin, which is located in the inner membrane of mitochondria. To catalyze this reaction, the interaction between the Met80 and the iron must be disrupted to allow oxygen or peroxide to bind to and be activated by the iron of the heme cofactor. The primary focus of this project has been to study the structures of cytochrome <em>c</em> that mediate peroxidase activity and to test several hypotheses about how the sequence of amino acids that make up cytochrome <em>c</em> has evolved to optimize the protein to carry out peroxidase activity.</p> <p>This laboratory has made a number of variant forms of cytochrome <em>c</em> with amino acid substitutions near Met80 in the sequence of the protein. Studies on these protein variants show that amino acids at sequence positions 72, 81 and 83 all impact the ability of cytochrome <em>c</em> to convert from the structure that mediates electron transfer to the structure that mediates peroxidase activity. Studies on the peroxidase activity show that the level of activity correlates well with the ability of the protein to convert to a structure that is competent for peroxidase activity. The laboratory has also characterized the binding of cytochrome <em>c</em> to membrane models containing cardiolipin, known as liposomes. These studies show that cytochrome <em>c</em> undergoes two stages of structural rearrangement on the surface of the liposome that depend on the available space on the membrane surface. To better understand the nature of the interaction between cytochrome <em>c</em> and cardiolipin containing membranes, crystals of cytochrome <em>c</em> in the presence and absence of detergent molecules (as mimics of cardiolipin) were grown. X-ray diffraction methods were applied to these crystals to obtain atomic resolution structures of two alternate conformers of cytochrome <em>c</em>.
