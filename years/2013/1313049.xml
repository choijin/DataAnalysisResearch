<AbstractNarration>The research outlined in this proposal addresses two separate aspects of the water-wave problem within the framework of Euler's Equations.  First, the spectral stability of both two- and three-dimensional periodic traveling waves will be examined.  Results will be obtained numerically and analytically using a nonlocal formulation of the water-wave problem due to Ablowitz, Fokas, and Musslimani.  Second, this proposal will develop methods for the reconstruction of surface waves from pressure measurements.  Building upon previous work with collaborators, this proposal will generalize the relationship between pressure and the surface elevation to allow for pressure measurements to be taken at arbitrary depths (not just the bottom).  In addition, physical parameters that are difficult to physically measure a priori will be formally eliminated from the model without approximation.  Asymptotic models will also be derived and compared with numerical experiments.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Understanding the physical conditions necessary to generate rogue waves or tsunamis aids in predicting when these events could occur. This proposal seeks to better understand these physical conditions by investigating the mathematical models that describe surface water waves. Due to the complicated nature of these equations, techniques such as stability analysis increase our understanding of how waves behave over some period of time. This project will investigate the stability of traveling wave solutions in order to gain better insight into the physical parameters and types of perturbations that could give rise to rogue waves or tsunamis. Alone, this information is not sufficient in practical use. One must also rely on real-time measurements the current ocean state as part of any prediction or forecasting system.  As part of this proposal, fast and accurate methods of reconstructing the current wave-height from pressure data will be identified and compared with numerical and field data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall vision outlined in the original proposal, Various Aspects of the Water-Wave Problem, is an integrated research and education program. Specically, the proposal outlines following primary objectives: (1) to understand how waves may become "monster waves", (2) to explore how pressure sensors can be used to measure waves in real-time, and (3) to promote the integration of research and education to undergraduates at Seattle University (SU).  The research outlined in this proposal addresses two separate projects regarding the behavior of water-waves. First, we have furtherered understanding the stability of water waves.  WIth such insight, we hope to better predict what enviornmental factors give rise to "freak waves" - a question of importance for the shipping industry. In second project, we extended methods to measure the height of water waves using  pressure measurements. by eliminating unmeasurable physical parameters, including the effects of vorticity, and including bathymetry.  These new formulae will be useful both in practice (such as real-time measuring of waves) and in experiments. In corcordance with the objectives of this proposal, this award supported research conducted by 15 undergraduate students at SU. This dramatically enlarged the scope of undergraduate research and opportunities available for all students at SU. For example, support was used to run an intensive crash-course in advanced numerical methods, invite speakers to the SU Undergraduate Mathematics Colloquia, run summer and academic year advanced reading courses, and support student presentations at numerous regional and international research conferences.
