<AbstractNarration>Research Objective and Approach&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is about the development of a new generation of polymeric materials that upon mechanical damage undergo coloration in a damaged area, but exposure to electromagnetic radiation, acidic vapors, and/or elevated temperatures will result in self-repair of the damaged area and revitalization of the original color. The objectives of the proposed research are three fold: (1) development of a new platform of materials capable of sensing and self-healing, (2) understanding of molecular and macroscopic processes leading to orchestrated chemical and mechanical changes during color-induced self-repairs, and (3) property and design optimization that will lead to rapid innovation. The approach of this research will be to precisely synthesize and engineer a new generation of polymeric materials with photochromic components and variable copolymer compositions that offer these rarely obtainable advanced properties. Using a combination of molecular and thermo-mechanical probes we will develop fundamental understanding of processes leading to self-healing. Combining chemical imaging, controllable damage assessment, and analysis of spatial distribution of thermal and viscoelastic attributes of damaged and repaired areas will allow us to fully elucidate the relationship between molecular and macroscopic events responsible for this unique behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Benefits to Society&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the benefits of this research will include many unique applications ranging from multi-level sensing devices to "smart" coatings, and extended lifetimes of materials' original integrity that will revolutionize societal desires. These will include composite structures with build-in molecular sensors, allowing early assessment and prevention of potentially catastrophic events in airspace industries, early detection of corrosion and degradation processes, engineering of mechano-mutable devices, and many others. We envision that these stimuli-responsive self-repairing materials will play a vital role in the pharmaceutical, medical, personal care, electronic, energy, and related industries. If successful, a new technological paradigm through "green" chemistry approaches, with minimal or no impact on the environment creating sustainable material approaches to solve critical technological challenges, will be established. Another benefit to the society of the proposed research will be the development of the highly educated workforce that will tackle scientific and technological challenges leading to the enhancement of US technological superiority.</AbstractNarration>
