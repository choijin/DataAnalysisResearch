<AbstractNarration>The 2013 Maine/Québec Number Theory Conference will take place on October&lt;br/&gt;5 &amp; 6 at the University of Maine in Orono. This conference is held annually, at Université Laval in Québec in even years and at the University of Maine in odd years. By providing a forum for number theorists from New England, Québec, and beyond to present and discuss their research, the conference promotes interaction and collaboration between Canadian and American number theorists.  The small scale of the meeting (with around 60 attendees) makes this a good opportunity for graduate students and young mathematicians to interact with leading researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference website can be found at http://www.math.umaine.edu/numbertheory/mainequebec.html.</AbstractNarration>

The grant was used to provide travel and lodging for those 2013 conference participants who came from outside the Orono area.  A smaller portion of the grant was used for travel support for sixteen US-based participants (including eight students) attending the 2014 Quebec/Maine number theory conference, which was held at Laval University on September 27-28, 2014.  These events provided a forum for researchers in number theory from New England and Quebec to meet, present and discuss their work, and initiate collaboration for future progress.
