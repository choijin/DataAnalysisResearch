<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to develop a computational model that can predict how mechanical loading interacts with other factors to determine scar structure across multiple tissues. A wide range of mechanically loaded tissues including skin, tendon, ligament, and heart respond to injury by forming a collagen-rich scar. The collagen fiber structure of the developing scar is often the single most important determinant of how well the healing tissue continues to function, and evidence suggests that manipulating collagen alignment could improve everything from heart function after myocardial infarction to the strength of surgically repaired tendons. Yet therapies for all of these conditions, from polymer injection into myocardial infarcts to physical therapy routines for tendon injuries, are devised entirely through trial-and-error, because there is no way to predict the long-term effects of proposed interventions on healing tissues. Work under this award will combine agent-based models that simulate fibroblast decisions at the cellular level with finite-element models that represent mechanics at the tissue level to understand, incorporate, and predict the effects of regional heterogeneity, mechanical loading history, and strain-dependent collagen degradation on scar formation in mechanically loaded tissues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Healing and repair of mechanically loaded tissues influences the societal impact of everything from heart attacks to workplace injuries to aging. If successful, these studies could therefore have a broad impact by providing the capability to predict the long-term effects of a wide range of therapeutic interventions in heart, tendon, ligament, and skin, enabling computational design of better treatment strategies. Educational efforts under this proposal aim to excite students at multiple educational levels about studying math, computing, and engineering by introducing them to the power of computational modeling and the role of engineers in integrating the ever-increasing supply of data to understand systems-level behavior and problems.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The overall goal of this project was to better understand how cells that produce scar tissue (called fibroblasts) respond to their mechanical environment, and to develop computer models that encapsulate that understanding and have the potential help researchers, doctors, and others predict how changes in mechanical loading will affect healing after injury in the heart, tendons, and other tissues. We were able to develop computer models that explain three main observations, none of which had been satisfactorily explained by any previous theory or model. 1) First, we were able to generate a model that can explain why fibroblasts always align parallel to stretch when they are making scar in the body, but perpendicular to stretch when they are removed from the body and placed onto stretchable membranes in the laboratory. This research has important implications for predicting how observations made in the lab should be interpreted when developing new devices and drugs. 2) Second, we were able to integrate our cellular alignment model into a more complex model of tendon healing after injury. We were able to explain why some animal studies have reported that exercise enhances the strength of healing tendons, while other studies found the opposite. In the future, this work could help researchers, doctors and physical therapists devise better treatments for tendon injury. 3) Finally, we were able to offer one potential explanation for why the structure of scar tissue that forms after an injury varies from place to place within the scar, even if the mechanical and chemical conditions during formation were uniform everywhere. This finding is interesting from a biologic perspective, but it is not yet clear what the practical applications may be. One hypothesis is that the variations in scar structure we observed could help protect against failure, so that scars with this structure can withstand higher forces. Finally, perhaps the most significant outcome of this project is that provided opportunities for students to learn about research and be inspired to pursue careers in science and engineering. Over five years this project provided training opportunities for eleven different students &ndash; 8 undergraduates, two graduate students, and one postdoctoral fellow. All of these students plan to pursue careers in science and technology in the United States. One is already an engineering Professor, two have gone on from undergraduate study to begin PhD programs in engineering, and one is already employed at a biotechnology company.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/06/2018<br>      Modified by: Jeffrey&nbsp;W&nbsp;Holmes</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
