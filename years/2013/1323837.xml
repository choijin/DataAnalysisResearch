<AbstractNarration>Overview: The world's oceans are becoming more acidic at unprecedented rates, which are dramatically changing ocean ecosystems. Ocean acidification has been documented to affect everything from the composition of calcified structures to the growth and metabolism. These changes to marine organisms at the individual level are predicted to have major ramifications for the ecosystem as a whole. In particular, they are predicted to affect trophic interactions between species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the fellow aims to quantify links between the mechanical properties of exoskeleton and the trophic ecology of intertidal coral reef and sea grass organisms. The Mantis shrimp (Stomatopoda, Crustacea) has been selected as the study organism for this project because their feeding mechanism for smashing hard-shelled prey is highly dependent on exoskeleton structure and function. Mantis shrimp produce one of the fastest predatory strikes in the animal kingdom through a power amplification system in the raptorial appendage that stores elastic energy in the exoskeleton and then releases the energy over very short time scale. Because mantis shrimp rely on their exoskeleton for feeding, changes to the exoskeleton should directly affect feeding mechanics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fellow will study changes to the exoskeleton by placing the animals in experimental aquaria with elevated pCO2 levels and then examine the morphological, kinematic, metabolic, and behavioral changes in feeding that occur in response to the elevated pCO2 treatments. The fellow expects that acidic ocean conditions will alter a mantis shrimps ability to generate high accelerations and forces because the string elements in the exoskeleton will become too stiff to operate. If mantis shrimp are no longer able to produce forceful strikes, then they will also not be able to consume hard-shelled prey. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) is host institution for this research and Dr. Jennifer Taylor is the sponsoring scientist. Dr. Taylor is an expert in biomechanics research on crustaceans, including mechanical testing on exoskeleton and kinematic analyses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: In this project, the fellow will test how ocean acidification could affect the fundamental connection between material properties of crustacean exoskeleton and feeding. In addition, if mantis shrimp are no longer able to consume hard-shelled herbivorous snails and hermit crabs in response to changes in the properties of the exoskeleton, then this could have affect the food web as a whole because pressure from herbivory would increase. The proposed research will lay the foundation for determining whether trophic cascades due to ocean acidification could occur. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The fellow will develop a program to increase the participation of elementary and high school students from underrepresented groups in ocean science in the U.S. by coupling the fellow's research experience in working with educational programs in Panama with projects currently underway at SIO. Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers at SIO will work directly with classroom teachers to create lessons that integrate their research with the actual science content which teachers are required to cover. These lesson plans along with reflections written by the classroom teachers will be available on a website created for this program so that teachers across the U.S. can access successful lesson plans and use them in their classrooms.</AbstractNarration>
