<AbstractNarration>This Cyberlearning Integration and Deployment (INDP) project brings together an interdisciplinary research team from the MIT Media Lab, the Digital Media and Learning Hub at University of California Irvine, and Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet and Society to explore development and use of new types of online tools, activities, and gatherings to engage more young people in developing computational fluency, particularly youth from groups currently underrepresented in computing. The project builds on the success of the NSF-funded Scratch programming language and online community (http://scratch.mit.edu), where more than 1.5 million young people have created interactive stories, games, animations, and simulations based on their interests. The Coding for All project aims to provide new pathways into Scratch for youth from populations that are not currently drawn in easily to technological and scientific discourse and activities. The PIs are designing and refining a variety of interest-based microworlds -- introductory programming environments that are customized to particular interests of youngsters in those populations -- to provide easier and more inviting entry points for getting started with coding, and they aim to develop guidelines for designing microworlds that are simple enough not to be overwhelming, engaging enough to draw youngsters in, rich enough to allow creative expression, and tuned well enough to the interests and prior knowledge of new participants to foster curiosity and learning. In addition, the team is exploring how to use personnel in libraries and other spaces where low-income youth congregate to support initial introduction to and engagement with these microworlds and developing and refining tools to support interest-based on-line hangouts and unconferences, where young people who become engaged through these microworlds can meet peers and mentors to share ideas, form collaborations, and increase their programming and expressive capabilities. The PIs are collecting much data about the engagement and participation of youngsters, the development of their skills and understanding, and the development of their interests, and their analysis will contribute to deeper understanding of needed supports, pathways, and outcomes related to computational fluency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the need to draw in and promote learning among those in populations not served well by current educational practices and important national priorities in workforce development, equity, and the need for a technologically fluent public. The project's tools and activities will provide alternative pathways into coding, increasing opportunities for young people in non-dominant communities to develop computational fluency. The focus on public libraries explores how to use public educational institutions most geared towards serving the technology needs and diverse interests of non-dominant communities in taking advantage of new online learning opportunities. The findings from this research will inform researchers and practitioners concerned with STEM-related learning, online educational resources, equity in education, and cyberlaw.</AbstractNarration>

Ethnography of the Scratch Online Community The ethnography indicated that the Scratch online community is extremely active, and is centered on creative production. The culture of the community is also very supportive, and encourages learning, feedback, and expertise development. The youth in the community participate both in creation and remixing of projects, as well as communicating through the forums and commenting on projects. The community members fall into three categories, those who mainly make projects, those who mainly comment, and those who do both nearly equally. Although the community has official admins it is largely community moderated because the youth take ownership over their community. Beyond developing coding skills, youth in the community use social knowledge construction and feedback to support learning, develop informational literacy practices, and participate in connected learning practices. They also seem to develop strong relationships despite the fact that there is no private chat, which means all communication takes place in public spaces. Analysis of interviews indicate that active participation in the online Scratch community can have a strong impact on the career and future pathways. This seems to be because of the support that is provided in the community, which encourages skill development, as well as the opportunities for being recognized in the community and beyond. For those who use Scratch but don?t participate in the online community, there are fewer connections between their experiences with Scratch and other aspects of their life. Although they enjoy and use Scratch, it does not seem to have the same impact on their broader life prospects. 2. Workshops Research on eight pilot workshops in libraries from 2014 through 2016 provided insights into some of the challenges and opportunities associated with bringing interest-driven and technology-rich programs to libraries.  The focus on youth interests -- like video games and hip hop --- provided a point of engagement for youth. Interviews and observations indicated support for the hypothesis that these popular forms of youth culture could draw youth into STEM programming. What was somewhat unexpected was that many youth saw the opportunity to participate in coding as a primary reason to participate. Particularly in the summer program, youth valued coding and the interest in other activities equally. In the fall of 2015, the participants were much younger than in previous workshops. For them, the relaxed atmosphere of the workshop and the interest topics were what brought them and then kept them coming to the workshops across the six weeks. These findings indicate that, at least for older teens, an interest in coding may be as inviting as the appeal to a popular culture interest. However, with younger teens the cultural content plays a larger role in their decision to participate. The research provided insight into the specific needs and contexts of libraries seeking to offer technology-rich programs. The programs were delivering a new set of opportunities for young people who had not previously had much access to digital media production and coding opportunities. Most participants lacked reliable Internet access, and while they generally had a mobile phone, very few had Internet connected phones. The pilot programs were reaching both youth who an interest in games and hip hop, as well as youth with an interest in coding who lacked  coding programs in their school. In other words, the youth being served by these urban libraries lacked access to the online resources generally associated with "digital kids," and had technology and programmatic needs that different substantially from middle class youth. These findings were also supported by the summer 2016 workshops, which had a mix of younger and older students. The librarians were effective brokers of the programs. The youth librarians had close ties with local youth, and were instrumental in drawing the teens to try something new. With some training and curricular scaffolding, librarians who were not experts in coding were able to facilitate the programs.
