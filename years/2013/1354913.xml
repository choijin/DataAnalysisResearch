<AbstractNarration>Brain plasticity, the adaptability of the nervous system in response to experience, is a modulatory process leading to long-lasting structural and functional changes. Plasticity has been thought to characterize neurons primarily. Preliminary data suggest that glia, cells thought to provide nutritive support for neurons, undergo a new, potentially fundamental form of plasticity: diurnal and light-stimulated morphological dynamics in the central circadian clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). This concept is novel and has not been effectively explored. Knowledge of the patterns and regulators of SCN glial plasticity over the daily cycle will contribute significant new insights on glial cellular dynamics in the brain, an emergent property of an understudied area. Goals of educational and outreach components are to develop and validate effective cross-disciplinary instructional modules involving neuroscience, imaging, and three-dimensional analytic techniques. Emphasis will be on engaging women and groups underrepresented in neuroscience research. Outcomes will include a series of educational materials, presentations, and publications for use with K-12 educators and students and the general public aimed at increasing interest and awareness of recent research findings. This will enhance scientific literacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The scientific issues will be addressed using confocal microscopy coupled with computer-based analysis of glial structural complexity and spatial organization in the rat SCN. This study will advance understanding of diurnal modulation of glial plasticity in two ways: 1) providing an unbiased, high-resolution three-dimensional assessment of diurnal patterns of SCN glial plasticity, and 2) generating new insights on signals that alter glial structure and thereby dynamic cell-cell relationships. Assessment of efficacy of the educational and outreach components will be made in partnership with Prof. Lizanne DeStefano, Director of the Illinois STEM Education Initiative and an expert in design and evaluation of innovative STEM education programs. They will employ a robust goal-based evaluation to validate, document, and disseminate this model through publication and presentation.</AbstractNarration>
