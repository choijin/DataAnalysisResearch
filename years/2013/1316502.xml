<AbstractNarration>This grant provides partial travel support for U.S. students and a limited number of established scientists with unusual financial needs to attend the 19th International Conference on Nucleation and Atmospheric Aerosol (ICNAA) to be held in Fort Collins, Colorado. The intellectual merit of this activity rests in open exchange of the latest research results concerning formation, physical and chemical properties, transformation and cloud-climate impacts of atmospheric aerosol particles. Broader impacts of this support center on offering a unique opportunity for student scientists to share research results and have discussions with an international cross-section of established experts in their respective subdisciplines.</AbstractNarration>
