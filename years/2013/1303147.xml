<AbstractNarration>This doctoral dissertation research project investigates the ways in which notions of sacred landscapes are used to claim territory, and the effects of those processes on human-environment relationships. Struggles between indigenous communities and states over territory, environmental access, land use, and resource management take a number of forms, and are often situated within the growing global indigenous rights movement. Out of these struggles over human-environment relations, notions of sacred landscapes are increasingly mobilized as embodiments of ethnic identity and territoriality, yet the effects of such claims on human-environment relations within communities whose landscapes are reified as sacred remain unexplored. This dissertation project hypothesizes that mobilizations of sacred landscapes, in the context of highly politicized indigenous rights movements, reshape and redefine human-environment relations in important ways. Situated within a conceptual framework that draws on a theory of articulation, the concept of the production of space, and a political ecology approach, this dissertation research seeks to answer the following questions: (1) How are territorial claims articulated with global indigenous politics through notions of sacred landscapes?; (2) In what way does the production and reproduction of sacred landscapes structure indigenous identity and territoriality?; and (3) In what ways does this process (re)shape environmental access, land use, and resource management within a community?  This project uses a suite of qualitative research methods, including focus groups and semi-structured in-depth interviews, participant observation, and textual analysis in a case study in Nepal.  The research contributes to multidisciplinary literatures on indigenous politics, identity and territory, and religion. Further, this dissertation research works to bring critical approaches to religious studies into more traditional framing of the geography of religion in order to advance understandings of the role of that religion plays in human-environment relations and landscapes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the intellectual and theoretical contributions of the research the findings of this project can influence national and international policy regarding sacred landscapes and indigenous communities. The project contributes to the training of students in Nepal who will be engaged in the project as research assistants.  Results of the research will be disseminated locally in Nepal and at national and international academic conferences and via publications in scholarly journals.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this project will provide support to enable a promising doctoral student to establish an independent research career.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Increasingly, non-governmental organizations and social movements, ranging from the local to global in scale, are mobilizing sacred landscapes&mdash;intimate, yet contested and politically charged lifeworlds and expressions of beliefs&mdash;to support environmental conservation programs, development agendas, and indigenous peoplesÆ territorial claims. Yet, such mobilizations often essentialize and depoliticize understandings of such landscapes as well as human-environment relations in such places. The purpose of this research was to investigate the ways in which the concept of sacred landscape works to shape articulations between global movements and local concerns, with specific attention to the role of space in such processes.              While geographers have generally approached religious landscapes by considering the ways in which religion shapes the environment&mdash;especially the built environment&mdash;or the ways in which lived religion is expressed through landscape, mobilizations and uses of sacred landscapes and sites in environmental conservation and development, and indigenous political, movements compel us to think of religious, or sacred, landscapes in a new way&mdash;as "packages" connecting environmental conservation, development, and indigenous political agendas across scales. That is to say, as local communities, often indigenous, work to make their concerns and grievances legible at a broader scale, one mechanism available to them is the narrative and language of sacred landscapes and sites. By shaping localized, often indigenous, religious practices and associated human-environment relations into a globally recognizable form&mdash;a sacred landscape or site&mdash;local activists render their struggles legible to international legal forums and connect to similarly positioned peoples and social movements elsewhere. Simultaneously, as global environmental conservation and development efforts seek traction in specific places, the narrative and language of sacred landscapes and sites evokes a moral responsibility to conserve and protect the environment.

The goals of this doctoral dissertation project are to understand 1) Why did the beyul concept fail to be successfully articulated in Khumbu?; 2) In what ways was the beyul concept productive of space?, and 3) What role did such space(s) play in the beyul conceptÆs failure to enunciate in Khumbu? The co-PI used qualitative methodologies to explore Khumbu SherpasÆ relations with Khumbu as a spiritual territory, how those relations are embodied and performed through everyday practices and rituals, and the disconnections between those relations and local concerns over environmental conservation, development, and indigenous rights. The co-PI argues that the beyul concept produces an ideological space that lacks reference to the material and everyday spaces Khumbu Sherpas produce through practices and rituals maintaining relationships with localized deities and spirits.
