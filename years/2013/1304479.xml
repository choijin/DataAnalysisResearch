<AbstractNarration>This project is developing innovative simulation games for teaching and learning building science, integrating them into existing courses at Santa Fe Community College (SFCC), pilot testing them at SFCC and three other community colleges in New Mexico, and evaluating their educational effectiveness through tracking and analyzing learner data. The versatile and powerful simulation game engine, SimBuilding, being developed supports three types of simulation games in both English and Spanish: diagnostics games; construction games; and operation games. These different types of games will support both traditional students as well as building professionals seeking continuing education to improve their knowledge and skills. SimBuilding games allow for learner data to be automatically logged and analyzed to assist in understanding how students learn through the games. From this information, an intelligent tutoring system coaches the student as needed providing personalized learning. An independent consultant works with the project team on research and evaluation of the overall project and on determining the effect of the games on student learning. The SimBuilding games and associated curricular modules are being disseminated through community college faculty workshops, outreach to high school students and teachers, and at national building and green energy meetings and their websites.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The SimBuilding project was developed by Santa Fe Community College (SFCC), in collaboration with the Concord Consortium to create educational software for teaching and learning Building Science skills and knowledge.&nbsp; Building Science is a poorly-understood field of study, pulling from physics, chemistry, and thermodynamics, to explore how buildings perform--how air, moisture, and heat move through them and the reprecussions thereof.&nbsp; Building Science is increasingly being used to inform renovations of older homes and the construction of new ones in an effort to create a more energy-efficient and lower cost housing stock.&nbsp; As a result, Building Science has come to the forefront of training in the construction and related industries, and particularly has become a part of community and technical college programs across the country.</p> <p>Until recently, professionals building new homes and performing renovations have not been focused on energy effiency.&nbsp; As energy-efficient measures have become more commonplace, and new building materials and techniques have developed, the knowledge base for the construction industry has shifted drastically.&nbsp; A thorough understanding of how air, heat, and moisture move through a building is critical to creating comfortable and safe homes.&nbsp; A new generation of green building, energy-savvy professionals and homeowners is needed.&nbsp; But how do you get students excited about studying the movement of air?</p> <p>Education theory has long embraced the use of computer games in the classroom.&nbsp; Tracing back to the early days of PCs and such classroom games as The Oregon Trail, teachers have acknowledged that computer games can engage students in ways that traditional lecture-based learning cannot.&nbsp; As technology has progressed, games have become more realistic and manipulable so that today an entire generation is as comfortable utilizing computers as they are with real-life experiential learning.&nbsp; This is where the SimBuilding project came in.&nbsp; Could computer games be the answer to bringing Building Science to this new generation of learners?</p> <p>The resulting SimBuilding suite includes two different pieces of software, SimBuilding and Energy3D.&nbsp; SimBuilding is a first-person simulation game where the player walks through a simulated home and uses diagnostic tools, in particular infrared thermography, to determine issues with the home's performance, such as air leakage or water intrusion.&nbsp; In SimBuilding, the player earns points for finding "hotspots" within the home and correctly diagnosing problems based on Building Science.&nbsp; Energy3D is energy modeling software, in which the user is able to "build" a home, locate it anywhere in the world, select a day and time, and see how the home performs.&nbsp; Will it lose energy?&nbsp; Will it keep its occupants comfortable without costing them exorbitant amounts of money?&nbsp; In Energy3D, the user can change building materials, the home's orientation, landscaping, and even add passive solar or photovoltaic panels to see how small changes can make significant changes in a home's performance.</p> <p>Delivering student and instructor workshops across the state of New Mexico, as well as in five other states, SFCC took the SimBuilding suite to community colleges and technical schools to get feedback, which the Concord Consortium utilized to make adjustments and upgrades.&nbsp; SFCC was able to reach several hundred students and an additional hundred instructors through these workshops and, as a result, the suite is now integrated into national curricula reaching many students across the country.</p> <p>In addition, SFCC reached out to instructors in a number of related fields, including Architectural Engineering, Drafting &amp; Design, Construction Technologies, and Applied Engineering, to encourage the use of the SimBuilding suite in more diversified curriculum.&nbsp; Presenting the SimBuilding suite at conferences nationally, further encouraged the dissemination of the software in the green building industry and the professional development community.&nbsp; Further discussion also suggested applying the software to real estate or city planning applications.</p> <p>As a final means of continued support for the SimBuilding suite, SFCC developed and will maintain for the foreseeable future, the SimBuilding.info website.&nbsp; This site is intended to direct students, instructors, and the public to the software suite, and provide instructional videos, related worksheets, and sample lesson plans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>The SimBuilding suite is completely free to the public and is accessible to anyone with an internet-enabled computer.&nbsp; Though a basic understanding of computer gaming is helpful, both games have integrated tutorials.&nbsp; The suite was developed to encourage the learning of Building Science, so prior knowledge is not required, though it is certainly helpful as well.&nbsp; For information, please try out the SimBuilding suite at SimBuilding.info.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/26/2017<br>      Modified by: Amanda&nbsp;Hatherly</p> </div> <div
