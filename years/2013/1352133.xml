<AbstractNarration>This project is to organize a national conference with leading engineering, computer science and policy making thought leaders and exchange ideas on future energy management systems (EMS).  The objectives of the new EMS architectures will particularly be discussed to support the premise that IT-enabled distributed loosely coordinated architecture is both efficient and robust during major unplanned natural disasters, like hurricanes and tornadoes.  At present, EMS software does not have applications that enable electricity users to pro-actively respond to system conditions during such major natural disasters.  There are no tools for fast bottom-up restoration, either.  The workshop will address possible problem formulations for next generation multi-layered EMS architectures capable of incentivizing the groups of users (one may refer to them as the intelligent balancing authorities (iBAs)) to utilize resources as efficiently as possible during normal condition, and be sufficiently adaptive  and flexible to ensure  differentiated reliable service during single/double equipment outages (planned for by the utilities now by keeping conservative stand-by the worst case reserves) as well as during natural disasters (for which utilities do not have methods to ensure reliable prioritized service  without requiring excessive stand-by reserve).  The workshop will explore how the distributed intelligence and the right IT signals with the right parallel asynchronous algorithms embedded into different layers would enable both social choice and system-level performance.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was awarded to organize a Workshop  on Data-Driven Energy Systems:  From Data  Collection to Information Technology for Sustainable Services. The workshop is motivated by the need to bring closer computer science community with the electric energy systems community.  Methods and state-of-the-art have emerged in this field along non-intersecting paths.  The electric energy systems community is viewed as a mature community which primarily concerns physical operaitons of the system. Computer science community, on the other hand, oculd offer amjor computer applications in support of more sustinable operaitons of this system. However, for this to hapen, the community needs to  jointly pose problems of interest, and, in particualr, come up with common frameworks and principles for designing cyber for  physical grids.   Notably, timing for data-driven energy systems has come.   General  sensing, communication and contorl technologies have matured, and are ready for deployment.  One of the major conclusions is that frameworks for systematic innovations of software applications for large-scale data-driven dynamical systems are missing.   Fundamnetal research is needed to arrive on principles for sftware platforms, such as ROS in robotics. This example was mentioned several times as a possible model to be introeduced in the changing electric power industry.  Thsi workshop has helped bridge the deep gaps between these communities and form the basis for badly needed collaboration.  Much more is needed in order to rip benefits of cyber methods in physical grids.  It is recommended that future workshops be held to build stronger  collaboration.
