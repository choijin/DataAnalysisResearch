<AbstractNarration>The KY?WV LSAMP Alliance proposes to leverage the progress and momentum of the Phase 1 effort to aggressively increase the quality and quantity of underrepresented students receiving baccalaureate degrees in STEM fields and subsequently applying for graduate study or entering the STEM workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A collaboration among 9 academic institutions, 2 state EPSCOR programs and diversity initiatives at all campuses, the Alliance was created with LSAMP Phase 1 funding in 2006. The Mid-Level LSAMP (2013-2018) projects the following outcomes as goals: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) Increase URM STEM enrollment Alliance-wide by 15% by year three with a 10% - 20% increase yearly thereafter (1650+ students) and&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;(2) By 2017, increase the 4-5 year graduation rate for URM STEM majors Alliance-wide to 50% of URM 2012 cohort or above; maintain or increase this rate thereafter. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These goals translate to 260+ STEM baccalaureates/year by year 5. These admittedly ambitious projections focus on two key strategies: more carefully targeted recruiting and more attention to the Year 4-Year 5 attrition problem. URM Students with the clear motivation and potential to succeed will be aggressively recruited and their recruitment will constitute an institutional commitment to support their progress to the degree academically, socially and financially. For example, Hispanic recruiting will be more aggressively targeted since this growing population has not been recruited effectively to date. Secondly, the Alliance will target attrition in the fourth and fifth years, the STEM ?Valley of Death.? National studies show that URM students enroll as STEM majors at the same rate as their counterparts, but graduate at significantly lower rates. Key to retention will be the provision of timely effective support as needed based on real time tracking and mentoring (both faculty and peer). Strategies will be supported by effective real-time tracking integrated with campus and Alliance support systems (academic, financial and social).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Effective Phase 1 activities will be continued and enhanced. These include outreach and recruiting, peer mentoring, undergraduate research experiences culminating in an annual student research symposium, summer bridge and transitional programs for entering students, curricular reforms in "gatekeeper" courses and workshops on STEM research career options.  Supplementary funding for student research (e.g., NSF REUs, DOE and NASA programs) will be pursued to leverage Alliance resources and increase participation in the very popular and effective undergraduate research participation programs. The leadership of the chief academic officer for campus diversity has been obtained for this Phase II effort and the program is housed in the Office of Institutional Diversity at the Lead Institution.  Finally, the Mid-Level Alliance will draw upon the experience of other LSAMPs to optimize program performance.</AbstractNarration>
