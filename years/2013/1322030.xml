<AbstractNarration>This research addresses how individuals and groups in the contemporary U.S. measure and conceptualize economic value; that is, how they deploy ideas about worth, utility, and importance. Drawing on convention theory, and using ethnographic (interview-based) methods, it focuses on three contexts where systems of value are in contest: 1) debates over economic contributions of public sector work; 2) arguments over corporate responsibility that have resulted in the chartering of a new form of "Benefit Corporation"; and 3) an experiment with alternative forms of regional economic integration known as "Slow Money." &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This study will develop a model of how actors build consensus around new modes of evaluation.  It uses convention theory - a framework that explores the way meaning is linked to habits, customs, routines, technologies, and standard practices - but extends that framework to focus on moments of contention at the interface of social spheres.  The ultimate goal of the research is to provide grounding for more precisely targeted modes of evaluation to replace the monovalent measures that currently inform public policy.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Systems of evaluation are central to policy formation across many spheres.  Nobel prize-winning economists Joseph Stiglitz and Amartya Sen have argued that new systems of valuation will be critical to our ability to reshape a global economy facing widespread downturn.  This task requires systematic study of economic contributions that are not included in measures of value such as Gross Domestic Product. By mapping and analyzing critical debates over "market value" and its alternatives, this study will offer a model of what is at stake in various frameworks for assessing value and of when and how systems of evaluation can change.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project explored contemporary debates over economic value in the U.S. by analyzing three movements seeking change in valuation practices: a movement to recognize public sector contributions to the economy (the Wisconsin Uprising of 2011); a movement to expand the measure of business success beyond shareholder value metrics (Benefit Corporations); and a movement to promote local peer-to-peer investing as a way to value and support local economic integration (Slow Money).  Using narrative analysis, ethnographic process-tracing, and incorporated comparison, it addressed two questions: how do confrontations between dominant and alternative ways of assessing value unfold across domains of state, market, and civil society?  How are struggles over value shaped by historical and contemporary inequalities?  The project's main outcome to date is a book manuscript, currently under review, entitled: The Politics of Value: Three Movements to Change How We Think about the Economy.   Research findings  1. Movements that were most successful were less challenging to dominant measures.    2. Movements whose participants had strongest claims to economic citizenship were most successful.    3. The three movements each spoke to different aspects of a single dilemma: a changing societal division of labor that has shifted risk from government and business to civil society.  The Wisconsin Uprising and Benefit Corporation movement sought to "rebalance" this division of labor, while Slow Money sought the kind of capacitation for civil society that would allow it to take on more risk and responsibility.    4. Through analysis of the findings, the project developed a theory of value that includes material, social, and discursive dimensions and that builds on prior critical perspectives.
