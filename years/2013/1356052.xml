<AbstractNarration>STEM Scholars - Building Professional Identities in Under-Represented Students&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to increase the number of distinguished underrepresented STEM graduates from the University of Wisconsin-Platteville. To accomplish this, females and underrepresented minorities (URMs) will be supported through large scholarships and high-impact practices, enabling them to be academically successful in STEM majors, acquire career development skills, participate in undergraduate internship experience(s), and to secure desirable STEM job placements upon graduation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this program is refining campus best practices for recruiting and retaining underrepresented students. Innovative practices will be employed, including the use of non-cognitive traits to demonstrate academic potential and to personalize support programming for students, development of a cohort network of support through shared scheduling of classes and shared extracurricular experiences, and a strong peer mentor support system. Additional best practices will include the building of early networks with industry champions, student development that includes career placement initiatives, and building the campus' overall institutional capacity for student success among academic and student services and also industry. This capacity-building effort also will have broader impact implications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project will help creating a legacy of STEM Scholars on campus and improving degree attainment for underrepresented students in the College of EMS. This project is also augmenting the campus' pipeline of underrepresented populations into STEM professions. Finally, through existing and developing industry relationships, the project will improve faculty and industry partners' competency in supporting underrepresented students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of the project include:  Recruit and select academically talented female and/or underrepresented minority students with demonstrated financial need. Create a unified cohort identity that engages the scholars to build a sense of community. Initiate and develop professional identity in scholars. Develop scholars noncognitive transferable skills related to self-efficacy, intercultural communication, lifelong learning, teamwork, setting and attaining goals, and leadership. Support all scholars from enrollment through degree attainment and desired job or graduate school placement. Synthesize existing best practices (such as use of noncognitive variables in applicant selection; development of cohort identity; individualized support programming; and progressive career development) into a holistic approach to degree attainment and desired job or graduate school placement.

[Broader Impact] Use a value-added assessment approach to determine the impact of this program on degree attainment and desired job or graduate school placement. [Intellectual Merit]   Specific Outcomes include:  Retained through graduation. Eight scholars have graduated with STEM degrees; 4 scholars graduated in 4 years, two scholars graduated in 4.5 years, and 2 scholars graduated in 5 years or more.  Retention in STEM. Participation correlates to substantial increases in retention of students in STEM through four years or graduation, specifically:  88% (comparative is 51%) for the entire cohort;  7 of 8 female identifying scholars 88% (comparative is 51%);  6 of 8 underrepresented minority identifying scholars 75% (comparative is 43%).   Successful STEM-related post-graduate placement. Overall, 8 of 9 (89%) of graduated scholars have gainful employment or are enrolled in a graduate program, while 10 of 13 scholars (77%) will have gainful employment or be enrolled in a graduate program by the start of summer 2021.
