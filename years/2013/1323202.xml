<AbstractNarration>Competence and confidence in using cutting edge technology is an important element in preparing highly qualified engineers and scientists, while providing access to the technology for students at a range of institutions is a significant challenge. This collaborative project by Louisiana State University &amp; Agricultural and Mechanical College, Florida State University and the University of Nevada Las Vegas is seeking to make access to sustainable energy laboratories possible for all engineering students by developing remote, web-accessible laboratories. Increasing world-wide energy demand coupled with finite conventional energy resources calls for a portfolio of sustainable energy alternatives and new technologies. Engineering students would benefit from learning about sustainable energy systems but it is impractical for all engineering schools to invest in the complex equipment that such systems entail. Through this project Louisiana State University, Florida State University, and the University of Nevada Las Vegas will create laboratories in: cogeneration, biofuels, and solar photovoltaic systems. These laboratories, and associated educational products in renewable and advanced energy technologies, will be formulated in a common fashion and provide real-time data through a two-way web-portal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The laboratories will be designed for use in advanced third and fourth year chemical and mechanical engineering courses such as thermodynamics, heat transfer, and process control.  Materials will focus on student understanding of sustainable energy practices and alternative energy sources as applications of theoretical principles of engineering science.  The remote laboratories in cogeneration, biofuels, and solar photovoltaic systems will provide real-time data from industrial and pilot-plant-sized facilities. The project will include the implementation of an interactive web portal to disseminate the data, and related background information in energy sustainability.  Students and faculty at participating institutions with have the opportunity to provide feedback to the site developers. An important benefit of the remotely-accessible laboratories is the possibility of reducing scheduling problems that occur when conventional laboratories become oversubscribed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Evaluation will focus on the extent to which appropriate student learning objective are achieved through the remote laboratory format. The approach to assessing learning objectives involves collecting data in the form of pre- and post-tests for each laboratory activity,  formative assessments such as quizzes, lab journal entries, problem-solving results, and other artifacts exemplifying student learning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  We developed several additional (11) learning modules for the study of energy efficiency and production, over a range of Engineering classes.  These modules reside on our Energy Sustainability Remote Laboratory website, http://www.esrl.lsu.edu/.  They can be used in either lab (archived data provided) or project-based classes.  An instructor-only section of the site gives suggestions for assignments and complete solutions in Excel/VBA, Matlab, or Aspen Plus.  A public (student) section of the site gives background material (in some cases, both a video and a document) and a solution template.    Participating universities have used these modules to establish an energy thread in their curricula. There are modules appropriate to classes ranging from the early Soph. to late Sr. year.  Because several modules would require the solution of stiff differential equations or simultaneous nonlinear equations, we also developed Excel-callable versions of CVODE and KINSOL (both from Lawrence Livermore National Lab) to enable easy solution of such problems by undergraduates without access to other packages.  There are now 16 full modules in place, spanning cogeneration, plant-wide energy integration, biomass refining operations, solar photovoltaics, and nuclear reactors.  In this 1-year project alone, the CVODE/KINSOL project was completed, along with modules on combustion emissions equilibria, combustion emissions kinetics, optimal cogeneration plant design, biomass (sugars) refining to chemical intermediates, nuclear reactor operation (2 modules), biological crystallization, biomass comminution and solar photovoltaic array operation.   Broader Impact:    Ten faculty at six universities adapted the modules for use in several classes (Thermo, Intro Mass and Energy Balances, Process Dynamics, Jr. and Sr. Labs, Heat and Mass Transfer), yielding valuable student and faculty feedback. More than 1000 students to date have been affected. The work resulted in a thesis, a refereed publication, a conference proceedings and 4 conference presentations. The original PI wrote a textbook (with NSF acknowledgement), in which these modules provide the bases for 6 of the book?s 17 chapters.  Several of the modules are now accessible through the Merlot Engineering Web Portal, a highly accessed educational site.  What is clear from our efforts is that students want experiences closely aligned with real world ones.  Our experience convinces us that the use of the real-time energy system data and ancillary materials as described above constitutes such experience.  An added benefit is that by utilizing web-based delivery of data, background and assignments, the faculty workload in lab and project setup can be greatly reduced, allowing them to focus more on broader contexts and learning strategies.
