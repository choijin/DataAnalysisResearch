<AbstractNarration>Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cartilage is the smooth tissue which articulates between bones to allow motion of joints such as the knee and hip.  During normal activity (e.g. walking) cartilage cells are compressed, which provides a mechanical stimulus that affects chondrocyte (i.e. cartilage cell) biology.  The mechanisms by which the cells sense and respond to their mechanical environment are not yet fully understood, and the objective of this project is to define how central energy metabolism changes in response to applied compression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our hypothesis is that short-duration compressive loading results in changes in energy metabolism resulting in increased protein production.  This project will utilize a dual approach consisting of experimental measurements and computational predictions.  Experimental analysis will quantify the abundance of central energy metabolites in response to 0-30 minutes of applied compression.  Computational analysis will predict patterns of central energy metabolite expression for testing of our hypothesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Significance and Importance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will improve our understanding of how cartilage cells respond to mechanical loading.  This improved understanding may enable novel treatments for debilitating diseases such as arthritis.  This knowledge will also enable bioengineering of specific cellular behavior (e.g. production of metabolite X) in response to applied compression, which may have applications for the bio-inspired design of new classes of sensors and actuators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadening Participation Activities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Broadening Participation activities will focus on providing intensive academic and research support to a highly-selected population of Native American students.  These students will receive tutoring assistance and a mentored laboratory experience where they conduct experiments and analyze data.  Successful completion of the Broadening Participation Plan will increase the representation of Native American students which will contribute toward a greater increase in cultural diversity in the STEM fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has been funded through the Broadening Participation Research Initiation Grants in Engineering solicitation, which is part of the Broadening Participation in Engineering Program of the Engineering Education and Centers Division.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ All cells use energy by processing a sugar called glucose.  In this project, we created a mathematical model of how cells harvest energy from glucose.  This model was developed based on measurable data from experiments.  When we integrate the model with the data, we learn how cells change their energy usage in response to changes in their environments, or experiments.  We then used this model to analyze cartilage cells.  Cartilage cells are important because they help maintain healthy joints such as the knee and the hip.  When we walk, the cartilage and cartilage cells in our joints are compressed.  In this project, we asked the question: do cartilage cells change their energy usage after compression.  We compressed cartilage cells and measured changes in glucose and its derivatives.  We then used the model to answer our research question.  The results show that cartilage cells change their energy usage in response to applied compression.  These results are important for many reasons.  First, the cells from all mammals (including humans) use the same biological pathways to use energy.  The development of this model provides scientists and engineers a new method to analyze these pathways.  Use of this method may enable future discoveries that allow bioengineering of energy usage toward a specific application.  For example, we may be able to improve a drug by harnessing appropriate types of energy usage by the target cells.  The second reason these results are important is because they demonstrate that cartilage cells change their energy usage in response to applied compression.  Future studies may leverage these effects to repair damaged cartilage and promote joint health.       Last Modified: 05/25/2017       Submitted by: Ronald K June]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
