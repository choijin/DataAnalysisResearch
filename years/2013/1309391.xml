<AbstractNarration>The 2013 TeXAMP Symposium takes place at Rice University during the Fall 2013 semester, with a thematic focus on the intersecting area of dynamical systems, spectral theory, and PDE's. The website of the meeting is http://www.math.utexas.edu/users/tc/TeXAMP/TeXAMP-2013.html. Speakers who have tentatively agreed to participate are: Giovanni Forni (University of Maryland), Rupert Frank (Caltech), Vojkan Jaksic (McGill University), Svetlana Jitomirskaya (UC Irvine), Rowan Killip (UCLA), Alexander Kiselev (University of Wisconsin), Alexei Poltoratski (Texas A&amp;M University), Israel Michael Sigal (University of Toronto). Moreover, there will be a poster session for graduate students to disseminate their research findings. This will provide graduate students with an opportunity to obtain feedback from senior faculty from other departments. We strongly believe that the networking activities made possible by TeXAMP will prove to be a valuable experience for young researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Texas Analysis and Mathematical Physics Symposium (TeXAMP) is a regional weekend meeting held annually, hosted in turn by Rice University, and the University of Texas at Austin. It is intended for the participation of  around 50 people (including 25 non-local graduate students). The workshop brings together many senior mathematicians from Texas and neighboring states, who may not otherwise have a chance to discuss mathematics together throughout the year. We take great interest in the advancement of graduate students and recent Ph.D.s.; they are a main focus of this funding proposal.</AbstractNarration>
