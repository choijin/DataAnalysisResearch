<AbstractNarration>Background:  The majority of larvae of coastal marine species are planktonic and generally weak swimmers.  Thus, they are thought to be dispersed widely by coastal currents.  However, there is accumulating evidence that their behavior can strongly influence their transport: some remain within estuaries, while others make true migrations between adult and larval habitats, even out to the edge of the continental shelf and back. Rates and directions of larval transport are thought to be determined largely by the timing, duration, and amplitude of vertical migrations and the mean depth that larvae occupy in stratified flows. The PIs propose to provide one of the first direct tests of how behavior affects across-shelf and alongshore transport using biomimetic drifters. The study will be conducted in a region of persistent upwelling, where strong currents are widely believed to overwhelm larval swimming and limit recruitment to adult populations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: Knowledge of underlying mechanisms regulating larval transport is central to understanding ecology and evolution in the sea and anticipating the impacts of climate change on marine populations and communities. The proposed research will provide the first experimental field-test of how larval behavior affects the rates, directions and distances of transport and population connectivity in an upwelling regime. The PIs will test three hypotheses: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Residence below the wind-driven surface layer and vertical migrations below that layer keep larvae closer to shore compared to residence in the surface layer or larvae without depth preferences and vertical migration.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Residence at depth enhances northward transport near shore, and vertical migration leads to decreased alongshore mean displacement but increased variance for a group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Depth preferences and vertical migrations have pronounced effects on retention and transport of plankton in upwelling regions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will compare direct measurements from mimetic drifters with observed and modeled cross-shelf larval distributions, and with modeled alongshore transport. Results will be broadly applicable to upwelling regimes along the western margins of continents, and the approach can be applied to non-upwelling systems throughout the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The proposed research will support a graduate student and six undergraduates at two institutions.  It will also provide volunteer research opportunities for college and high school students with diverse backgrounds and for members of the public. The research will be included in college courses taught by the PIs, and will be added to websites and visitor displays at the PIs' two institutions.  Results will be disseminated to science teams managing and designing Marine Protected Area networks through the PIs' advisory associations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was two-pronged.  The biological oceanography portion (based at Bodega Marine Laboratory) addressed how transport of larvae in the ocean is affected by their behavior.  The technological aspect addresses a roadblock to studying transport of living larvae in the ocean:  the impossibility of tracking them. We created a "robot larva" that mimics larval behaviors and resultant drift, and it can be tracked.  Intellectual Merit  How microscopic larvae are transported by ocean currents is no small matter. Most marine invertebrates, and even fishes, reproduce by releasing tiny offspring into the surrounding water.  They typically are weak swimmers while small, and go where the water is going. To become part of the next generation, they must be transported to appropriate habitats to take on adult forms and ecological roles. Whether they succeed has huge implications for choosing the location and size of Marine Protected Areas as sources to repopulate depleted or overfished habitats and for fisheries management -- does larval mixing make this a single population, or several isolated stocks?  Larval transport also affects how fast invasive species spread and how resilient species are to changing climate&mdash;can they move as fast as physical zones are moving?   What if the water into which larvae were released is not going where they need to go? Water motion isn?t homogeneous, and behavior gives even weakly swimming larvae options to affect transport by migrating vertically into different layers of water moving at different velocities or directions.  On the technological side of the project, we developed a novel biomimetic instrument: the Autonomous Behaving Lagrangian Explorer (ABLE) to serve as a "trackable robotic larva."  They sense their physical microenvironment, log the data, and use the data to dynamically calculate the target depth toward which they migrate according to a behavioral model based on real larvae.

In contrast, observations show that they typically remain within a few km of the adult habitats where they were released. This could not occur if they were remaining at a fixed depth; vertical migratory behavior must be involved.  Broader Impacts  To assess effects of vertical migratory behaviors, ABLEs were released at various sites, programmed with theoretical or observed larval behavioral patterns and tracked for 1-2 days.  Several hypotheses were tested and ABLE trajectories were consistent with each.  1. Larvae that remain near-surface during upwelling would be transported SW and offshore with surface waters. ABLEs at 2 m went in that direction at several km/day.   2. When upwelling stops, as denser upwelled water sloshes back down (the system "relaxes,") larvae that remain near the surface would be transported northward and inshore. ABLEs at 2 m went north at several km/day and were recovered close to shore.  3. Larvae that remain near the bottom would be transported shorter distances under either upwelling or relaxation conditions. ABLEs remaining at 16 m bore this out.  4.
