<AbstractNarration>The goal of this REU Site is to engage undergraduate students on a wide range of aspects in robotics research - including mechanical engineering, design, electrical engineering, and computer science - while learning how to build complete systems that are able to deal with all of the complexities and uncertainties of the real world. REU students gain insight into the process of doing research in a university environment, what it takes to be a successful graduate student, working on a multi-disciplinary robotics project in a large research group, and what graduate student life looks like. The skills that students are learning by participating in this REU Site will prepare them for graduate studies and to enter the rapidly-expanding robotics industry, and help the United States maintain its lead as a technological innovator. We are starting to see robots enter our daily lives, and we need students who understand how to put together complete working systems and make them work in the real world. The ability to work as a team, across disciplines, is a vital skill in today's research and work environments, and not only in robotics. This REU Site is teaching students the non-technical skills that will make them attractive hires in any field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;REU students work alongside with faculty, graduate students, and other undergraduates on cutting-edge problems in robotics, with the goal of getting robots to work robustly in the real world, not just in the laboratory. Student projects are advancing the state of the art in walking robots, human-robot interaction, control of complex mechanical systems, and long-term autonomy. More information about this REU Site can be found at the web site (http://robotics.oregonstate.edu/reu).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over three years, this awarded 34 undergraduate students from around the country to spend three months in the Robotics Program at Oregon State University, finding out what it's like to be a graduate student as part of our Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program.  The visiting students joined on-going research projects, and worked with peer mentors, graduate students, and faculty members to make significant contributions to these projects.  The program also included a structured set of experiences, like lectures and group activities, designed to show the students what graduate school is like: how to do research, how to find and get into the program that's right for them, how to talk about your work, and how to pay for it.  The overall goal of the program is to give students the information and tools to make an informed decision about what they should do once they graduate: go to graduate school, or join the workforce.  The students came from all parts of the country, and represented the diversity that we see in the nation.  Many came from schools where there is no opportunity for them to get involved in research.  Several were the first in their families to go to college.  All of them took their experiences back with them at the end of the summer, and talked to their peers about their time in Oregon.  Students who have been part of our summer REU program will, we belive, be able to make more informed choices about graduate school, regardless of whether or not they ultimately decide to enroll in an advanced degree program.  If they do, they will go in with their eyes open, and will be better equipped to be successful.  If, instead, they choose to enter the workforce, they will do so knowing what research is like, and more certain that it is not th path that they want to follow.  In addition to the 34 students supported by this award, an additional 31 undergraduates and 7 high school students participated in the REU activities over the three years of the award.
