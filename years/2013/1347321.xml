<AbstractNarration>This project supports hosting the 18th GENI Engineering Conference, including organizing and hosting a demo session, to be held October 27-29, 2013, on the campus of the Polytechnic University of New York. The Global Environment for Network Innovations (GENI) is a virtual instrument that is rapidly emerging in prototype form across the United States. GENI aims to transform experimental research in networking and distributed systems, as well as emerging research into very large socio-technical systems, by providing a suite of infrastructure for 'at scale' experiments in future internets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;About 250 to 300 leading researchers and Ph.D. students from diverse U.S. institutions will gather in New York to showcase their ideas and results. In the demo session, each demo will be provided with a wired connection to the GENI infrastructure. The NYU Poly information technology department will support both the conference and demo session with high speed and high bandwidth connectivity for researchers to demonstrate their experiments, both wired and wireless. The demo venue will also provide connectivity to Internet2, National Lambda Rail, and/or regionals, thus enabling researchers and practitioners to access all the GENI resources nationwide for supporting their demo needs. Each GEC demo project will be issued with temporary campus-wide wireless credentials that will grant access to the campus wireless infrastructure and commodity Internet for the duration of the demo evening.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The GEC meeting and demo sessions provide graduate students with an opportunity to demonstrate and explain their work to the GENI community prior to formal publication. It is a key part of helping new graduate students understand what is being done with GENI and who amongst their peers at other institutions might be valuable resources. It also supports outreach to new community members, including the emerging US Ignite community. GENI is already being used as an instrument for research. This project supports further development and use of the research instrument.</AbstractNarration>
