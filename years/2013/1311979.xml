<AbstractNarration>The Urban Community Project to Stimulate Interests in STEM Careers (U-CPS) project of Fisk University is a three-year project designed to provide challenging and stimulating learning experiences to  middle school students  by providing high quality professional development experiences for three cohorts of 15  middle and high school teachers through the development of learning modules. Teachers will conduct research by testing and refining these modules and operate as facilitators initially in pre-existing 8-weeks boys' (THURST) and girls' (GUSTO) summer science camps, and then modify them for use in science classrooms during the academic year. The project provides an after-school teachers' training program focusing on the utilization of robotics, rocketry, computers and ICT programming skills in urban classrooms in the Metropolitan Nashville Public School System.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The goals of the project are to: (1) Improve pedagogy among public school science teachers by providing a professional development program for middle and high school science teachers to assist them in developing and integrating innovative teaching methods in their science curricula; (2) Enhance science and math summer science programs to prepare students from underrepresented groups for academic achievement and careers in STEM/ICT disciplines; (3) Use structured interactive and hands-on activities in rocketry and ICT in the classroom to enhance teaching competencies and student learning.</AbstractNarration>

The teachers developed over 60 teaching modules that impacted approximately 3000 students in fifth through eighth grade.  The modules were tested and evaluated utilizing three summer camps involving approximately ninety students each summer between the ages of nine and sixteen.

The UC PS project also provided robotics and rocketry supplies for use with the summer-science camps, middle-school science clubs, and the Saturday Science Academy, for use in teaching STEM subject matters.  The middle-school science clubs, and the Saturday Science Academy are sponsored by the Center for Physics and Chemistry of Materials, a NSF CREST initiated research center.  The Saturday Science Academy consisted of students from public schools who had exceled in math and science courses in high school;  We used robotics and rocketry to further their interests in considering science as a career option.       The developed modules were used by some of the teachers during the subsequent school years.  As a result, approximately 1500 students (many of which were from under-represented groups)  per year were exposed to rocketry and robotics.  Many were very excited and expressed a greater interest in considering S.T.E.M fields for a career.       The teacher participants developed strategies that were used to improve classroom instruction and cross curricular connections with math and science. Teachers were able to develop cross curricular modules that were used in classrooms in over ten schools and three school districts. The curriculum modules focused on interactive math and science lessons with literacy connections.             Last Modified: 04/30/2017       Submitted by: Warren E Collins]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
