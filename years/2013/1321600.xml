<AbstractNarration>Title: Collaborative Research: SAVI- Building a framework between the EU and the USA to harmonize data products relevant to global research infrastructures in the environmental field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is designated as a Science Across Virtual Institutes (SAVI) award and is being co-funded by NSF?s Office of International Science and Engineering. Four US environmental observatories (National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI), Advanced Modular Incoherent Scatter Radar (AMISR) and collectively EarthScope, comprising USArray and the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO), operated respectively by the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) and UNAVCO) are working together with their respective counterparts from the European Union on developing common data policies and standards relevant to global research infrastructures in the environment field.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project goals include developing new understanding through broad harmonization of data and constructing multi- discipline, synergistic data products that have wider societal importance.  In addition, these activities will help the scientific community to better develop coupled models that better capture critical feedbacks and interactions of the earth system.  These models are needed to help make these types of data more accessible to decision-makers at many levels.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Linking these existing programs provides a unique opportunity for early career researchers and students to learn in a multi-disciplinary environment and to benefit not only from the US participants but also their European counterparts.  The observatories will be developing graduate and post-graduate courses and the workshops will seek to include early career scientists and students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activities will focus on addressing societally relevant challenges. Through case studies, ways of harmonizing data will be investigated with the goal of making the data from these observatories easier to include in effective decision-making.   Disasters, carbon and water will likely be the first set of issues addressed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program is creating opportunities for enhancing the career trajectories of a new generation of researchers in Europe and the U.S. The virtual institute is providing mechanisms for exposing early-career scientists to interdisciplinary, multi-institutional activities focused on environmental data and cyberinfrastructure; arming them with new scientific tools to address challenging questions in harmonizing environmental data to help in effective decision making; and showing them how international partnerships can help to solve global problems. It is recruiting a diverse set of US and European students to create collaborative networks of environmental data and cyberinfrastructure experts across these countries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Seismological data are typically gathered for networks of stations that are operated by a single organization. The network?s stations may be specific to a particular region or feature (such as a volcano) or may be globally distributed.  The data from these networks are collected and archived in data centers that serve one or more networks and serve the research community and public of the funding organization(s).  Because each data center may develop its own data access methods, collecting data from a number of data centers for a particular study can be difficult and time-consuming.  Most seismic networks are registered with the International Federation of Digital Seismic Networks (FDSN), which, in an effort to promote the exchange of seismic data, has established standards for data formats. The data exchange format standard has greatly facilitated data gathering from the numerous seismological data centers, but a common data access specification was needed to make data retrieval even more efficient.   The objective of this project was to establish standardized FDSN web service specifications that could be used by data centers to provide data access to users and to promote use of those standards first in the US and Europe, and eventually throughout the world. The outcome of this effort has been a set of four simple but useful web services specifications:  The station web service returns metadata related to the various timeseries at seismological data centers. The dataselect web service allows access to timeseries data from seismometers as well as many other geophysical sensors that create timeseries data of earth observations. The availability web service returns detailed information about the actual holdings of each data center and considerably improves the operation of the federated system. The event web service returns event catalogs (lists of earthquakes) from FDSN event data centers.   These web service specifications were promoted throughout the world and adopted by 20 active seismological data centers on 4 continents to provide standard access methods for retrieving data. IRIS, the largest repository of broad-band seismological data in the world with data from over 14,000 permanent stations is now supplemented by data from an additional 13,382 permanent stations that are kept in these ?federated? data centers. Along with increasing the amount of data that are available through common retrieval mechanisms, this project has reduced the need to keep copies of data that are better served from viable federated data centers.   This project laid the groundwork for federating seismological data centers and could eventually lead to a single request to one of the federated data centers returning all of the applicable data no matter which federated data center hosts them.
