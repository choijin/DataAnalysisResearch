<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the "West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar" that will be held from October 26-27, 2013, on the campus of the University of California-Davis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is the twenty-first installment of a series (WCOAS) that annually brings together a diverse group of mathematicians whose primary research interests are in operator algebras and related topics. Among the topics to be discussed by speakers at this year's meeting are the following: classification of C*-algebras (the Elliott program); noncommutative geometry; operator algebras in solid state physics; rigidity for actions of countable groups on von Neumann algebras; free probability and its applications; subfactors and their invariants; applications to geometric group theory; topological dynamics; K-theory and representation theory; quantum groups. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A very successful meeting of the West Coast Operator Algebra Seminar was held at UC Davis.  Several workshops on projects initiated at the meeting were subsequently held, with participants supported by residual funds.  The meeting emphasized the areas of mathematics which will gain from applying operator algebras in new and creative ways.    Two workshops on Operator Theory and Noncommutative Geometry was held, with principal speakers being Ron Douglas of Texas A&amp;M and Xiang Tang of Washington University, St. Louis.  Another workshop on Noncommutative Geomety and Harmonic Analysis was held.  In this one the main speakers were John Roe of Penn State University and Rufus Willett of the University of Hawaii at Manoa.  Both were very useful and many people from the math department at UC Davis attended.  Many were not in precisely this area which was part of the goals of the program.  Operator algebras and noncommutative geometry have recently been used in the study of topological insulators in physics.  They provide, throught the use of K-theory and index theory of elliptic operators, the tools for a surprising way of classifying topological states of matter.  The interactions with condensed matter physics continues to be an area of strong activity and many successes.
