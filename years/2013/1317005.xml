<AbstractNarration>This action funds John Pardo of Penn State University to conduct a research project in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST) in Nomi, Ishikawa Prefecture in Japan.  The project title is "Classifying the Theoretical Strength of Ramsey's Theory." The host scientists are Drs. Mizuhito Ogawa and Keita Yokoyama.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project extends current research in the area of Reverse Mathematics regarding combinatorial principles and specifically Ramsey's Theory for pairs.  In general, Reverse Mathematics is a program which focuses on classifying the proof-theoretic strength of mathematical theorems from all area of mathematics as subsystems of second-order arithmetic; interestingly it is the case that a large number of theorems fall into one of five major such subsystems known as "the big five", however many of the known exceptions to this are combinatorial principles - the goal is to advance what is known about Ramsey's Theory for pairs.  Dr. Yokoyama has had significant success in this area before using model theoretic methods, in particular relating to approaches used in non-standard analysis, so this research begins work with these techniques in mind as well as considering proof-theoretic and recursion-theoretic methods in the work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, this collaboration will strengthen the connection between mathematical researchers at Penn State and JAIST.  Ideally this bond will continue to grow in the future and ultimately culminate in many additional collaborations that would have otherwise not existed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Reverse mathematics is an area of mathematics that focuses on proof-theoretically classifying various mathematical theorems as subsystems of second-order arithmetic.  In other words, a reverse mathematician takes well known results and determines what axioms are required to prove those results, as well as what axioms those results themselves imply: in this way many astonishing connections between different areas of mathematics have been discovered.  For examples, take G&ouml;del's Completeness Theorem, Brouwer's Fixed Point Theorem, and the local existence theorem for solutions of ordinary differential equations.  At first glance these results look very different, but they each entail an essential notion of compactness in their proofs and in fact it turns out that these results are all equivalent (over a standard basic axiom system) to an axiom known as Weak K&ouml;nig's Lemma.  In the technical sense this means that Weak K&ouml;nig's Lemma is proved by each of these results and proves each of these results, but at a deeper level it means that all these theorems are the same mathematical idea manifested in different contexts - finding and understanding these sorts of connections is the thing that drives mathematicians.  As it turns out there are five subsystems of second-order arithmetic known as the "big five" such that a large number of known mathematical theorems are equivalent to one of these five axiom systems; it is thus interesting for mathematicians to find `counterexamples' to the big five, i.e. results that are not equivalent to any of them.  It has turned out that many counterexamples have been found in the form of combinatorial principles, so reverse mathematicians are particularly interested in looking at famous combinatorial theorems as of late.  Ramsey's Theorem and its many versions are famous combinatorial results regarding colorings of sets of natural numbers and so have been a focus of reverse mathematicians.  Although much is known about Ramsey's Theorem in reverse mathematics, there are still rich results to be developed studying it.  My host and I focused our attention this summer first on what is known on the topic already and have now moved on to look at some open questions; for example we have been looking recently at variations of versions of Ramsey's Theorem that deal with classes of partial colorings (versus just considering normal colorings).  Although we are not currently prepared to publish our findings we are confident that our work will yield interesting results.  Because of the all-encompassing nature of reverse mathematics it is very plausible that our work will have significant consequences in many other areas of mathematics, which could ultimately lead to collaborations with many researchers in other areas.
