<AbstractNarration>The Plains Elevated Convection At Night (PECAN) experiment will investigate the evolution of nocturnal mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) and convection and their interactions with the evolving nocturnal stable boundary layer (SBL) environment. This proposal addresses two primary goals of PECAN: 1) To characterize the transition from surface-based to elevated nocturnal MCS structure and the interaction of cold pools generated by MCSs with the nocturnal SBL, and 2) to determine how the organization and evolution of surface-based and elevated MCSs are influenced by the stable boundary layer and the vertical profile of wind and stability above the nocturnal low-level jet (NLLJ). To rectify the present paucity of detailed, integrated observations of nocturnal MCSs and their SBL environments, the project will observe nocturnal MCSs and convection with mobile ground-based radars, mobile sounding systems, and mobile mesonets in concert with other ground-based and airborne observing platforms during PECAN. Multi-radar syntheses, data assimilation, and modeling will provide the integrated analyses of these combined observations to evaluate the detailed internal structure of nocturnal MCSs and the impact of static stability, pre-existing boundaries, and wind shear on nocturnal MCS evolution processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;This project emphasizes the tightly coordinated observation of nocturnal MCSs and their SBL environments with an array of multiple mobile Doppler and dual-polarimetric radars in conjunction with mobile soundings and surface in situ observing systems. These observations will be integrated to obtain 3-D airflow syntheses, precipitation fields, and thermal structure of MCSs and newly initiated convection and their environments. Mobile radars are essential as they can provide enhanced temporal and spatial resolution and low-level observations over any area within the PECAN domain. C-band radars, with their ability to both penetrate heavy precipitation and sense clear-air inflow, are required. The mobile C- and X-band dual-polarimetric radars will provide microphysical information beyond the typical operating ranges and below base-scan altitudes of the polarimetric WSR-88D radars. The mobile sounding and surface observations complement the radar wind measurements by providing unique buoyancy and shear profiles both within and outside of precipitation, thus resolving internal MCS dynamics and characterizing the SBL environment that interacts with the MCSs. These data, in combination with other PECAN data from fixed and mobile ground-based radar, profilers, mesonets, and aircraft, are essential for interpreting nocturnal MCS evolution with respect to in situ environmental conditions and for providing input and validation of cloud dynamical-microphysical model simulations of MCSs. The scientific objectives of this project are to: (i) document the internal structure and evolution of nocturnal MCSs and convection; (ii) establish the environmental ingredients and related physical mechanisms that control nocturnal MCS evolution; and (iii) test hypotheses concerning MCS dynamical microphysical forcing and MCS-environment interactions within detailed cloud-resolving models. The research conducted here will advance fundamental knowledge of the internal MCS dynamics and interactions with the SBL and will enable better representations of both within cloud-resolving models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;Characterizing the morphology of nocturnal MCSs and the vertical profiles of temperature, humidity and winds ahead of and near the convective region in the cold pool are essential to helping improve the specificity and accuracy of diagnoses and short-term predictions of the geographical extent and duration of severe weather, heavy rainfall, flash flooding, and aircraft icing conditions. Additionally, these PECAN field observations will be essential for refining data assimilation systems and improving future operational numerical predictions of nocturnal MCSs and their SBL environments. The datasets collected here will also be used in university classes through graduate level. Several undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in the execution of a large atmospheric field campaign by being integrated into the data collection and post-field phase analysis. Lastly, the data collected here will be made available to other NSF and NOAA investigators identified as part of the PECAN project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was focused on collecting and analyzing data, and using that information along with numerical models of the atmosphere, to better understand the commonly observed storm systems that occur overnight and affect the central United States in the summer.  The field project, known as Plains Elevated Convection At Night (PECAN), took place during June-July 2015, based in Hays, Kansas. Observation platforms involved in the project included research aircraft, fixed and mobile radars, and a wide variety of instruments to measure the vertical structure of the atmosphere. Our group focused on launching balloon-borne instrument packages (known as radiosondes) to measure the atmospheric profile in a variety of conditions, with special attention to the environments before and after the passage of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs).   MCSs are lines or clusters of thunderstorms that provide a large fraction of the summer rainfall in the central US, and often occur overnight.  Yet relatively little field research has been done to characterize these systems, in part because of the difficulty of collecting observations at night.  PECAN was the first project to have its primary objectives aimed at observing and understanding these nocturnal systems.  Between the groups associated with our collaborative grant, we collected over 230 soundings (vertical profiles of the atmosphere), launched from highly mobile vehicles. (During PECAN as a whole, approximately 1500 soundings were taken.)  Routinely, such soundings are only observed twice per day at widely spaced locations; the PECAN observations were taken at unprecedented frequency and with much higher spatial density.  One key result that emerged from these observations was found during an MCS on 24-25 June 2015 in Iowa. In comparing the PECAN sounding observations with the information used by operational forecasters (which only incorporated the widely spaced routine observations), we found that the operational analysis did not accurately represent the rapid increase in moisture that occurred in Iowa that night. All forecast models predicted a heavily raining MCS to occur in Iowa that night, but they all predicted it to occur 100-300 km farther north than where it actually occurred.  Our research showed that these two findings were connected: because the models were too dry (i.e., they did not show sufficient water vapor), they required air to be lifted for longer over the surface front, and thus they predicted the storms to be too far to the north.  All models we examined predicted the MCS to be too far north (and had too little low-level moisture), but those with more low-level moisture (i.e., were closer to the moisture profile in the special PECAN soundings) also had the MCS closer to the observed location.  We then undertook a bigger-picture analysis of the unprecedented sounding dataset that was collected in the environments of nocturnal MCSs during PECAN.  For soundings in the pre-storm environment, we identified three primary categories of profiles: profiles with unstable air that was elevated (located above the ground) and had a low-level wind maximum; profiles that also had a low-level wind maximum but maintained a more daytime-like profile even well after sunset, and those with only weak winds at low levels. The first type fits the conventional conceptual model for nighttime thunderstorms, whereas the other two types represent situations different from those generally analyzed in past research.  For soundings taken in convection or after its passage, the profiles were highly variable, but nearly all cases showed evidence of a convectively generated cold pool.  Some cases had strong cold pools, as are typically seen in squall lines (with temperature deficits of over 9 K).  But others had weak cold pools, or cold pools that were strongest above the ground.  These situations had been hypothesized to occur in nighttime thunderstorms but had never been observed in as much detail as they were in PECAN.  The results of our project, in conjunction with the studies conducted by other research groups involved in PECAN, represent new knowledge about how the storms that produce a large fraction of the rainfall in the central US function.  The results were disseminated to the scientific community via technical conferences and several journal articles. The findings were also presented to operational forecast centers, were included in training modules for National Weather Service forecasters, and are being incorporated into forecast models to better predict these systems and the high-impact weather they can produce. This project fully supported the research and education of one student to the completion of her PhD, and also allowed several other students to participate in the successful execution of a field research campaign. The project also led to numerous opportunities for public education and outreach, both informally as part of the field campaign, and formally through the production of the NSF-sponsored series "When Nature Strikes", which is designed for classroom and public use.
