<AbstractNarration>INTELECTUAL MERIT: The investigators will follow-up on their discovery of significant accumulation of silicon by marine picocyanobacteria of the genus Synechococcus to assess the contribution of these organisms to the cycling of biogenic silica in the ocean. Oceanographers have long assumed that diatoms are the dominant marine organisms controlling the cycling of silica in the ocean. Recently, however, single-cell analyses of picocyanobacterial cells from field samples surprisingly revealed the presence of substantial amounts of silicon within Synechococcus. The contribution of Synechococcus to biogenic silica often rivaled that of living diatoms in the two systems examined. Moreover, size fractionation of biogenic silica indicates that up to 25% of biogenic silica can exist in the picoplanktonic size fraction. Given that picocyanobacteria dominate phytoplankton biomass and primary production over much of the world?s ocean, these findings raise significant questions about the factors controlling the marine silica cycle globally, as well as the proper interpretation of biogenic silica measurements, Si: N ratios in particulate matter, and ratios of silicate and nitrate depletion. It also suggests that picocyanobacterial populations may be subject to previously unknown constraints on their productivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have both laboratory and field components. Because cellular Si varies substantially among the field-collected samples and laboratory strains so far analyzed, the laboratory component will document variability in Si uptake and cellular Si concentrations, while determining what role physiological and phylogenetic factors play in this variability.  The investigators will use strains of Synechococcus for which there are already genome sequences. Laboratory experiments will 1) use 32Si radiotracer uptake experiments to assess the degree of variability in Si content and Si uptake kinetics among strains of Synechococcus acclimated to different levels of silicate, 2) characterize the intracellular distribution and chemistry of silicon within cells using fractionation techniques, density centrifugation, electron microscopy and x-ray absorption spectroscopy, and 3) use bioinformatic analyses of published genomes to determine whether uptake of Si can be predicted based on phylogenetic relationships, to identify candidate genes involved in cyanobacterial Si metabolism, and to develop probes for community structure that can be related to cellular Si content. Field work at the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series (BATS) site will assess the contribution of Synechococcus and diatoms to total biogenic silica in surface waters at times of the year when the former are typically dominant. Field measurements will include size fractionation of biogenic silica biomass and Si uptake, and synchrotron-based x-ray fluorescence microscopy, and the phylogenetic composition of the Synechococcus assemblage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACTS: This project has the potential to drive a major paradigm shift in our understanding of the marine silicon cycle. In addition, one PhD student will be trained at Stony Brook. Each PI will provide research experience to a number of undergraduates working on original research projects for credit, as a part of an REU program or as the basis for undergraduate theses. Stony Brook research programs for undergraduates are supported with summer research money from the Undergraduate Research and Creative Activities (URECA) program, and draw on its very diverse student body. The investigators will also engage promising high school level students through several residential programs that the PIs have been a part of in the past. These include the BLOOM program at Bigelow and the Simons Summer Research Fellowship Program at Stony Brook. The PI has continuing relationship with a regional high school (Brentwood) with a high proportion of underrepresented minorities. PI Twining is involved in the Caf√© Scientifique program at Bigelow. Baines will engage in similar outreach through the Center for Science and Mathematics Education (CESAME) sponsored Open Science Nights. Finally, PI Baines will cooperate with CESAMEs teacher education programs, with the aim of incorporating biological oceanography into K-12 curricula. PIs Krause and Brzezinski will incorporate aspects of phytoplankton ecology into UCSB's Oceans to Classroom Program that brings marine research at UCSB to life for over 18,000 K-12 students each year.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  As part of a broader collaborative project with investigators from Stony Brook University and the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences, the Dauphin Island Sea Lab and University of California Santa Barbara team confirmed the presence of significant amounts of Silicon in picocyanobacteria through a series of laboratory experiments and field observation.  The previously-unknown occurrence of Silicon (Si) in these organisms fundamentally changes our assumption regarding which phytoplankton groups contribute to the biological cycling of Si in a vast majority of the ocean (e.g. subtropical gyre systems).  Culture experiments with pure clones from the cyanobacteria genus Synechococcus demonstrate that cellular Si levels and the rate of Si accumulation respond proportionately to changes in the concentration of silicic acid in the external medium.  Si per cell is also inversely related to growth rate, implying growth rate dilution, and our studies demonstrated that additional dissolved silicic acid availability does not enhance cellular growth rates.  While Si uptake increased linearly with increasing dissolved silicic acid (up to 500 micromolar), which implies diffusive transport of Si into cells at environmentally relevant silicic acid concentrations, there also was evidence that Si may pass through a phosphate transporter under low-silicic acid conditions. Within the cell, Synechococcus had a significant proportion of Si which was water-soluble and the concentrations were high enough (i.e. ~2 millimolar) to imply the existence of a large pool of organically bound silicic acid, as has been hypothesized for diatoms (the main phytoplankton group which uses Si).  These culture data have assisted in the development of an operational model for Si accumulation in these organisms.  In the field, the picoplankton size class (which includes Synechococcus spp.) was observed to contribute a measurable, and at times significant, proportion of the total biogenic silica standing stock and to its rate of production in the Sargasso Sea. Prior to this study, the fundamental assumption in this system was that diatoms were the only group with a significant contribution to the standing stock and production rate of biogenic silica in these systems.  The picoplankton standing stock was consistent in space and time; however, the rate of biogenic silica production in this size-class was more variable.  When accounting for differences in the quantity of biogenic silica in each size, the rate of production in the picoplankton was similar to or exceeded that of the diatom size class in many stations.  Our results suggest picoplankton may have a small, but relatively stable, contribution to biogenic silica in this region, which underlies a more dynamic microplankton biogenic silica pool driven by diatoms.  However, in the Sargasso Sea, the magnitude of biogenic silica production rates in the picoplankton size class are unlikely to increase current estimates of how much biogenic silica is produced per unit area annually.  Such a lack of change is due to the selection of standard filtration sizes during studies in the early 1990s, which have been used since, and were small enough to capture nearly all the picoplankton cells considered in this study; therefore, current annual production rates already include some or most of the picoplankton contribution.         Broader Impact:  During the life of this project, two senior personnel and two technicians were supported.  One undergraduate student, from an under-represented ethnic group, was trained during the first two years of the award and presented work at a society meeting.  This was the first exposure for the undergraduate to oceanography and this individual has since earned a M.S. degree in Marine Science and is pursuing a Ph.D.; therefore, this project was significant in helping recruit a new oceanographer and provide opportunity for a promising young scientist.
