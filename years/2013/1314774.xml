<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professors Pran Nath, Haim Goldberg, Brent D Nelson and Tomasz Taylor at Northeastern  University in Boston, Massachusetts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Principal Investigators (PIs) plan to carry out research in broad areas of particle physics with the aim of deciphering the nature of physics that lies beyond the Standard Model. Their theoretical investigations are closely linked with the current experimental efforts such as those at the Large Hadron Collider as well as in several underground experiments searching for dark matter and satellite experiments which probe the early history of the universe.  The efforts of the PIs are based on supersymmetry, supergravity and string theory as these are the leading theoretical frameworks for new physics beyond the Standard Model. The PIs also plan to pursue neutrino cosmology and dark radiation in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and in Cosmic Microwave Background data coming from the PLANCK satellite experiment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project also has a strong educational component which involves the training of graduate and undergraduate students. Several students will work with the PIs on their Ph.D. dissertations and additionally the research projects will be used as an educational tool for physics majors regarding developments on particle physics frontiers.  The results of this research will be disseminated via publications in refereed journals, through open access arXiv.org, through talks at international conferences, and through popular journals. This research project will also involve collaborators from many countries and thus will enhance international collaboration in fundamental physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the major discoveries in particle physics this decade is of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at the Central European Organization for Nuclear Research in Geneva, Switzerland in the year 2012. Its mass was measured at 125 Giga electron volt in energy units. The mass determination provides a very significant clue to the nature of physics at higher energies. One of the leading candidates for new physics beyond the Standard Model is a new symmetry known as supersymmetry and a more complete version of it known as supergravity. Unified models using supergravity, one version of which is known as mSUGRA, allow one to predict the nature of new physics at much higher energies than currently accessible to us, in fact up to energies which approach the energy scale of the Big Bang. The data provided by the Large Hadron Collider on the Higgs boson mass helps make the predictions of supergravity models more definitive. Thus using the additional restrictions provided by the Higgs boson measurements, analyses for the discovery of new particles, which are the supersymmetric cousins of the known particles, were carried out. It was shown that the prospects for the discovery of these particles at the Large Hadron Collider are significantly improved as a consequence of the Higgs boson measurements. Further implications of these analyses for the observation of dark matter were discussed. Other aspects of unified models which allow for generation of matter over anti-matter in the early universe were also investigated.   As mentioned in the previous paragraph, the precise nature of the particle (or particles) that constitute the dark matter in the cosmos is unknown. While one possibility is that the dark matter consists of the supersymmetric partner of a known Standard Model particle, such a scenario is not the only one imaginable. Indeed, realistic string theory models tend to contain multiple sectors, each containing its own set of particles and interactions. One or more of these sectors may play the role of dark matter. Work supported by this grant investigated an array of possibilities motivated by string theory, and placed each such model in an over-arching classification system that studied how such sectors interact with the (observable) Standard Model sector. This has led to a better understanding of how string constructions are constrained by cosmological observations, and under what circumstances we might expect string-motivated dark matter candidates to be relevant for the Large Hadron Collider.  Finally, in elementary particle interactions, gravity does not seem to play a significant role. The reason why gravity is so "weak" is not known and in general, the nature of gravitational effects at microscopic distances remains as one of unsolved theoretical problems. There is a very interesting hint coming from string theory, where photons (quantum particles of electromagnetic waves) and gravitons (quantum particles of gravitational waves) arise from vibrations of open and closed strings, respectively. Since closed string can be thought of as a pair of open strings connected at the ends, it is tempting to speculate that the graviton is akin of "square" or "bound state" of particles similar to standard photons or intermediate bosons of electro-weak interactions. Indeed in the computations of physical quantities, in particular in the amplitudes describing the scattering processes, the presence of gravitons is often equivalent to two standard particles. The nature and possible origin of these connections between standard forces and gravity were investigated.          Last Modified: 12/14/2017       Submitted by: Brent D Nelson]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
