<AbstractNarration>Funds are provided to examine the impact of sea ice on the distribution and abundance of zooplankton, and how they are partitioned among top predators. To this end, new and historical data will be used to test a series of hypotheses and answer questions relating to bottom-up and top-down control of large crustacean zooplankton and their impact on the flow of carbon and energy in the ecosystem. From the examination of these hypotheses, new mechanisms will be derived and old ones re-evaluated. Existing numerical models will be used to assess the relative importance of these mechanisms. Existing conceptual models will be tested, and new conceptual models of carbon and energy flow will be developed. Such a study of the eastern Bering Sea shelf ecosystem is timely. Some of the most direct effects of changing climate will be on sea-ice - its extent, duration, timing of retreat, and inter-annual variability. Sea ice in turn controls ocean temperature/salinity, timing of the spring phytoplankton bloom and thus the extent of export/remineralization of fixed carbon. Crustacean zooplankton can be a choke-point in the flow of carbon and energy through the food chain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Bering Sea ecosystem provides roughly half the commercial seafood landings in the United States, as well as significant resources for subsistence fishermen.  Major fluctuations in these stocks have occurred in the past and been associated with climate variations.  Improved management of these important fisheries should be enabled by the understanding derived from this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Bering Sea and other sub-Arctic and Arctic seas are predicted to be among those regions most severely affected by global warming, as relatively small changes in the heat content of the water can have a disproportionately large effect on the presence of seasonal sea ice.  Over the last decade, a wealth of data, in particular the Bering Sea Ecosystem Study (BEST), has become available for the eastern Bering Sea from continued monitoring and multiple large-scale, comprehensive research programs. From these efforts, it is becoming evident that the presence or absence of sea-ice in spring is the single most important component determining the physical and biological structure of this critically important ecosystem, not only in spring, but for the remainder of the warm season. This includes the determination of the magnitude Bering Sea foodweb that leads to the highly productive fisheries in this region.  This synthesis project was centered around integrating knowledge from the BEST field program, with other information in the region, to generate a more holistic understanding of how food supply (bottom-up processes) and predation (top-down processes) impact crustacean zooplankton.  The Bering Sea shelf ecosystem is one of the most productive, in terms of fisheries yield, in the world.  These high levels of fisheries production are supported by even higher levels of productivity at lower trophic levels, namely the zooplankton (animal plankton) that are fed upon by fish, and the phytoplankton (plant plankton) that are fed upon by the zooplankton.  Our specific component of the BEST Synthesis project focused on if food supply (i.e., phytoplankton production) was a limiting factor for crustacean zooplankton production.  We explored this idea by combining our phytoplankton production data with estimates of crustacean zooplankton biomass and production.  We observed that crustacean zooplankton production was a relatively small fraction of phytoplankton production, at least via direct feeding of zooplankton on phytoplankton.  One of the outcomes of the BEST field program was that a surprisingly large fraction of phytoplankton production was consumed by small planktonic protists, called microzooplankton.  These microzooplankton can consume up to 50% of phytoplankton production in the spring and 100% in the summer.  These microzooplankton are known to be an important prey item for crustacean zooplankton and thus the foodweb in the Bering Sea is more complicated than just phytoplankton to crustacean zooplankton to fisheries.  Furthermore, estimates of euphausid predation on zooplankton equates to 1-20% of primary production depending upon which estimate of euphausid biomass is used.  Thus one of the most important unknowns underlying our understanding of the flow of energy in the Bering Sea remains accurate assessments of plankton biomass.  In an effort to integrate this diversity of information across key regions of the Bering Sea, we also developed an ecosystem indicator model.  This model used satellite ocean color data and phytoplankton physiology to estimate gross primary production on a larger spatial scale and then by looking at changes in phytoplankton abundance on a weekly basis we could estimate the loss of phytoplankton as the difference between modeled production and observed values.  This loss of phytoplankton was then modeled to parse it between different fates, such as sinking to the bottom, grazing by microzooplankton and crustacean zooplankton, among several other fates.  We used this modelling approach to compare ecosystem states and the fate of phytoplankton production between the warm years in the early 2000Æs and the cold years in the late 2000Æs.  While there is some indication that total phytoplankton production may be higher in warm years (although the loss of sea ice algae production has not been evaluated), the loss to other ecosystem pathways also increase such that the fate of phytoplankton production in the s...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
