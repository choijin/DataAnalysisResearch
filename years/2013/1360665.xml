<AbstractNarration>The proposed project examines retention of diverse, engineering graduates in engineering careers by investigating how students perceive their career options, engineering skills, and educational experiences relate to their plans and  to engage engineering educators and industry professionals in using our research findings to reform undergraduate engineering education. Undergraduates at six institutions from their junior year to their first year post-graduation will be evaluated using qualitative and quantitative research.  The community of practice element will convene stakeholders at each partner institution who are invested in translating the results from this project into educational practice. A Professional Pathways Model that explains how students beliefs about their career options and their own abilities affect their career decisions will be proposed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ WHAT IS THE PROBLEM  Calls to prevent a shortfall of qualified engineers often focus on retention in the major or among experienced workers and fail to consider the significant numbers of engineering students who leave almost immediately after graduation. To increase retention during the college-career transition, we must learn more about the factors contributing to early career engineering attrition, and particularly, "problematic attrition" (where an individual is "pushed away" from engineering by negative factors).  This national study draws on data from six U.S. institutions, and has a specific objective of bridging research findings to practice. Our mixed-methods study, based on career professional staff interviews and student surveys and interviews, addresses the following research questions:  How do engineering students develop beliefs about their      career options and abilities? How do these beliefs influence their career plans and      preparation over time? How might research findings on      students? beliefs and plans be used in improving career development      services?   WHAT WE LEARNED- STUDENTS  We surveyed juniors and seniors at our partner schools in Fall 2016, and again, one year later. Results indicate that student?s confidence in two areas, career exploration and job acquisition, are highly related and influenced by a common set of experiences, including having had an internship/co-op, having been a student leader, and taking courses that emphasizing engineering careers or skills. Some of the most impactful campus resources on students? career confidence, such as company visits and mock interviews, were found to be the least utilized among students. With respect to people, students most sought out career help from academic advisors, faculty, other students, and family members. Career counselors were sought out least and, usually, not until senior year.  We also interviewed 62 survey respondents majoring in mechanical or chemical engineering. Similar to the survey results, analyses revealed four main socializer groups: family, peers, university individuals, and work individuals. How socializers influence students appears to be domain-specific, with family members influencing students? thinking about specific jobs and peers influencing their job exploration more broadly. The student interviews also showed patterns between high and low levels of preparedness, corresponding to how much students knew about the job acquisition process and whether they took action based on this knowledge. Students with a high level of preparedness took action early to "practice" job acquisition steps such as talking to companies at career fairs. Students with a low level of preparedness did not take action or understand why their process was not netting desired outcomes.  WHAT WE LEARNED--CAREER PROFESSIONALS:  We interviewed administrators, faculty, and staff regarding their perceptions of students preparedness for their first position after graduation and the role of career services and faculty in this regard. Findings revealed that the career services and advising offered varied across institutions. We also identified key behaviors and beliefs of career service professionals related to engineering students? career development; which were further characterized within career exploration, career skills, or job acquisition. Our findings suggest that career service professionals believe that while engineering students graduate with sound engineering skills, acquiring a job requires a dynamic set of professional and interpersonal skills that may not be fully addressed within engineering curriculum. Finally, we analyzed the data for beliefs and behaviors specific to internships and noted the behaviors, at times, did not fully support the beliefs regarding their potential benefits.  Implications of our findings include considerations for how we inform students regarding the knowledge and skills needed to successfully obtain a preferred first position after graduation.   IMPLICATIONS  The      FORMAL ENGINEERING CURRICULUM largely focuses on helping students      develop engineering skills and abilities.  When career-related      options and skills are included, they contribute to student confidence      in engineering, as well as confidence in career discovery and job      acquisition skills. Engagement      in EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES (including internships) has positive      career discovery and engineering skills payoffs.  The      group that supports students? sense of preparedness / confidence in career      discovery and job acquisition skills is not homogeneous, with FACULTY,       INDUSTRY CONTACTS and FRIENDS playing particularly strong roles.  Because the group that supports      students in developing career- and job-related skills is not homogeneous      and a variety of activities (both inside and outside the classroom)      contribute to students? preparedness it is challenging to know who are      the "customers" are for Career-related research findings?
