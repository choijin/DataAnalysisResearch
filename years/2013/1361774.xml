<AbstractNarration>The research of the planned I/UCRC for Advanced Vehicle Manufacturing aims to integrate multiple universities and disciplines to advance research that is intended to extend knowledge in the fields of smart assembly, logistics, and process diagnostics through data analytics and statistical modeling. Moreover, a better fundamental understanding of adapting emerging manufacturing methods and advanced materials with environmentally friendly (waste, fuel, emissions) vehicle designs will be explored. Research will also include an improved understanding and integration of the health, safety, and environmental issues of emerging manufacturing techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vehicle manufacturing is a sector of significant economic impact to the U.S., especially to the southeast. The Center intends to address the major challenges faced in advanced vehicle manufacturing and in the process have a major economic impact. With the cross-disciplinary expertise of the faculty and industry support, the center will also provide opportunities for interdisciplinary education. Workforce development and cross-training will be addressed through collaboration with a consortium of community colleges that work closely with the auto industry. The research team has significant involvement in diversity, veterans and K-12 outreach initiatives and the mentoring of graduate and undergraduate researchers.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Engaged the state and city organizations in these meetings with representation from the: Auburn Economic Development Council, Alabama Automotive Manufacturing Association, Georgia Automotive Manufacturing Association, Tennessee Automotive Manufacturing Association, Business Council of Alabama and Economic Development for the State of Alabama. Constructed a website to disseminate and publicized for the SAAV consortium, see www.saav.center .  Conducted numerous site visits to engage several of the top OEMs in the best strategies for launching the center and how to shape the research projects for their benefit. Developed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) document that will be signed by the universities and the members, if the SAAV center is granted a Phase I center by NSF.  Finalized the membership agreement. NSF and the legal teams of all three universities have approved this document.   We are now working on the draft proposal for the Phase I center which we will submit to NSF in the fall.
