<AbstractNarration>This work will extend and complete the precise radial velocity (RV) survey at McDonald Observatory of 500 nearby stars. The ladditional years of data collection will make it possible for the investigators to identify many extrasolar planets with long (12-15 years) orbital periods. Their main research goal is to determine the fraction of planetary systems that have undergone significant migration, including planets that are more than 5 AU from their host star, to constrain models of planetary system formation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include the participation of several graduate students in the research, production of 12 StarDate radio broadcasts, and public outreach programs through the McDonald Observatory.</AbstractNarration>
