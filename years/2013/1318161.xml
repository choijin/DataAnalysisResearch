<AbstractNarration>The investigator will develop and study a new computational approach for the simulation of turbulent droplet-laden flows rooted in the probabilistic-based description of particle transport. This requires the determination of the evolution of the particle-density function in space and time, coupled with the turbulent flow of the carrier phase (gas or liquid). Knowledge of this function enables consistent coupling with the flow through mass, momentum, and energy sources in the governing equations of the carrier gas flow. The main mathematical difficulty that has prevented this approach from progressing in the past is the high dimensionality of the space of independent variables of the distribution function, which renders traditional computational techniques ineffective with current or foreseeable computational resources. The main idea of the research is the use of a new non-linear global basis function projection approach that condenses several of the extra dimensions of the problem. The transformative nature of the proposal is in (i) devising a methodology for integrating the transport equation for the distribution function that is computationally amenable, (ii) implementing the numerical methodology in an efficient predictive and modular tool, and (iii) extending the knowledge of the currently inaccessible aspects of the microphysics interaction with the carrier gas in atmospheric cloud simulations.  Furthermore, collaboration with a team at Max-Planck Institute for Meteorology will ensure the effective transfer and dissemination of the technology that is proposed to the area of physical meteorology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The prediction of multi-phase flows, particularly solid or liquid particles dispersed in a host-gas, is challenging  and computationally onerous. These flows arise in natural phenomena; encompassing cloud dynamics, dust storms and grassland fires; and industrial applications such as food and chemical processing as well as chemical synthesis and propulsion. The interactions between a highly turbulent flow and the extremely large number of particles (millions-to-billions and beyond) of different shape and size, moving in different directions with different velocities, that undergo phase transformation and/or chemical reactions, lead to a complex mathematical problem. The proposed research will make a significant impact in the understanding of a wide range of science and engineering phenomena involving flows with dispersed particles that are currently inaccessible. The research will enable high-fidelity computations that incorporate phenomena at the small and large scales consistently. Enhancement in the prediction of these flows has numerous scientific and societal benefits; e.g., because atmospheric flows are critical to improve weather prediction and to better understand the global energy balance of our planet.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project is concerned with the development of a numerical method to simulate the behavior of particles and droplets in turbulent flows, primarily of geophysical interest. Small particles and droplets that are dragged around by a chaotic and turbulent flow obey rather simple interaction laws but, unfortunately, the collective behavior of the particle cloud can be very complex. In this project, we are not interested in following the dynamics of each particle because this approach becomes impractical for the typical large number of particles encountered in applications. Instead, we focus on describing the statistics of particle clouds, which necessitate fewer parameters; e.g., density of particles, momentum, spread, etc. As it often happens in mathematics, one can replace a complex problem by another complex problem of different nature, and only some critical observations (and simplifications) may be able to make the description more tractable. The statistical description of particles is not limited by the actual number of particles but this is achieved by increasing the dimensionality of the underlaying equation that must be solved. In the past, this equation has been approximated by taking moment (averages of the distribution function of particles with their velocity). This approach is well documented but it has its drawbacks. To overcome some of this drawbacks we pursued a different strategy where moments are not used but, instead, we perform a least-squares minimization of the equation that govern the statistics. This produces very different equations than those resulting from moment methods and they require specialized numerical methods. The key advantage of the new approach is that the new equations obey simpler rules, and they are more accurate and better behaved than the moment equations, as we have been able to demonstrate. Furthermore, multidimensional aspects of particle movement in turbulent flows, such as cross-velocity correlations (the degree of interdependence of the particle velocity components) can be incorporated easily. There is one disadvantage, namely that the derivation of the equations is more involved and only recent advances in symbolic manipulation software have enable this part of the approximation technique to be successful. To highlight some recent results, the attached figure shows the composite view of the behavior of particles in a flow driven by an array of vortices (not show). The color use in the figure indicates whether the particles move along one of the coordinate directions, horizontal or vertical, (greens), they move along the diagonal directions (red positive and blue negative diagonal). In addition, black curves denote iso-concentration of particles, clearly showing that the flow is composed of region of low particle density (vortex cores) and bands of particle accumulation at the edges of the vortices. Furthermore, the cross-correlation of velocity components (colors) do not align perfectly with the density iso-concentration lines, showing that there are intricate and hard to capture delays in the alignment and accumulation regions. These are completely new results that have been possible thanks to the analytical and numerical methods developed as part of this grant. <br /><br />&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/01/2017<br>      Modified by: Carlos&nbsp;Pantano-Rubino</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1318161/1318161_10255210_1506865399025_rho-alpha--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1318161/1318161_10255210_1506865399025_rho-alpha--rgov-800width.jpg" title="VelocityCorr-Density"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1318161/1318161_10255210_1506865399025_rho-alpha--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="VelocityCorr-Density"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Particle velocity correlation and density in chaotic flow produced by an ensemble of random unsteady vortices.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Carlos Pantano</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Carlos&nbsp;Pantano-Rubino</div> <div class="imageTitle">VelocityCorr-Density</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
