<AbstractNarration>This action funds Nicholas Andrew Johnson of the University of Minnesota to conduct a research project in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering area during the summer of 2013 at the Australian National University in Canberra, Australia.  The project title is "Real-Time Learning in Multiagent Systems for Ad Hoc Robot Teams." The host scientist is Professor Bob Williamson.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The capability of heterogeneous robots to work together in order to accomplish a task is greatly improved through the use of real-time learning. Robots must be able to learn efficiently in the presence of other robots that possess differing capabilities. This project develops learning robots that take into account trust, cooperation, risk, and regret in order to allow teams of ad hoc robots to work efficiently and accurately to accomplish a task.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, impacts of this project include advancing our understanding of the ability to coordinate teams of robots with heterogeneous capabilities;  using the cooperation of the robot teams as a teaching activity for elementary children; and improving the speed, accuracy, and safety of response and limiting human endangerment in emergency situations through the use of robot teams.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The initial project titled "Real-Time Learning in Multiagent Systems for Ad Hoc Robot Teams" was to develop an algorithm that allows teams of robots to coordinate together while receiving input from the environment in real time in order to satisfy a single objective. The scope of this project was slightly modified to focus more generally on any coalition of robots with the goal of satisfying multiple objectives and gaining a better understanding of the relations with specific types of utility functions. This more general problem statement includes, as a special case, the original proposal's problem statement.    The rationale for this change is that this research area advanced so far in the time between the proposal and the start of the program that a more general approach to solving this problem was considered more significant as well as its applicability to other areas rather than simply to teams of robots.   The collaboration was also more closely aligned with only the host researcher rather than a secondary researcher as originally planned and the scope was change to align better with his current research.   We investigated the ability for a coalition of robots to make performance guarantees while satisfying multiple objectives by focusing on a specific type of utility function called "proper loss" functions. Our investigation lead us to theorize that, given the properties of proper loss functions, we can relax a strong requirement of the utility functions previously used for making performance guarantees. This will allow us to develop algorithms for a wider range of robots and be able to handle more complex environments while still being able to guarantee a certain level of performance. This performance guarantee was previously shown to only hold for strict and simple utility functions and, as such, the applicability of such robots was limited.    Our findings may help robots perform more efficiently, quickly, and with a higher minimum performance standard even in complex environments. This could improve response and safety for search and rescue robots in disaster situations.   In addition to the technical results of the project, the outcomes of the program included meeting fellow researchers and building a cross-university and cross-nation collaboration which all involved agreed we would like to continue to build and work together in the future.   We were also able to meet researchers in other fields and learn about and discuss the way research is managed and conducted in Australia. We were also witness firsthand to an exciting political upheaval and how it might affect science policy in the future for Australia.   Finally, we were able to meet many local Australians, experience the way they live, learn about their history, and enjoy their culture including food, theater, and athletics.
