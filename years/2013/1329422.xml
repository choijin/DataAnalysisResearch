<AbstractNarration>A hybrid system is a dynamical model that describes the coupled evolution of both continuous-valued variables and discrete patterns. A prime example of such a system is a power electronic circuit, where the semiconductor transistors behave as ideal switches whose switching actions effectively change the circuit topology (i.e., the discrete pattern) that in turn defines the dynamics of currents and voltages (i.e., the continuous variables) and hence the switching actions. There have been two disparate paths to analyzing and designing hybrid systems. One path is to focus on the discrete patterns and achieve scalable, high-level analysis and synthesis. The other path is to pay attention to the dynamics of continuous variables and guarantee low-level properties such as stability and transient performance. The research objective of this proposal is to bridge these approaches by enabling a synergy between the discrete pattern based and continuous variable based approaches. The theory and algorithms developed in course of this work will be applied to digital control of power electronic circuits in order to overcome the scalability and stability issues suffered by existing approaches to power electronics design.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs envision that a successful completion of the project will establish a new paradigm in the analysis and design of hybrid systems, and thus contribute to the needs of modern society, such as microgrids and embedded generation, where power electronic circuits are integral parts. The research will be integrated into educational programs through student mentoring and development of courses and laboratory equipment. The PIs will make a special effort to recruit women and minority students. These broader-impact programs will help innovate science and engineering education and prepare for next-generation CPS scientists and engineers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major objective of the research effort supported by this grant was to develop efficient algorithms for controller design for a class of systems called switched systems. Switched systems have two main advantages: i) they can approximate the behavior of any nonlinear system and ii) as opposed to general nonlinear systems, it is possible to develop systematic procedures for identification of models from data and for controller design.  To accomplish this objective, three main research thrusts were pursued  1)      Algorithms for system identification from noisy data: Starting with data collected, efficient algorithms were developed that determine the model of the sub-systems and dynamics of the switching among these subsystems. Tools from areas as different as algebraic geometry, probability theory and machine learning were used in order to design algorithms that are efficient and can handle very large noisy data sets.  2)      Algorithms for robust controller design: Again, by using concepts from very diverse areas, we were able to develop algorithms that achieve the desired results, even in the presence of significant uncertainty.  3)      Risk-adjusted controller design: Problems involving risk minimization are problems that are known to be very complex. For general controller design, we have developed efficient convex relaxations that approximate the solution of this very complex problems. In the particular case where the problem involves only linear constraints, we developed new representations of probability which enable the use of "traditional" stochastic approximations algorithms to minimize risk.  The algorithms above were applied in different contexts. The PIs addressed several problems in electrical power networks, both at the local level control and overall optimization of power distribution in the presence of uncertain renewable sources. Moreover, a collaboration effort with social scientists was pursued where the control system concepts described above were used for studying the efficiency of treatments for smoking cessation and improving physical activity. Applications of the developed approaches were also pursued in other fields.  Finally, there were several graduate and undergraduate students involved in this project which made significant contributions to it.
