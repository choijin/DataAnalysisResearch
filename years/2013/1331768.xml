<AbstractNarration>Water, solar and wind are essential for a sustainable transformation of our energy systems. Distributed solar and wind farms proliferate, but energy harvesting from water is trapped in a century-old damming paradigm with high up-front costs and ecological impacts. And yet, as a river runs down to the ocean, there is enormous amount of kinetic energy that could be sustainably harvested, if done without impoundments that break up the run of the river. An environmentally friendly alternative, known as hydrokinetic or run-of-the-river power extraction, harvests a portion of the kinetic energy in the river at relatively small, local scales at multiple places along the river. However, these projects are characterized by uncertainty in generated output and strong weather/climate dependence. They are typically developed in an ad-hoc manner without prior large-scale analysis of determining optimum locations, online analysis of the produced output, or effective decentralized control of distributed hydrokinetic generators. Furthermore, climate change introduces highly variable weather patterns that alternate benign conditions with catastrophic levels of wind, precipitation, temperature extremes, and droughts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates climate-aware modeling, analysis, and control for large-scale sustainable energy harvesting in river networks. The project goals are: (i) modeling of time-space varying river network flow conditions and water levels both with and without multiple hydrokinetic generators; (ii) determining optimum locations for hydrokinetic units in a distributed river network based on economic, reliability-driven, and environmental criteria; (iii) evaluating environmental sensor requirements for demand/response or environmental disaster avoidance; (iv) predictive matching of hydrokinetic power generation and time-varying demand in complex river networks with geospatial and temporal dependencies; and (iv) climate-aware planning for distributed hydrokinetic power generation resources and avoiding catastrophic events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential societal impacts of this research include flood disaster avoidance and guidance on small footprint hydropower project development. Given that the estimated hydrokinetic resource potential in the United States is roughly four times the amount of hydroelectricity currently produced each year, small footprint hydroelectric projects could create enough low-carbon energy to power an economy the size of Virginia's while minimizing the impact to the surrounding environment and nearby communities. While the main goal of the research is determining in a climate-dependent manner the production output and identifying any imbalance between production and demand or the control mechanisms to match one by the other, the approach is sufficiently general to be applied to a more diverse body of applications where deterministic small-scale processes need to be upscaled for effective feedback response and control. The educational and mentoring component incorporates multidisciplinary collaboration across electrical, civil and energy/public policy engineering in creating large-scale complex system models that cross traditional boundaries of both academia and industry. Through its educational component the project involves a diverse student body, while expanding the project's outreach beyond the typical undergraduate and graduate demographics to high-school and middle-school student population.</AbstractNarration>

While distributed solar and wind farms are mainstream, hydro power has been trapped in a century-old damming paradigm with high up-front costs, ecological impacts, and ongoing costs as obstacles for barge traffic. There is an enormous amount of kinetic energy that can be sustainably harvested in environmentally friendly alternatives such as hydrokinetic power projects. However, its dependence on precipitation or climate anomalies, makes small footprint, run-of-rive hydropower&nbsp;challenging to forecast and use in reliable, renewable energy generation. Our project has addressed these issues through a holistic framework for (1) effectively planning and operating ecologically and economically sustainable run-of-the-river hydropower systems in the developing world, (2) supplementing existing conventional hydropower in the developed world, and (3) for restoring dammed rivers to natural flows while still supplying power.Our team, comprised of electrical, computer, and civil engineers from Carnegie Mellon University, Penn State University, University of Southern California, and University of Texas at Austin has successfully achieved the following outcomes during the completion of this project:</p> <p>* Flexible river dynamics prediction with high accuracy (&gt; 85% correlation between predicted gage/discharge with real data) for both short- and long-term (from 15min to 48hours) forecasting, targeting either renewable energy pricing or catastrophic events, such as flooding or ecological disasters.</p> <p>* A novel feature extraction method called K-Hop learning which significantly reduces the short-term (24-hours ahead) flowrate prediction error by 57-82% by learning important features directly from the complex river network characteristics.</p> <p>* Multivariate and multiscale analysis for precipitation, temperature and carbon emission dynamics with long-memory&nbsp;(50 years)&nbsp;temporal relationships, long-range spatial dependencies, and low-frequency variability, to improve precipitation predictions and enable accurate rainfall models for smart water networks.</p> <p>* An effective method for generating the consistent initial condition for Saint-Venant Equations in large-scale river network simulations. The newly proposed method can be up to 5000+ times faster than traditional methods.</p> <p>* The SPRNT model was used for prototyping an approach using reach-scale channel geometry and a Saint-Venant Equations dynamic model for automated generation of rating curves for every stream reach in a watershed, which can be useful in the absence of full dynamic river modeling. We use a variant of the Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) method to develop reach-scale channel geometry, and apply an unsteady SV model to solve for quasi-steady conditions. The procedure can systematically establish a rating curve database for every reach in the CONUS, and provides a graceful transition for converting hydrological data to hydraulic information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>* A graph-theory based technique for isolating problematic boundary conditions in large-scale river network simulation has been proposed and tested. Development of continental-scale river network models creates challenges where the massive amount of boundary condition data encounters the sensitivity of a dynamic numerical model.&nbsp; Hence, by implementing the graph theory concepts and the modified steady state solver, the problematic boundary conditions can be easily screened out in a relatively short time.&nbsp;</p> <p>* A new global-scale non-stationary Bayesian learning model on multilayer cloud networks to accurately predict short-term (1-3 hours) solar irradiance across a large river basin (with error 8-18%), and to explicitly quantify solar energy interdependence among all locations. Such a global model can enable power-grid operators/policy-makers to see beyond the local boundaries of their respective geographical locations.</p> <p>* A novel information theory inspired mathematical optimization for precise allocation of run-of-river power plants that matches spatio-temporal energy demand and avoids disasters. To overcome seasonal and transient energy demand profiles, our polynomial time algorithm also determines the active/sleep modes for run-of-river plants.</p> <p>* Using a novel method, based in finance theory, for evaluating the performance of portfolios of power generation assets fueled by water, wind and sun, we have identified fundamental performance tradeoffs among different renewable energy portfolios across time and space. Optimizing renewable energy performance over a single time scale yields reductions in portfolio performance across other time scales. The magnitude of this tradeoff increases with the spatial scale across which renewable energy portfolios are optimized.</p> <p>* We have illustrated differences in the planning of renewable portfolio asset portfolios based on optimizing output and using ensemble prediction methods to optimize renewable energy investments based on how easy or difficult it is to forecast power output.</p> <p>* As an application to domains outside river networks, run-of-river plants, and pricing, we developed an efficient design methodology for network-on-chip-based multicore architectures for endowing cyber-physical systems with high degree of distributed smartness and cognition (adaptation) to process massive amounts of data and control in real-time complex systems. The new architecture for large scale control problems achieves 29% improvement in latency and 28% improvement in energy dissipation over the conventional many-core architecture.</p><br> <p>
