<AbstractNarration>With support from the National Science Foundation Dr. Molly Morgan will coordinate the analysis of a geological core collected from the Sesecapa Lagoon in Pacific coastal Guatemala. Using radiocarbon dating, floral, faunal and geological and chemical analysis Dr. Morgan will develop a detailed and chronologically sensitive reconstruction of climate change and environmental transformation for this portion of the Pacific coast. Because human habitation of this coastal region extends over multiple millennia it provides a comparative record which will allow researchers to examine the multi-directional interactions between environmental change and societal response. It is expected that the core will document ca. 6,000 years and thus cover the entire occupation span. Archaeologically the region documents athe shift from residential mobility and low-level food production to permanent sedentism and sociocultural complexity and the rise of complex society.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent paleoclimatic research recognizes that this period following the last "Ice Age" experienced shifts in climate that must have affected human populations, but understanding of local mechanisms are often lacking and detailed associated culture change remain obscure. On the Pacific coast of Middle America, as well as tropic coasts in many other regions of the world, these changes included the formation of lagoons and beach formation and progradation. These would be documented in the core. &lt;br/&gt;In addition to the new light which will be shed on regional archaeology the project has multiple broader impacts. The research will document a major type of landscape transition - the closing off of saltwater estuaries and the subsequent formation of freshwater lagoons - a currently ongoing process on the Pacific coast. The work will provide a detailed understanding of beach accumulation rates and landscape effects. Communities living in this wetland area today can use this information to plan for changes that they will face as rivers continue to dump sediments along the coast and estuary environments transform. Secondly the results may be more broadly generalized.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Environmental change is one of the top problems facing our society today. Our leaders are trying to understand how to protect communities all over the world, but they face immense challenges in foreseeing how specific landforms will respond and how human populations will be affected by the emerging conditions on our planet.  Archaeology offers the unique perspective through which we can learn from the past, to see how different environments changed, how natural processes transitioned, and how humans adapted to a changing world.  The project summarized here is one example of current research contributing to this important field of study.  This research project involves a complete study of a core containing sediments dating back nearly 7000 years, taken from the Sesecapa lagoon on the Guatemala Pacific coast (Figure 1).  Sediments collected in core samples from lakebeds can be studied to develop high resolution, continuous records of environmental and climate change, sometimes over long-term periods of time. To be most useful, reconstructions of this kind require multiple lines of evidence. The Sesecapa core (Figure 2) contains physical, biological, and chemical information about the surrounding watershed and has provided a significant opportunity for a multi-disciplinary reconstruction of regional historical ecology.  Thus, the materials recovered from this sediment core supply data used in reconstructing a comprehensive and chronologically sensitive record of environmental and climatic shifts in a dynamic coastal wetland landscape.  Sediments from the core produced especially clear evidence of environmental and cultural phenomenon between roughly 7000-5000 years ago, earlier than most other records from Mesoamerica.   The primary contribution of the knowledge gained from this investigation to the field of archaeology lies in the discovery of early maize on the Pacific Coast of Guatemala.  It is clear from the diatom record that water from the Sesecapa lagoon, throughout much of the time span of the core, would have been unsuitable for agricultural purposes, thus it is likely that crops were never cultivated on lands surrounding the coring location. Pollen and phytoliths, however, indicate that nearby, perhaps upstream, maize was being cultivated from a very early time, approximately 4885&ndash;4705 calibrated years BC.  These dates are among the earliest radiocarbon dates for agriculture along the Pacific coast of Central America.  Furthermore, this study provides datasets with which to understand environmental transition in coastal Guatemala over the past 7,000 years, providing information important to prehistoric studies of environment more widely than in archaeology alone.  This sediment core records transitions in sedimentation resulting from climate shifts and human agricultural activities, changes in floral and faunal populations in response to habitat conditions, saline shifts in coastal waterways, and the movement of landforms due to erosion and sea currents.  This information is useful in bolstering our collective data about coastal environments and how they change through time.  Finally, beyond the academic world, this study documents the closing of the estuary system and the creation of the freshwater Sesecapa Lagoon as a result of sediment accumulation from nearby rivers and sea currents.  Since these processes are still taking place, and coastal estuaries all along this Pacific coastal area (Figure 3) face the prospect of transformation to freshwater environs, this information could be useful to current studies of environmental change in Guatemala.
