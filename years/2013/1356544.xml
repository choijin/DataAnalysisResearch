<AbstractNarration>The Mathematics, Engineering, and Physics (MEP) Scholars program at Jacksonville University is contributing well-prepared individuals to the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce by providing an educational experience that emphasizes student discovery. This program is designed to increase enrollment of students, including those from underrepresented groups, and improve retention of scholars through graduation or transfer to an affiliated institution in engineering-related disciplines. The project can serve as a model for similar institutions, particularly those that utilize a 3 + 2 program with affiliated universities for students to earn an engineering degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is recruiting annual cohorts of students based on academic ability and financial need and supporting them by the development of a Residential Learning Community (RLC), faculty mentors, tutoring, peer study groups, college survival skills training, and career development. The program is collecting information on how an RLC works as well as how the systemic implementation of the numerous support structures impacts the retention and graduation of STEM majors. Women and underrepresented minorities are being targeted in recruitment and retained via the social and academic support structures of an RLC. The program is being assessed based on enrollment, mid-term and final grades, attendance at extracurricular functions, career plans, resiliency, engagement of faculty and students, learning motivation, and learning strategies. Outcomes and knowledge gained are being broadly disseminated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The participation by scholars in project-based courses, mathematical modeling contests, and enrollment in paired courses enables them to discover the connections between physics and mathematics. The scholars are being encouraged to participate in an annual mathematical modeling competition, undergraduate research, and internships with local government and industry partners. Support structures are scheduled within the targeted majors to deliver maximum impact to each student and to equip each student to succeed. Mentoring provides feedback and guidance and grounds students in their chosen disciplines. Undergraduate research, internships, and career development solidifies their learning and prepares them professionally. To ensure best practices in STEM teaching, a Learning Community (LC) is being created for the MEP faculty and tutors. Faculty and tutors are participating in workshops and regular meetings to discuss best practices in STEM education, teaching strategies, and the progress of the program.</AbstractNarration>
