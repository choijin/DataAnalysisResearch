<AbstractNarration>The PIs develop a conceptual architecture for the EarthCube program. The conceptual architecture&lt;br/&gt;will serve as the blueprint for the definition, construction, and deployment of both existing&lt;br/&gt;and new components to ensure that they can be unified and integrated into a evolutionary national&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure for EarthCube. They intend to create a concept that incorporates findings and&lt;br/&gt;requirements from ongoing EarthCube activities as well as other cross-agency Earth Science&lt;br/&gt;informatics efforts. The architecture models will be a roadmap for building an extensible&lt;br/&gt;and sustainable EarthCube system that facilitates new science and inspires substantive participation&lt;br/&gt;of a broad spectrum of geoscientists. The project team is led by a group of computer scientists&lt;br/&gt;from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and private industry that has extensive&lt;br/&gt;experience and a proven track record leading the architecture, design and development of complex&lt;br/&gt;and data intensive science data systems. They will specifically focus on the development of&lt;br/&gt;a guiding architecture report and specification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this EarthCube architecture study can intellectually&lt;br/&gt;contribute to other scientific and agency efforts as they are studying new architectural models&lt;br/&gt;to address scientific data management and discovery in the big data era.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ EarthCube is a community of scientists working on a broad range of NSF-supported projects, mainly in the areas of data and computing, with the goal of fostering the development of our understanding of the Earth.  The goal of our project is to developed a conceptual software architecture for the EarthCube.  This will serve as the blueprint  for the definition, construction, and deployment of both existing and  new software components to ensure that they can be unified and  integrated in.  This is necessary for an orderly, evolutionary development of the national geosciences infrastructure for  data that is part of the EarthCube enterprise.  We have thus developed such a software architecture design, working in a close collaboration with other projects and participants in the EarthCube community.  This architecture includes a set of principles, identification of  stakeholders, use cases as drivers, and architectural elements (process,  information model, technologies/services).  These results have been presented to the EarthCube community at a number of conferences, workshops, team meetings, and in the various professional publications.  We have also made the software available through the appropriate depositories.  We believe that the outcome of this project will facilitate the work of other in the EarthCube community, and accelerate the development and federation of the various software/data systems therein.
