<AbstractNarration>This proposal is for partial funding for the Fourth International Conference on Mathematical Modeling and Analysis of Populations in Biological Systems that will be held at the campus of Texas Tech University in Lubbock, Texas, on October 4-6, 2013. The conference will provide a venue that will foster new collaborations that stimulate novel ideas, advancing the field of mathematical modeling in the analysis of populations across several biological levels. Specific topics to be addressed include: cell signaling, chemotaxis, epidemiology, species range shifts, and macroecology.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interdisciplinary collaborations are crucial in developing applications pertaining to human health and biodiversity conservation in our rapidly changing world.  This conference will bring together researchers and students at all levels from multiple disciplines to foster such collaborations and to identify areas of common ground linking otherwise relatively disparate research areas. Special efforts have been taken to include members of underrepresented groups at all levels. The results of the conference will be disseminated via a conference website and a special issue in the Journal of Biological Dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
