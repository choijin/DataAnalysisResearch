<AbstractNarration>This award supports a forward-looking community discussion on the challenges facing the U.S. mathematical sciences workforce, through a series of on-line thematic discussions leading up to an in-person workshop to be held at the headquarters of the American Statistical Association in Alexandria, VA, from July 14-July 17, 2013.  The mathematical sciences are central to the STEM enterprise -- the range of business, industry, and academic positions that require mathematical and statistical skills is expanding as more and more disciplines encounter the challenges and opportunities of large-scale data analysis and mathematical modeling.  The mathematical sciences communities recognize that there are significant challenges in ensuring that adequate numbers of graduates with expertise in the mathematical and statistical sciences at the bachelor's, master's, and doctoral levels enter the U.S. workforce.   This activity reassesses the training of future generations of mathematical scientists in light of the increasingly cross-disciplinary nature of the training they need.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project will bring together thought leaders to develop strategies for future investments in training the next generation of professionals in the mathematical sciences.  This project will establish a community of stakeholders from academic institutions, professional societies, government agencies, and industry to analyze issues that include recruitment and retention, sustainability, and assessment, and to plan strategically around workforce challenges facing the mathematical and statistical sciences communities.  The project will also make exemplary prototype initiatives visible to the broader mathematical and statistical sciences communities and propose metrics that demonstrate the value of such initiatives in order to (1) broaden adoption of effective practices to improve student recruitment, retention, degree completion, and job placement, and (2) ensure that successful practices are sustained beyond initial implementation.  This award is jointly supported by the Division of Mathematical Sciences and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities within the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
