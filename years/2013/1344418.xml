<AbstractNarration>This workshop project is bringing together professionals directly responsible for undergraduate education initiatives at approximately fifteen disciplinary societies in STEM fields. The workshop's intellectual merit lies in its fostering of communication and collaboration among society representatives for the purpose of sharing existing knowledge of Discipline-Based Education Research (DBER) and practice across disciplines. Furthermore this effort is highlighting the latest insights into effective translation of theoretical knowledge into actual practice and propagation of evidence-based instructional strategies and programs. Workshop outcomes include: 1) publishing a joint document clarifying the support of the disciplinary societies for the adoption of discipline-based education research (DBER) and detailing the strategies employed by the societies to promote active learning across the STEM disciplines; 2) identifying exemplars of successful strategies for fostering adoption of evidence-based active learning strategies from the participating professional societies and documenting them on a public website; and 3) determining whether or not a longer-term initiative designed to instigate wide-scale, long-term improvement in undergraduate teaching practices is feasible and what such an initiative would entail. The broader impacts of the workshop are felt through its engagement of major STEM disciplinary professional societies that collectively represent the full range of the STEM disciplines: physical sciences (including chemistry, physics, and geoscience), biological sciences, engineering, and the mathematical and statistical sciences. These disciplinary societies play a critical role in disseminating information about DBER through their publications and online resources. Individually, they have already established a number of different models for faculty development and created a variety of mechanisms to support continuing faculty growth, and the cooperation and collaboration fostered through this workshop multiplies that influence.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many of the professional societies in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering are working on efforts to improve undergraduate education through workshops for new faculty, the promotion and distribution of discipline-based educational research, tools to aid department chairs in departmental self-assessment, suggestions for improving the success of women and students from underrepresented minorities, and policy positions that encourage elevating the importance of undergraduate teaching. Most of this is done within the silo of an individual discipline, but most of these societies face similar challenges, and the ideas that work within one disciplinary context will often work in others. This project undertook to promote greater communication among the scientific, mathematical, and engineering societies by sharing ideas and approaches. It also identified a few points of common concern where the societies can---and have now begun to---work in concert.  This project began with the establishment of a website, serc.carleton.edu/issues, where professional societies in physics, chemistry, mathematics, geosciences, the life sciences, and psychology posted summaries of and links to the initiatives to improve undergraduate education that each currently has underway. This was followed by an initial two-day workshop in January of 2014 in Washington, DC that brought together the leaders of the educational efforts within these societies together with representatives of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), the Board on Science Education of the National Academies (BoSE), the Association of American Universities (AAU), the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU), and the American Association of College and Universities (AAC&amp;U).  Five areas for common effort were identified:  To support early career faculty.  To strengthen departments by providing tools for self-assessment.  To increase the diversity of students in our courses by improving the communication of career pathways.  To shift cultural norms to increase the recognition of efforts to improve undergraduate instruction.  To provide norms and tools to help the disciplinary societies measure the effectiveness of their own programs.   This project and The Role of Scientific Societies in STEM Faculty Workshops project (NSF DUE #1230391) jointly sponsored a follow-up workshop in September 2014 to look at concrete steps that could be undertaken by the societies in furtherance of these common goals. The extensive report of that meeting is being posted on the ISSUES website as well as the website of the AAU STEM Initiative (stemedhub.org/groups/aau).  In addition, the ISSUES website is now being used to identify the particular interests and concerns of the disciplinary societies and to form networks of those working on each of these issues       Last Modified: 08/20/2015       Submitted by: David M Bressoud]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
