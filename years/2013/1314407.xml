<AbstractNarration>The National Collegiate Inventors &amp; Innovators Alliance (NCIIA) proposes to scale the I-Corps program by supporting the program at campuses in geographically-diverse locations across the U.S. NCIIA will work with members of the I-Corps teaching team to implement a I-Corps curriculum workshop. Feedback from the evaluation process will inform improvements in both the instructor-training program and the I-Corps curriculum. NCIIA Course and Program grants support the development and implementation of experiential education programs that teach engineering and science students to apply innovative and entrepreneurial thinking to their coursework. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the I-Corps program is to determine the commercial feasibility of technology derived from NSF-funded research. Participants will leave the program with an expanded skill-set that will give them the tools necessary to evaluate and translate their research into applications that can benefit society. This program will support a network of instructors who can improve and adapt the program model as it is disseminated to new institutions and regions.</AbstractNarration>

Of those respondents who indicated that their project resulted in the formation of a company, 33% stated that the  I-Corps&trade; Entrepreneurial Lead (EL) was the CEO; 26% stated that the CEO was not a team member, but rather an industry expert or seasoned CEO. 36% of the teams that completed the I-Corps&trade; course had at least one female team member.  Of those teams, 63 are known to have created companies; 13 of theses companies are known to have female CEOÆs. 46% of survey respondents indicated that they are pursuing a new venture.  Of those pursuing a new venture, 92% stated that their experience in I-Corps&trade; has positively influenced it.  Of the 319 teams that have participated in I-Corps&trade; (as of June 2014), 152 have created startups.   The first two years of the NSF I-Corps&trade; program have proven extremely successful, meeting (and often exceeding) expectations. With 152 new companies having incorporated within 36 months of program initiation, I-Corps&trade; is achieving its mandate to strength the U. S. economy and create high-skilled, well-paying jobs.       Last Modified: 11/30/2014       Submitted by: Philip J Weilerstein]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
