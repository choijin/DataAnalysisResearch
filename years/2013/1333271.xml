<AbstractNarration>The objective of this collaborative research study is to improve the reliability of social vulnerability indicators by reducing uncertainties in input data and methods, and validating output metrics.  Social vulnerability has been receiving increasing attention by disaster planners at local, state, and federal levels as they seek to reduce adverse impacts of natural hazards.  Yet far too little is currently understood about the robustness of the leading vulnerability indicators, both in terms of the approaches used to build them and their ability to adequately represent real world conditions.  There is a critical need for methodological advancements to improve the precision and accuracy of social vulnerability indicators.  Without such advancements, the use of social vulnerability indicators in disaster mitigation, preparedness, and recovery could mislead decision-making.  Based on a study area of the Southeast U.S., the project will develop novel regionalization routines and apply global sensitivity analysis and multiple regression to census data inputs and output vulnerability indicators.  The research is expected to generate new understanding of the critical inputs and decision points in social vulnerability modeling, the level of agreement of resultant indicators with observed disaster outcomes, and the influence of uncertainty in social vulnerability modeling.  By narrowing the existing gap between vulnerability models and real-world practice, improved social vulnerability indicators will allow for better disaster planning and interventions that account for the most vulnerable populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has great potential to transform dominant approaches for the measurement of social vulnerability to hazards.  The finalized methodology will be made widely accessible to both researchers and the public through an internet-GIS application that generates user-customizable vulnerability indices.  The improved vulnerability metrics will also be shared with state and federal disaster planners through existing relationships with the research team.  The study contributes to training the next generation of hazards researchers through the direct involvement of graduate and undergraduate students, including those from groups historically underrepresented in graduate research and education.  The project findings will be integrated into the classroom through the development of learning modules for existing courses that explore urban geography and interactions between hazards and society.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This collaborative research project was a partnership between the University of Colorado, University of Iowa, and the University of Central Florida.  The project focused on social vulnerability indicators, quantitative indices that are used to measure the social and economic vulnerability of places and populations to natural hazards.   These indicators are widely used to focus and tailor hazard mitigation and response efforts to the needs of communities.   However, these indicators suffer from a variety of problems including a reliance on uncertain input data, lack of validation, and questions about the stability of the models.  This project addressed each of these concerns by developing new ways to process data to reduce uncertainty in estimates, published demographic data for most major cities in the USA, developed methods to estimate the margin of error on composite indicators of vulnerability, and gathered data to assist in the validation of social vulnerability indicators.  This project, via extensive research, found that  the most widely used social vulnerability indicator may not function as designed in a variety of settings.  The project participants published books, articles, software, and websites in support of the project aims.  This project supported several masters and PhD candidates and undergraduate students via the REU program.             Last Modified: 12/29/2017       Submitted by: Seth E Spielman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
