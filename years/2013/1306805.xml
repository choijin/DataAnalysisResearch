<AbstractNarration>Lattice gauge theory provides the framework to study the excited spectrum of hadrons. As such, this project will help unravel key aspects of the physics of quark confinement and hadron formation in quantum chromodynamics, the theory of the strong interactions and one of the fundamental forces of Nature. In fact, understanding the physics of confining gluons is an important intellectual challenge and was recognized as one of the seven so-called Millenium Prize problems announced by the Clay Mathematics Institute of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The masses of excited hadron resonances will be evaluated using Markov-chain Monte Carlo computer simulations of quarks and gluons on a space-time lattice. Results of these calculations are relevant to several ongoing experimental programs, such as the Hall B N* program and the GlueX experiment in Hall D at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. It is worth mentioning that in the past such calculations were performed with unrealistically large quark masses due to computational limitations. The current project continues the development of a new methodology to incorporate crucial multi-hadron operators into computations in order to reduce the quark masses to nearly their physical values.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research incorporates the participation of two graduate students, and possibly one or more undergraduate students, so the broader impact of this  project concerns also the training of future researchers in the field of lattice QCD. The students are provided with an unique opportunity to learn and contribute to an important line of inquiry at the forefront of nuclear theory. Given the high-performance aspects of this projects, students will also acquire essentials skills in the use of state-of-the-art parallel computing resources. The broader impacts of the proposed activities will be strengthened by posting results with simplified background information on publicly accessible web pages.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the theory  which describes the interactions between fundamental particles known as  quarks and gluons, which bind to form the proton, neutron, pion, and a  myriad of other composite particles known as hadrons.  Good progress  towards computing the masses and studying the structures of the excited  hadronic resonances predicted by QCD was achieved.  Exotic particles,  such as glueballs and hybrid mesons, involving excitations of the gluon  field, and tetraquarks were of particular interest.  The decay width of the rho-meson was computed from first principles, and the scattering of kaons, pions, and eta mesons were studied. The research lends support to  current experiments, such as in the Hall B N* program and the GlueX  experiment in Hall D at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator  Facility (JLab), which are studying such hadronic resonances.    One  of the most reliable means of investigating such systems is using  computer simulations with quark and gluon fields defined on a space-time  lattice.  In the past, such calculations have been done with   unrealistically-large quark masses due to computational limitations.   Current calculations have reduced the quark masses to nearly their  physical values, causing the need to incorporate multi-hadron operators  into the computations to become crucial.  A new methodology for dealing  with multi-hadron operators, known as the stochastic LapH method, was  developed and shown to work well in achieving reliable estimates of the  energies of a variety of hadronic systems.  These computations relied  heavily on resources provided by the Extreme Science and Engineering  Discovery Environment (XSEDE), which is supported by the NSF.  The  proposed research incorporated the participation of graduate students,  and a few undergraduate students, whose educations were enhanced not  only by involvement in scientific projects at the forefront of nuclear  theory, but also with high-technology training in the use of  state-of-the-art parallel computing resources. Outreach efforts included physics demonstrations to students from Colfax K-8 School in Pittsburgh, PA.             Last Modified: 10/07/2016       Submitted by: Colin J Morningstar]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
