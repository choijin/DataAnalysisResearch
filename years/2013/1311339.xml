<AbstractNarration>Birds on small islands have smaller flight muscles and longer legs than their close relatives on larger islands. How do these differences affect function? Birds on small islands might experience less predation, and do not need to take off as rapidly. They are able to save energy by reducing the size of flight muscles, and the longer legs could compensate for smaller muscles during takeoff. This might lead to a slower overall takeoff for birds on small islands. This study aims to test these hypotheses about how differences among island populations affect takeoff. The take-off mechanics of five bird species on the islands of Trinidad and Tobago will be studied. A perch instrumented with strain gauges and a high-speed video camera will be used to measure force generated by the leg thrust as well as flight velocity, acceleration, and wing movements. These data will be used to calculate: (1) the timings of leg thrust, wingbeat, and peak acceleration; (2) total forces produced by the leg thrust; (3) velocities at the end of the leg thrust and of take-off; and (4) percent leg contribution to take-off velocity. &lt;br/&gt; This study aims to assess the functional consequences of island evolution and to test how small-island species differ functionally from their close relatives in ways that directly affect their abilities to compete and escape predators. These functional biomechanical differences might help explain why island species are so vulnerable to human disturbance and introduced species. This project will involve training undergraduate biology students in research skills.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="p1"><span class="s1">In this project, we studied how birds evolve on islands. Lots of people had studied this before, but nobody had figured out that there is a change in general body shape that has occurred in nearly all bird populations that have colonized islands. After birds colonize islands, they invest more energy into the legs and less energy into the muscles that power the wings. This pattern was stronger on smaller islands and on islands that contained fewer bird species. By studying dozens of island bird populations in the South Pacific and Caribbean, we were able to establish that this change in shape is predictable and nearly universal. We then sought to determine the effect of this shape change on flight ability. We hypothesized that birds would not need to rapidly burst into flight when they live on small islands that contain few predators. Accordingly, birds on small islands may shift their energetic investment from forelimbs to hindlimbs at the cost of a slower takeoff. To test this hypothesis, we traveled to Trinidad and Tobago, where there are several pairs of bird populations that have evolved reduced flight muscles and larger legs on the smaller island of Tobago. Using high-speed video, we filmed the takeoff of birds from both islands. Digital analysis of the videos revealed that birds on Tobago use their legs more than their wings during takeoff and accelerate more slowly as a result. It is well known that birds on small islands are vulnerable to introduced predators, including humans. This makes them more susceptible to extinction than bird populations that occur on continents or large islands. As a result of this project, we know that island birds have typically evolved body shapes that contribute to this susceptibility by reducing the speed of takeoff.</span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/03/2015<br>      Modified by: Christopher&nbsp;C&nbsp;Witt</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
