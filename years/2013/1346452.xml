<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of delivering a radically game-changing Big Data - based Supply Chain Analytics Platform. A complex supply chain, in consumer goods manufacturing and distribution, for example, involves data analysis and decision support in many areas. Today's tools and techniques used in supply chain analytics are too restrictive as they rely on the company's internal factors and are unable to effectively incorporate the increasing volume of readily available, external data. The quality of analytics directly impacts the product quality, cost of fulfillment, customer satisfaction, and ultimately the company's financial health. It is proposed to introduce Big Data concepts including distributed text mining, machine learning, and scalable analytics to support supply chain analytics. The proposed innovation will integrate increasingly available structured and unstructured external data to enhance supply chain decisions. This will enable companies to be more customer-focused, make better decisions, and become more profitable. The key results from this research will include algorithms and methods to pre-process inherently unstructured Big Data into quantitative and qualitative descriptors suitable to be inputs for creating new indicators for decision making. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The benefits of better supply chain analytics are clear and significant including better products, better customer service, reduced waste and costs, and increased quality The broader/commercial impact of the proposed innovation is in the area of enhancing product quality and reducing costs for consumer goods companies, increasing the safety of products, and rapid new products introduction into the market based on customer feedback, etc. The proposed research will also significantly lower the technology adoption barriers - both technology-wise and cost-wise barriers to embracing Big Data - while delivering next generation analytics capabilities for businesses and will "democratize" the use of Big Data for companies of all sizes. This is expected to make U.S. companies more competitive resulting in job creation in the U.S. and reducing the outflow of jobs overseas. The potential impact of the proposed research on the business community is significant, and validated in various surveys and studies recently  published documenting the benefits of applying Big Data to business.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[INTRODUCTION &amp; BACKGROUND - Our Phase I STTR project has demonstrated the technical feasibility by completing the tasks under two main objectives stated in our proposal:  1. Develop novel inputs to supply chain analytics models by leveraging Big Data &ndash; as they relate to Demand Forecasting and Product Quality Monitoring;    2. Develop a software test-bed to demonstrate feasibility of using BD for supply chain analytics. We selected the problem of forecasting the Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) patient load. Classification and prediction of T2D has significant implications to the supply chains of a life-sciences company right from setting research priorities, identifying customers, to managing drug manufacturing, warehousing, and distribution operations. a. Using EMR (Electronic Medial Records) data, can we identify patients with type II diabetes (T2D) who have NOT yet been flagged as being diabetic - i.e., ID silent diabetic patients? b. Using EMR data, can we predict the probability of a patient visiting the T2D state? Addressing the specific questions above gives key inputs to the T2D franchise of the company which directly impacts its supply chain. The ability to identify silent diabetics and potential diabetics allows the company to    Proactively target its drug development programs; Efficiently manufacture and supply drugs in different geographies; Procure long lead-time raw materials to produce the necessary products cost effectively; Create novel intervention and patient awareness programs to reach a larger patient pool; Create novel payor and physician education / awareness programs which will benefit the business as well as the patients alike.    Type II Diabetes (T2D) affects millions of people around the world and is one of the fastest growing diseases in both developed and developing economies. When a person has T2D, he/she loses the ability to control blood sugar concentration. This will lead to heart diseases, renal failures, vision problems, and problems in the legs which may lead to amputations. It has been shown that early detection and aggressive intervention has a significant impact on patient health, mortality, and even the overall cost of healthcare.  INTELLECTUAL MERIT -  Using Big Data and Machine Learning methodologies, we are able to build predictors for T2D for a 1 year and 2 year horizon in future. We are also able to process millions of patient records rapidly in order to prepare data for modeling and testing. Significant technical chllenges were encountered in input data processing which include missing data, noisy data, and auxiliary predition variables creation. A significant contribution from our research is also a compact prediction model which predicts T2D fairly accurately using only a few measurements like Body Mass Index (BMI), Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, and Urine content.  Our research also focused on a detailed analysis of which variables have the highest potential to improve prediction accuracy.  The Figure. showcases the prediction performance for the various models developed. AUC (area under the curve) is a metric that captures the model fidelity - with  a maximum value of 1 - the higher this metric, the beter is the preditcion model.  BROADER IMPACT -  Using our results, commercial solutions can be built to readily harness EMR data to rapidly predict T2D risk in patients vising their physicians for routine check up. Since the second level of check-up beyond the routine check-up involves relatively low-cost efforts (like measuring Glucose or H1AC) our result gives a compelling tool to the primary care physician. This has the potential to proactively treat millions of silent type 2 diabetes patients resulting in significant healtcare cost savings and mortality rate reuction.
