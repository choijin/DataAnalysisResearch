<AbstractNarration>The 3rd Mile High Conference will take place at the University of Denver from August 11-17, 2013. The Mile High Conferences on Nonassociative Mathematics provide a unique forum for all aspects of nonassociative mathematics.  This conference will bring together researchers working in various areas of nonassociative mathematics, including quasigroups and loops, Lie algebras and Jordan algebras, latin squares, 3-nets and latin square designs, and applications of octonions and nonassociative structures in physics. The interdisciplinary spirit of the conference is reflected not only in the selection of main speakers from various fields, but also in the composition of the Program and Organizing Committee. About 70 researchers are expected to participate. The main goals of the 3rd Mile High Conference are as follows: (i) To reinforce the Mile High Conferences as a leading series of conferences in nonassociative mathematics worldwide; (ii) To bring together scientists from all areas of nonassociative mathematics, hence promoting cross-disciplinary research; (iii) To make the conference accessible to graduate and post-doctoral students while also providing a forum for these young researchers; (iv) To encourage and support participation of researchers from underrepresented and underprivileged groups; (v) To publish conference proceedings in order to promote original research; (vi) To disseminate open problems in the various fields of nonassociative mathematics. All these goals address both the intellectual merit and the broader impact of the conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nonassociative mathematics is a broad field that interacts with many traditional areas of mathematics as well as mathematical sciences. For example, quasigroup theory and the octonions have found applications in relativistic physics and particle physics. Jordan algebras have proven to be useful in both physics and statistics, and latin squares also show up routinely in the latter field. Finally, the ubiquity of Lie algebras in mathematical sciences is well known. The Mile High Conferences in Nonassociative Mathematics strive to be one of the primary opportunities for people working in diverse parts of nonassociative mathematics to come together, exchange ideas and learn about the cutting edge of the field.
