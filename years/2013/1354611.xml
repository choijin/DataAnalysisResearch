<AbstractNarration>The proposal requests student travel support for The ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP 2013) and associated workshops.  The conference is being held in Boston MA during the period of September 22-28.  ICFP is the premier conference on all topics related to functional and higher-order programming and the meeting includes eight related workshops and symposia.  ICFP is the premier conference on all topics related to functional and higher-order programming.  Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF.  Broader impacts include building the next generation of researchers in this research area, as well as providing international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce.</AbstractNarration>

The grant was advsertised by the ICFP local organizing committee; the same team also administered the payments to the students (with the assistance of the ACM NSF team, which in essense "owned" the grant).  There was some confusion as to the eligibility criteria, but the most significant factor was delays in getting confirmation of no-cost extension to the ICFP team.
