<AbstractNarration>This award satisfies Division B, Title V, Sec. 543 of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2013 (P.L. 113-6, enacted on March 26, 2013). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual  Merit: The project is important to US national security interests because it addresses economic coercion that undermines democracy. Scholars have long recognized that rulers in non democracies can extend their tenure by subverting elections, focusing on ballot-box fraud, repression, turnout-buying, vote buying, patronage spending, and the co-optation of opposition elites. However, they have largely overlooked one prominent form of electoral subversion in contemporary hybrid regimes: the coercive mobilization of voters by employers. In many countries, employers - firm managers, supervisors, CEOs, landlords, bosses, directors and so on - use their leverage over workers to induce them to turn out and/or vote a specific way. Using surveys of 1) firm managers in Russia and 2) residents of Russia, Ukraine, Georgia, Honduras, Algeria, Lebanon, Mozambique, Botswana, South Africa, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Cambodia, this research seeks to identify the conditions under which firm managers apply political pressure on their employees during elections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research sheds light on an understudied means by which rulers in hybrid regimes subvert elections and forestall democratization.  It also identifies how the structure of the economy affects a country's prospects for regime change. In addition, while much of what we know about clientelism suggests that it is largely confined to poor, rural settings with tight-knit social networks, this research explores how clientelist exchange can persist in modern, industrial settings.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: By identifying the conditions that allow leaders to subvert elections via the workplace, this research will help policymakers and the democracy assistance community to develop programs that improve the integrity of elections. More specifically, the proposed research will lead to the development of vote monitoring techniques that can detect workplace electoral subversion and informational programs that can be deployed by NGOs to reduce the incidence of economic coercion in the workplace. The proposed research will also show how incomplete economic reform, which leaves firms dependent on the state, can make workers' voting rights vulnerable to infringement. Thus, this project will help policymakers understand how economic reforms that reduce state power over firms can help promote political liberalization.  Finally, this research contributes to our understanding of why and when hybrid regimes break down; an important public policy consideration in its own right.</AbstractNarration>

Next, we explored whether employers used positive inducements, such as small gifts, or negative inducements, such as threats of dismissal or cuts in pay to compel workers to engage in political activity. This distinction is important as it suggests different strategies for ending the practice. In Russia, we found that negative inducements were far more common than positive inducements, perhaps due to the relatively high average income.    In addition, we examined why some firms engaged in the workplace mobilization of their employees while others did not. We developed a number of arguments linking specific features of the firm &ndash; its size, property type, asset mobility, product line, level of competition &ndash; and specific features of the firm manager &ndash; ideology, partisanship, relations with the ruling party, prior work experience &ndash; to the propensity to engage in workplace mobilization of employees.    Of course, employers are not the only brokers mobilizing voters during elections.  Modern clientelist exchange is typically carried out by many different intermediaries---e.g. party activists, employers, local strongmen, traditional leaders---who mobilize voters on behalf of politicians, but we know little about the relative effectiveness of different types of brokers.  Using framing experiments and direct questions placed on surveys in Venezuela and Russia, we found that the average respondent is more likely to respond to turnout appeals from employers than they are to appeals by party activists.  Employers have a range of tools &ndash; from withholding salary, to firing, to denying promotion &ndash; that are not easily available to party activists. These tools give employers great power over the employees at election time.  We also found that that those voters most vulnerable to job loss and most embedded in workplace social networks were more likely to respond to clientelist mobilization by their bosses.      The project also had some professional development and training goals. It provided valuable training for a graduate student in Political Science at Columbia to develop his skills in analysis and empirical research. He now holds a tenure track position in Political Science at George Washington University and was recently awarded two-year postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard University.  In addition, we look forward to making public the survey data that we have collected during this project.   Finally, to ensure the validity of surveys in a non-democratic setting of Russia, we borrowed a technique for eliciting honest answers to sensitive questions that we hope will be used by other scholars conducting research in inhospitable environments.
