<AbstractNarration>The class of equations under study, called integrable systems, includes  several fundamental equations of nature. This is an old and venerable area of study which goes back to classical works of Liouville, Gauss, and Poincare. Currently, the theory of integrable systems has become  an expanding area  which plays an increasingly important role as one of the principal sources of new ideas for many branches of modern mathematics and theoretical physics. Simultaneously, it provides an efficient analytical tool for the study of some of the fundamental  mathematical models arising in  modern nonlinear science and technology. In addition to the traditional domain of differential equations, integrable techniques are becoming  common in  such diverse fields  as  string theory, statistical mechanics, random processes, quantum informatics,  and number theory. Many of the  problems considered in the project  have direct connections with these disciplines. Indeed,  the concrete analytical questions addressed in the project  are primarily motivated by the needs of the analytical theory  of quantum entanglement - a phenomenon which is expected to play a key role in a practical realization of quantum computing, and by the challenges of analytical  description of  fundamental issue of phase transition in the quantum and statistical mechanics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal goal of this research project is to address various  new analytical questions of the theory of integrable systems which have emerged from  recent developments in random matrix theory and in the theory of exactly solvable quantum models. In this project, the PI proposes to focus on three directions of research: the  asymptotic analysis of Toeplitz and Hankel determinants and the applications of these determinants  in random matrices and statistical mechanics,  the study of   Fredholm determinants arising in  random matrix theory, and the asymptotics of the correlation functions of non-free fermionic quantum spin models.  Each of these directions is represented by a collection of concrete problems, and they will be investigated within the same analytical framework, viz., the Riemann-Hilbert method.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ INTELECTUAL MERIT  The proposed project is a continuation of the PI's long term research efforts in the theory of Integrable systems and their numerous applications.   The term ``Integrable Systems''  usually refers to mathematical objects, most often differential equations, with  special  symmetry properties  which allow to study  them in a very detailed way and sometimes even to solve them  in a closed form.

It is concerned  with the theory  of Painlev\'e  tau functions which are playing increasingly  important role in many areas of the modern mathematics and theoretical physics;  indeed, the Painleve functions are dubbed as the ``special functions of the  XXIst century''.  BROADER IMPACT  The analysis of the double scaling limit of the sine-kernel determinant produces a quantitate description of very interesting phenomenon -  the   transition between  Poisson statistic and random matrix statistics in  the one dimensional Coulomb gas model  introduced in 1995 by Freeman Dyson.   The results of the PI and his collaborators concerning  the asymptotic analysis  of Toeplitz and Hankel determinants contribute to the study  of critical phenomena  in statistical mechanics - an enduring, fundamental problem in the field.   Specifically, the proof of the Basor-Tracy conjecture and the asymptotics of  the T+H determinants obtained by the PI with his co-workers  have already  made it possible to justify  various  asymptotic formulae that appeared   previously in the physical literature on  the basis of this conjecture.  These results have also been used in condensed matter physics  in recent studies of  quantum many-body systems  away  from  equilibrium and in testing  random matrix predictions in number theory.  The asymptotic solution of the operator - valued Riemann-Hilbert problem obtained  by the PIwith hiscollabotartor  makes animportant contribution towards resolution   of  one of the  most ``wanted'' problems in modern theory of integrable systems which is   to develop  a rigorous approach to the evaluation of the long distance asymptotics of the  correlation functions of the XXX and XXZ Heisenberg spin chains.    During the entire period of the award, the  PI has been engaged in many  educational activities: he has given five mini-courses in various world scientific  centers, has  supervised three graduate students (one successfully defended  his PhD in  2013), and has given  in total 62  invited  presentations including three Plenary Talks. Also, during the same period, the PI has published  24   research papers  in the major refereed  journals.           Last Modified: 09/15/2018       Submitted by: Alexander R Its]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
