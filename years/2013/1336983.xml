<AbstractNarration>1336983&lt;br/&gt;Wood&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary objective of the proposed research is to examine fast  (high Reynolds number) flows in porous media. A unified approach is proposed, which integrates three research elements (1) upscaling theory (the method of volume-averaging ) with closure, (2) direct numerical simulation (DNS) of flow in porous media, and (3) PIV experimental studies of flows in porous media.  The study will cover a broad range of Reynolds numbers [Re ~O(100-4000)]. The overall goal of this work is to provide a cohesive theory (with extensive experimental validation) to describe rather high velocity flows in a packed bed in a way that is consistent with the widely-used empirical expression known as the Darcy-Ergun-Forchheimer equation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The wide range of applications of high Re flows in porous media includes gas adsorption, filtration, catalyst reactions, combustion, heat transport and other processes in fixed bed reactors, nuclear reactors and subsurface groundwater remediation. Due to the complex and irregular flow geometry within the pore space, the confining aspects of the flow, and the variable length scales, it is difficult to properly define the mean flow structure and associated turbulence of high Re flows in porous materials. These same complexities make experimental observations and numerical simulations extremely difficult. To date there exist few detailed PIV or DNS data for turbulent flows in randomly packed porous media, and none that cross validate among DNS and experiment. The proposed research brings together unique and complementary expertise and capabilities in experimental, computational, and theoretical approaches. Combined experiments and simulation data will be used to enhance our understanding of the flow physics in porous materials. The upscaling approach, which will focus on providing a consistent theory, has the potential to transform modeling approaches for heat or scalar transport in densely packed porous media. The experiments will involve pore-scale velocity field data for both simple cubic packing and randomly packed porous beads using three-component time-resolved particle image velocimetry. The DNS work will focus on high-fidelity, fully resolved direct numerical simulations of steady/unsteady inertial, transitional and turbulent flows. The detailed data from both sources will elucidate the complex flow structures and turbulence characteristics needed to form a theoretical basis for the development of a predictive tool for macroscopic flow and transport properties in porous media. Specifically, the data will facilitate direct evaluation of non-linear, closure terms due to unresolved, sub-grid scales of motion in the model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research plan will become the basis for training students and helping them appreciate the need for the integrated analysis necessary for complex problems. The PIs have a track record of involving underrepresented groups in their laboratories, both graduate and undergraduates (such as Textronic Scholars [available to first-year women] and University Honors Students. This project will reach out to developing engineers to provide a learning opportunity through the OSU-SMILE mentoring program for middle school students (which targets underrepresented groups). International exposure through collaborations with Insitut de Mecanique des Fluides de Toulouse will also be available to students. In addition the graduate students will be supported through the proposed grant and departmental funds to present their work at international and national conferences. The investigators will plan two special sessions at international conferences (such as AGU) during the final year.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Fluid Dynamics and Particulate and Multiphase Processes Programs in Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems Division.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Although we may not think about chemical reactors in our everyday lives, they are an incredibly important component of the industrial processes that drive our economy.  We studied a particular kind of system called a "packed bed reactor".  Basically, packed bed reactors are made by adding reactive solid particles to a reactor vessel; these form a porous material (much like beach sand in a bucket).  These kinds of reactors are used in all kinds of processes, from petroleum products to processing the exhaust in automotive applications.      One of the features of these kinds of reactors is that they are frequently operated under conditions where the fluid is in a turbulent state.  Turbulence is the word we used to describe flows that contain a significant random or disordered component to them.  The roiling water in a river is a familiar example of turbulence; so are the cloud-like structures that are formed when cream is added to coffee.     Turbulent flows are so complicated that they are not well understood.  Although there are mathematical descriptions of such flows (these are called "force balance equations"), the solutions to these equations are so complex that it has only been in the last few years that supercomputers have become powerful enough solve them.      In packed bed reactors, even though the pores between particles are very small, there can still be turbulent flows in them.  Not much is known about such flows, in part because it is hard to see them in experiments.  In this work, we conducted a combination of experiments and a visualizations of these flows by solving the force balance equations on a large computer.  The result was that we were able to "see" the turbulence in the pore spaces, and thus learn more about how turbulence affects the flow in porous materials.  An example of a turbulent flow is provide in the image given by Figure 1.  This figure shows the flow between four particles in a packed bed under turbulent conditions.  The ribbons of color show path that fictitious particles released into the flow would follow (think here of releasing ping-pong balls at different locations across a stream; each ball would travel with a different path).  The color on these paths indicates how much "rotation" there is along the path &ndash; red indicates a large amount of rotation (or spin), and blue represents a smaller amount.  As you can see&mdash;the paths that particles would follow in turbulent flows very complex!     By better understanding turbulence in porous materials, we have the opportunity to improve the performance of chemical reactors.  These results are important in applications: much of the costs for processing chemicals comes from the cost of running pumps (which take lots of power!)  By understanding the structure of turbulent flows in a porous material, we can conceive of engineering materials better to reduce the amount of pumping energy needed, or we can consider changing the flow rate to optimize energy and reactor performance.   Not only did this research help generate new scientific information that may help to generate better reactoers, it also supported graduate students conducting research as part of their pursuit of a doctoral degree in engineering.  Supporting students in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) is essential for the US in maintaining global leadership in fields as wide ranging as medicine to industrial production of consumer goods (Figure 2). Many of the jobs in the next generate are expected to be in STEM fields; an example of anticipated job growth is given in Figure 2.  This research is helping to support students who will enter the work force in this important area.       Last Modified: 09/19/2017       Submitted by: Brian D Wood]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
