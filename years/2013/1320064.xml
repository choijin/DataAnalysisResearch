<AbstractNarration>This Cyberlearning: Transforming Education project brings together leading-edge researchers in computational linguistics and computer-supported collaborative learning to explore feasibility issues in designing an intelligent conversational agent that interacts with groups of learners as they are working together and provides cognitive, meta-cognitive, and social advice to enhance their collaborations. The conversational agent is being designed to enhance group dynamics by providing supportive advice as well as promoting awareness of the dynamics.  Design of the agent is informed by theories of meta-cognition, collaborative learning, and accountable talk. In addition to investigating how to design such agents and testing their effectiveness, investigators are exploring how learning develops when a conversational agent is available to help with productive talk, the influences of conversational behaviors on developing understanding and actions, and ways of influencing understanding and behaviors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the biggest limitations of online education, especially massive online courses (e.g., MOOCs), is personal contact with instructors and peers. While much of formal education focuses on faculty interactions with large groups of students in lectures, much student learning depends on interactions with teachers and teaching assistants and discussions, study sessions, and project work done with peers. Massive online education will be broadly successful only after we know how to provide these kinds of supports to online learners.  This project focuses on designing an interactive agent that can provide conversational support for small groups of collaborating students to help them productively solve problems and learn together.  The agent is being designed to provide the kinds of advice that a teacher or teaching assistant would provide if such a human mentor were available. The researchers conjecture that with such support available, online students can provide for each other the kinds of social supports for learning that contribute in integral ways to students' learning experiences in higher education. The agent is being deployed and tested in several different online courses. Results are expected to be applicable to massive online education as well as to blended educational environments such as flipped and project-based classrooms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The results of this project have been aimed at enhancing the collaborative element of online learning as a key component of creating effective environments for learning at scale.  Findings emerging from this work are providing alternative perspectives to traditional beliefs associated with collaborative learning. Specifically the findings argue against providing support primarily during collaborative activity and argue against a popular perception that verbal equity is a predictor of performance.  Instead, the results support the idea that positive impact can be achieved as well and sometimes better through careful group composition in preparation for collaboration and through support of reflection after collaboration.  Affordances for support of collaborative learning in online courses created under this grant are available for use in courses through the University of Pennsylvania's World Campus and through the Open Learning Initiative housed at Carnegie Mellon University and Stanford University.  Additionally, some software produced by this project is freely available as open source software resources offered through DANCE (dance.cs.cmu.edu).  The research has produced rubrics for assessment of collaboration as well as technology to automate assessment of collaborative processes in real time.  Borge?s development of rubrics to assess collaborative learning serve as bridge building efforts between the Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) community and core Computer Science fields. The rubrics developed to assess and guide collaborative learning have been shared with the office of Learning Initiativesat Co-PI Borge's university.  This project produced 32 publications over its life span, accumulating hundreds of citations altogether within this short time.  The most cited of these papers already has 188 citations, and another has 104 citations.  As part of their dissemination efforts, the PIs delivered over 40 invited talks, including keynote talks at major international conferences.  Among these, Rose delivered invited talks related to innovative approaches to assessment of collaboration at ETS, ACT, and the Association for Test Publisher?s conference, which is the biggest conference for assessment research and practice in the United States.  And beyond this, the work was disseminated through training opportunities such as a yearly Learning Sciences and Technology Summer School offered at Carnetic Mellon University.
