<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on why and how tea quality is vulnerable to changing climate conditions and how changes in quality may affect farming communities and land-use strategies.  Tea production and consumption systems are used as a case study to explore complex interactions among human and natural systems.  This interdisciplinary research project will examine how links among tea agroecosystems, markets, and farmers are impacted by increased climate variability and the resulting socioecological feedbacks.  The investigators will ground their research in socioecological and chemical ecology theory. They will employ a range of research methods, including field sampling in tea-producing areas of China; controlled greenhouse experiments; biochemical and sensory analyses of tea samples; consumer surveys of purchasing decisions and price modeling; farmer surveys of ecological knowledge, management, social networks, and livelihoods; and multivariate modeling of climate and management scenarios.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide new information and insights regarding climate effects on crop quality and to facilitate societal actions towards sustainability of agro-ecosystems and farmer livelihoods. The project will enhance theoretical understandings regarding human-environment relationships and shed new light on the dynamics of climate change, agroecosystems, markets, and agricultural practices.  Project findings will assist in the development of evidence-based management plans and policy suggestions for land-use organizations in tea producing areas.  Although this project focuses on tea production and related environmental conditions in China, it will yield insights that have value in exploring the complex relationships between quality-related market-driven forces and changing natural conditions for a broad range of environmentally sensitive resource-related activities across the globe.  Examples of other economic activities for which real and perceived changes in product quality associated with even-minor changes in environmental conditions may have profound impacts include wine production in the U.S. and elsewhere, cherry production in Washington state and Michigan, and skiing conditions in the Rockies and New England.  This project is supported by the NSF Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH) Program.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Millions of farmers depend on the production of specialty food and beverage crops to sustain their livelihoods. Increasing temperatures and changing patterns of rainfall challenge the ability of farmers to produce high-quality specialty crops, but some agricultural practices and innovation can help farmers adapt. Because farmers are part of a global supply chain, consumers choices may influence adoption of costly or risky climate adaptation strategies by farmers. Our team used tea production in China as a model system to explore the impact of precipitation and temperature on (i) tea quality, (ii) farmer livelihoods, and (iii) the potential for farmer adaptation, either directly via management practices or indirectly via consumer behavior.</p> <p>Using newly developed state-of-the-art tools we measured how the chemicals in tea that determine quality (e.g. flavor and health benefits) are affected by precipitation and temperature. &nbsp;We found that high precipitation increased tea plant growth, but decreased quality to such an extent that farmers often did not even harvest a crop. High temperatures were also found to negatively impact tea quality. In contrast, tea grown in low rainfall environments and cooler temperature produced tea that contained pleasing flavor and more health beneficial compounds.</p> <p>While changing patterns of temperature and precipitation pose challenges to farmers, our studies identified factors that can help them adapt directly to these challenges. For example, we found that more biodiverse tea farms are more resilient to the effects of climate change on tea quality. Also, leaves harvested in low quality growing seasons can still be sold for extraction of health beneficial compounds. Finally, allowing some pest insect attack can improve the quality of tea (due to the defensive compounds the tea plant produces) enough to increase farmer income despite reductions in yield.</p> <p>&nbsp;Since many of the management practices we identified for climate resilience are also known to reduce the carbon footprint of tea production, there is potential for indirect consumer-mediated adaptation of these practices. Indeed, consumers are willing to pay a significant premium for agricultural mitigation of carbon emissions, thus providing a potential incentive for farmers to employ the identified adaptation strategies. The capacity of farmers to adapt, however, depends on various factors, including social networks, ecological knowledge, access to markets, and contribution of tea sales to their income. To integrate these factors, we developed a conceptual model to characterize farmer responses to climate-driven changes on tea systems. Our model emphasizes the inherent propensity of farmers to experiment and innovate within a social context that determines the outcome.</p> <p>Our project contributes an interdisciplinary model to examine impacts of global environmental change on specialty crop quality using a coupled natural and human systems framework that integrates chemical ecology and socio-ecological theories. For example, by integrating ecological theory and novel analytical approaches, we can better understand how climate variability affects crop quality, consumer decisions, and ultimately farmer livelihoods. In turn our detailed work exploring farmer knowledge and consumer behaviors then provides an important perspective to management practices that can help farmers adapt. In fact, the chemical, consumer and socio-ecological tools developed for this project on climate effects on food and beverage quality and farmer livelihoods are being applied to understand the resilience of other coupled human natural systems, including coffee in Costa Rica, wild foods in tribal communities in Montana, and sugar maple syrup in New England.&nbsp;</p> <p>Future advances require working across disciplines.
