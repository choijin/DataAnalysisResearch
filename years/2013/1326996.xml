<AbstractNarration>1326996&lt;br/&gt;Nicholas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) are uniquely capable of improving the efficiency of today's hydrocarbon-based economy while simultaneously enabling  a transition to a carbon-neutral energy economy. Aspects which support this contention are 1) the highest possible combined heat and power efficiency (90%) of any energy conversion technology, 2) gravimetric energy densities comparable to internal combustion engines and ~5x higher than the best Li-ion batteries, 3) gravimetric power densities comparable to the best Li-ion batteries and ~3x higher than internal combustion engines, 4) the co-generation of high-quality waste heat that can be used for water-heating, space heating, or the production of additional electricity, and 5) an ability to use either hydrocarbons (gasoline, propane,  natural gas, etc.) or hydrogen as a fuel. Unfortunately, SOFC research and development efforts have suffered from technical challenges, funding scarcity/inconsistency, and a lack of public awareness. The objective of this proposal is to organize a SOFC Promise, Progress, and Priorities workshop that will allow representatives from academia, industry, and government to exchange ideas on how to best advance SOFC technology, through a series of moderated discussions and completion of various technology assessment tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These objectives will be met by convening federal officials, corporate representatives, and academic SOFC researchers for a workshop at the Westin Arlington Gateway Hotel in Arlington, VA from July 11-12, 2013.  Jason Nicholas of Michigan State University is the primary Organizer for the Workshop. The workshop will engage the 36 invited participants and 14 general participants in poster presentations, review panels, committee meetings, and open discussions. Workshop conclusions will be disseminated through the publication of an open-access, peer-reviewed workshop summary article and by the online posting of committee reports, constituency whitepapers, and the workshop summary.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will have a broad impact by advancing a technology capable of improving the nation's environmental quality, economic sustainability, and national security. The workshop will result in improved awareness of the unique benefits of SOFCs by the public and the scientific community. The workshop will also improve the participation and impact of women and underrepresented minorities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields by having these individuals serve on high-visibility panel reviews and as committee chairs/co-chairs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) and Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cells (SOECs) (i.e. SOFCs operated in reverse) are solid-state devices that can be used to a) convert between chemical and electrical energy and/or b) drive chemical reactions.  These capabilities make them attractive for energy conversion, energy storage, chemical sensing, chemical separation, and chemical synthesis applications.  To articulate the unique benefits of these promising technologies and spur consensus on a successful SOFC/SOEC development path, leaders from academia, industry, the U.S. government, and the public policy community came together on July 11-12, 2013 in Alexandria, Virginia for a National Science Foundation (NSF) sponsored Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Promise, Progress, and Priorities (SOFC-PPP) workshop.  Consensus opinions from this workshop were published in a 5-page workshop highlights article that 1) lists the workshop participants, 2) summarizes the promise of SOFC/SOEC technology 3) describes the current challenges limiting SOFC/SOEC development, 4) identifies emerging research areas, and 5) makes US fuel cell policy recommendations.

The highlights article is available for download at: https://www.electrochem.org/dl/interface/wtr/wtr13/wtr13_p049_054.pdf  The intellectual merit of this report is evidenced by the fact that as of July 31, 2014 it has already been cited in the peer-reviewed literature and was downloaded 1,121 times since its January 11, 2014 publication date. With its ability to educate policymakers, the scientific community, and the public at large about SOFC/SOEC technology, this highlights article has ensured the SOFC-PPP workshop had a broad impact.  As noted in the SOFC-PPP highlights article and thoroughly examined in the 133 page SOFC-PPP Final Report, the consensus view of the SOFC-PPP participants was that a National Academy Study on Fuel Cells should be conducted in order to:  Identify the relative strengths, relative weaknesses, and synergistic opportunities for different fuel cell applications across military and civilian application in the context of reducing the need for logistics support, readily available fuels, and the need to implement the technology in light of a diversified U.S. energy mix. Quantify the cost and performance targets necessary to make fuel cells commercially viable in various markets. Identify opportunities that advances in basic research could offer to overcome critical fuel cell cost and performance gaps, to improve the understanding of fuel cell components, materials, and chemistry, and to achieve disruptive technology breakthroughs leading to very high performance or low cost fuel cell technologies. Review current major government fuel cell policies and programs, including in the United States, Europe, and Japan, and assess implications for industry and market competitiveness.  Evaluate how effective various federal fuel cell R&amp;D funding programs have been at meeting their stated goals, paying specific attention to program management, the responsiveness of federal agencies to recommendations made in previous National Academies reviews, and other topics that the National Academies committee finds important to comment upon.  Recommend policy initiatives that would establish a long-range strategy for achieving significant advances in fuel cell science and technology and strengthen support across government, industry, and the public for U.S. fuel cell applications.
