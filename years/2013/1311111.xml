<AbstractNarration>The genus Buddleja, commonly called the butterfly-bushes, is a group of flowering plants that includes approximately 110 species of shrubs and trees.  They exhibit great diversity in the architecture of inflorescences, the structures in which groups of flowers are arranged, which has been hypothesized to be adaptations to different habitats and pollinators.  Also, the group has a wide distribution, including areas of Africa, Asia, North America, and South America.  Hypotheses concerning the geographic origin and dispersal history of the group and its relationship to past geologic and climatic events have been proposed but remain untested.  The PIs will conduct a molecular phylogenetic study of the genus, using DNA sequences from multiple loci to infer evolutionary relationships among species.  A novel high-throughput method of gathering genetic data will be developed.  The inferred phylogenetic tree will be used in further analyses to test hypotheses about inflorescence architecture evolution and biogeographic history.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reproductive architecture, including inflorescence form, is an important component of the success and diversification of flowering plants, and this project will contribute to elucidating patterns in its evolution and adaptive significance.  The study of biogeographic history is important for understanding the formation of modern floras and current distributional patterns.  Buddleja includes many species of conservation, ethnobotanical, and horticultural interest.  Understanding species relationships will help guide future research in this group.</AbstractNarration>

As a plant systematist, Chau is interested in plant diversity and the processes and patterns in how it originates. <em>Buddleja</em> is a genus with more than a hundred species, with a distribution spanning four continents and a rich diversity of flower and inflorescence forms. Chau's research focused on elucidating the relationships among species in the group, and using knowledge of the phylogeny, or family tree, to explore other questions about its evolutionary history, including how it attained such a large geographic range. Case studies on diverse groups like <em>Buddleja</em> can illuminate general patterns in how life on Earth evolved.</p> <p>Modern studies on evolutionary relationships rely on comparing molecular data, particularly DNA sequences. In order to obtain DNA sequences, fresh or properly preserved tissue from a species is required, which is often not available for rare species from regions outside the U.S. During his funding period, Chau was able to travel to several regions whose flora includes <em>Buddleja</em> species, including South Africa, China, Bolivia, Costa Rica, and the southwest U.S. The specimens he collected were used in his molecular work and will be preserved in herbaria, museum collections of plant specimens that serve as permanent records of the flora at a particular time and place.</p> <p>The results of Chau's work revealed the broad patterns in the relationships in <em>Buddleja</em>. Species from the same region, like the Americas, Asia, or Madagascar, form groups of closely related species, which conflicts with previous classifications that grouped species by morphology.

He found that <em>Buddleja</em> originated in southern Africa. From Africa, the group spread in separate events to the Americas, Asia, and Madagascar. These movements are inferred to have occurred about 10 million years ago, when a warmer climate may have allowed the plants to grow at higher latitudes in regions that connected the continents. Upon reaching the mountainous, complex environment of the American cordilleras, the group exploded into many new species, producing the diversity observed today.
