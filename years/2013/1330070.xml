<AbstractNarration>This cross-cultural research investigates cultural models (CMs) of nature held by populations across several cultures and five continents ranging from long-time primary food producers, e.g., farmers, fishermen, herders (and also hunters and gatherers) to those who recently shifted to become primary food consumers due to globalization forces. CMs of nature, typically held out of one's or a community's awareness, affect environmental actions in ways not necessarily predicted by more traditional ecological models. The project comprises fifteen scholars and six graduate students who are experts in a particular cultural area. Linguistic and experimental data will be collected and analyzed by a common protocol that combines qualitative and quantitative approaches. Methodology and ethnography play paramount roles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers expect to discover a variety of CMs of nature that characterize each community investigated. These CMs represent specific organizations of the constitutive categories underlying the concept of nature, that is, humans, animals, plants, weather, physical environment, and the supernatural. They also expect causal relationships to be one of the major forces (in addition to spatial relationships) weaving together these categories. Similarly, while attributed to different elements and in a different potency, intentionality will be universally present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results, because of the focus on primary food producers, will provide insights on how this kind of population typically constructs a CM of nature. In addition, one can explore the possibility that conceptions of space are central to the construction of CMs (in this case, of nature), thus, provide supporting evidence for an architecture of the mind that includes a major role for the spatial domain in the forming of other domains of knowledge. Finally and more importantly, the findings are intended to supply policy makers, i.e., major actors in finding solutions to climate change induced problems, with information on indigenous CMs of nature that will assist them in their decision-making.</AbstractNarration>

In discussing changes in agriculture and problems with these changes, peopleÃ†s dominant focus was that the soil no longer produces like it used to, with a some people referring to the soil as being worn out or tired. The people say that there is:  decreased soil productivity a greater lack of water more extreme weather (heat, cold, rain, wind) an increase in microbial and insect pests a shift in the timing of the weather during the year   When asked an open-ended question about why these changes might be occurring, all but one person said that humans were responsible for the weather and environmental changes that have been occurring, specifically by:  cutting down trees that would otherwise hold back desertification burning trees, grassland and crop residues which all protect soil moisture increasing the number of factories and the size of cities&mdash;thus polluting the earth using agrochemicals that poison humans, animals, soil and water (although some at the same time see agrochemicals as beneficial by supporting good levels of production) disposing of waste and garbage into the waterways and on the ground   People also discussed this theme "We are to blame" in moral terms, by claiming:  we have been lazy we are egotistically doing whatever we want we are teaching children poorly we are getting on poorly with others   Following along with peopleÃ†s discussion of these environmental changes their perceptions of those changes in causal terms, the researcher produced a cultural model of how people see the relationship between elements of nature. The following is a summary of that cultural model:  The soil and its productivity is affected by lack of water--because of cutting trees, and the lack of organic matter due to burning&mdash;and the soil is affected by pollution from factories, cities, a...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
