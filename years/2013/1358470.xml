<AbstractNarration>Overview: Across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), fluxes of heat and momentum and other dynamical quantities establish the heat budget for the whole Southern Ocean, govern the strength of the ACC and its vital inter-ocean exchanges, and arguably govern the main vertical density structure of the world oceans. Yet, theoretical concepts, numerical models, and the sparse observational records give conflicting views of the mechanisms and magnitude of transfers across the ACC. South of about 55Â° S the puzzle is further confounded, because the heat fluxes associated with wind-driven Ekman transport and its counterbalancing meridional overturning circulation, that are strong and dominant at lower latitudes, become weak. At that latitude, it falls to cross-frontal processes arising from mean and eddying flow to complete the heat budget. It is particularly puzzling how fluxes cross the several ocean fronts, e.g., from Subantarctic Front  to Polar Front to Southern ACC Front. Observations of heat and momentum fluxes and mixing are vitally needed at additional sites around the ACC to inform global climate modeling efforts. Of particular interest is how the oceanic meridional overturning circulation absorbs and redistributes heat and carbon that is critical to the earth's climate. In this study, an array of Current and Pressure recording Inverted Echo Sounders (CPIES) will be deployed for a period of two years to observe and quantify exchanges of buoyancy, heat, momentum and potential vorticity across the ACC as it flows near the Udintsev Fracture Zone in the central South Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. The CPIES have been shown to be particularly well suited for these measurements. The Udintsev Fracture Zone has been selected because the three main fronts (Subantarctic Front, Polar Front, and Southern ACC Front) converge closely together as they deflect equatorward where they encounter complex shallower ridges and exhibit strong eddy variability in the lee. Therefore, the Udintsev Fracture Zone emerges as a likely location for mean and eddy fluxes to combine to cross the entire ACC system. This project is an international collaboration with a team of French and Korean scientists with complementary goals to deploy tall current meter moorings and conduct CTD surveys in this region.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Mesoscale eddies are thought to play a key role in ACC dynamics, with cross-frontal exchange by eddies forming the underpinning of the meridional overturning circulation. Recent studies suggest that this exchange occurs locally in "hot spots" found in the lee of bathymetric obstacles, yet direct estimates of eddy fluxes from ocean measurements are scarce, both globally and especially within the Southern Ocean. Two Current and Pressure recording Inverted Echo Sounders (CPIES) arrays are proposed. The northern array is within the strong eddy region between the Subantarctic Front and Polar Front (where they neighbor closely), and the southern array is located near the Southern ACC Front where historically few measurements have been made. These sites have been selected as candidates where eddy and mean cross-frontal fluxes are likely to be strongest. The CPIES arrays will quantify the role of eddies in redistributing heat, momentum and energy throughout the full water column. The French and Korean tall moorings will provide measurements of currents and temperature at fixed levels, providing complementary estimates of mean and eddy fluxes. The knowledge gained regarding eddy fluxes is crucially important for conceptual understanding of the dynamical balances that control the ACC and drive the overturning circulation and to quantitatively guide future modeling efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: A quality-controlled daily time series of density and currents determined from the CPIES measurements will be disseminated broadly. Combined with data from the current meter moorings, data products suitable for validating numerical models and improving prediction of the cross-frontal flux of momentum, heat, and potential vorticity will be produced. New technology for remote transmission of CPIES data via pop-up data capsules will be tested for use in the strong current, high sea state remote Southern Ocean. Dual pressure sensors will be installed in two CPIES to investigate the calibration-drift of these sensors. An engineering undergraduate student will join the University of Rhode Island technical team and assist CPIES upgrades and preparations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For climate studies it is important to understand the exchange of heat from the subtropics across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) toward Antarctica and its melting ice. Eddy-driven heat flux is the predominant mechanism, and the required eddy measurements have in the past only been made at a small number of isolated sites.  Yet the ACC extends around the globe, and there is great variation in cross-frontal exchange from one location to another.  Poleward eddy heat flux was estimated along the whole path of the ACC using satellite observations of variability in sea surface height, as follows:      A power-law relationship between eddy heat flux and sea surface height standard deviation had been suggested by direct observations in the cDrake experiment. This relationship was corroborated locally and around the full ACC using the Southern Ocean State Estimate numerical model. This relationship was applied to observed satellite sea surface height standard deviation to determine global estimates of poleward eddy heat fluxes. Enhanced eddy heat fluxes occurred in a handful of hot spots that are associated with major topographic ridges as well as in regions where the ACC interacts with subtropical western boundary currents.  Within individual hot spots, cross-front exchange tends to cross only a northern, middle, or southern portion of the ACC.  This implies a that a sequence of hand-offs of heat must occur between neighboring ACC fronts and frontal zones as the several current jets encounter the different eddy heat flux hot spots along their circumpolar path.  Temporal trends of increasing down-gradient eddy heat fluxes between 1993 and 2014 occurred at three of the eight eddy heat flux hot spots.  Mesoscale eddy dynamics play a crucial role in exchanges of water properties across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC).
