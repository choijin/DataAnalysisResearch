<AbstractNarration>The principal investigator (PI) will conduct theoretical and applied research on distance correlation methods, with applications to high-dimensional astrophysical databases. This research will be accomplished with co-authors in statistics and astronomy, and with graduate students. The PI and a Co-PI will develop Hankel transforms for distributions on matrix spaces and apply the results to develop goodness-of-fit testing procedures for data consisting of symmetric positive definite random matrices. The PI and a Co-PI will analyze high-dimensional astrophysical databases on galaxy clusters to identify associations and correlations between multiple astrophysical variables.  Research on distance correlation measures for mixtures of Gaussians and general heavy-tailed distributions will be carried out.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The advances in inference for data consisting of positive definite random matrices will be applied to develop new statistical theory and methods for modeling variability in biological shapes and analyzing the movement of water molecules in biological tissue. The research program benefits human development and education in the society through the training of graduate students and joint research with post-doctoral and faculty colleagues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of the project were:  To carry out theoretical and applied research on distance correlation methods, with application to medical imaging and high-dimensional astrophysical databases; to continue research on kurtosis tests for multivariate normality with monotone incomplete data; and to conduct research with graduate students and co-authors in statistics and astronomy.  The specific objectives of this project were:  The derivation of new theoretical results for distance correlation measures for data on Euclidean spaces, application of distance correlation methods to high-dimensional astrophysical data, and applications to tomography and other medical imaging techniques.  The major activities of the PIs:  The PIs conducted research in collaboration with each other and with research colleagues, postgraduate fellows, graduate students, and undergraduate students.  This research was carried out at Penn State University, PA, at the University of Heidelberg, Germany, at the Institute of Statistical Mathematics, Japan, at the Institute of Science and Technology, Austria, and at the Astronomical Institute of the Slovak Academy of Sciences, Slovakia.  The PIs and their co-authors gave numerous invited lectures, seminar talks, and confererence presentations at many institutes, universities, and conferences.  These research efforts led to numerous research publications and to the on-going preparation of other manuscripts.  Impact on the development of the principal disciplines of the project:   The distance correlation method is a new approach to measuring and assessing the strength of correlation between collections of variables, which is fundamental to the statistical analysis of data in all areas of science. The primary impact on the principal discipline of statistics is that the distance correlation method is more powerful than classical Pearson-type correlation techniques which are used routinely in data analysis. Hence, distance correlation represents a fundamental advance in statistical data analysis.  Moreover, the results in the publications of the PI and co-PIs provide additional support for the use of the distance correlation method, novel applications to astrophysical data and multivariate time series, and further theoretical advances in the mathematical foundations of the distance correlation method.  Impact on other disciplines:  The distance correlation method is a new approach to measuring and assessing the strength of correlation between collections of variables, which is fundamental to the statistical analysis of data in all areas of science.  Impact on the development of human resources:  The project has resulted in new and broad research problems for  graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty in the mathematical  sciences, computer sciences, and astrophysical sciences. The project also resulted in the training of graduate students and to the broader intellectual development of the PIs.  Impact on society beyond science and technology:  The problem of correlation vs. causation is a fundamental conundrum in all areas of society. The ability of the distance correlation method to assess the strength of existing nonlinear relationships between collections of variables will result in widespread use of the distance correlation coefficient beyond the boundaries of science, engineering, and the academic world.   The project has resulted in new and broad research problems for  graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and faculty in the mathematical  sciences, computer sciences, and astrophysical sciences.
