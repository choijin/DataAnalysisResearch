<AbstractNarration>More than 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created daily in the form of sensor measurements, web posts and clicks, surveillance videos, purchase transactions, and health-care records. However, not all data collected is informative and not all features are relevant to the outcomes of interest. While several researchers have focused attention on compressive sampling for minimum error data reconstruction to improve data storage and acquisition, the objective of this research is broader and is focused on salient feature discovery. The key insight is sparsity, namely, that there is a tight coupling between a small relevant set of observations and the outcomes of interest. This research is focused on the sparse identification of the most relevant observations that are essential to predicting the outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators will develop a new information-theoretic framework and algorithmic tools for understanding the intrinsic relationships and sparse interactions between outcomes of interest and a set of features/observations in order to improve inferencing capabilities for enhanced decision-making in the context of this data-deluge. The goal is to discover the most relevant sparse subset of features that are essential to predicting the outcomes, and to uncover the fundamental limits of the associated sparse models. The approach is based on a unifying Shannon information-theoretic framework, whereby the problem of salient feature identification is mapped to a problem of capacity analysis for an equivalent channel model. This research addresses challenges posed by models with correlated features, models with missing features, models with latent variables, and the non-linearities of the measurement processes, in a unified way. Furthermore, this research involves the development of data-driven sparse recovery algorithms that reinforce the value of information when the underlying statistical models are partially or completely unknown. The investigators will use the developed methods to enhance the detection of sparse mixtures of explosives with fluorescence sensor arrays, and to identify high-degree hubs in computer networks using network tomography.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this project is to develop a new unifying information-theoretic framework and algorithmic tools for understanding sparse interactions between outcomes of interest and a set of features in large datasets. The aim is to discover the most relevant subset of features that are essential to predicting the outcomes, and to uncover the fundamental limits of the corresponding sparse models. A second goal of this project is to develop data-driven sparse recovery and structure learning algorithms that reinforce the value of information when the underlying statistical models are partially or completely unknown for a host of applications.  This project was successful in achieving the following key outcomes.  * Deriving unifying capacity formulae through a new Shannon-theoretic framework characterizing the sample complexity for sparse models, irrespective of the underlying model specifics.  * Development of data-driven recovery and learning algorithms that leverage low-dimensional structures inherent to much of the prevalent data to achieve substantial gains in the sample and computational complexities even in the presence of outliers.  * Development of new algorithms for signal reconstruction under structural and physical sensing constraints.    * Publishing a number of peer-reviewed articles in the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, Signal Processing Letters, as well as machine learning and signal processing conferences such as ICML, Allerton, ICCV, Asilomar, GlobalSIP, ITA, CISS.  * Imparting training at both the graduate and undergraduate levels and nurturing several fruitful collaborations of interdisciplinary nature.  Specifically, this project led to the following key milestones:  Fundamental information-theoretic limits for sparse signal processing: We developed fundamental information-theoretic bounds for diverse sparse signal processing models, including sparse regression, noisy group testing, multivariate regression, graphical models, and problems with missing features and latent variables. This work bridges the traditional divide between noisy channel coding and sparse signal processing theories through providing a notion of capacity -- the holy grail of channel coding theory -- for all sparse systems. The developed insights, bounds and analysis techniques contribute to the knowledge-base and advance the theory of sparse signal processing with linear and non-linear observation models.  Learning and recovery from big and high-dimensional data:  We have developed new scalable and robust learning algorithms for matrix decomposition, subspace recovery, subspace clustering, signal reconstruction, and sampling from structured and corrupted data. These algorithms provably bring about stunning speedups in the management and processing of ever-increasing amounts of data encountered in health-care, defense and commercial applications. We have explored these algorithms in the context of video analytics for activity detection, motion segmentation and video summarization, image processing for removing shadows from facial images captured under different illumination conditions, recommender systems for learning users? preferences for different products, optical interferometry for modal reconstruction under practical hardware constraints, brain computer interfacing for detecting visual evoked potentials in presence of background neural noise, and network security for reliable defense against jamming attacks.
