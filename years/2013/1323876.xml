<AbstractNarration>Michael Heckenberger and Stephanie Alem√°n of the University of Florida will conduct participatory mapping using differential GPS (dGPS) and GIS of historical landscapes and collaborative research on local knowledge about areas of historical occupations and land-use among indigenous communities. The research will take place among the Amerindian (Lokono) communities in two study areas in the Berbice and Demerera River areas of Guyana. The research builds on previous research supported by NSF Archaeology, which initiated participatory mapping of pre-Columbian and historical archaeological features of the landscape. These features are well known to local communities and reveal the rich cultural heritage of these Amerindian communities, including a dynamic history of interaction with European colonists and imported African peoples. Several major episodes of pre-Columbian landscape modification have been defined, including mid-Holocene villages and late Holocene settled agriculturalists, with earthen agricultural mounds and associated managed wetlands and forest islands. These occupations at their maximal expression in pre-contact and earliest colonial occupations represent the maximal expression of production and settlement networks and are clearly the cultural antecedents of historical Lokono peoples. Historical sites are known from the early 16th century and include several major episodes, including divergent trajectories of missionized Demerera River community and Berbice plantation communities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through participatory mapping of these settlements and focused study with specialists on local histories, general ecology and ethno-botanical knowledge, the latter portion of this rich history will be explored, including local knowledge and contemporary land-use of pre-Columbian settlement sites and production landscapes, notably agricultural areas, managed wetlands and forest islands.  The project expands participatory research on local knowledge related to the archaeological landscape related to indigenous oral history, contemporary land-use and ethnobotany.  All studies will be conducted with indigenous para-technicians with the primary objective of creating geo-spatial data on the Lokono historical landscape from multiple spatio-temporal scales that will be incorporated in project GIS. The project design and outcomes will be discussed during initial training workshop and entrance and exit group forums of research participants and local community leaders, including interviews to gauge changing perceptions and knowledge domains (knowledge maps). The project also involves synergistic activities with project co-director George Simon, a professor at the University of Guyana and Lokono, under the auspices of the Guyana Ministry of Culture and Walter Roth Museum. Results of the project will have important implications for indigenous cultural heritage in the region and sustainable land-use based on historical patterns.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project with the Arawak-speaking indigenous communities along the middle Berbice River, Guyana was conducted between September 2013 and May 2015.  Three primary field activities included: (1) participatory ethnoecological survey, focusing on ethnobotanical inventory, ethnoecological zonation, explorations of concepts of identity, history and cultural heritage among local Berbice Arawak; (2) participatory mapping of cultural features and resources in Berbice Arawak traditional territories, focusing on areas of landscape modification associated with late pre-Columbian and colonial period occupations; and (3) group forums and interviews of local conceptions of cultural heritage and collaboration, including co-participation by diverse Amerindian and some non-indigenous participants, as well as synergistic activities with government and academic institutions in Georgetown.  This overall goal of the project was to consider: (1) how indigenous groups retain significant knowledge regarding past landscape modifications; (2) how cultural heritage is informs contemporary practices and identities; and (3) what aspects of Berbice River landuse and ecological knowledge are comparable to other Arawak and non-Arawak indigenous groups (Waiwai), as well as non-indigenous groups in Guyana; and (4) development of robust colloborative research design and protocols through training and participatory methods in the Berbice River region and more broadly among indigenous groups across Guyana.  One of the key question of the research was: How does the materialization of the past through archaeological recovery, historical texts, ethnoecology and oral history impact the lived experience and historical identities of those whose 'past' is made present in such ways? We have accessed ethnographically the current understandings and meanings of the ways in which the history of the region has been created and by and for whom, and have begun to synthesize this into a larger picture of the region. For these groups, materializing of the past entails not just intellectual questions of origins and recognizable change but urgent issues of identity and destiny in the postcolonial state of Guyana and within larger global contexts of conservation, development, indigenism and social justice.  Importantly, the research demonstrated the strong local attachment with forested areas.  Most oral histories and other narratives pertain to forest settings, while occupations and communication routes across non-forested landscapes are less central.  Notably, while the area is noted for large-scale manioc production, as reflected in colonial documents from the early 17th century, there is no evidence that forested areas, lying adjacent to rivers and streams, were ever significantly cut in slash-and-burn. This articulates with findings from pre-Columbian sites interpreted as raised agricultural fields and managed wetlands. This holds important clues not only for regional cultural heritage but also for contemporary resource management, notably sustainable land use without permanent forest conversion.  A floristic inventory of the ethnobotanically significant plants recognized by the Berbice Arawak as well as the ways in which they currently use the landscape has now been completed and is in preparation for publication. Interviews with participants on the nature and success of the work have also resulted in a detailed understanding of the way in which local collaborators conceive of archaeological and anthropological work as well as how local people would like to benefit from the results of such work being presented to government and academic audiences.  Initial results suggest a general pool of highly diverse knowledge that is deployed in hybrid social and geographic settings. This suggests that basic divisions based on linguistic affiliation and geographic propinquity can tend to mask diverse linkages between these groups, which is an argument that has colored regional anthropo...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
