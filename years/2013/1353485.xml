<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a new high brightness light engine platform by monolithically integrating high performance silicon transistors with compound semiconductor optoelectronic materials.  Dense arrays of light emitting diodes (LEDs) have been previously fabricated to show the opportunity of using such arrays in microdisplay and projection concepts.  However, without active control circuits, the ultimate brightness and resolution are limited.  The technology developed in this SBIR uniquely allows for the fabrication of LED arrays with integrated control circuits on a single substrate enabling a light engine platform with high peak brightness, high dynamic range, and high efficiency.  Prototype LED arrays and transistor devices have been fabricated, and the next step to realize this platform is the development of advanced silicon circuitry to directly control the LED arrays and color generation methods to achieve full-color displays.  The anticipated results of this project are on-chip driving circuits and development of color generation methods which will be integrated with arrays of LEDs to form a commercially-ready prototype.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of a light engine with a power efficiency, brightness, cost, and form factor unavailable in incumbent systems.  In particular, three markets are identified where this technology significant advantages over current technologies.  These include the microdisplay market, the pico projector market, and the projector market.  This light engine platform offers a small form factor, long lifetime, environmental robustness, high energy efficiency, and the high brightness required for sunlight readability.  These features are necessary to create truly ubiquitous display devices and enable new see-through augmented reality experiences or smaller, more integrated portable projectors, not possible with current technologies.  Commercialization of this device will impact all of these areas and also enable a range of new downstream applications including other non-display industries, such as, 3D scanning and novel user interfaces.</AbstractNarration>
