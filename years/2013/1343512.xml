<AbstractNarration>The "Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry in the Southeast" will take place from 3:30 on Friday, November 8, 2013 until noon on Sunday, November 10, 2013 at the University of South Carolina. There is a strong and growing Commutative Algebra community in the Southeast and there is a strong and growing Algebraic Geometry community in the Southeast. The purpose of the  "Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry in the Southeast" conference is to foster collaborations between researchers at different institutions and encourage interaction between the Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry communities.  There will be nine lectures and a poster session where graduate students will present their work. The list of speakers includes renown experts as well as junior researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry are established and active areas of mathematics that have deep connections with each other and with many other subjects. They both study similar questions from somewhat different points of view. Both disciplines profit when there is inter-communication. The conference will provide opportunities for experts in these two fields to share ideas and techniques from one of the fields that might be beneficial to the other field, as well as opportunities for students and young researchers to exchange ideas, start collaborations, and be exposed to new mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference website can be found at http://www.math.sc.edu/~kustin/CA-AGMeeting.html.</AbstractNarration>
