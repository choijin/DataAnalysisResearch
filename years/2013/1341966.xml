<AbstractNarration>This research focuses on integrating M-ary distributed detection and &lt;br/&gt;communications, and makes a significant impact on the theory and &lt;br/&gt;practice of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and cognitive radio networks &lt;br/&gt;(CRNs). In particular, the following four problems are tackled.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) M-ary distributed detection: The PI develops fusion rules and local &lt;br/&gt;decision rules for M-ary distributed detection systems with different &lt;br/&gt;wireless channel models, and studies how the erroneous channels &lt;br/&gt;fundamentally limit the performance of these systems. Furthermore, two &lt;br/&gt;composite M-ary distributed detection problems that have applications in &lt;br/&gt;WSNs and CRNs are investigated: joint detection and localization of &lt;br/&gt;multiple acoustic sources and spectrum sensing in a multi-channel &lt;br/&gt;system. (2) Sequential methods for wireless distributed detection &lt;br/&gt;systems: Striving to gain a profound understanding of the tradeoffs &lt;br/&gt;between static and sequential distributed detection in wireless &lt;br/&gt;networks, the PI designs two sequential distributed detection systems &lt;br/&gt;with i) sequential tests only at the sensors and ii) sequential test &lt;br/&gt;only at the fusion center, and studies how the detection reliability and &lt;br/&gt;delay of static and sequential detection systems are affected by the &lt;br/&gt;adopted wireless channel model. (3) Impact of imperfect channel state &lt;br/&gt;information on the performance of wireless distributed detection &lt;br/&gt;systems: The PI studies the effects of channel estimation errors on the &lt;br/&gt;designs of static and sequential distributed detection systems and &lt;br/&gt;investigates how these errors further limit the system detection &lt;br/&gt;performance. (4) Cooperation in wireless distributed detection systems: &lt;br/&gt;For both static and sequential distributed detection systems cooperative &lt;br/&gt;schemes are developed, based on local information passing among &lt;br/&gt;neighboring nodes, and conditions under which cooperation provides gain, &lt;br/&gt;in terms of both detection reliability and delay, are explored and the &lt;br/&gt;relationships between the cooperative gain and different channel models &lt;br/&gt;are sought.</AbstractNarration>
