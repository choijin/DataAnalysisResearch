<AbstractNarration>Documenting and understanding the past behavior of the climate system provides a critical reference for comparison with future potential climate change. Since the record for instrumental measurements covers only the most recent 100-150 years, indirect ("proxy") measurements must be considered. Quantitative analysis of these proxy data is challenged by the fact that the proxies apply to specific locations, and their relationship to the main feature in the climate system are not well understood.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this project, researchers from the University of Washington build on recent progress in using state-of-the-art tools from the weather prediction community to reconstruct past climate states by a method referred to as paleoclimate data assimilation (PDA). The research involves optimally blending information from climate models and proxy data to reconstruct Earth's climate over a wide range of time scales. PDA provides a transformative synthesis of irregularly spaced pointwise data into global gridded data, similar to reanalysis products derived from weather observations. Reconstructed climate states will be used for hypothesis testing using numerical models to evaluate climate sensitivity and predictability on decadal and longer timescales with robust sample sizes over a wide range of climate states.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research leverages expertise from both the paleoclimate and climate dynamics communities. Further interdisciplinary collaboration will take place through interactions with the PAGES (PAst Global changES) community. Funding supports education and training of a graduate student, as well as outreach activities to schools, community organizations and state agencies.</AbstractNarration>

The first figure shows a time series of the global-mean 2 m air temperature anomalies relative to the 10-years preceding the eruption. It shows a sharp cooling in the first year, which persists for about 20 years. Part of this persistence relates to the eruption of Mount Tambora in 1815, leading to the "year without a summer" in 1816. These results show that the cooling associated with the Tambora eruption involved a reinforcement of a major cooling event established by the 1809 eruption. This figure also shows the uncertainty associated with sources of error in the reconstruction; while there is spread in the amount of cooling, there is broad agreement on the timing and duration. The second figure shows the spatial response of the climate to the eruption during 1808--1813. In the 2 m air temperature field, we find cooling in 1809-1810 that spreads globally but also becomes locally concentrated, especially over high-latitude land areas of the Northern Hemisphere. The second field, geopotential height anomalies in the 500hPA height field (black lines, negative values dashed), reveals why this is the case: a wave in the jet stream associated with the "Pacific North America" pattern strongly amplified cooling over western North America. This may be help explain why there is apparently little written record of the 1809 event from settlements in the eastern United States.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/01/2017<br>      Modified by: Gregory&nbsp;J&nbsp;Hakim</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1304263/1304263_10245827_1512169948178_jgrd53021-fig-0015--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1304263/1304263_10245827_1512169948178_jgrd53021-fig-0015--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1304263/1304263_10245827_1512169948178_jgrd53021-fig-0015--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Global-mean 2 m air temperature anomalies relative to 10 year period prior to 1808, which is denoted by year 0 on the abscissa.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Hakim et al.
