<AbstractNarration>This project will create a Theoretical and Computational Astrophysics Network with major nodes at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University of California at Berkeley, and Princeton University, to advance the theory of black hole accretion and outflows. Accretion of matter onto black holes is central to many astrophysical and gravitational phenomena, but current theory lacks self-consistent models both for high accretion rate flows where radiation forces are important, and for low accretion rate flows where collisionless plasma effects are important. The network team brings together expertise in high performance computing techniques, astrophysics, and plasma physics in order to address this need. The team will develop a general relativistic, radiation magnetohydrodynamics code to study luminous accreting black holes, and a multi-fluid relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code with anisotropic electron and ion pressures, conduction, viscosity, and radiative heating and cooling to study slowly accreting systems. These new codes will be used to address fundamental questions about the structure and observational appearance of the inner accretion disk as well as the origin and maintenance of the large-scale magnetic fields believed to power relativistic jets, and then will be made publicly available to the research community. The network will contribute to scientific workforce development by supporting the work of undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs; and a program of visualizations, released on the internet, will help communicate the excitement of black hole astrophysics to the scientific community and to the broader public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit   Gas flowing into black holes (a process known as accretion) produces some of the best observational evidence that black holes are ubiquitous constituents of the Universe.   Accretion onto black holes also provides a laboratory for testing physics under conditions that cannot reproduced in laboratories on Earth. Our collaboration developed improved models for how plasma accretes onto black holes at low accretion rates by incorporating electrons, electron radiation, and viscosity and thermal conduction self-consistently in the calculations.   We also carried out simulations of accretion onto the black hole at the center of our own galaxy fueld by the stellar winds of the 30 massive stars close to the black hole (removing some of the simplifying assumptions of previous work).   Finally,  we made predictions for how such accretion flows would look observationally to distant observers.   These predictions will help shape the interpretation of forthcoming observations that will have spatial resolution sufficient to image the event horizon of a black hole.     Broader Impact   Our collaborative effort helped build a technically advanced scientific workforce by training undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars in research.  We also gave public talks that disseminated the results of our research to the public at large, held a summer school to train physicists, engineers, and astronomers in computational techniques, and released our numerical tools to the community at large.
