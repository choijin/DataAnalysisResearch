<AbstractNarration>Early, accurate detection of breast cancer has long been a top medical priority. Recent clinical&lt;br/&gt;success using Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) developed by our Massachusetts General Hospital&lt;br/&gt;(MGH) research partners shows reduced false alarms relative to conventional mammography.&lt;br/&gt;However, despite DBT?s enhanced detection capability, the 1% radiological contrast between&lt;br/&gt;cancerous tissue and commonly-occurring fibroglandular tissue limits the unequivocal characterization&lt;br/&gt;of diseased tissue. Alternatively, due to the relatively high contrast (10%) between cancer&lt;br/&gt;and fibro-glandular tissue, microwave imaging has a strong potential to distinguish diseased&lt;br/&gt;from healthy tissue. However, the often highly heterogeneous nature of breast tissue, where&lt;br/&gt;fibroglandular tissue is randomly interspersed in the adipose background, results in disorganized&lt;br/&gt;microwave images resulting in degraded image reconstruction.&lt;br/&gt;In collaboration with our research partners at Northeastern University?s Gordon Center for&lt;br/&gt;Subsurface Sensing and Imaging Systems (Gordon-CenSSIS) ERC, HXI proposes to fuse the DBT&lt;br/&gt;X-ray imagery with microwave Nearfield Radar Imagery (NRI), and by building upon the image&lt;br/&gt;extraction techniques developed by ERC platform technology, to significantly improve the cancerous&lt;br/&gt;tissue detection rate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activities will help the scientific/medical community to advance the knowledge&lt;br/&gt;and understanding of the effectiveness of microwave NRI method in detecting breast cancer.&lt;br/&gt;Our approach is based on the use of high resolution X-ray-based DBT imaging to obtain the&lt;br/&gt;spatial organization of heterogeneous breast tissues and on coupling it as prior information&lt;br/&gt;to NRI for 3-D reconstruction. This completely new transformative concept has not been previously&lt;br/&gt;investigated, and it has the potential to overcome the limitations of a single-modality breast&lt;br/&gt;cancer imaging technology.&lt;br/&gt;This project brings together expertise from multiple disciplines:&lt;br/&gt;1) HXI, world experts in radar design, will build the NRI sensor and antenna array;&lt;br/&gt;2) CenSSIS will provide its platform technology algorithms to perform the sensing, imaging&lt;br/&gt;and feature extraction of biological tissues and conduct phantom experiments; and&lt;br/&gt;3) Consultants from the MGH will provide medical expertise.&lt;br/&gt;Our approach, using new but validated imaging systems, allows for rapid transition to industrial&lt;br/&gt;product development. The project furthers the ERC?s strategic plan through the application&lt;br/&gt;of translational research for commercialization, with appropriate licensing of CenSSIS? IP&lt;br/&gt;to HXI. Additionally, the NRI/DBT system has the potential to expand HXI?s portfolio of marketable&lt;br/&gt;microwave and RF products.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project are multifaceted, including improving breast cancer detection&lt;br/&gt;rates, minimizing the cost of treatment by reducing the number of false-positive screenings&lt;br/&gt;and preventing patients from going through the anxiety that callback examinations create.&lt;br/&gt;Today, mammography allows 10-15% of cancers to go undetected and present themselves within&lt;br/&gt;one year. In the United States approximately 45 million mammograms are performed annually&lt;br/&gt;with false positive rates of 8-10%. This equates to more than 4 million callback examinations&lt;br/&gt;per year. With the global market growing at a CAGR of 15.4% developing better imaging systems&lt;br/&gt;is a high priority, in terms of women?s health, emotional toll, and medical costs.</AbstractNarration>
