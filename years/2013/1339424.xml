<AbstractNarration>The Level Playing Field Institute will design and implement a comprehensive Advanced Placement computer science preparatory course sequence within its 3-year Summer Math and Science Honors Academy (SMASH) to prepare underrepresented high school students of color to pursue computer science degrees in higher education. The project will to provide 345 African American and Latino low-income, first-generation high school students from schools in the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles Area the opportunity to engage early (9th grade) and consistently (three 5-week courses over 3 summers) with computer science curriculum. This course sequence will adopt the Exploring Computer Science curriculum and introduce students to the field of computer science, while making computer science relevant to the cultural background and lived experiences of students of color. This project aims to: (1) integrate computer science into the core program components of the SMASH Academy, providing a 3-year AP CS Principles preparatory sequence for all students; (2) examine the impact of a 3-year computer science sequence on the learning outcomes, aspirations, beliefs, attitudes, and longitudinal outcomes of underrepresented high school students; and (3) examine the impact of online AP CS Principles courses on student outcomes and examine implications for online computer science courses to address disparities facing underrepresented students and broaden participation in computer science.</AbstractNarration>

Students received approximately 112.5 hours of computing instruction over 3 summers, and took an optional 6 month Saturday course during their senior year to prepare for the AP CS A exam. In addition to the curriculum, the program included guest speakers, mentorship events, and visits to tech companies to further expose students to career opportunities within computer science. A 6-day CS professional development course was developed and implemented for CS instructors. The curriculum guide can be accessed at: </span><a href="http://www.lpfi.org/nsf-ce21/"><span>http://www.lpfi.org/nsf-ce21/</span></a><span>. </span></p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Students attending SMASH Academy are from groups underrepresented in computer science (84% Latinx or Black, 54% female, 79% low-income). &nbsp;Over three summers, 465 students took at least one CS course, 280 students took at least two CS courses, 75 took the full three CS summer course sequence, 208 took a portion of the year-long AP CS A prep course, and 42 completed the AP CS A exam. &nbsp;Beyond access, the program intervention significantly increased students&rsquo; CS content knowledge, interest, and engagement with diverse computing role models. Interest in pursuing a CS major in post-secondary education nearly tripled (from 15% to 44% pre- to post-intervention) and computing career aspirations more than doubled (from 21% to 45% pre- to post-intervention). Students who participated in a sequence of courses had significantly higher outcomes than those only participating in one, demonstrating the cumulative impact of multiple exposures. The percentage of students who completed the SMASH program and went on to major in a computing-related major nearly quadrupled over the course of the intervention, from 9% in 2014 to 35% in 2016, with 39 currently pursuing computing majors in college. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p dir="ltr"><span>The project also resulted in broader impacts beyond numbers of students served and increased computing preparation and career trajectories.

To build upon the momentum across sectors to enhance CS opportunities, and address challenges in the lack of depth, reach, and systematic coordination and alignment across programs and initiatives, the project team worked with key stakeholders to develop a city-wide computing initiative in Oakland, CA. A cross-sector leadership team was developed to lead the Oakland CS for All initiative, including leaders from the school district, industry, philanthropy, and nonprofit community. This initiative has: (1) developed a collective understanding of the current computer science education and funding landscape in Oakland, (2) developed a set of collective impact goals to increase access and preparation in CS across the pipeline, and (3) identified specific initiatives to implement, including identifying 4 tech talent pathways to prioritize and develop with non-profit and industry partners. </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p dir="ltr"><span>Finally, research and evaluation were conducted across all three years of the project period using pre- and post-program surveys, content assessments, instructor surveys, and alumni surveys to examine short- and long-term impacts. &nbsp;This research culminated in 3 annual program evaluation reports, 2 published peer-reviewed journal publications, 2 journal publications (submitted), and findings widely disseminated at academic and professional conferences, societies, and symposia, including: &nbsp;American Educational Research Association, Innovation and Technology in Computer Science Education, California Department of Education STEM Symposia, Computer Science Teachers Association, SIGCSE, and Tapia Diversity in Computing Conference, among others. &nbsp;The dissemination of the knowledge gained from research on the impact of this CS intervention has implications for the development and scaling of out-of-school computing interventions for underrepresented populations across the nation. </span></p> <div><span><br /></span></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/30/2017<br>      Modified by: Alexis&nbsp;Martin</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1339424/1339424_10281218_1509407641619_SMASHstudents--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1339424/1339424_10281218_1509407641619_SMASHstudents--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SMASH students learning CS"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1339424/1339424_10281218_1509407641619_SMASHstudents--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SMASH students learning CS"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">SMASH students learning CS</div> <div class="imageCredit">LPFI</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alexis&nbsp;Martin</div> <div class="imageTitle">SMASH students learning CS</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1339424/1339424_10281218_1509408423556_SMASHgirlscomputer--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1339424/1339424_10281218_1509408423556_SMASHgirlscomputer--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SMASH students learning CS."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1339424/1339424_10281218_1509408423556_SMASHgirlscomputer--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SMASH students learning CS."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">SMASH students learning computer science.</div> <div class="imageCredit">LPFI</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alexis&nbsp;Martin</div> <div class="imageTitle">SMASH students learning CS.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1339424/1339424_10281218_1509409099912_SMASHstudentsSaturdayAcademy--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1339424/1339424_10281218_1509409099912_SMASHstudentsSaturdayAcademy--rgov-800width.jpg" title="SMASH's Saturday CS Academy"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1339424/1339424_10281218_1509409099912_SMASHstudentsSaturdayAcademy--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="SMASH's Saturday CS Academy"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">SMASH students in the AP CS Prep course meet two special guests (Gordon Bell and Sheridan Sinclaire-Bell)</div> <div class="imageCredit">LPFI</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alexis&nbsp;Martin</div> <div class="imageTitle">SMASH's Saturday CS Academy</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
