<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to investigate the operation principle of a new type of broad-area semiconductor lasers, termed beta-type distributed feedback lasers. The approach involves numerical and experimental investigations of the lateral mode selection mechanism through the angled cavity and the longitudinal mode selection mechanism through the beta-type distributed feedback grating.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the proposed research is that a deeper understanding about the mode selection mechanism of beta-type distributed feedback will be obtained. The lateral mode selection will be investigated as functions of the cavity tilt angle, ridge width, cavity length, and sidewall verticalness. The longitudinal mode selection will be studied by changing the coupling strength. Finally, the optimal design will be applied to the best quantum cascade gain medium to demonstrate the highest peak power in room temperature single mode operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed research stem from the potential that the beta-type distributed feedback laser offers a cost effective approach for power scaling of all types of semiconductor lasers while maintaining excellent beam quality with single mode emission, which offers immense benefit to the society, given the current proliferation of semiconductor lasers in the consumer market. The result of the proposed research activity will be disseminated in peer reviewed journals, professional conferences, and non-technical publications. Some results will also be compiled into classroom materials for both graduate and undergraduate courses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Quantum cascade lasers emitting in the mid- to far-range infrared radiation can be used for the detection of gases, chemicals, and pollutants in the atmosphere. Good beam quality is necessary for sending infrared light across great distances, but few structures have been able to achieve both high power and high brightness.  Through this work, it is found that this dilemma can be overcome using a remarkably simple technique: tilting the laser cavity. A peak power of 203 W was demonstrated at room temperature, which is the highest power obtained from a single semiconductor laser. Along with the record-breaking output power, the beam quality is also superior, making it the brightest quantum cascade laser to date.  A new category of semiconductor lasers, termed as "angled cavity distributed feedback lasers" is introduced, which is the combination of the angled cavity with the distributed feedback gratings. The angled cavity is responsible for spatial mode control, while the distributed feedback is responsible for spectral mode control. This project shows that high power, good beam quality, and single mode operation can be simultaneously obtained using the angled cavity distributed feedback approach.  Although this new structure is demonstrated in a quantum cascade laser, there is no fundamental limit preventing the application of the angled cavity laser technology to a wide range of semiconductor lasers for single mode power scaling.
