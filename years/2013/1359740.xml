<AbstractNarration>The research focus of this project is the provision of incentives in the face of severe contemporaneous liquidity constraints.  Hence, one way of framing this project is as endeavoring to answer a natural economic question:  ?what is the best way for the owner of a firm (the principal) to incentivize an employee operator (the agent) who has no wealth of his own??  The posited answer is that the principal should use ?sweat equity contracts? that reward the agent for good outcomes (i.e., low cost realizations) by increasing his ownership stake in the firm and punish him for bad outcomes (i.e., high cost realizations) by reducing it.  As such, the findings will have implications in numerous financial and contractual settings including: franchising, venture capital, and investment banking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, the methods at the heart of this project should give rise to robust empirical implications in such settings. For instance, work-to-own franchise contracts should specify the path by which an employee operator either becomes a vested owner of a franchise or is fired and replace.  Similarly, in the context of venture capital covenants, output growth should be associated with the transfer of control rights from venture capitalists to the founding entrepreneurs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, the methods developed under the auspices of this project will have spillovers in many applications of dynamic mechanism design. For example, in a setting of multi-firm procurement, the theory developed under this project may help to explain the endogenous emergence of long-term supply relationships.  Whereas, in the context of repeated sales to cash constrained customers, the theory may shed light on such contractual arrangements as frequent-purchase discount plans.  Finally, in a setting of private wealth shocks, the methodology may advance understanding of optimal mutual insurance mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technically, the purpose of this project is to investigate the structure and implementation of optimal dynamic screening contracts.  Specifically, the model proposed for study is an infinite-horizon version of the canonical static monopolistic screening setting in which the agent is privately informed about the stream of costs or revenues and is severely liquidity constrained.  The resulting dynamic mechanism-design problem facing the principal will be formulated as a recursive dynamic program in which the relevant state variable is promised future rents paid to the agent.  It will be shown that under certain assumptions all contractual terms (output, contemporaneous rents, and future rents) are weakly increasing in the state variable, affording a unique interpretation of the state as the agent's equity in the firm.  Higher levels of sweat equity are associated with lower output distortions and less stringent liquidity constraints. Moreover, monotonicity in type permits characterization of short-run dynamic adjustments in the contractual environment -- high cost realizations result in lower sweat equity and more distortions while low realizations have the reverse effects.  Following the optimal dynamic insurance literature, it may also be possible to establish long-run contractual dynamics under which the agent ultimately either achieves a vested ownership stake in the firm or is fired and replaced.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Consider the common situation in which two parties form a partnership in order to operate jointly a business enterprise.  The equity or cash partner (principal) possesses capital, but is unable, either due to lack of expertise or because her time and energy is best spent elsewhere, to operate the firm.  By contrast, the managing partner (agent) possesses technical knowhow, but lacks access to the financial resources necessary to launch the enterprise or keep it afloat.  Thus, there is generally some degree of separation between the expert individuals responsible for execution of a venture and the entity that provides its financial backing.  Moreover, the preferences of the entrepreneur, contractor, or researcher (the "agent") regarding the timing, intensity and direction of investment are unlikely to be perfectly aligned with the preferences of the financier, end user, or institution (the "principal").   Real-world examples of this type of situation abound: retail franchising, venture capital, real estate development, newly minted professionals joining established firms.  The salient features of these contractual settings are that: (i) the agent is liquidity constrained and cannot purchase or finance the enterprise himself, (ii) the relationship is of a long term nature, (iii) the agent has private access to knowledge regarding certain factors influencing profitability, and (iv) the principal possesses substantial physical or financial capital and maintains control rights over some aspects of the operation.    In this project , we provide a normative analysis of optimal dynamic contracts for the principal in a variety of settings possessing these characteristics.  Our question can also be phrased as follows.  There are numerous stylised facts about contracting in, say, franchises, or venture capital funding etc.  Is it plausible that these contractual arrangements are optimal? A brief summary of our work is that many features of the theoretically optimal contract are also found in real-world arrangements, which suggests that people are, actually, doing the best they can given the institutional, informational, and market constraints under which they operate.  In somewhat more detail, our findings relate the evolution of firm dynamics to other features of the contractual relationship.  In particular, we show that there is a maximal firm size, ie, scale of operations, that is achieved if (and only if) the agent becomes a fully vested partner in the firm.  Moreover, we show:    Backloading of rents:  The optimal contract incentivizes the agent exclusively via promised future payments before he becomes a fully vested partner, and exclusively via instantaneous payments if he becomes a fully vested partner. Easing of liquidity: Liquidity constraints ameliorate as the firm grows, and vanish completely if the agent becomes a fully vested partner. Up or Out: In the long run, with probability 1, the firm either grows to the point where the agent becomes a fully vested partner or it shrinks to the point where the principal replaces him. Consequences of Promotion: If an employee is promoted, he is typically paid for past performance as well as for future performance.  This raises the question of how transfers should be priced within a firm.  Such questions regarding the impact of long-term interactions within firms is generally ignored in the transfer-pricing literature, which our analysis suggests is an oversight.      In fact, our main results are best summarized collectively as a theory of "sweat equity," wherein the agent works for the principal without receiving rents until the scale of the firm and his equity position grow to the level of ownership or shrink to the point where he is replaced.  We point to evidence showing that these characteristics of the optimal dynamic contract have close parallels in real-world work-to-own franchise programs and venture capital covenants. They also resonate with features of contracts involving ne...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
