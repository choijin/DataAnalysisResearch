<AbstractNarration>Fruit represent a significant portion of human diets and a major constituent of global food security. Fruit are significant contributors of vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates and fiber, yet present day fruit and vegetable intake is well below dietary guidelines.  Inadequate fruit consumption is due partly to practical production, storage and shelf-life constraints limiting fruit availability at affordable prices. In addition, reduced flavor, appearance and aroma qualities, often attributed to early harvest and incomplete ripening (necessary for produce survival through modern supply chains), decreases consumer interest in fruit and fruit products.  A better understanding of the genetic control of ripening and associated nutrient, flavor and quality characteristics, will provide growers, breeders and seed companies with tools for selection of higher quality fruit crops.  Recently numerous ripening control processes have been resolved in tomato due to its short life cycle, providing insight into strategies for improving fruit quality while minimizing product loss.  The primary objective of this project is to investigate the extent to which findings in tomato hold true for additional fruit crops, thus providing paths toward crop improvement. We have selected melon and banana as research targets due to their global consumption and economic value, and because they represent a range of ripening mechanisms and genetic diversity that will distinguish specific from more general ripening and fruit quality control components.  Genes and genetic processes conserved among these species are likely to be common to most other fruit crops and will provide practical selection targets for fruit quality and shelf-life improvement. This project will also provide international exchange of students and postdoctoral fellows between the US and Israel as part of the scientific training and collaboration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A critical role for the epigenome in regulating fruit maturation and ripening has been demonstrated in tomato.  Under this project we characterized transcriptome activity and epigenome dynamics in two important fruit crops, melon and banana, to assess the conservation of epigenome mediated fruit development phenomena in additional plants bearing fleshy fruits.  Banana and melon were selected due to their relevance in US and Israeli markets, in addition to their world-wide importance as agricultural commodities and as contributors to nutritional and food security.   Lastly, they were selected as the research group had access to a transgenic melon variety repressed in production of an ethylene synthesis enzyme, ACC oxidase (ACS), allowing assessment of the role of this ripening hormone in epigenome effects.   Banana was additionally selected as it is evolutionarily quite diverged from both melon and tomato.  As such, molecular commonalities found among these species are more likely to be conserved, and the resulting information applicable, to many fleshy fruit bearing species.   Specific activities of the project included transcriptome (global gene expression) profiling of banana and melon fruit from pre-ripening through maturation and late ripening.   A similar analysis was performed with both the normally ripening and ethylene inhibited melon lines.  Transcriptome profiling of bananas inhibited in a ripening transcription factor, MaMADS2, necessary for normal ethylene synthesis and ripening was also undertaken.               Project activities demonstrated that homologs of important ripening regulators involved in primary transcriptional control, hormone effects and epigenome modifications are similarly induced in maturing fruits of all three species.    Critical components of these regulatory systems are thus likely conserved through evolution and present targets for altering fruit ripening and quality via available genetic diversity or targeted modification.  Banana DNA methylation data proved difficult to acquire and is still being analyzed.  Characterization of DNA methylation in normal and ethylene impaired melon lines revealed ripening-associated changes in DNA methylation associated with ripening genes and further suggests a role of ethylene in mediating said changes.  In summary, genes underlying ripening control at multiple levels are evolutionarily conserved and ethylene plays a role in mediating epigenome changes contributing to the ripening process.  Practically, these results point to targets for genetic interventions, whether via identification of suitable variation and breeding or through targeted modifications such as gene editing, for improvement of fruit shelf-life and quality.  These outcomes will influence food and nutrient security.              Several undergraduate and graduate students in addition to one postdoctoral researcher were trained under this project.  Specifically, using project funds or funds from an institutional REU project, one undergraduate summer intern was exposed to laboratory biological sciences research and trained in each year of the project.  These interns were identified by colleagues at minority serving institutions (California State University Fresno and Sacramento).  A Ph.D. student received partial support from this project and postdoctoral research was largely supported over the project duration.
