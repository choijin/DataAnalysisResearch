<AbstractNarration>The project will characterize the functional, taxonomic, biotic and abiotic drivers of soil ecosystems in the Trans Antarctic Mountains (one of the most remote and harsh terrestrial landscapes on the planet).  The work will utilize new high-throughput DNA and RNA sequencing technologies to identify members of the microbial communities and determine if the microbial community structures are independent of local environmental heterogeneities.  In addition the project will determine if microbial diversity and function are correlated with time since the last glacial maximum (LGM).  The expected results will greatly contribute to our knowledge regarding rates of microbial succession and help define the some of the limits to life and life-maintaining processes on Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will analyze genomes and RNA derived from these genomes to describe the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning from soils above and below LGM elevations and to correlate these with the environmental drivers associated with their development during the last ~18,000 years. The team will identify the taxonomic diversity and the functional genetic composition within a broad suite of soil biota and examine their patterns of assembly and distribution within the framework of their geological legacies. The project will mentor participants from undergraduate students to postdoctoral researchers and prepare them to effectively engage in research to meet their career aspirations. The project will contribute to ongoing public education efforts through relationships with K-12 teachers and administrators- to include University-Public School partnerships. Less formal activities include public lecture series and weblogs aimed at providing information on Antarctic polar desert ecosystems to the general public. Targeted classrooms near each PI's institution will participate in online, real-time discussions about current topics in Antarctic ecosystems research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Terrestrial soils in Antarctica represent one of the most challenging environments for life on Earth. Despite the extremely low temperatures, limited water availability, and high salinities common in Antarctic soils, they can harbor a broad diversity of microorganisms, including many bacteria and fungi that have never been described. This project provided new insight into what microbes are able to survive in remote Antarctic soils, how they are able to survive, how these microbial communities assemble over time and space, and the specific physiological adaptations of bacteria that permit survival in Antarctic soils. One of the more surprising outcomes from this work is that we identified the 'limits to life' in Antarctic soils, i.e. we identified the environmental conditions that prevent microbial colonization and survival in terrestrial Antarctic environments and show that such conditions are likely common across the continent. This is important as it has long been assumed that every terrestrial surface on Earth can ultimately be colonized by microbes - we show that this paradigm is not correct - there are limits to microbial life. We also used this unique series of habitats sampled across the Shackleton Glacier region to investigate the factors that influence how microbial communities assemble over time, demonstrating that microbial communities are more strongly influenced by dispersal limitation than expected. While it is often thought that 'everything is everywhere' when it comes to microbes - we show that this longstanding paradigm is not correct. Finally, we employed genomic and metagenomic approaches to identify the unique physiological adaptations used by bacteria to survive in Antarctic soils. Most notably, we show that many Antarctic soil bacteria can sustain activity by metabolizing trace gases from the atmosphere and by employing novel strategies to detoxify perchlorate and chlorate containing compounds. This work will ultimately have important implications for understanding microbial life in other 'extreme' environments on Earth (and possibly even on Mars), identifying new strategies for bioremediation of heavily polluted sites, and broadening our perspective on how microbes in Antarctica may be impacted by ongoing climate change.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/05/2020<br>      Modified by: Noah&nbsp;Fierer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
