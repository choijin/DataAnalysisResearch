<AbstractNarration>The project will develop Hodge theory and apply it to problems in algebraic geometry, number theory and representation theory.  The researchers intend to focus on four related topics: (1) Mumford-Tate (MT) domains, (2) moduli spaces, (3) algebraic cycles and the Hodge conjecture, and (4) mixed Hodge modules.  (1) MT domains are classifying spaces of Hodge structures, and, roughly speaking, the boundary components of Mumford-Tate domains parametrize degenerations of Hodge structures.  The PIs intend to advance number theory, representation theory and algebraic geometry by studying Mumford-Tate domains and their boundary components.  For example, the PIs plan to extend work of Carayol, which seeks to associate Galois representations to automorphic representations whose archimedian component is a degenerate limit of discrete series.  (2) The second topic concerns the realization of moduli spaces of geometric objects as quotients of discrete groups.  An example of such a realization is the moduli space of non-hyperelliptic genus 3 curves, which can be realized as a ball quotient, where the 6 dimensional ball in question sits in the MT domain of K3 surfaces.  However, there are not many examples of this type known.  The PIs intend to look for more.  (3) The third topic involves the approach to the Hodge conjecture via normal functions and their singularities due to Green and Griffiths. The PIs will develop this approach in several directions.  For example, they will study the archimedean height function associated to a normal function, and they intend to study the non-reductive MT groups associated to normal functions.  (4) Finally, the PIs will develop a flexible theory of complex variations of mixed Hodge modules and apply it to questions arising in representation theory.  In particular, they would like to understand the structure of conformal blocks viewed as complex mixed Hodge modules on the moduli spaces of stable curves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hodge theory is a central area of algebraic geometry with roots in the the classical (19th century) theory of special functions and period integrals.  From a modern point of view, the goal of Hodge theory is to relate topological invariants of algebraic varieties to arithmetic and analytic invariants.  The central notion is that of a Hodge structure on the cohomology groups of an algebraic variety.  While the cohomology groups are purely topological, depending only on the shape of variety, the Hodge structure is a much more sensitive invariant. Consequently, the Hodge structure carries a great deal of important algebro-geometric and number-theoretical information.  The most famous unsolved problem in algebraic geometry is the Hodge conjecture, a question about the relationship between the Hodge structure of the cohomology groups of a variety and the existence of certain subvarieties.  This focus on the relationship between topological objects and finer analytic invariants is typical of Hodge theory as a whole, and it is the main motivation for the research supported by this FRG.  This research will consequently impact several areas of mathematics including number theory, algebraic geometry and representation theory.  Owing to the number of techniques involved, the PIs have a diverse set of skills and points of view.  An important component of the FRG will be devoted to conferences, which will exchange ideas between the PIs and train postdoctoral fellows and graduate students in a wide range of topics having to do with Hodge theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main objects of the proposal were as follows.  Intellectual Merit  The rigorous construction, in joint work with Gregory Pearlstein, of Richard Hain's biextension line bundle associated to an arbitrary pair of admissible normal functions, and the criterion for the singularity of Hain's metric on this bundle in terms of local intersection cohomology.  This work deepens our understanding of normal functions, and has potential applications to the Hodge conjecture.  The deeper understanding of the cohomology of the KZ system obtained in joint work with Belkale and Mukhopadhyay.  This work extends and completes work of Looijenga aimed at putting a complex mixed Hodge structure on the KZ system.    The palindromicity theorems obtained in a joint paper with Chow on Hessenberg varieties and a single author paper on obstructions to compactifications of families of algebraic varieties.  These theorems relate the palindromicity of the cohomology groups of fibers of a family of varieties to geometric properties of the family itself. Moreover, the joint work with Chow resolves a conjecture of Shareshian and Wachs on the relationship between the cohomology groups of Hessenberg varieties and certain combinatorial objects associated to graphs.    Broader Impact.  The training of several postdoctoral fellows and graduate students.  The organization of several conferences including several large conferences organized in connection with the FRG and one Banff International Research Station (BIRS) conference on Hessenberg varieties.
