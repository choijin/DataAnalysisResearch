<AbstractNarration>Vanessa Fong of Amherst College will explore how cultures are transformed through the migration experience. This is a unique, longitudinal project that explores how and why attitudes toward migration and return change over time. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will use longitudinal interviews, surveys, and participant observation to examine the motivations and experiences of young adults who returned to China after living in the USA, Japan, Europe, Canada, Australia, Singapore, and/or South Korea, to learn why they chose to return to China, what they experience after they returned to China, how they decide whether to stay in China or go abroad again, and how their experiences, achievements, perspectives, trajectories, and goals compare with those of their former high school and middle school classmates who have never left China even for a day.  As Chinese incomes have risen and processes of globalization in China and worldwide have intensified, rapidly increasing numbers of Chinese citizens are emigrating, only to return to China after several years abroad. This study will be the first to examine the long-term trajectories of this kind of transnational migrant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Findings from this project will increase understandings of how migration between China and other countries affect China and the world, and help citizens and policymakers in the USA and other receiving countries understand the kinds of conditions that can motivate transnational migrants to return to their home countries, and the kinds of long-term consequences that experiences of transnational migration can have for the migrants and the countries to which they return. These findings will also offer better understandings of the long-term costs and benefits of transnational migration, so that educators, businesses, organizations, and governments who work with them can better advise them about these issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data from this project will serve as the basis for students senior honors theses, and as materials for courses taught by the researcher, thus strengthening Amherst College undergraduates' research skills, international perspectives, and understandings of how qualitative and quantitative methods and analyses can be integrated.</AbstractNarration>
