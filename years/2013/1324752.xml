<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: Deciphering the regional-versus-global aspects&lt;br/&gt;of the Toarcian (Jurassic) Oceanic Anoxic Event in North America&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;by&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Benjamin Gill, Virginia Tech University, EAR-1324752&lt;br/&gt;Michael Formolo, University of Tulsa, EAR-1324751&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The geologic record contains many past instances of biological crises linked to environmental change. These events can be thought of as past experiments that offer a window into understanding the dynamics of the current and future Earth surface system. The Oceanic Anoxic Events, or OAEs, of the Mesozoic Era (252 to 65 million years ago) are particularly relevant examples to the present changes on Earth. These intervals are notable because they are characterized by widespread marine anoxia and extinction events. OAEs also occur during times of rapid global warming and large disturbances to the global carbon cycle, thought to be associated with increased levels of greenhouse gases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The target of this investigation is the oldest of the Mesozoic OAEs -- the Toarcian OAE of the Early Jurassic (approximately 183 million years ago). Past studies of this event have identified major disturbances to the global carbon and sulfur cycles and the occurrence of widespread marine anoxia. However, to date, the majority of these Toarcian OAE studies come from a relatively confined geographical area in Europe. The incomplete Toarcian geochemical record has led to active debates regarding the global nature of both the changes in the element cycles and the geographic extent of marine anoxia. This study will investigate both the inorganic and organic geochemical record of the Toarcian OAE in North American black shales and carbonates to assess the global-versus-regional nature of the event. Further, these new data will be integrated with the available data from Europe in a comprehensive modeling approach that will test the hypothesized mechanisms that triggered, maintained and terminated this event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will have three main broader impact contributions. The first will be the development of graduate students and early career scientists at Virginia Tech and the University of Tulsa. The second will be the development of an educational program through the Museum of Geosciences at Virginia Tech aimed to inform the public about past environmental change on Earth. The Museum of Geosciences offers one of only a few public science venues in the region, and it provides an excellent venue for reaching portions of the population that would not normally be exposed to this science. The last contribution will be the mentorship of undergraduate researchers through the Tulsa Undergraduate Research Challenge (TURC). This program specializes in facilitating research for undergraduate students and community outreach.</AbstractNarration>

Studying such events is key to understanding the full and dynamic range of the environmental and climate changes that can occur on the Earth. Specifically, our study shows how the Earth responded during an event called the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event that occurred during the Early Jurassic (~183 million years ago). During this event, elevated additions of greenhouse gases were injected into the atmosphere from large volcanic eruptions over a relatively short interval of time (50,000 to 100,000 years).</p> <p>This study assessed the global changes to the carbon cycle using carbon isotope analyses of sedimentary rocks deposited during the event. This study showed that the changes or &ldquo;excursions&rdquo; in the carbon isotopes are found elsewhere<sup> </sup>in the North American record. This observation is important because this indicates that these excursions represent changes in the global carbon cycle. Based on computer simulations of the carbon cycle during the event, we suggest that carbon added to the atmosphere ocean from previously considered sources (for example: volcanoes, methane from sediments) are not enough to cause the carbon isotope excursion. We therefore argue for an important role of terrestrial sources of carbon (wetland, lakes, etc.) in the overall carbon cycle during the event.</p> <p>This study also assessed changes in the oxygen levels in portions of the oceans during the event. Specifically, we quantified the amount of iron and sulfur found in sedimentary rocks deposited during the event. These can be used to assess whether the seawater was oxygenated or was anoxic (lacked oxygen). Our results from the Canadian locations indicate that the deeper waters of this marine basin were anoxic before, during, and after the event. This observation is opposed to the record that has been reported from other locations where the waters changed from oxygenated to anoxic and back to oxygenated during the event. This suggests the changes in oxygen levels in the oceans during the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event was more complex than previously considered.</p> <p>This award also partially supported a study of the changes in chemical weathering over the T-OAE using osmium isotopes. Chemical weathering is an important negative feedback to rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere; these chemical reactions consume carbon dioxide by reactions with water and rocks. We identified an osmium isotope excursion &ndash; an increase in the ratio of osmium isotope 187 (<sup>187</sup>Os) over 188 (<sup>188</sup>Os) &ndash; during the interval that contains the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event. This excursion indicates a temporary increase in the weathering rocks on the of continents during the event; continental rocks are in enriched in <sup>187</sup>Os relative to <sup>188</sup>Os as compared to other sources of osmium to the ocean. While similar signals have been previously found in locations in Europe, it had yet to be identified elsewhere. Again, as for the carbon isotope record, this observation is critical to identify whether the excursion represents a global change in the osmium cycle. We also used a numerical model of the osmium cycle to derive estimates of the change in chemical weathering during the event: our model suggests up to a three-fold increase in the weathering of continental material during the T-OAE.</p> <p>Finally during the field work in Canada that was supported by this award a lagerst&auml;tten - a unique fossil deposit with exceptional preservation (soft tissues) - was discovered and a preliminary study was conducted.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p> <p>The award supported the professional development of three graduate and two undergraduate students over the time span of the project. This included training in a variety of field methods, geochemical methods in the laboratory, and computer modeling of the elemental cycles. The award also supported one of the graduate students to present their results at two professional scientific conferences.</p> <p>Several public outreach activities were completed during the project. PI Gill gave a presentation on how geoscientists reconstruct ancient climatic and environmental change in the Virginia Tech Museum of Geoscience Public Lecture Series. This event included a one-hour lecture followed by meet-the-scientist session in the museum that included hands-on activities. PI Gill also conducted a half-day workshop for high school educators on the use of stable isotopes in reconstructing ancient environmental change in the&nbsp;Biotechnology Educators Conference at Virginia Tech. During the workshop, data generated for this study was used as examples of how geoscientists reconstruct ancient environmental change. Lastly, an exhibit about Early Jurassic climatic and environmental change was completed for the Virginia Tech Museum of Geosciences. This exhibit also highlights how geosciences reconstruct Earth&rsquo;s past using a variety of methods and disciplines.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/04/2017<br>      Modified by: Benjamin&nbsp;Gill</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1324752/1324752_10258940_1501878074277_ScreenShot2017-08-04at4.14.01PM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1324752/1324752_10258940_1501878074277_ScreenShot2017-08-04at4.14.01PM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Data from the East Tributary study site in Alberta, Canada"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1324752/1324752_10258940_1501878074277_ScreenShot2017-08-04at4.14.01PM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Data from the East Tributary study site in Alberta, Canada"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Lithostratigraphy, carbon isotope stratigraphy and fossil occurrence data from the East Tributary study site in Alberta, Canada.
