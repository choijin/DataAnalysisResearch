<AbstractNarration>SRI will investigate the potential of a computer science curriculum, Build IT that successfully encourages African American and Latina girls' interests and pursuits in computer science, to encourage these girls? educators to pursue computer science learning and careers. Preliminary data suggest that Build IT may increase IT education and career pursuits among the educators, who are primarily women of color in their 20s and 30s. SRI will conduct a mixed-methods study in both the Girls Inc. network of affiliates throughout the United States and the California School-Age Consortium (CalSAC) network of afterschool programs in California to understand (1) under what conditions do Build IT educators pursue computer science learning and careers, (2) what types of computer science learning and careers do Build IT educators indicate interest in and pursue, and (3) to what extent is there a relationship between educators' computing interests and pursuits, their implementation of Build IT, and youth outcomes for Build IT. To address these research questions, the team will conduct a study of Build IT and other STEM educators in the Girls Inc. and CalSAC networks gathering data on their STEM backgrounds, implementation practices, and their IT career plans. The team will examine the impact of the Build IT educators' IT interests and career plans on youth outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is important for practitioners, researchers, and policymakers interested in encouraging underrepresented populations to pursue STEM learning and careers in general and computer science learning and careers, specifically. While there is some evidence that teaching STEM programs may encourage afterschool educators to pursue further STEM experiences, there is a gap in the research on the role that teaching such an afterschool computer science curriculum can play to activate or reactive young women from African American and Latina backgrounds in pursuing computer science and the effect that these educators? pursuits can have on girls' computer science learning and career interests. This research will inform practice and research on programmatic designs and implementation environments that encourage underrepresented populations of both learners and educators to pursue computer science. Through Girls Inc. and CalSAC, the Build IT curriculum and research findings and practices can reach hundreds of thousands of middle school girls and thousands of afterschool educators who are predominantly female and from African American and Latina backgrounds.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Computer science-related jobs are predicted to grow faster than all other professional jobs over the next decade yet participation of women and certain racial and ethnic groups is low. Girls, students from certain minority groups, and low-income students have low participation in computing education and are less likely to have access to constructive, creative experiences with technology. Afterschool settings are a promising venue for these learners to engage with technology and to develop an interest in Information and Communications Technology (ICT) careers. Led by SRI Education, Building the Capacity of Afterschool Computer Science Educators (ACSE) was a research project that aimed to study how and under what conditions the educators involved in afterschool computing programs, many of whom are young women from diverse backgrounds, pursue their own computing education and careers contributing insights into how afterschool programs can improve diversity in computing. The two research partners were the Girls Inc., a nationwide network of afterschool programs serving K-12 girls in underserved communities, and the California School-Age Consortium (CalSAC) that provides professional development to afterschool programs throughout California. In one condition, a curriculum was used that taught ICT design and problem-solving skills in a way that has proven attractive to youth. The curriculum, called ICT4me (sometimes also called BuildIT) was developed under prior NSF awards (ESI-0524762, HRD-1232461, and DRL-0833692) and co-designed with the Girls Inc. The two-year curriculum consists of six design-oriented ICT units. Each unit incorporates design-based problem solving and mathematics activities related to computer science; structured interactions with ICT professionals (including having girls participate in engineering design and development teams); and Family Tech Nights at which youth present their work and offer family members technology assistance. The ICT4me website, a product of this project and prior NSF awards, provides materials needed to enact the curriculum. The units themselves, which both structure the activities and provide background on the topic for the educators, who may be unfamiliar with some concepts in the curriculum. Materials for program coordinators describe technology requirements, provide direction for recruiting professionals for visits, and offer tips for supporting educators. Materials for educators explain how to use the curriculum, how to recruit youth participants, and how to keep youth engaged. An important part of ICT4me is helping youth educators understand how to teach youth so they feel welcome in the program and come to believe that they could pursue ICT careers. This project used a Gender, Race, and Culture Equity Guide, developed under another NSF award (# 1232461), to give background on threats to equity as well as specific practices that educators cancould use to help create more equitable classrooms. The equity guide and equity practices are used during training for educators. ICT4me uses a train-the-trainer approach in which regional trainers work with SRI staff to learn how to facilitate the curriculum and then work with afterschool facilitators before and during the two-year curriculum. Because the trainers are prepared on an ongoing basis, this process builds, thus building capacity for teaching ICT in informal learning settings beyond the life of the project. The objectives of the research were to understand:   Under what conditions do Build IT/ICT4me/STEM afterschool educators pursue computer science or STEM learning and careers?    What types of computer science or STEM learning and careers do Build IT/ICT4me/STEM educators indicate interest in and pursue?    To what extent is there a relationship between educators? computing interests and pursuits, their implementation of Build IT/ICT4me, and youth outcomes for Build IT/ICT4me?   We collected data from ICT4me facilitators and their students. To isolate the effects of the ICT4me curriculum from other afterschool STEM experiences, we also collected data from Girls Inc. and CalSAC sites implementing any other STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) afterschool curriculum such as computer programming, robotics, and ocean science. The study investigated the potential of the ICT4me curricula to encourage, girls, African American and Latina students, students in low-income communities, and their educators to pursue ICT learning and careers. This research enhances the field?s knowledge about teaching ICT in afterschool settings and how experience facilitating ICT programs can influence career trajectories of young adults. The interdisciplinary research team, representing expertise in youth development, computer science, curriculum development, assessment, professional development, and encouraging girls in ICT, disseminated the findings through websites, presentations, and publications (see http://ict4me.sri.com/about/research.html). While challenges to collecting data from youth and educators in afterschool settings limited the analysis on change over time, the research did demonstrate significant interest in ICT careers among facilitators and revealed findings on the implementation of the curriculum relevant to future efforts to bring ICT to afterschool settings. Through Girls Inc. and CalSAC, this curriculum and research findings and practices can reach hundreds of thousands of middle- school girls and thousands of afterschool educators who are predominantly female.
