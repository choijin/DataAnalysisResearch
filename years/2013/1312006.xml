<AbstractNarration>This goal of this research program is to study the multifaceted problem of feedback via detailed simulations designed to model galactic star formation processes over a wide range of galaxy mass and size scales.  The work will involve a series of high-resolution numerical simulations to investigate the detailed physics of feedback in disk galaxies by assessing the relative importance of supernova blasts, HII region expansion, streaming ultraviolet, and diffuse infrared emmision to driving turbulence in the ISM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students, creation of ?visually rich? web pages, workshop coordination, and sharing of software with the community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The scientific studies in this project focused on developing self-consistent theoretical models of the star-forming interstellar medium, mainly using computer simulations that follow the dynamical equations govering flows of gas and radiation, and account for magnetic fields, gravity, and the energy ``feedback'' injected by stars.  The effects of star formation feedback are important both on the scale of individual clouds and on the scale of the whole galactic disk, and in this project we have studied both.  For our large scale models, we developed a new computational framework called ``TIGRESS'' -- this acronym stands for ``Three-phase Interstellar medium in Galaxies Resolving Evolution with Star formation and Supernova feedback.''  The TIGRESS framework allows us to follow the interstellar medium, star formation, and feedback self-consistently over very long timescales and over spatial scales from a few light years to a few tens of thousands of light years, accurately including the important physical processes described above (and more).  We have documented the algorithms adopted in the TIGRESS framework, as well as numerical accuracy of our model results, in a comprehensive publication.  The TIGRESS framework can be applied to make theoretical models of interstellar gas properties in a wide range of galaxies, and as a first application we have run numerical simulations for enviroments similar to that surrounding the Sun in our own Milky Way.  We also used this model to make predictions for new observations and to interpret existing observations.  This included a thorough study of how to interpret observed emission from carbon monoxide (CO) interstellar gas, the most commonly observed molecule in the Universe.  Our study of synthetic CO emission also required the development of a new chemical network that we expect to be adopted widely by other researchers.  Our TIGRESS models also make predictions for the properties of a large-scale wind that may be driven away from the disk of the Milky Way into the halo surrounding our galaxy.  We have conducted idealized studies of individual supernova-driven bubbles that are complementary to our TIGRESS models.  In other galactic-scale work, we used our computational models of the large-scale interstellar medium to collaborate with other theoretical and computational groups from other universities. The PI has also been involved in teams that have obtained and analyzed observations of star-forming gas in both normal and starburst galaxies  Our small-scale models have focused on how giant molecular clouds evolve in response to the radiation emitted when star clusters form in their interior.  The strong radiation from young star clusters creates spectacular ionized nebulae in their immediate enviroment -- many of the most well-publicized images from ground- and space-based optical, infrared, and ultaviolet telescopes are of these nebulae surrounding star clusters.  These ionized nebulae -- as well as the non-ionizing radiation also emitted from stars -- are believed to play a role in the longstanding question of what determines the star formation ``efficiency'' in a cloud.  Having developed and implemented a new numerical method for following the interaction of radiation with gas (under support of a previous NSF grant), we used this implementation to run detailed computer models of the effects of radiation pressure in star-forming clouds.  We considered two regimes, and a range of different cloud properties in each regime.   The combination of ionized gas and radiation pressure is likely to be more effective than radiation pressure by itself, in dispersing gas from clouds.  We were therefore motivated to implement a new ``ray-tracing'' algorithm so that we can study both mechanisms simultaneously, which we did working with collaborators from Korea. This is now enabling us to study a range of cloud models, which we are pursuing with support from a new NSF award.    Altogether, the research program was quite successful, leading to 16 papers published or submitted for publication in refereed journals over the period of the grant. In addition, the PI and other members of the team gave talks to disseminate the results of research.    The most important Broader Impact of this project was in training and mentoring of graduate students and postdoctoral scientists. Two undergraduate students, four graduate students, and two postdoctoral scholars took part in the project, and as a result were trained in advanced computational research methods and mentored in preparing results for presentation and publication. One student who received his PhD moved on to a data science position in industry, another PhD graduate took a postdoctoral research position, while the postdoctoral researcher who completed his term took a position at a national research laboratory.   In addition, the PI and team members used research results from the project as part of instructional curricula and public outreach, and software developed for this effort will be freely shared with the larger community beyond our university.
