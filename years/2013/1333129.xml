<AbstractNarration>This project will create a Theoretical and Computational Astrophysics Network with major nodes at the California Institute of Technology, Syracuse University, Cornell University, and the University of Washington to advance the theory of merging compact-object binaries and stellar collapse. Gravitational waves from these types of events are expected to be detected by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory in coming years. The network team's goals are to develop the theoretical and computational tools needed to extract the equation of state of dense nuclear matter from gravitational wave and electromagnetic observations, and to determine the impact of compact-object mergers on the synthesis of light and heavy elements. The team will combine its expertise in numerical relativity, nuclear astrophysics, and gravitational wave detection to (1) develop an open-source, next-generation relativistic astrophysics computation framework; (2) improve the theoretical understanding of the nuclear equation of state and compute a large ensemble of equations of state for different temperatures and compositions; (3) improve the computational treatment of nuclear reactions in merger and collapse simulations; and (4) develop parameter estimation techniques to extract information on the equation of state from multi-messenger observations. The network will contribute to scientific workforce development through the involvement of graduate students and postdocs, who will receive cross-disciplinary training in modeling, microphysics, and multi-messenger observations. Outreach videos with visualizations and interviews with project scientists will be disseminated via YouTube to enhance public understanding.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ After LIGO's stunning detection of gravitational waves from binary black holes, the next discovery to look forward to is the detection of signals from systems containing either two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole.  Combining LIGO's gravitational-wave observations with observations of other messengers from the same event -- photons across the EM spectrum and neutrinos -- will revolutionize our understanding of the physics and astrophysics of these sources.  One of the main goals of this TCAN is to develop a new highly-accurate computational code for the simulation of  these events.  This code will be designed for the upcoming generation of exascale supercomputers and will be made available to the community as open source.  This particular goal was pursued primarily at the Cornell hub of the collaboration. By the end of project, we had demonstrated a prototype version of the code running successfully on over 500,000 processors of the Blue Waters supercomputer.  The broader impacts of this work include improving our understanding of fundamental physics. There are currently no real tests of general relativity in the strong field regime of black holes. For experiments like LIGO to confront theory with observation, one must be able to calculate what the theory predicts. For example, are the black holes that LIGO may observe the black holes predicted by Einstein's theory? With LIGO's first detections now in hand, we are poised to begin answering these questions.  The research will also have an impact on the broader area of computational science. The computational techniques developed here can be used to solve problems in many other areas, including fluid dynamics, meteorology, seismology, and astrophysics. Young researchers trained in these techniques are in great demand.       Last Modified: 10/30/2017       Submitted by: Saul A Teukolsky]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
