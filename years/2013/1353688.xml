<AbstractNarration>Linda Z. Holland, P.I.  &lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL NUMBER:  1353688   &lt;br/&gt;PROPOSAL TITLE: ABR: Evolution of Left-Right Asymmetry in Chordates using Cephalochordates as a Proxy for the Ancestral Chordate&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical description/broader impacts       &lt;br/&gt;Cephalochordates (amphioxus and lancelets) are closely related to vertebrates but simpler both structurally and at the gene level as their genomes have not undergone the two rounds of whole-genome duplication that occurred in ancestral vertebrates. While these duplications are useful for humans as a defect in one gene can often be compensated for by a duplicate, the lack of gene duplication in amphioxus makes it ideal for determining how individual genes work together to create an embryo and adult. Because amphioxus is so vertebrate-like, the genetic mechanisms that pattern, for example, the kidney or brain are fundamentally the same for both groups. The difference is that vertebrates have created additional complexity by elaborating upon these basic mechanisms.  A major outstanding question is how left/right (LR) asymmetry evolved. Vertebrates are superficially symmetric, but internal organs are asymmetrically arranged across the left/right (LR) axis. This study aims to elucidate the genetic mechanisms of LR asymmetry using two distant amphioxus genera (Branchiostoma and Asymmetron). Importantly, hybrids between the two genera yield larvae intermediate in asymmetry. This study has far reaching implications for understanding gene networks and how they evolve. A collaboration with bioinformaticians will help identify genes that are active at particular developmental stages. It will give undergraduates research experience. During 2013-2014, 13 undergraduates including 6 under-represented minorities participated in research in the Holland laboratory. One postdoctoral fellow will be trained. Results will be presented at meetings and published in scientific journals. Outreach with the Birch Aquarium at Scripps and the San Diego Unified Schools' Enhancing Science Education through Technology program will give middle school students virtual tours of the Holland laboratory with direct interactions via SKYPE.  The work will foster cross-disciplinary education via exchanges of students/postdocs between the PI and collaborators, allowing bioinformatics students to learn biology and biology students to learn bioinformatics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description&lt;br/&gt;The basal chordate amphioxus has long been thought to hold clues to vertebrate origins. This proposal addresses a major unresolved question: What is the genetic basis of LR asymmetry in chordates and how has it changed during evolution? The specific aim is to elucidate the evolution of LR asymmetry in chordates using two distant amphioxus genera (Branchiostoma and Asymmetron) as proxies for ancestral chordates. Except for left-sided expression of the conserved triad of Nodal, Lefty and Pitx in embryos of both vertebrates and amphioxus, the fundamental genetic basis of LR patterning in chordates is elusive. It is proposed that specification of LR asymmetry begins with skewed maternal Nodal and is refined by BMP suppressing Nodal on the right. The simplicity of amphioxus embryos allows dissection of gene networks starting with the egg and ending with a vertebrate-like embryo. Branchiostoma and Asymmetron offer the "Goldilocks Principle"- alike enough to be sure that two structures are homologous and unlike enough to elucidate genetic differences in LR asymmetry. Hybrids between the two genera have  intermediate asymmetry. The Holland lab pioneered research on B. floridae, was the first to study Asymmetron development and establish year-round breeding of both species in the laboratory.  sequencing the A. lucayanum genome and is currently sequencing the A. lucayanum genome. The two genera are similar, but LR asymmetries differ in several respects. Importantly, Branchiostoma has gonads on both sides, but Asymmetron has them only on the right. The approach combines in situ hybridization, antibody labeling, manipulating gene function, RNA-Seq and bioinformatics. Comparisons of the molecular basis of LR patterning and germ cell migration in both species will elucidate the fundamental basis of LR asymmetry in chordates and test the overall hypothesis that vertebrates evolved from an amphioxus-like ancestor. The results promise to be applicable not just to cephalochordates but also to vertebrates and may transform ideas on evolution of the myriad variations vertebrates added to the basic theme of a small non-yolky embryo gastrulating by invagination.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project focused on amphioxus&mdash;marine animals resembling a fish with no fins, eyes or jaws that are close relatives of vertebrates but much simpler. They are evolving slowly and are similar to ancestral chordates in Cambrian fossils. Therefore, for 30 years, amphioxus has been used to understand how vertebrates evolved from their invertebrate ancestors.</p> <p>The present project investigated the genetic basis of left/right asymmetry. In humans, viscera are asymmetric with heart and stomach on the left and liver on the right. Dextrocardia, in which the heart is on the right, results in serious medical problems. The present research focused on the genetic mechanism positioning the amphioxus gill slits. Gill slits are also present in all vertebrates except reptiles, birds and mammals, which have lost them. Occasionally a human is born with a branchial fistula indicating reactivation of the gill slit genetic pathway. Amphioxus larvae in the genus <em>Branchiostoma</em> are highly asymmetric with gill slits on the right and mouth on the left. In a second genus<em>, Asymmetron,</em> larval gill slits are ventral. Surprisingly, the two genera can hybridize although they split over 120 mya (in contrast, horses and donkey, whose hybrids are mules, split only 3 mya). In hybrids, gill slit positions are intermediate between those of their parents. The question is when and how are gill slit positions established.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Amphioxus embryos first form a hollow ball, the blastula. Then they invaginate to form a two-layered gastrula. The outer layer forms the nerve cord, brain, skin or ectoderm containing cells that sense touch. The inner layer forms the gut (endoderm), muscles (mesoderm) and notochord (mesoderm) among other structures. As the neural tube forms, genes specifying the gill slits, mouth and other pharyngeal structures begin to be expressed in the pharynx. Among these genes are Nodal and Hedgehog, coding for secreted signaling proteins.&nbsp; In vertebrates and amphioxus, Nodal is expressed on the left and specifies left identity. In amphioxus embryos both Nodal and Hedgehog are expressed on the left although Hh is also expressed in other tissues.&nbsp; In vertebrates, Hh is also expressed in the pharynx. However, in some vertebrate tissues, Hh synergizes with Nodal but in others inhibits Nodal. Therefore, we asked if Nodal and Hh interact in pharyngeal patterning in amphioxus. It was found that continuous Nodal inhibition during the amphioxus with the chemical SB505124, which inhibits binding of Nodal protein to its receptor on target cells, blocks gill slit formation and causes some pharyngeal structures &nbsp;normally developing on the right to be duplicated on the left. In addition, we found that continuous inhibition of Hh signaling with cyclopamine, which interferes with the Hh signal by binding to the membrane protein Smoothened that transduces the Hh signal, eliminates gill slits in amphioxus. We, therefore, focused on transient inhibition of Nodal and Hedgehog at the very early neurula.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The beauty of using chemical inhibitors of signaling pathways is that they can be applied at a very specific time in development and then washed out. We found that transiently inhibiting Nodal signaling at the very early neurula shifts the gill slits ventrally and inhibits expression of Nodal itself; thus Nodal regulates its own expression. Inhibition of Nodal also reduced expression of Hh and Tbx1, a transcription factor expressed in the bars between the gill slits. Reduced Nodal signaling also skewed the domains of several other genes expressed in the pharynx towards the left. In contrast, reduction in Hh signaling did not affect gill slit positions or expression of Nodal or Hh, although it did reduce the pharyngeal domain of the Hh target Gli and block gill slit penetration. We conclude that Nodal and Hh cooperate in gill slit development; Hh mediates gill slit formation and Nodal establishes the left-right position of the gill slits.</p> <p>The next step is to determine if the ventral position of gill slits in Asymmetron results from a lower level of Nodal protein. Therefore, we are first sequencing the Asymmetron genome. Our results showed that amphioxus species are evolving more slowly than the slowest-evolving vertebrate, the elephant shark. Thus, even though <em>Asymmetron</em> and <em>Branchiostoma</em> split about 120 mya, their genomes differ by just the right amount for comparisons to identify regions that may be functionally important. When these regions flanking coding sequences were linked to the lacZ gene and injected this construct into amphioxus and zebrafish eggs, they directed expression to the tissues in both animals that normally express the gene. Thus these conserved non-coding DNA are enhancers directing genes to turn in specific tissues.</p> <p>Taken together, our most recent NSF-supported work on amphioxus has shed light on how genomes evolve and how genes interact to generate an embryo. A major question in biology is how genomes translate into phenotypes&mdash;that is, the organism that we see. The present research has helped answer that question.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/16/2018<br>      Modified by: Linda&nbsp;Z&nbsp;Holland</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1353688/1353688_10329696_1537132908777_HollandoutcomesFig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1353688/1353688_10329696_1537132908777_HollandoutcomesFig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Chordate phylogeny"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1353688/1353688_10329696_1537132908777_HollandoutcomesFig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Chordate phylogeny"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Fig. 1.
