<AbstractNarration>This project includes organization of the 2013 Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Principal Investigators (PI) meeting. This will be the latest in a series of annual meetings held for CPS program grantees, at which they are able to present research results and collectively identify future research directions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyber-physical systems use computations and communication deeply embedded in, and interacting with, physical processes to add new capabilities to physical systems. These cyber-physical systems range from the very small to the very large, and can increasingly be found in a wide variety of technologies we use in our daily lives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this annual CPS PI meeting is to discuss the latest developments in the field and to help develop ideas for future research. The attendees of this workshop will hear general plenary talks by leaders in the field, then participate in breakout sessions to discuss more specialized aspects. The meeting will feature broad, diverse participation comprising the CPS PI community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was to support the annual conference for principal investigators (PIs) for the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Program at the National Science Foundation.    This program provides for research in systems that combine physical systems like automobiles with networked computers that are embedded in that system.  Indeed most modern automobiles have several dozen such computers, making them really computer networks on wheels.  There many other kinds of such systems, of course.  Others that touch us personally are medical devices like X-ray and other imaging machines.  The electrical grid that supplies energy to our homes depends on networked control computers to keep our lights on. And there are many others.  This is a very fast moving field, because of the rapidly improving power of computer systems, and because of the increasing number of physical systems that can take advantage of them.  Thus it is a very active area of research and development, and the NSF CPS program provides vital funding to universities and research institutes to enable its progress.  The researchers who lead these projects are called PIs, and usually they are assisted by graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and technicians.  Once a year NSF organizes this CPS PI conference in the Washington area for these PIs to exchange results and ideas from their NSF-funded projects.  This project project was intended to organize this conference in 2013.  The International Technology Research Institute, Inc. (ITRI) was chosen to assist NSF in organizing the conference.  This consisted of making the logistical arrangements with the conference hotel, and with the video contractor that captured much of the material for broad dissemination.  ITRI also supported the event, including solving problems during the meeting.    The conference was held on October 16-18, 2013 in Arlington, VA and was successful in communicating the results among the PIs, despite an unusual challenges:  the U.S. Government was shut down for October 1-16.  This meant that none of the Government people who had planned to participate could plan to come or assist in the conference preparation.  Or that the Government could reimburse ITRI for its costs.  However, ITRI went ahead at its own risk.  The Government went back to work just before the conference started, so in the end, everything turned out all right.  The new approaches of webcasting the proceedings and video taping poster sessions proved to be efficient and effective.  These results were posted on the existing "CPS-VO," which is an on-line site for this community to share information.  Intellectual Merit: This comes from the merit of the CPS research itself.  This project merely provided for exchange of results from this research to help avoid duplication, build on the results of others, and to get new ideas for research themes.  Broader Impacts: Again, these come from the impacts of the CPS research itself, which reach into every corner of our life today.  This project merely provided means to encourage faster progress in making those impacts.  Note: This conference was organized on as economical a basis as possible.  It was held in a standard conference hotel in the Arlington, VA area, to minimize the cost for attendees to come.  There was no entertainment of any kind, only business meetings.  Standard Government travel policies, including economy class travel and standard per diem allowances for meals were used.
