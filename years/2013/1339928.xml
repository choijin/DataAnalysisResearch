<AbstractNarration>The western United States has experienced an unprecedented period of wildfires in the last two decades, and both land owners and downstream water users are vulnerable to wildfire and its effects on erosion and water quality. The 2012 High Park Fire was the second largest fire in Colorado history (over 35,000 ha burned) and burned in a wildland-urban interface of public and private lands located north and west of Fort Collins, CO. This research will provide a unique understanding of the second largest fire in Colorado history.  The award will enable studies of the biological and physical dynamics of burn severity and post-fire recovery 2012 High Park Fire using an integrative approach that combines high resolution remote sensing provided by the National Ecological Observatory Airborne Observatory (AOP) remote sensing instruments and in situ field collected data. The award will provide funds for developing an integrated understanding of the biological and physical responses to fire across a spatially complex landscape. The study has six objectives: (1) characterize the post-fire landscape, (2) investigate the effects of pre-fire landscape conditions on burn severity, (3) examine the post-fire biological response, (4) examine the post-fire physical response, (5) conduct an integrated biological and physical assessment of the fire impacts on the Cache la Poudre watershed, and (6) inform future AOP applications. Two of these (1 &amp; 6) are methodological objectives aimed at developing strategies for using AOP data to examine landscape response to a large disturbance, and the remaining (2-5) are scientific objectives related to understanding controls on burn severity and post-fire response. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data on the spectral, topographic and forest structure qualities of the recovering landscape will facilitate an understanding of the physical and biological processes of recovery within a common spatially-explicit three-dimensional framework. By integrating the extensive information in the airborne remote sensing data with field monitoring, the research allows examination of spatial and temporal dynamics at a level of detail that would not be feasible with field measurements alone. The combined biological and physical analyses will facilitate understanding of the feedbacks between vegetation changes and post-fire erosion and deposition patterns. Combining the field and remote sensing datasets will allow an assessment of the impact of the fire, provide data products useful to the scientific and management communities, and support future research on ecosystem recovery. A postdoc and two graduate students will be fully integrated in the research, thus building awareness and capacity for using airborne remote sensing data in the future.</AbstractNarration>

The 2012 High Park Fire was the second largest fire in Colorado history (over 35,000 ha burned) and burned in a wildland-urban interface of public and private lands located north and west of Fort Collins, CO.

This analysis indicated that there was no statistically significant evidence that pre-fire beetle infestation was a factor in the distribution of post-fire burn severity- a major objective of this research and a key issue for forest managers in the western United States.     We used 2007 (pre-fire) stereo aerial photography to reconstruct forest height and cover attributes prior to the fire and conducted a detailed comparison of the ability of lidar and aerial photography to predict attributes such as aboveground carbon storage. Using this approach, we estimate that, when all the dead material has been decomposed, 2 Tg of carbon will have been released to the atmosphere and can break down the carbon loss due to each level of fire severity.       We analyzed controls on erosion rates and evaluated how channel geomorphic changes related to these erosion rates and to rainfall event characteristics (Kampf et al. 2016). We found that bare soil and rainfall intensity were the primary drivers for storm event erosion. Instead of rainfall erosivity, which is commonly used for erosion predictions, we found that rainfall depths exceeding high intensity thresholds were best correlated with hillslope erosion rates.     We compared the rainfall thresholds causing erosion at High Park Fire to those of other fires and examined how eroded sediments from hillslopes have moved through the channel network. Generally hillslope erosion declined over time, but the pattern is strongly influenced by the storm patterns in each year.     At the hillslope scale, we found that rainfall depths exceeding high intensity thresholds best explained downstream channel change (Kampf et al. 2016). The patterns of incision and aggradation in the channels were completely altered by the extreme 2013 September flood, which produced substantial upstream incision and downstream aggradation in the study watersheds. Our findings suggest that within the burned area, patterns of channel change are linked more to rainfall patterns than to burn severity, steep slopes, and erodible soils.     Finally, we evaluated the use of NEON AOP (a remote sensing platform) operations and data processing algorithms, identifying numerous areas for improvement of the existing data processing methods, which were subsequently adopted by the NEON AOP group.
