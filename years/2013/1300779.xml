<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a three year continuing award to support a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site program at Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) entitled, "RET in Engineering and Computer Science Site: Research Experiences in Mechatronics, Robotics, and Industrial Automation", under the direction of Dr. Sheng-Jen ("Tony") Hsieh.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Automation has a profound effect on the way we do work, and mechatronics and robotics are the building blocks for industrial automation.  U.S. manufacturers are seeking highly skilled workers to hire in industrial automation and control jobs. This RET Site will allow twelve high school and two-year college faculty (36 over three years) involved in career and technology education (CATE) to actively participate in Mechatronics, Robotics, and Industrial Automation research and curriculum development at TAMU during a six week summer research program with follow-up activities during the academic year. During the summer the participants will: 1) engage in a research project with faculty research mentors and develop a poster and presentation about their project; 2) attend special topic presentations and site tours; 3) develop an instructional module to teach a topic related to their research area; and 4) participate in a weekly workshop series on how to write a proposal.  During the following academic year, they will 1) implement their instructional modules in their classrooms and assess learning outcomes; 2) revise the modules and summarize results from the assessment; 3) participate in a spring workshop to present results, disseminate developed materials, and evaluate the program; and 4) give a presentation about their summer experience to other teachers.  An online community will be developed to allow participants to continue to communicate with project staff and with one another during the academic year.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Opportunities for CATE faculty to participate in university research are relatively few. This proposed RET Site program will provide opportunities for CATE faculty to collaborate and establish long-term relationships with research faculty at TAMU, a Tier 1 research institution.  The integration of research and education, along with increased availability of high quality curriculum materials and instructional resources will strengthen education in mechatronics, robotics and automation and ultimately help the U.S. workforce to be more competitive in these areas.</AbstractNarration>

During the following academic year, participants implemented and evaluated their lesson modules.  They then returned in the spring to share their findings and updated lesson modules, and participated in a focus group to evaluate the program.  Applicants were recruited through multiple channels, including direct emails to teachers and principals at over 800 high schools, distribution of flyers and program info via the Engineering Technology listserv, the ATE PI meeting, and distribution lists for Texas BEST (a robotics organization) and the Florida ATE Center (FLATE).  Of the 37 participants, 25 (68%) were secondary school teachers and 12 (32%) were two-year college instructors. Also, 12 (32%) of the 37 were female and 14 (38%) were members of minority groups.

Also 23 (68%) of the institutions represented have student populations that are predominantly (&gt;50%) underrepresented minority. Thirty-three lesson modules were developed and evaluated by over 1600 students in the U.S.  Participants conducted research and developed lesson materials on topics such as:  Development of Smart Mobile Robot System to Help Middle-School Students Learn about Robot Perception Web-Based Automated Transfer System Engineering Mechanics: Simulating 3-D Models with OpenFOAM Smart Packaging Machine Simulator for Teaching Ladder Logic Programming A Study of Multi-Robot Systems Recreated for High School Students Smart Lighting Module for Teaching High School Science and Engineering Students about Programmable Logic Controllers Urban Search and Rescue Robot: Visual Localization and Navigation Instructional Module on Use of a Programmable Logic Controller for Smart Traffic Light Control Multiple Sensors for Robot Teaming using Raspberry Pi and VEX Robotics Construction Kit Face Detection Library to Teach Algorithm Basics in Python Designing and Building a Prosthetic Hand for a High School Engineering Design Course   A paper about the program was presented at the 2015 ASEE Annual Conference.  In addition, program participants wrote and published 14 papers for the ASEE Annual Conferences during the project period.
