<AbstractNarration>SES-1333367&lt;br/&gt;Phillip McMichael&lt;br/&gt;Kathleen Sexsmith&lt;br/&gt;Cornell University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation examines the moral basis of the labor process and workplace relationships between undocumented immigrants and farmers on New York dairies, in the context of industrial growth and consolidation. Although sociological theories of development expect labor relationships in industrial agriculture to be governed by functional and impersonal norms, employment commitments on dairy farms are often based on notions of justice and affective ties. This dissertation research hypothesizes that farmers are compelled to meet workers' ideals of fairness regarding the treatment of labor, including protection from immigration enforcement and support in meeting basic needs, due to these immigrants' skilled job performance and the risk of their labor flight. It further hypothesizes that farmers' compliance with these moral economies paradoxically contributes to the modernization of the dairy industry. The study contributes to understanding industrialization processes in agrarian societies, migrant networks, and agricultural labor under globalization, by seeking answers to the following questions: (1) How does undocumented status combine with the structure of production to shape: a) the material and social experience of dairy labor, and b) the formation of migrant networks? (2) What ideals of fairness do farm owners and workers draw upon to legitimate the division of labor on dairy farms? (3) How, and with what impact on farms, do migrant workers resist when their expectations of fairness are not met? The researchers will complete comparative, ethnographic research in two New York dairying counties with differing experiences of agro-industrial growth and immigration enforcement activity. It analyzes the social fabric of dairy farm life through semi-structured interviews, time use surveys, archival analysis, and participant observation with farm and community members. &lt;br/&gt;Study&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Findings could potentially inform immigration policies and agricultural extension programs that aim to improve the employment conditions of migrant workers and the viability of dairy farms. Results will be presented to the Cornell Cooperative Extension offices. The research design includes English classes for immigrant workers, helping them to integrate in the community. It also benefits the teaching and learning of two undergraduate students, who will be employed as research assistants. The theoretical positioning of the project at the nexus of development sociology and migration studies will contribute to interdisciplinary collaboration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research project illustrated the relationships between food system globalization, labor migration, and transnationalism in the context of the isolated dairying landscape of rural Upstate New York. It analyzed the legal and social production of precarity for immigrant dairy farmworkers, as well as their counter-hegemonic efforts to achieve structural change in their working and living conditions.  Based on four years of ethnographic and archival research, this dissertation research found that the rapid industrialization of the New York dairy industry has depended on the constant availability of an undocumented migrant population&mdash;often enclosed on dairy farms due to intensive post-911 border patrolling &mdash;for round-the-clock labor in modernized milking parlors. In these workplaces, the regulatory framework has failed to provide adequate labor and health and safety protections, exacerbating farmworkers? vulnerability, and requiring farmers and farmworkers to try, often in vain, to informally fill in these social protection gaps. It finds that a paternalistic social system has emerged on dairy farms in which farmers provide jobs, access to food, transportation and funds to receive medical care, and a sense of protection from Border Patrol, in return for farmworkers? consent to an arduous, dangerous, and poorly remunerated labor process. I found that farmers negotiate ethical codes around hired labor practices to justify the unceasing work that industrial dairy farming &ndash; and the survival of their businesses in a competitive neoliberal dairying economy &ndash; requires. Farmworkers, too, define new moral rules in their labor networks, developing new systems of domestic cooperation, but also creating clandestine markets for dairy farm jobs. Despite these conditions, some dairy farmworkers, supported by labor advocates, are calling on policy-makers for systemic changes in occupational safety and health regulations, and have already achieved regulatory changes that have helped to improve these precarious conditions of work and life.  This research has made a valuable contribution to Agro-food System Studies and to Migration Studies by analyzing how the ethical rules that shape farm labor processes are reformulated as undocumented immigrants are integrated into the social fabric of a "new immigrant destination" in the rural U.S. It produces theoretical findings on (1) the legal framework and social practices that produce a racialized, gendered, and nationality-based labor hierarchy on dairy farms; (2) how farm size and proximity to the international border shape the dimensions of employer paternalism, using comparative data across farm sizes and space; and (3) how and why the ethical ties in migrants? labor networks sometimes disintegrate in the hostile and isolated landscape of rural Upstate New York.
