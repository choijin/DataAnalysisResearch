<AbstractNarration>PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS: &lt;br/&gt;Arizona State University (ASU - Lead)&lt;br/&gt;University of Virginia (UVA)&lt;br/&gt;University of Notre Dame (ND)&lt;br/&gt;University of the Pacific (UOP)&lt;br/&gt;Colorado State University (CSU)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT DESCRIPTION &lt;br/&gt;This project is developing and evaluating a computer-aided tutoring system to support the teaching of elementary linear circuit analysis. It is expanding a prototype system to cover topics in a traditional two-semester linear circuits course. The system can generate circuit problems with random topologies and element values for DC, steady-state AC, and transient circuits; allowing students to study concepts related to Fourier analysis, Laplace transforms, Bode plots, and three-phase circuits. Problem solutions are produced using a variety of special pedagogical features, including exercises designed to correct common student misconceptions. The system accepts a rich variety of inputs such as equations, re-drawn circuit diagrams, waveform sketches, matrix equations, as well as conventional numerical and multiple-choice answers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The web-based system is being employed and evaluated in a variety of ways in linear circuit classes at ASU, UVA, ND, and UOP. Dr. Daniel Robinson (at CSU) is conducting rigorous evaluation and analysis of the resulting qualitative and quantitative student learning data collected at these institutions. Through testing the software system in a variety of public and private schools, the team is demonstrating that the system can provide rapid feedback to instructors and enhance student learning - in areas that students have the most difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER SIGNIFICANCE &lt;br/&gt;The project is directly impacting more than 4300 students and having a significant effect on engineering education, since many engineering students in various disciplines take circuits courses. It is also expected that the system will be highly suitable for incorporation into massive open on-line courses (MOOCs) addressing this subject area. Student engagement is being increased through the use of interactive exercises that provide rapid feedback to students at each step of a problem. The team is also developing a tutorial authoring interface and execution engine that allows tutorial writers (e.g., instructors) to design more effective tutoring sequences by using the features of the circuit generation and solution modules. The approach is adaptable to other subject areas in electrical engineering, as well as other engineering disciplines. Some of the simpler tutorials and modules on basic circuit properties are being made available to high school students and the general public via a website designed for that purpose.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objectives of this project are to expand, disseminate and evaluate a circuit tutor software that had been developed under a previously funded NSF Type I project. This is a collaborative NSF-TUES Type II project, following a previously funded Type I project on "step-based computer-aided tutoring software".  This circuit tutor software coaches and guides students learn how to analyze linear circuits which is a required course(s) in most electrical and computer engineering curricula, as well as other engineering curricula. The main goals of our participation in this project are to help further develop, evaluate and disseminate the software.  The key intellectual merit of this project rests on the further development of interactive software tools to improve students? learning effectiveness in the study of linear circuit analysis.  The software provides instant (step-by-step) feedback to students and enhances their intentional engagement throughout the learning process.  The outcomes of this project show that this software package is also suitable for incorporation into massive open on-line courses (MOOCs) addressing this subject area.  Linear Circuit Analysis is a fundamental course taken by a large numbers of engineering students in several engineering disciplines, Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering at most universities, as well as Physics at some universities.  Thus, outcomes of this project can have significant broad impact on engineering and basic physical science education.  It could also have broader pedagogical impact on computer-aided learning tools.  The important outcomes have been presented at conferences (American Society for Engineering Education Annual Conference and Exposition, IEEE Frontiers in Engineering Education Conference).  Those outcomes include data that support the effectiveness of this software as an effective learning tool, and student feedbacks on their usage of the software.  Use of the software was shown to improve student learning of the subject matter, as evidenced through test scores.  Based on students? written feedbacks and responses at a focus group meeting, it also appeared to have improve students? engagements in the course and enhance their interests in the subject matter.  Throughout the entire project period, the software was continuously tested and improved.  In essence, this project has provided students with experience of using the computer-aided tutoring software to help them achieve learning objectives. it also trained a graduate student and an undergraduate student work on testing the software, thereby getting some in-depth training on teaching circuit analysis and the software tools' development process.
