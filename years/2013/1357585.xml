<AbstractNarration>This award provides funds for a new Research Data Center on the campus of the University of Nebraska Lincoln, with a branch center at Iowa State University. Research Data Centers are established by host institutions with cooperation from the Bureau of the Census.  The Center will provide secure access to restricted-use government microdata for the purpose of statistical research.   Research at this Center will include projects on a wide range of topics, including economics, rural vs. urban life and resource sustainability, and water and food security.   The research conducted at this RDC will give policymakers new insights into long term trends in this region of the country.  In addition, Center researchers plan to use their expertise in survey methods to work to develop methods appropriate for Census data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RDC is supported by an initial consortium that includes the host institutions and the University of Nebraska Medical Center, the University of South Dakota, and the University of Iowa.  The Center will add geographic diversity to the current network of 18 existing RDCs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Federal Statistical Research Data Centers (RDCs) provide qualified researchers at leading research institutions with access to restricted-use microdata to address important research questions in fields such as economics, public health, psychology, sociology, education, statistics, and survey methodology.  This NSF award provided seed funding to establish the Central Plains Research Data Center (CPRDC), which includes a consortium of researchers at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Iowa State University, the University of Iowa, the University of South Dakota, and the University of Nebraska Medical Center.  Before this award, there existed 14 RDCs, with none of them located in the central part of the continental United States.  With the benefit of NSF seed money provided by the award, the CPRDC, with a facility located on the campus at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, was established on November 10, 2015 (https://business.unl.edu/outreach/central-plains-federal-statistical-research-data-center).   From the time of its establishment until the time of this writing (August 2018), the CPRDC has been able to sponsor 21 research projects with research investigators throughout the consortium.  In terms of intellectual merit, these projects will advance knowledge by seeking a greater understanding of issues regarding the relationship between housing attractiveness and community living choices, income and mental health, residential changes and employment, rurality and public health, survey interviewing dynamics and data quality, statistical modeling and valid scientific inferencing regarding mortality, among additional topics.  The broader impacts of this research will include public policy decision making in economics, housing, and health, and on improving methods for the collection and analysis of data collected by the federal statistical agencies.  The CPRDC will continue to grow in the coming years providing key answers to societal issues that will lead to benefits among residents of the United States, with a particular focus on those who live regionally in the central plains.
