<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to examine interactions between two fundamental and distinct types of atmospheric circulation: primary circulations, consisting of zonal, east-west directed jets together with their embedded Rossby waves and Rossby-wave critical layers; and the slower but persistent secondary circulations, which are driven to a large extent by the eddy mixing associated with the jets and waves of the primary circulations, and which control long-term meridional transport throughout the atmosphere. Although primary circulations drive secondary ones, the latter also modify the former though the transport both of momentum and of radiatively active chemical species, notably carbon dioxide, water vapor, and ozone. The work builds extensively on previous NSF-supported research on the "potential vorticity staircase" and the nature of atmospheric zonal jets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A key theme will involve a consideration of the influence of inhomogeneous eddy mixing on the distribution of secondary circulations in height and latitude; and, in turn, the steepening of chemical tracer and potential vorticity gradients by the differential vertical motions of the secondary circulations. Theoretical investigations into the importance of non-trivial vertical structure and the role of eddy-driven secondary circulations in the potential vorticity staircase will be complemented by applications to topical issues in stratosphere-troposphere and tropical-polar dynamical coupling and the transport of chemical tracers throughout the atmosphere.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project focused on the interplay between two fundamentally different types of circulation in the Earth's atmosphere: the primary, predominantly zonal, planet encircling winds that comprise, for example, the jet stream and the winter stratospheric polar vortex; and the secondary circulations, transverse to the primary ones, that move air systematically across different heights and latitudes.  Although much weaker, the secondary circulations are responsible for much of transport of heat and angular momentum within the atmosphere, and therefore are instrumental in shaping the primary circulations themselves.  Conversely, the secondary circulations are determined to a large extent by the synoptic and planetary-scale wave perturbations to the primary circulations, such as the meanders of the jet stream in latitude.  One of the main outcomes of the project has been the development of a theory that links the secondary circulations with the inhomogeneous mixing in latitude that occurs between jet streams when waves and meanders deform irreversibly.  The theory provides estimates of how strong the secondary circulations can be for a given configuration of primary circulations and can be used to examine the interactions between distinct jets streams that are separated in latitude and height.  Another fundamental outcome is a new description of how waves and disturbances can transfer from one jet stream to another in a manner fundamentally different from the classical linear theory of wave propagation.  The theoretical developments in the project have been illustrated by applications in a number of diverse contexts.  In the Earth's atmosphere, outcomes of the project provide a new description of the natural variability of the winter stratospheric polar vortex as well as its coupling to the quasi-biennial oscillation, an alternating pattern of east-west winds in the tropical stratosphere.  They also provide insight into the role of planetary-scale waves in the observed shift of the subtropical jet stream in response to climate change.  More widely, because the theoretical developments rely on few assumptions, they may be applied very generally, not only to the circulations of the Earth's atmosphere but also to typical circulations found in atmospheres of other planets, provided only that they are rapidly rotating and stably stratified.  Such outcomes of the project include a new description of the annular structure of the winter polar vortex found in the Martian atmosphere and a new theory for how observed east-west jets at the cloud-top level in the Jovian atmosphere depend on height in a way that is consistent with established theories of jet stability.
