<AbstractNarration>At Lehigh University the Imbt Laboratories are comprised of two nationally recognized research facilities: The Advanced Technology for Large Structural Systems (ATLSS) Engineering Research Center and the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES@Lehigh) Facility. These labs conduct data- and computationally-intensive research in the areas of structural and civil engineering, as well as simulation of earthquake effects on large-scale structural systems. The increasing use of numeric and fast hybrid simulations in these areas of engineering in the Imbt Labs require massive data transfers, which require high-capacity network availability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed upgrades to the Imbt Labs and Lehigh's campus cyberinfrastructure provide three major functionalities to enhance research and teaching. These include: improved access to computing infrastructure maintained in the university data center; improved access to national computational resources (e.g. NSF XSEDE); and enhancements to collaborative research activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The network enhancements provided by the project consist of upgrading the Imbt core network infrastructure with gigabit connectivity for improved bandwidth supporting large dataset transfers. This project also creates a campus ScienceDMZ, greatly enhancing long-haul transfer of large data sets with external research partners and collaborators working with ATLSS, NEES@Lehigh, and other campus research centers such as Lehigh's Center for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project significantly enhances research at Lehigh as well as graduate and undergraduate education in various disciplines that utilize the resources of the Imbt Labs. Activities in the Imbt Labs also contribute to and promote Lehigh's diversity commitment to increase the participation of members of underrepresented groups in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Outcomes Report - Award 1340992 CC-NIE Network Infrastructure Building a ScienceDMZ for Enhanced Engineering and Science Research Lehigh University &ndash; December 2015  Lehigh University has experienced a rapid increase in demand for network bandwidth and lower-latency connectivity to support engineering and science data flows, both on- and off-campus.  Nowhere were these requirements more striking than in The Advanced Technology for Large Structural Systems Engineering Research Center (ATLSS) and the George E. Brown, Jr.  Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES@Lehigh), a national shared-use research facility.  Both of these research centers are located in the Imbt Labs facility on LehighÆs Mountaintop Campus and provide compelling research drivers for comprehensive re-engineering of campus cyberinfrastructure (CI).  The overall goal of this project, then, was to broadly remove impediments to large data transfers within the university network and to our research collaborators on the Internet2 backbone through the implementation of an infrastructure technology called a "ScienceDMZ".   Research data sets from ATLSS/NEES research activities are quite large and need to be stored and shared with other researchers, some of which are physically in different locations around the world.  The datasets employing the ScienceDMZ during 2015 included comprehensive experimental and analytical data on the projects. The largest of the datasets was in excess of 4 TB. Prior to the implementation of the data transfer node (DTN) and the network upgrades, the transfers required several hours to upload to the repository.  With the installation of the DTN and subsequent testing and tuning, we were able to transfer the data in 25 minutes.  In addition to the data transfers related to experimental work, data transfers of analytical modeling results have been significantly impacted. One specific researcher conducting analytical studies has participated in the transfer of 12TB of modeling results with high performance computers where before this would not have been feasible.  The improved bandwidth and reduced latency has had a significant impact on the number of researchers conducting collaborative research at the ATLSS Center and the number of researchers utilizing HPC (high-performance computing) for large analytical research studies. Prior to the improvements, there were a limited number of researchers (at that time 4 researchers) conducting large-scale analytical studies using HPC resources. Since the improvements, there are now in excess of 12 graduate student researchers, 3 post-doctoral researchers, and 5 faculty members involved in collaborative projects utilizing the improved bandwidth.  The research background affected includes varied structural engineering sub-disciplines: fatigue and fracture; reliability; resilience modeling; and earthquake engineering.  Clearly, there are positive broader impacts to be derived from addressing the CI requirements of the data-intensive research activities noted above.  All similar research activities are being productive and efficient---leading to faster time-to-solution for problems at current scales, and the ability to consider problems at larger scales than previously were investigated given local resource constraints.  Expansion of 10GbE services connecting our central computing facility to the campus backbone and the ScienceDMZ is also benefitting the universityÆs teaching mission, as the central resources are providing enhanced services for both research and classroom/lab users.
