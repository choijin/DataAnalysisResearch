<AbstractNarration>This work by the University of Illinois Chicago particle physics group is focused on improving our understanding of the Universe at the smallest scales, allowing us to probe nature?s basic symmetries and their relation to our fundamental understanding of mass. By precisely measuring the properties of the newly discovered Higgs boson with the CMS detector at the LHC, key insights will emerge into how electroweak symmetry is broken and the fundamental property of mass.  Other topics that this research will explore include searches for manifestations of supersymmetry and exotic new phenomena beyond the Standard Model involving strong dynamics.  Enabling tools and methods for this research include their work on hardware and software development for CMS.  The group also has an established Quarknet outreach activity in Chicago-area high schools.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="Body">The CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has been at the high-energy frontier in particle physics since 2010. It is a unique tool for fundamental physics research, providing&nbsp; unprecedented physics potential. After completing a very successful first run in 2013, which included the discovery of the elusive Higgs Boson, the accelerator complex resumed operations in 2015 at nearly the designed proton-proton collision energy of 13 TeV.&nbsp; Since the start of the LHC, the High-Energy Physics group at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) has concentrated its research activities on the CMS experiment. &nbsp;During the period covered by this award the group made important contributions in the upgrades of the CMS Forward Pixel Detector and the Level-1 Calorimeter Trigger. &nbsp;The group&rsquo;s contributions to physics analysis has been focused on studies of Higgs Boson production, and searches for supersymmetry, new massive particles decaying to pair of top quarks, quark compositeness, and extra spatial dimensions.</p> <p class="Body">The UIC group has been responsible for testing and calibrating the ~750 detector modules that together comprise the new CMS forward pixel detector (FPix). The FPix detector lies at the core of CMS detector and is able to measure the position of the particles created in the collisions with a precision better than 1/10<sup>th</sup> the size of a human hair.&nbsp; The new detector was shipped to CERN in November 2016 and will begin taking data in March 2017. Figure 1 shows a photograph of a quarter-section of the FPix detector after it was assembled at Fermilab.</p> <p class="Body">A powerful and flexible trigger is the cornerstone of a modern hadron collider experiment, and it dictates what physics processes can be studied properly and what is ultimately left unexplored.&nbsp; The UIC group has been heavily involved in the CMS Trigger since 2006, where we have been major contributors to both the Level-1 (L1) and the High Level Trigger (HLT) systems.&nbsp; Over the time period covered by this grant, the group took leading roles in the development, commissioning, and monitoring of the L1 Calorimeter Trigger upgrade for Run 2 of the LHC. In addition, the group has been responsible for the development, implementation, validation, and maintenance of the trigger algorithms and menus for both the L1 and HLT systems.</p> <p class="Body">The UIC group has also made significant contributions to physics analysis at CMS with emphasis on the following areas:</p> <p class="Body">The group used newly developed jet substructure techniques to perform a model-independent search for highly boosted resonant top pair production in events containing a lepton, a neutrino, a b-jet and a top-jet. The result was combined with similar searches with different final states and published in Phys. Rev. D 93 (2016) 012001. As can be seen in Figure 2, even though the channel pursued by UIC (shown in red) is the most sensitive one, the final result nevertheless benefitted from the combination with other channels, resulting in the most stringent exclusion limit for these particles to-date.</p> <p class="Body">The group has continued playing a leadership role on searches of new physics phenomena using angular distributions of the two highest transverse-momentum jets (dijets) in proton-proton collision events.&nbsp; The dijet angular distribution with respect to the beam direction is directly sensitive to the dynamics of the scattering partons at the shortest distance scales, providing a fundamental test of QCD, while serving as a powerful tool for searching for new physics models (such as quark contact interactions or compactified extra dimensions) that predict more isotropic angular distributions.&nbsp; Using the full 8-TeV data sample, the group published a measurement (Phys. Lett. B 746 (2015) 79) of the diijet angular distributions over a wide range of dijet invariant masses (Figure 3). No significant deviation from the standard model predictions was observed, and the most stringent set of limits on contact interaction scale and the best limits on benchmark models of extra spatial dimensions were set at the time.</p> <p class="Body">The group also led CMS searches for the direct pair production of light supersymmetric partners to the top-quark, using the non-resonant all-hadronic jets and missing energy channel.

Analyzing both the 8 TeV (JHEP 1506 (2015) 116) and first 13 TeV data samples, the group excluded supersymmetric top-squarks having a mass below approximately four-times the standard model top-quark mass, raising the stakes considerably on the prospects for weak-scale supersymmetry.</p> <p class="Body">Finally, the UIC group has been very active in outreach activities at all levels, from engaging Chicago-area high school students and teachers in hands-on high energy physics research, to giving public lectures and maintaining displays at local museums.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/28/2016<br>      Modified by: Nikos&nbsp;Varelas</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1306951/1306951_10275531_1480387591424_FPIX--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1306951/1306951_10275531_1480387591424_FPIX--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1306951/1306951_10275531_1480387591424_FPIX--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Quarter-section of the FPIX detector.
