<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to continue the Iowa State University's (ISU) participation in the CyberCorps®: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program to prepare highly-qualified Cybersecurity professionals for entry into the government workforce. Faculty from the Departments of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Political Science, Mathematics, and the School of Education lead the interdisciplinary CyberCorps® SFS program, designated by the National Security Agency as a charter Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education. The graduate students work closely with the faculty to receive Cybersecurity training, conduct research, and develop as leaders and team members. All students participate two full years in the unique and critical component of the ISU CyberCorps® SFS program: leadership, teamwork and professionalism development. The NSF's CyberCorps® SFS program funds projects that address cybersecurity education and workforce development. The Scholarship Track provides funding to award scholarships to students in cybersecurity. In return for their scholarships, recipients will work after graduation for a Federal, State, Local, or Tribal Government organization in a position related to cybersecurity for a period equal to the length of the scholarship. The Capacity Track seeks innovative proposals leading to an increase in the ability of the United States higher education enterprise to produce cybersecurity professionals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To date, the project has produced and placed with the federal government close to 60 CyberCorps® SFS students. ISU is known for a wide dissemination of hands-on, lab-oriented courses and educational materials that emphasize problem solving in a variety of contexts; engagement with state agencies and local industry, and multiple opportunities to practice professionalism within service learning projects. Students contribute to Cybersecurity knowledge base by participating in ISU research programs that address important issues including intrusion detection systems, network security, data privacy and security, dependable systems and networks, and security policy and commerce. The program has an outstanding record of supporting students to complete their programs within the required two years. ISU CyberCorps® SFS program allows students to have a broader impact on society before they leave the university. For the culmination of the leadership program, students give back to the community through an extensive service learning project designed to require the direct application of all the skills they have been developing throughout the program: technical, research, interpersonal, team, and leadership. In addition, the project will provide interactions with high schools and community colleges to increase Cybersecurity awareness and the number of students interested in Cybersecurity.</AbstractNarration>

This current SFS proposal provided funding to support an integrated research and education program for 22 total students over the 5 years.  Consistent with the current program and its format, graduate students take the cyber security courses and earn either a masters degree or a Ph.D.  Points of pride of the ISU Cyber Corps program include the use and dissemination of hands-on, lab-oriented courses and educational materials, emphasis on problem-solving in a variety of contexts, leadership and team development, a strong cohort experience, engagement with state agencies and local industry, and multiple opportunities to practice professionalism within the service learning project  The ISU SFS program continues to benefit society by providing the federal workforce with increased numbers of cyber security professionals who apply best practices in their technical fields and who engage in lifelong technical, intellectual, leadership and citizenship development.

For the culmination of the leadership program, students give back to the community through an extensive service-learning project designed to require the direct applications of all the skills they have been developing throughout the program: technical, research, interpersonal, team, and leadership.  In addition to the skills listed, the students are expected to manage all parts of the project which gives them the opportunity to develop action plans to meet expected outcomes.   They meaningfully engage in the integration of their cyber security coursework, research expertise, and leadership skills to practice what will be expected of them over their professional lives.  In addition, strong impact results as: (1) faculty continue to host and participate in conferences and workshops that make ISU instructional materials for courses and labs freely available and (2) partnerships are strengthened between ISU and federal, state, and other relevant cyber security professional employment sectors.
