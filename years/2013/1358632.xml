<AbstractNarration>The research team is developing a photonic crystal platform technology based on negative refraction superlattices designed to implement high-performance phase modulators and tunable birefringent filters for use in optical communication modules.  This technology is with chip-scale photonic crystal elements, highly wavelength-dispersive and potentially low-loss structures allows for high-density integration into modules. Since the devices are based on negative refraction photonic crystal superlattices which have strong wavelengths and phase sensitivity, they have low-voltage/power requirements for modulation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current optoelectric modules are large and require high power and high voltages. This technology provides a small, low power, low voltage module.  The smaller size, would enable devices to be integrated into large numbers on silicon chips and enhance communications technologies.</AbstractNarration>
