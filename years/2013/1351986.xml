<AbstractNarration>Superconductivity in Lithium-rich compounds &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non technical abstract: Superconductors, which have zero electrical resistivity and perfect diamagnetism, hold great promise for applications in energy storage, transmission, medical applications and transportation. Unfortunately, the operating temperature of all currently known superconductors is too low for large scale applications. Light materials have been considered to be promising for exhibiting superconducting properties at high temperature. This research focuses on finding new superconducting systems made of ultra light materials with a focus on understanding the non-classical lattice dynamics which are considerable in light elements. We will specifically focus on materials rich in lithium (the lightest metal and superconducting element) and search for new lithium-rich high temperature superconducting systems utilizing extreme conditions of pressure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical abstract: Lithium is the lightest metal and superconducting element. The emergence of exotic quantum states in a compressed light metallic system has been entertained theoretically for metallic phases of hydrogen.  Metallic hydrogen is predicted to have a liquid ground state, and may exhibit a two component superfluid and superconducting phase.  The difficulty of compressing hydrogen to densities sufficient for metallization, however, has prevented experimental proof of these effects.  As an alternative route to studying the evolution of lattice quantum effects in a dense light metallic system, this study will investigate the structural and electronic properties of lithium which is isovalent to hydrogen under pressure. Due to its light mass, Li's lattice is highly dynamic, providing a large phonon spectrum for electron-phonon coupling. By chemical modification, it may be possible to synthesize a Li rich compound in which a high superconducting transition temperature is achieved through electronic enhancement. The motivation of this research is to systematically study superconductivity in ultra-light lithium-based compounds by using high pressure techniques. Studying the superconducting phase diagram of Li-rich compounds will provide insight into finding ways which enhance the superconductivity by chemical modification.</AbstractNarration>

Studying the physics of lithium provides information about the mechanism for superconductivity of ultra-light materials and insight into how one can synthesize new lithium-compounds with higher superconducting transition temperatures.</p> <p><strong>Background:</strong> At ambient pressure lithium is the simplest and lightest metal and superconductor and under compression has one of the highest superconducting transition temperatures of elements. Under pressure, lithium exhibits complex behavior. One of the fascinating aspects of physics of lithium roots in its low atomic mass. Due to its lightness, even at zero temperature lattice of lithium remains far from static. Lithium is the first element immediately after helium, however, while fascinating quantum nature of condensed helium, which remains and insulator, is suppressed at high densities, lithium is expected to adapt more quantum solid behavior under compression due to its metallic behavior. Physics of dense lithium offers a rich playground to look for new emergent quantum phenomena.</p> <p>In the presence of sufficiently large zero point effects crystalline order will be destroyed and a material will have a liquid ground state. One interesting scenario can be realized if a light system sustains long range interactions under compression. While zero point energy of a material cannot be measured directly, studying the physical properties of light metallic systems under pressure can provide information on the scale of these effects and defining the conditions under which these effects are dominant. To observe the quantum effects one would need to reduce temperature effects. Since zero-point energy is related to the mass, studying isotope effects is very promising. Based on these considerations, this award was used to study the isotope effects in superconducting properties and low temperature structural transitions of lithium.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Our contribution:</strong> We found that the superconducting isotope effects of lithium under pressure to be highly anomalous; likely due to the presence of significant lattice quantum effects. Lithium is found to become the first material that exhibits inversion of the superconducting isotope effect. This highly unusual behavior may stem from different mechanisms such as the differences in the structural phase boundaries of the two isotopes (a consequence of zero-point displacements) or even the differences between the electronic structures of two isotopes or combination of several effects. If the unusual isotope effect in Li is solely a consequence of its large zero-point displacements, Li is the only elemental solid known to exhibit such behavior.</p> <p>&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Similar to other alkalis, lithium has a complex and counter-intuitive structural phase transitions to lower symmetry structures. At ambient pressure lithium undergoes a martensitic phase once cooled below 75K which is thought to have a defining role in the superconductivity of lithium. To understand the origin of anomalous isotope effects in superconductivity of lithium it is necessary to determine the low temperature structural phase boundaries of its isotopes. We carried out series of tedious measurements on the low temperature structures of lithium isotopes. We measured the boundaries of the martensitic phase transition of <sup>7</sup>Li which is drastically different from what previously suggested through indirect evidence (Nat. Comm 2015).

In collaboration with theoretical groups we resolved this 75 years old mystery and identified a simple fcc structure as the true thermodynamic ground state of lithium.
