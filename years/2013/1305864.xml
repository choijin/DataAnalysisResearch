<AbstractNarration>Gravitational waves have the potential to expand astronomy into an entirely new regime, providing information about the dynamics and central engines of astrophysical events that are not available by any other means. Combining gravitational waves with electromagnetic observations through multi-messenger astronomy will maximize the information available and allow scientific discoveries that would not be possible with either alone. Our research focuses on three specific projects. The first of these involves searches for gravitational waves in coincidence with short duration radio pulses. Radio signals are a potentially crucial component of a full program of multi-messenger astronomy in the advanced detector era. In some cases, radio emission may be the only observable signal in the direction of the Earth aside from gravitational waves. Using pulses from currently existing Green Bank Telescope pulsar surveys as external triggers in LIGO/Virgo searches will allow us to probe deeper into our current data and set the stage for future coincident analyses between radio signals and gravitational waves. The other direction in which multi-messenger astronomy can be performed, and our second area of focus, entails the follow-up of potential gravitational wave triggers with instruments looking for other astronomical messengers. Regardless of the method employed to detect a signal, having the best data possible to work with will be critical in successfully detecting gravitational waves.  Thus, the third area of focus is in detector characterization, the understanding and mitigation of transient disturbances in the detector that may be confused with astrophysical signals, including developmental studies, as well as well as work maintaining software and validating the calibration of the instruments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Direct confirmation of Einstein's general theory of relativity through the observation of gravitational waves would be a major accomplishment of 21st century physics, with consequences in gravitational theory as well as astronomy and astrophysics.  Validating this observation with coincident emission of photons from the same event would increase our confidence in such an observation.  Additionally, a multi-messenger approach to astronomy, "hearing the universe" through gravitational waves as  well as seeing it through optical, x-ray or radio astronomy, will allow us to gain a more complete scientific picture of the sky around us, potentially including such  phenomena as gamma-ray bursts and supernovae. Since the research is carried out at a primarily undergraduate institution and fully integrates undergraduate researchers, this grant also facilitates the critical task of preparing the next generation of physicists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Multi-messenger astronomy uses more than one type of astrophysical messenger to learn more about a phenomenon in space than would be possible from a single type of signal alone.  In the case of the research supported by this grant, we have primarily focused on searches combining radio frequency bursts and gravitational waves.  These efforts included the first publication describing a search for gravitational waves in coincidence with high frequency radio bursts occurring on milliseconds time scales.  A variety of astrophysical sources could theoretically emit both types of signal nearly simultaneously, including cosmic string cusps, and quaking or coalescing neutron stars. These types of coincidence searches may help us learn about a variety of astrophysical phenomena, including the still-mysterious fast radio bursts.  This initial publication serves as a prototype for further radio/gravitational-wave coincident searches that are already underway.  Efforts in detector characterization can improve the sensitivity of LIGO searches by fixing problems that are interfering with the quality of the interferometric data or, when that isnÃ†t possible, choosing not to analyze short periods of data when a glitch or other problem is known to be occurring.  This grant supported work in enhancing gravitational-wave search sensitivity within LIGO/VirgoÃ†s burst data analysis working group by developing and applying a set of vetoes that eliminates the worst data while still using the vast majority of the data collected by Advanced LIGO.  This grant also supported work maintaining and developing software that allows us to visualize the outputs of hundreds of LIGO auxiliary sensors, letting scientists quickly see whatÃ†s going on with the interferometer and its surroundings.  These and other aspects of detector characterization covered by the grant contributed to the analysis and presentation of the first directly observed gravitational wave, GW150914.  Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University is an undergraduate-focused institution, and undergraduate research students played a role in all aspects of gravitational wave analysis supported by this grant.  Four different students were employed as research assistants.   Two of these students have conducted a senior thesis project involving LIGO data analysis, and all four were able to travel to a LIGO site or conference as part of their research experience due to NSF funding.
