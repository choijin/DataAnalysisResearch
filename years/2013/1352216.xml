<AbstractNarration>A central theme in modern number theory is the conjectural relations between classes of automorphic representations and Galois representations, with notions of algebraicity on both sides, in the context of Langlands program and its p-adic and p-torsion analogues.  To realize such conjectural relations at all, most known methods so far involve the use of the cohomology of certain algebraic varieties and their models over the integers; namely, the so-called (pure) Shimura varieties, the Kuga families over them (generalizing the Kuga--Sato varieties over modular curves) which are special cases of the so-called mixed Shimura varieties, their compactifications, and good models of these over the integers.  The research projects in this proposal aim at making further progress in understanding such fundamentally important geometric objects, through extensive studies along directions both old and new, and at developing their new arithmetic applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number theory and geometry are the two oldest branches of mathematics, and combined applications of them (such as error-correcting codes) have become indispensable in modern daily life (involving, for example, telecommunication and data storage).  The pure and mixed Shimura varieties are important geometric objects relating algebra, analysis, and geometry in natural yet mysterious ways, and advances in their theory have contributed to many exciting recent developments in number theory.  The education projects in this proposal aim at creating a vertically integrated learning environment for number theory and arithmetic geometry at the University of Minnesota, from which students at all levels can benefit, including supports for outreach activities, summer learning projects, and the development of courses and learning seminars.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Pure and mxied Shimura varieties are generalizations of the classical modular curves and the families of elliptic curves over them, whose arithmetic and geometry has played important roles in modern number theory.  The most important and novel outcomes of this project, in terms of its intellectual merits, can be summarized as follows:  (1) With Michael Harris, Richard Taylor, and Jack Thorne, we found a new way to associate Galois representations with automorphic representations, without any self-duality assumption.  One key ingredient is a new p-adic geometric construction of Eisenstein classes in certain rigid cohomology of the ordinary loci of Shimura varieties, based on my previous works.  This is a major breakthrough in Langlands program, and has inspired important works such as Scholze's groundbreaking generalization for torsion cohomology classes.  For nonexperts, the upshot is as follows:  The association of Galois representations with automorphic representations can be viewed as a vast generalization of the quadratic reciprocity law.  Many earlier works made use of the so-called etale cohomology of Shimura varieties, but Galois representations associated with non-self-dual automorphic representations are not supposed to occur this way.  Our method overcame this difficulty by realizing the desired Galois representations as p-adic limits of those that do occur in the etale cohomology, by using some kind of boundary part of the rigid cohomology of ordinary loci.  (2) To study Galois representations on the etale cohomology of Shimura varieties, it is important to understand their restrictions to decomposition groups.  For proper Shimura varieties, these are isomorphic to the cohomology of the associated nearby cycles over the proper reductions, by the proper base change theorem.  With Stroh, based on a series of works on integral models of toroidal compactifications by myself and by Madapusi Pera, we showed that this common assumption of properness is redundant for essentially all integral models of Shimura varieties people constructed in the literature, including all cases of PEL, Hodge, and abelian types studied by myself, Kisin, and Madapusi Pera.
