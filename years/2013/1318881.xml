<AbstractNarration>This project explores methods for enhancing computer security education through the use of practical problem-solving challenges.  The investigators are building step-wise and parametrized reusable security challenges that mimic real-world scenarios involving computer attacks and defense strategies. To this end, the project borrows ideas and practices from successful experiences in building computer security competitions such as capture-the-flag, and provides instructors with a reusable platform for designing and managing competition-style challenges for the purpose of computer security and information assurance education. The investigators are also developing new educational material related to computer security that can be more easily integrated into relevant non-security computer science courses. The main goal is to broaden computer security education by developing a "cross-cutting" teaching approach, whereby fundamental computer security concepts are taught in most core computer science courses, from lower-level undergraduate courses, to upper-level undergraduate, to core graduate courses. Moreover, this project creates an opportunity to further adapt the newly developed education material to a larger audience, offering introductory information security education to IT professionals and increasing awareness regarding information security problems in general.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal of this project is to develop and deliver an effective computer security curriculum so that students are able to deal with on-going dynamic cyber security issues during their design and management of information systems in real-world settings.  This project borrows ideas and practices from successful experiences in popular computer security competitions such as capture the flag (CTF).   We develop and organize CTF challenges for education purposes, and in this project we focus on solving issues related to the efficiency of challenge development. Although many CTF challenges are often effective hands-on exercises, the development of such challenges requires a substantial amount of effort in design, preparation, and management.  The common practice of challenge-based education is still at the stage of requiring to hide solutions from students.  Once write-ups and solutions are published, challenges need to be redesigned for new students.   This project provides a solution to challenge development and organization, allowing educators to achieve a higher efficiency for security curriculum development.   Our solution extends the lifetime of challenges with stepwise and reusable designs.   Stepwise is the guideline for organizing challenges around the same subject but with gradually increasing difficulty levels.  From students? perspective, the skill set should grow as they progress from one challenge to the next.  That growth should be relied upon for later challenges.  A natural progression from challenge to challenge should be evident.  For reusability, we designed challenges that are tunable such that unique variants can be generated with minimal effort.  From students? perspective, these variants will always pose the same level of difficulty, even if the solution to a previous version of the challenge is revealed.   With helps from educational experts, this project evaluated the effectiveness of how these challenges enhance student learning about computer security.  The benefits found with this approach include promoting students? integration and synthesis of their knowledge, the articulation of concepts and their connections, and interactions among peers.
