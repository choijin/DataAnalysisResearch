<AbstractNarration>All animals use external cues from the environment throughout their lives to determine what behavior to do and not do.  Ultimately it is the brain that must ?decide? what the cues mean and how to respond.  The goal of this study is to understand how the brain integrates different types of environmental cues to regulate the timing of reproduction.  The researcher will accomplish this using the garter snake to examine how temperature cues stimulate neural regulation of reproductive activity. Garter snakes are especially robust for these studies because its reproductive behavior is regulated exclusively by temperature. Furthermore, Thamnophis sirtalis has one of the most extensive ranges of any ectotherm in North America, from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico and from east to west coasts. Thus, garter snakes provide a relatively simple yet powerful framework for understanding why (and how) animals respond differently to the same environmental cues. Specifically this project uses a combination of molecular, physiological, and behavioral approaches to determine if temperature-induced reproductive behavior is regulated by changes in thyroid hormone metabolism within the brain. This project will broaden the participation of undergraduates in science education and outreach, with the ultimate goal of improving the scientific aptitude of the community. Additional broad impacts include training diverse students in integrative research, critical thinking, and community engagement.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will test the hypothesis that temperature-induced activation of the reproductive axis is controlled by neural thyroid hormone metabolism.  The research will use a combination of in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, pharmacological manipulation, radioimmunoassay, and behavioral testing to accomplish the following specific aims: (1) Identify the influence of low temperature dormancy on the neuroendocrine GnRH system; (2) Determine if temperature-induced reproductive behavior is regulated by changes in thyroid hormone metabolism within the hypothalamus; and (3) Determine if variation in the temperature sensitivity of reproductive regulatory mechanisms mediates differences in reproductive timing.  This project will advance the understanding of the neurobiology underlying plasticity in reproductive timing, and should reveal mechanisms that may be impacted by climate change. Data from this project will be used to generate inquiry-based learning modules for the classroom, thereby providing students with hands-on practice in experimental design, data analysis and data interpretation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Many people look forward to the changing seasons. We can see these changes in the way the sunlight shifts and as the days grow longer and shorter. We feel these changes as a warm spring breeze or a nip in the air when the leaves begin to fall. Like us, other animals can detect the changing seasons, and they use cues from the environment to ensure they perform activities like raising young and eating when environmental conditions are best suited for their success. One of the strongest cues driving seasonal changes in animal behavior and physiology is daylength. Not coincidentally, it is also the best studied. As daylength increases during spring, it triggers internal changes in animals that can stimulate reproduction, appetite, and/or parental behavior. In order for external, environmental cues to effect such changes internally, however, the environmental cue must first be translated into an internal signal that can "talk to" all cells in the body. The process of translating environmental cues into internal signals is the job of the neuroendocrine system. The hormone that features most prominently in this process is melatonin, because its synthesis is directly inhibited by light. Light is not the only environmental cue available to animals, however, and one question that remains is whether other environmental cues such as temperature also modify the neuroendocrine system to regulate changes in an organism's biology. Answering this question is critical if we are to understand how changes in the environment, especially those associated with climate change, will impact the health and reproductive success of animals. The main goal of this project was to determine if environmental temperature affects the neuroendocrine signals that regulate reproduction. We used garter snakes to perform these studies because their seasonal biology is regulated almost exclusively by temperature, and they can therefore help us understand how temperature impacts the brain, hormones, and behavior in all animals.</p> <p>This project has yielded several exciting results. First, we discovered that the neurons in the brain that produce gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) are sensitive to the duration of low-temperature winter dormancy. This neurohormone influences both reproductive behavior and the activity of the gonads, and therefore increases in GnRH in response to low-temperature dormancy explain, at least in part, how temperature activates spring breeding behavior. Next, we asked if these temperature-induced changes in GnRH are regulated by altered thyroid hormone metabolism within the hypothalamus of the brain. We found that low-temperature dormancy increases deiodinase 2 (the enzyme that synthesizes thyroid hormone) and decreases deiodinase 3 (the enzyme that deactivates thyroid hormone) immunoreactivity. Together, these changes would lead to the accumulation of thyroid hormone within the hypothalamus. Finally, we asked if the observed changes in GnRH and deiodinase enzymes are mediated by the hormones thyrotropin and/or melatonin. Our results indicate that the number of thyrotropin-immunoreactive cells in the median eminence and infundibulum of the pituitary decreased in response to low-temperature winter dormancy; this decrease was eliminated by treatment with the melatonin precursor 5-hydroxy-tryptophan. These results suggest that thyroid hormone metabolism within the hypothalamus is indeed regulated by environmental temperature and, more specifically, temperature-induced decreases in blood melatonin concentrations. These changes may, in turn, underlie the mechanism by which environmental temperature increases GnRH and activates reproduction. Intriguingly, many of the changes we observed were sexually dimorphic, suggesting that these neuroendocrine signals may also explain why male and female snakes exhibit different patterns of reproductive behavior.</p> <p>Throughout the project, we aimed to achieve our broader impacts and bring our science to a more diverse and inclusive audience. This project has facilitated the training of a Research Technician, 4 graduate students, 21 undergraduate students, and 9 high school students.
