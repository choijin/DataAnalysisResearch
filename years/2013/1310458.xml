<AbstractNarration>Research Objectives and Approaches&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to create a design process for offshore wind generation systems.  The design process will explore a variety of advanced technologies for the electric machinery as well as the power conversion and electrical connection to shore power.  The approach for this research project is to apply optimal design to a notional offshore wind farm considering a myriad of promising new technologies so as to achieve high performance, low weight and scalability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal comes about from development of novel approaches to design highly efficient, compact and reliable offshore wind power generation systems. The main components of the system should be designed carefully and optimally. The goal of this proposal is to overcome the challenges regarding the design of megawatt level generators, power converters and transmission system and finally grid integration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Offshore wind power production has taken root in Europe and is planned for future implementation in the U.S.  This specific form of energy production looks promising in terms of the amount of wind energy that can be harvested, the economic impact of "green" jobs, and the strength in diversifying the U.S. energy portfolio.  The proposed research would further knowledge of existing and potential technologies of offshore wind generation and assist quicker adoption of these technologies.  The principal investigator will flow down scientific findings from this research directly into courses she is teaching in renewable energy which, due to the long-term social component, tend to attract minorities and females students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Wind energy is the second fastest growing renewable energy source for power generation after solar photovoltaic. 52 GW of new generation was added in 2017, reaching a total installed capacity of 539 GW globally1.  Traditionally, land-based wind farms have higher prominence over offshore wind farms due to lower cost. However, offshore wind farms have the advantages of higher energy potential, and reduced human and environmental impact. These advantages coupled with the falling bid prices have resulted in significant growth of offshore wind energy by 30% in 20171.  To reduce the system cost and improve the performance of offshore wind farms, current industry and research trends as understood from our literature survey are as follows:  Increase in individual wind turbine (WT) capacities to reduce the cost, reaching up to 10 MW per WT; Migration from doubly-fed induction generators to direct-drive permanent-magnet (PM) generators to eliminate the mechanical gearbox, reduce weight and improve efficiency; Full-scale ac-dc and dc-dc power conversion systems with high-frequency isolation to reduce size, weight and achieve better controllability; Modular converter architectures to reduce cost, component ratings and improve scalability, and reliability; Energy storage integration to meet supply volatility and increase capacity factor; and Migration towards medium-voltage dc (MVDC) and high-voltage dc (HVDC) collection and transmission systems from traditional ac systems to improve controllability, efficiency, reliability and reduce cost.   Keeping up with the current trends, our research contributions for this project are as follows:  A new flux-switching permanent-magnet (FSPM) machine with high torque density, robustness and fault-tolerance has been developed for offshore wind applications. Machine design was optimized using 2D and 3D finite-element-analysis simulations. The proposed machine achieves comparable performance with traditional PM synchronous generators with additional advantages such as: robust rotor structure, easy thermal management and zero unbalanced magnetic forces.
