<AbstractNarration>Rapid technology scaling has fueled an unprecedented growth in the semiconductor&lt;br/&gt;industry, transforming the face of modern society. Commodity systems have&lt;br/&gt;undergone a sea change from the uniprocessor era of past decades to the current&lt;br/&gt;many-core era. With numerous on-chip processing cores, the communication fabric&lt;br/&gt;in many-core systems becomes a critical design component. Network-on-Chip (NoC)&lt;br/&gt;architectures are widely regarded as the most promising design for the&lt;br/&gt;communication platform for many-core systems, primarily due to their&lt;br/&gt;scalability. Many-core systems such as Intel 80-core and Tilera have already&lt;br/&gt;used NoCs as the backbone of communication between their on-chip processors. To&lt;br/&gt;maintain fault-free execution in these many-core systems, it is imperative to&lt;br/&gt;ensure sustained lifetime in both NoCs and processing cores. This research&lt;br/&gt;embarks on boosting sustainability in NoC architectures through a proactive&lt;br/&gt;design paradigm.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Using a cross-layer collaborative venture, spanning from the device layer to the&lt;br/&gt;architecture layer, this project establishes a transformative framework to&lt;br/&gt;design sustainable NoC architectures. Existing techniques for NoCs tackle the&lt;br/&gt;sustainability design challenge in a reactive way by triggering corrective&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms after a component failure. The investigators explore an orthogonal&lt;br/&gt;proactive strategy, recognizing the need for device level aging awareness during&lt;br/&gt;the entire life span of an NoC. This project demonstrates that sustainability&lt;br/&gt;can be improved in NoCs without sacrificing power-performance, by considering&lt;br/&gt;the criticality of packet transmission. By playing a central role to facilitate&lt;br/&gt;long term sustainability in NoCs, this research can substantially improve the&lt;br/&gt;cost efficiency in building large data centers supporting our modern compute&lt;br/&gt;intensive society. Major research insights will be disseminated through teaching&lt;br/&gt;to develop relevant skill sets, lead to more sustainable future computer&lt;br/&gt;systems, and benefit the community at large.</AbstractNarration>
