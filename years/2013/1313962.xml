<AbstractNarration>In this Award from the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability Fellows (SEES Fellows Program) Dr. Carrie Byron from the University of New England will engineer new tools for sustainable management of resources and will examine synergies between coupled human-natural systems using a carrying capacity approach.  This award is supported by the Directorate for Geosciences and the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work will (1) investigate the ways in which ecological- and social-carrying capacities can be quantified ; (2) investigate the feedbacks between ecological and economic systems; (3) study the mechanisms regulating ecological- and social-carrying capacity; and (4) explore if a carrying capacity concept can be used to promote sustainable management of natural resources in coastal ecosystems.  Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island and Cobscook Bay, Maine will be used as sites in the study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of studies like that proposed in this work is to develop better methods for the management of natural resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Byron will be working with collaborators Prof. James Sulikowski of the Marine Science Center at the University of New England and Dr. Di Jin at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Instittuion; as well as Prof. Tracey Dalton in the Department of Marine Affairs, at the University of Rhode Island and Prof. Gayle Zydlewski in the School of Marine Sciences at the University of Maine.  Dr. Byron will work with research students with her University collaborators and will disseminate the results of her work through scientific and public outreach.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported under the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability Fellows (SEES Fellows) program, with the goal of helping to enable discoveries needed to inform actions that lead to environmental, energy and societal sustainability while creating the necessary workforce to address these challenges. With SEES Fellows support, this project will enable a promising early career researcher to establish themselves in an independent research career related to sustainability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ SEES Fellows: Engineering a carrying capacity framework for sustainable management of natural resources.     Carrie J. Byron     The goal of this project was to engineer new tools for sustainable management of resources and to examine synergies between coupled human &ndash; natural systems using a carrying capacity approach. Specifically, our study focused on four central questions:  How can ecological carrying capacity and social carrying capacity be quantified? What are the feedbacks between ecological and economic systems? What are the mechanisms regulating ecological carrying capacity and social carrying capacity? How can a carrying capacity concept be used to promote sustainable management of natural resources in the coastal ecosystem?      To address these questions, we constructed a coupled biological-economic model that was used to quantify carrying capacity and explore mechanisms regulating it. We focused on two coastal areas that are rich in natural resources, host multiple industries and suffer from user conflict issues: Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island and Cobscook Bay in Maine. We demonstrated transferability and utility for sustainable management by implementing the same model structure in two different social-ecological systems with contrasting economic welfare and industry development motivations.     The findings from this work demonstrate that integrated modeling techniques can be used to quantify carrying capacity. The potential increase in ecological production translates to an equal magnitude increase in economic output. The mechanisms regulating both ecological and social carrying capacity are a social construct based on societal values and management goals. And, finally, we provide evidence that that the carrying capacity concept has been applied widely and broadly across ecological disciplines spanning several levels of ecological organization and provide suggestions for the application of the carrying capacity concept for future studies towards promotion of sustainable management of natural resources.

These findings specifically meet the following broader impacts:  1.     Benefits to society: sustainable management of the environment  2.     Dissemination to enhance scientific understanding 3.     Professional development of the PI               Results of this proposed research have been disseminated broadly at local, regional, national, and international venues including scientific conferences and sysmposia, as well as with resource managers in the study areas.
