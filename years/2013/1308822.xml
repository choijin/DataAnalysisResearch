<AbstractNarration>This action funds William Lennon of the University of California, San Diego to conduct a research project in Biological Sciences during the summer of 2013 at the University of Electro-Communications in Tokyo, Japan.  The project title is "Computational Modeling of the Cerebellum with Additional Biological Realism." The host scientists are Professors Nobito Yamamoto and Tadashi Yamazaki.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While much is known about the anatomy and physiology of the cerebellum, the function of this brain structure remains vague.  Roughly speaking, the cerebellum is responsible for ensuring the precise timing and coordination of movement, and is hypothesized to have similar effects on cognition.  Computational modeling of the cerebellum has been underway for many decades and has aided researchers in testing hypotheses about its function that would otherwise be impossible in a laboratory setting.  Recently, neuroscientists have realized the importance of a particular cell type in the cerebellum, the molecular layer interneuron (MLI).  Historically, these cell types have received relatively little attention from neuroscientists and as a result are poorly understood.  This project investigates the role of MLIs in a computational model of the cerebellum.  In particular, this project investigates the role of learning at synapses formed by MLIs and their effect on learning and control of movement.  A better understanding of brain structures like the cerebellum will ultimately guide our understanding of neurological disorders like schizophrenia and autism that are believed to affect these structures.  Additional insight into the function of the cerebellum may also lead to novel algorithms in robotics and the control of prosthetic devices.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, the PI plans to disseminate the results of this study by publication in peer-reviewed journals, publication of the source code in publicly available databases, and as course material for teaching future students of computational neuroscience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ My research focuses on how one part of the brain -- the cerebellum &ndash; enables smooth, well-timed, coordinated movement.  The cerebellum is also probably involved in performing an analogous function for cognition.  An example behavior that the cerebellum is involved in is something call the conditioned eyeblink response (CER).  The cerebellum is required to learn the correct timing of when to blink in response to a stimulus.  It turns out that children with autism are able to learn this response much faster than control subjects, but the timing of the blink is atypical. Thus, understanding the role and function of the cerebellum may help us understand autism.  In particular, I study the role of one neuron type &ndash; the molecular layer interneurons (stellate and basket cells) &ndash; in the cerebellar cortex by building theoretical and computational models of their function based on the available physiological, anatomical and other experimental evidence.  My work this summer focused on two aspects of building realistic models of the molecular layer interneurons (MLIs). First, on deriving a mathematical model of the dynamics of the neuron itself and in the presence of a network of other neurons that are interconnected.  Second, by deriving a mathematical model of learning at one synapse type to the neuron.   With respect to the first part, I modeled these neurons types as conductance based leaky integrate and fire neurons (a popular mathematical model for neurons) and found model parameters that match phyiosological.  I showed that when you combine many of these neurons in a network a certain phenomenon that appears in vitro and in vivo also appears; namely, asymmetric interspike interval distributions.  Since the model neuron is capable of reproducing the same phenomena as real neurons, this suggests it is a good model.  With respect to the second part, I reviewed the available evidence of plasticity (learning) at the parallel fiber &ndash; MLI synapse (the connection between two neurons).  I met with Dr. Kuzihiko Yamaguchi at RIKEN Brain Science Institute to discuss physiological details regarding plasticity at this synapse.  I derived a mathematical model that is consistent with the experimental data that describes plasticity at this synapse.  Further, I showed analytically that this learning rule can be interpreted as another form of learning present in a different part of the nervous system.  I showed in a rate-based neuron model simulation that this in fact occurs. I am now implementing this in a more realistic neural network model.
