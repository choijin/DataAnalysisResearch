<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using high-intensity ultra-fast laser pulses we can now control both the bond length and orientation of diatomic molecules. This gives us a unique opportunity to directly probe the structure of molecular orbitals and ask fundamental questions; such as, is there coherence between the different orbitals and how do relativistic orbitals differ from regular orbitals? In addition to probing molecular structure, we will also use our ability to manipulate molecules in order to generate highly excited states of the molecular ions with the ultimate goal of creating population inversions in the vacuum-ultraviolet spectral region.  Finally, we will test our hypothesis that certain configurations of the molecule may be highly susceptible to generating harmonic radiation driven by an intense fundamental laser.  Moreover, we have developed a new phase-matching technique that greatly enhances the efficiency of harmonic generation, in general.  Coupling these two techniques together may provide a new source of intense short-pulse vacuum-ultraviolet radiation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new phase-matching techniques may lead to a new class of coherent, ultra short pulse VUV radiation sources.  The strong field techniques developed in this award may lead to important insights into molecular structure useful for physical chemistry.  More broadly, interest in high-harmonic generation, attosecond physics, and short-pulse x-ray free electron lasers has exploded over the past decade, and this award contributes towards understanding important aspects such as inner-orbital ionization, excitation, and vibrational coherence.  Finally, this award provides hands on research training in state-of-the-art laser and optical technologies and prepares them for academic or high-tech career paths.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Chemical reactions initiated by light are fundamental to all of life.  Apart from human activity, virtually all life is powered by the conversion of sunlight into chemical energy at the cellular level.  In addition, vision begins as a reaction of molecules with light.  In order to harness solar energy, such light induced chemical reactions must be understood on an ultrafast timescale and at an atomic level.  For example, when a photon is absorbed by a chlorophyll molecules, the first reactions take space within 1 picosecond (one trillionth of a second) and the motion induced by the reactions is around 1 nanometer (one billionth of a meter).  Studying such fast and small events requires novel experimental techniques that have been under development for the last decade.  Central to these efforts have been our ability to manipulate light in ever more sophisticated ways.  Laser pulses as short as 30 femtoseconds are routinely produced and attosecond pulses are being generated in a number of labs around the world.  With this grant, we studied the simplest of molecules consisting of two identical atoms, such as hydrogen, nitrogen, and iodine, to understand the most basic aspects of the interaction of molecules with light.  Iodine (I2) is particularly interesting as it is the heaviest diatomic molecule and so it moves relatively slowly.  We find that I2 interacts with light in unusual ways.  Generally speaking, when a molecule is subjected to very intense light, the electron with the weakest connection to the molecule gets ionized.  However, we find that in I2, much more deeply bound electrons are ionized.  In addition, this ionization depends strongly on the wavelength of light used in the experiment.  The standard theory of molecular ionization predicts no wavelength dependence.  The significance of this is that when a deep electron is removed, the resulting ion is left in a highly excited state, and this is the first step towards creating a laser.  This type of laser would be quite unique and may have interesting properties.  Indeed, it has been observed that a laser can be formed in nitrogen molecules through intense laser ionization.  This laser can be formed in the atmosphere (which is predominately nitrogen) and may prove to be a powerful way to detect trace molecules in the atmosphere.  This process is not fully understood and our work on I2 may help understand this intriguing process.  Besides studying the interaction of light with molecules, we have also investigated ways to create short-pulse intense laser light.  It is quite common to convert laser light from one wavelength into another, either shorter or longer than the original.  We designed and studied a novel way to generate the third harmonic of a laser beam which, unlike other methods, will work for ultra-short laser pulses.  We have also tried to extend this technique to the fifth harmonic.  The resulting wavelength is very useful in studying molecular structure.  Finally, this work has trained several graduate students in state-of-the-art laser development and techniques to study molecules on a nanoscale, preparing them for a variety of jobs in research and industry.
