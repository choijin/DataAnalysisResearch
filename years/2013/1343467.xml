<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating the first wireless, fully programmable, implantable micro infusion pump with integrated dose tracking for closed-loop control to fill the current technology gap in drug administration technology for small animals research.   The translated technology has the following unique features: sensors for electronic real time confirmation of actual delivery and dosed volumes, wireless operation capable of accessing a wide dynamic range of flow rates, and form factor suitable for use in mice that provides exemplary performance, efficiency, and efficacy, when compared to the leading competing infusion technologies, whether implantable or not, in this market space.  The project accomplishes this goal by integrating wireless circuitry for controlling infusion and tracking doses into a tiny form factor suitable for use in a miniaturized infusion pump resulting in a working prototype closed-loop implantable infusion system that will be demonstrated at the benchtop.  The partnership engages Stevens Center for Innovation, Viterbi Student Institute for Innovation, Lloyd Greif Center for Entrepreneurial Studies, and industry partners (Fluid Synchrony, SAI Infusion Technologies, and Charles River) to provide guidance in the drug delivery technology space and other aspects of commercialization, manufacturing, and financing as they pertain to the potential to translate the technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality.  The potential economic impact is expected to be improved scientific discovery and drug development in the next decade, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the drug delivery technologies space.   The societal impact, long term, will be new therapies, greater drug efficacy, reduced side effects, improved treatment outcomes, and quality of life, especially as they relate to the potential impact of this effort on the long term goal of realizing closed-loop clinical infusion systems.</AbstractNarration>

Over 95% of preclinical drug research employs rodents as the first stage of validation.

Accurate delivery and confirmation of delivered doses are urgently need, however, neither feature is available in any non-clinical or clinical implantable pump on the market. Instead, users are forced to select from primitive and suboptimal administration technologies involving injections, catheter tethers, or nonadjustable continuous infusion. With more drug formulations featuring peptide, biologics and other short half-life compounds, fine control of drug administration is increasingly important for achieving drug efficacy. To remove these barriers, we developed a fully functional and manufacturable prototype infusion micropump; developed wireless circuitry for dose tracking and achieved integrated with the micropump; and demonstrated wireless tracking of infusion of precise volumes from micropump into tissue models. A working prototype closed-loop implantable infusion system was demonstrated at the benchtop.     Fabrication of a manufacturable prototype micropump:   The micropump reservoir packaging was redesigned with an inner diameter close to that of the bellows outer diameter, minimizing inaccessible dead volume from ~800 &mu;L to less than 100 &mu;L. A custom-made passive normally closed spring-loaded ball check valve was included at the pump outlet to prevent backflow of fluids as a result of the reverse pressure gradient caused by recombination.   Integrated sensors and wireless circuitry for dose tracking:   Tracking of doses delivered from the reservoir was achieved by electrochemical impedance measurements through the drug solution. Wireless circuitry was designed in order to combine wireless powering and data telemetry to allow for programmability and infusion rate control as well as dose sensing.  Once the final prototype was assembled, wireless programming and sensing were each separately calibrated, followed by demonstration of simultaneous flow control and sensing for an example delivery regimen with and without the new custom-made spring-loaded ball check valve.  Recombination detection using the dosing system, as well as, the effects of coil misalignment and distance on powering, programmability, and dose sensing data transfer were also investigated.   Wireless tracking of infusion of precise volumes from micropump into tissue models:   Although long term in vivo studies were beyond the scope of the work proposed here, simulated brain simulated tissue material consisting of hydroxyethyl cellulose-based gels were used to successfully demonstrate wireless closed-loop operation.
