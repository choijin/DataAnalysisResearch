<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project purposes to develop a new treatment for osteoarthritis, a debilitating joint disease characterized by significant tissue degeneration within the joint, significant pain, and loss of function. At the end stage of this disease, the only option is a total joint replacement using artificial materials, which is not appropriate for younger patients. The overall goal of this work is to utilize principles of regenerative medicine and engineering to develop a joint resurfacing implant to replace and regenerate the entire damaged articulating joint surfaces. Particularly, this project will study the infusion of an ultra-tough gel into an anatomically shaped, high-performance, three-dimensionally woven implant. The potential benefit of this technology is that it avoids costly and extensive culture time by improving the immediate properties of the scaffold to mimic the properties of native tissues. The research objectives are to develop these composite implants to match that of the native tissue using a variety of formulations and then examine their ability to integrate into living tissues over long-term culture. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project addresses the estimated $65B cost to the economy imparted each year by hip arthritis. After a patient fails conservative treatment, the standard surgical treatment is a total joint replacement, where the joint is replaced by artificial materials. Unfortunately, artificial joints have a lifespan of only 15-20 years and then typically require a revision surgery, which is complicated by high failure rates, making them a poor option for young patients with end-stage osteoarthritis. There are currently approximately 1 million patients younger than 65 with activity limiting hip osteoarthritis with no effective surgical therapies to treat them. Therefore, even conservative estimates of the addressable market size for the proposed product are calculated at $164 million today.  This is expected to increase to at least $563 million in 2018 due to projected growth of the target demographic, market penetration, and an increase in the price of hip prostheses.  If efficacy is demonstrated, it stands to reason that this technology, which satisfies an unmet clinical need, would be rapidly adopted and would therefore have tremendous clinical and economic impact in the US as well as enriching understanding of joint resurfacing technology in the scientific community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Arthritis is currently the most common cause of disability in the US, leading to joint pain and dysfunction in over 40 million Americans. Osteoarthritis, the most common form of arthritis, involves degeneration of the articular cartilage, the smooth, load-bearing tissue lining the ends of long bones within the synovial joints of the body. The treatment of injuries or diseases affecting articular cartilage poses important unmet challenges to the medical community. While treatment procedures for cartilage damage have yielded promising short-term clinical results, many of these approaches can lead to cell death, and further cartilage degeneration in the long-term.  Moreover, total joint replacement (TJR), the gold standard of surgical treatment for advanced joint pain, is generally not indicated for patients under the age of 60 due to limited implant lifespans and high failure rates of joint revision surgeries.  Because of the dearth of adequate cartilage repair strategies that address underlying cartilage defects and degeneration, many patients who are not yet candidates for TJR must resign themselves to pain management strategies through pharmaceuticals.     Cytex Therapeutics, Inc. is developing a novel 3D woven scaffold for cartilage repair and resurfacing.  The Cytex scaffold is highly engineered to provide the strength, flexibility, and many of the native properties of cartilage, while also prompting regeneration of the actual tissue throughout the scaffold conduits. Over time, the scaffold resorbs naturally, leaving the treated joint with the newly generated cartilage layer.  This project studied the use of "tough" hydrogel matrix materials used to coat the implant to ascertain improvements to the cartilage-mimicking properties of our textile-based implants.     Two specific aims governed the direction of this project.  In the first aim, varying "tough" hydrogels were studied to determine the most promising hydrogel/scaffold composite.  Of the hydrogels studied, polyethylene glycol-based hydrogels showed the most promise for supporting cell growth and inducing cartilage formation on our implants.  In the second aim, the compressive and frictional properties of the composite implant were studied after long-term culture with bone marrow-derived stem cells.  In this aim, we were able to demonstrate an improvement in the baseline mechanical properties of our cartilage-mimetic implant. However, it was also noted that these improvements in scaffold properties did not translate into improved wear performance, suggesting that  further research and optimization is necessary to address these performance issues if hydrogel incorporation is to be used in textile-based cartilage repair.
