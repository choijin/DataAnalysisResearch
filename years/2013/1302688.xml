<AbstractNarration>The operational complexity of networks and the resulting operational expense (OPEX) count among the top challenges faced by network operators.   This complexity arises, in part, because of the scale and continued growth of modern networks, the inherent complexity and intricate dependencies of the protocols that these networks run, and the increased expectations of network users due to the increasing importance that network connectivity and networked services play in society.  This complexity has been heightened by recent developments that make networks much more dynamic, adding a whole new dimension to the complexities of network management and operations (M&amp;O). The resulting state of affairs acts to impede the pace of innovation and change in networks.  The research on network M&amp;O has not kept pace with the research transforming the networks themselves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses these issues by designing and building a Knowledge-Centric Software-Defined Network Management and Operations architecture (KnowOps).  KnowOps will represent a significant step in moving M&amp;O towards fully autonomic operation.   The project will generalize database-like abstractions to create a network operations fabric (NOF) as a systematic and principled foundation for comprehensive network management and operations.  The PIs will combine this foundation with information centric data mining methods to create a structured information base which captures, in a systematic manner, the status of the network and expose it to other network management functions. The end result will be a knowledge base capable of systematically capturing operational procedures and policies as specified by domain experts.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Network OPEX is a major challenge for continued penetration of digital technologies into application areas in the home and small business.   The project will involve collaboration with a large, national network operator but also with a small, mostly rural carrier.   Improved network management tools are particularly important for smaller regional operators serving cyber-disadvantaged communities, who often do not have the technical breadth and depth of larger operators, but who, nonetheless, face the same operational challenges.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit:  The KnowOps project addressed three primary research challenges that stand in the way of improving network management and operation. The first is the lack of a holistic network-wide management framework that puts knowledge, policy, and practices into software, rather than in the hands of operators. The second is the fact that, despite the inherent structure present in networks, data from these networks are highly unstructured, semantically deficient and suffer from data uncertainty. Finally, though there is some understanding of how to set the myriad of discrete configuration options in a modern network individually, it is an open problem to set them dynamically on a network wide-basis, responding to changing conditions.  In addressing these challenges our research addressed: Performance issues in LTE/EPC mobile networks, efficiency of M2M communication, failure detection in mobile networks, scalability concerns of mobile network control planes, efficiently supporting peer-to-peer traffic in mobile networks, realizing a dynamic open access network architecture, creating a knowledge plane for enterprise networks, supporting uploading of live video in mobile networks, realizing an evolvable mobile network service control platform, creating a virtualized programmable data plane, performing automated queue management in network elements, realizing an IoT mobile edge cloud architecture, creating an SDN-based real-time data streaming framework, automatically determining the scope of service impacting anomalies, realizing automated resource scaling in a cloud platform, verifying the impact of policy changes in software defined infrastructures and realizing policy driven access control in a microservice environment.

Broader Impacts:  The focus of our work in KnowOps was in automating network management and operation with the ultimate goal of making networks more reliable and efficient and enabling new network applications and services. While our work directly impacted networking and related technologies, the ever increasing importance of networks in all aspects of modern life suggests that our work indirectly impacted a much broader set of disciplines. The project also trained more than a dozen graduate and undergraduate students, including four completed PhD and six completed MS degrees. These students gained valuable experience not only in the specific technical areas in which they worked, but also in producing software intended for real world use.
