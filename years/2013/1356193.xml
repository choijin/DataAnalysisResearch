<AbstractNarration>The University of California, San Francisco (San Francisco, CA) has received this ABI development award to generate new interactive tools to enhance our understanding of the relationship between the chemistry and biology of enzymes. Enzymes form the basis of nature's toolkit, performing the chemical reactions essential for life. While sophisticated computational tools and resources exist to probe the relationships between enzyme sequences and their structures (bioinformatics and computational biology), the resources to describe the chemistry of enzymes (cheminformatics) are significantly less mature. As a result, our ability to understand on a large scale how enzyme sequences and structures enable the chemistry of life is severely hampered. As sequence data continues to expand at a rate of tens of millions of sequences per year, huge numbers of new enzymes have been identified whose chemical reactions are unknown. Discovery of their chemical functions will open up new opportunities for understanding biology, ecology, and for guiding experiments that include enzyme engineering to produce new chemicals or to create enzymes capable of degrading toxic pollutants. To achieve this promise, this project will develop new tools needed to compare enzyme reactions and effectively link them to the sequence and structural features of the proteins that perform them. The results will be incorporated into a new database infrastructure, MEERCat (Mechanism and Evolution in Enzyme Reaction Catalysis), that will integrate chemical information with sequence and structural information for a large number of enzyme superfamilies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MEERCat will use as a foundation two databases separately developed to capture these chemical and protein data, respectively. MACiE, which stands for "Mechanism, Annotation and Classification in Enzymes", is an electronic database of the chemical reaction mechanisms of enzymes. It captures chemical steps and overall reactions, along with a web-based search tool to enable users to explore these mechanisms. The Structure-Function Linkage Database (SFLD), is an electronic database that classifies enzymes into evolutionarily related sets called superfamilies and then associates specific sequence and structural features of each superfamily with the chemical capabilities of its member reaction families. It provides web-based browse, search, and analysis tools including sequence similarity networks (SSNs). SSNs enable facile mapping of chemical and other functional properties to sequences, a technology that will be used extensively in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve broad impact and benefit researchers worldwide, all data will be freely available for download. A user-friendly web-based interface will disseminate the results accompanied by browse, search and analysis tools. The MEERCAT infrastructure will provide online and YouTube type tutorials to train researchers in using the resource and aid others in using it for teaching. The new resource will be incorporated into current graduate coursework in bioinformatics at UCSF and in workshops held at UCSF and at other institutions to train researchers with generating and interpreting analyses performed using MEERCat tools.</AbstractNarration>
