<AbstractNarration>This project will study and develop technology for Elastic Optical Networks (EONs).   In EONs flexible amounts of spectral bandwidth may be allocated to each data channel without requiring adherence to a fixed wavelength grid. Such an approach is well-suited for supporting a wide range of dynamic traffic demands in a bandwidth-efficient manner.  Key enabling technologies, optical arbitrary waveform generation&lt;br/&gt;(OAWG) and optical arbitrary waveform measurement (OAWM), will enable elastic optical networking over a large spectrum by dividing the spectrum into spectral slices and dynamically processing information at lower rates compatible with CMOS electronics. The project will leverage these technologies as a basis for innovative hardware and software solutions for EON technology, architectures, protocols, network control and management, system integration, and testbed integration.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Advances in the basic architecture and technology for optical networking is important for US competitiveness.   The project will work with several US-based industrial organizations as a means of technology transfer.  The research results and publications will likely to impact standardization activities of flexible grid networking (e.g. International Telecommunication Union ITU-T SG15 on flex grid).   The project will link education and research and serve as a rich platform for crossdisciplinary education in optical and higher-layer networking, and in computer engineering.</AbstractNarration>
