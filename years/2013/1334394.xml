<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research project is to develop a modeling and control framework to support a reconfigurable topology for electrical power microgrids that includes distributed sources or loads such as wind turbines, micro generators, and plug-in electric vehicles. The system ensures stable and efficient operation. The topology uses a decentralized optimal control framework to maximize efficiency with minimal communication among the microgrid components; a a way to assess stability of the microgrid as components such as wind turbines switch on and off; and a scalable, low-order modeling approach for the model-based control framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will support the adoption of reconfigurable microgrids as one way to increase plug-in vehicles and renewable resources in the energy portfolio of the future. Also, this research is developing fundamental knowledge on decentralized optimal control, stability in mode-switching systems, and modeling and identification have wide application beyond electrical grids, such as autonomous robotic swarms and large scale computer networks. The research results will be disseminated widely to the scientific community through publications; to graduate and undergraduate students through new courses and course modules; to over 40 industry partners through workshops, seminars, and short courses; to high school students and teachers through summer camps; and to K-12 students through two museum exhibits. The activities of this award will also provide underrepresented minorities with opportunities to participate in engineering research in both graduate and undergraduate level.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Microgrids are localized electricity networks with interconnected loads and distributed generation units (DGs) that can operate in either grid-connected mode or islanded mode. Rural microgrids, which correspond to the secondary distribution layer in traditional grids that directly link to households, are usually operated at low voltage levels and with distribution lines of high R/X ratio (resistance-to-inductance ratio). In this situation, the distribution power loss may be unnecessarily high if the load sharing among the DGs is not done properly. In addition, the DGs in microgrids tend to face more ?uctuating load pro?les due to the fewer number of households or facilities served. The intermittency of renewable power sources also makes an ef?cient control algorithm necessary in dealing with this load sharing problem if the penetration of the renewable energy is high. Therefore, maintaining low distribution power loss by proper load sharing among DGs in a way to increase grid efficiency is the specific focus of the research activities.   The overarching goal of this research project is to establish a modeling and control framework for a microgrid, with battery electric and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles as energy storage devices to mitigate the intermittency of renewable energy sources and to improve the grid efficiency while maintaining its power quality.  In order to achieve the research goals, we will need to develop distributed optimal control algorithms with reconfigurable topology, explore system identification techniques to minimize the knowledge requirement of the overall grid structure and investigate the impact of grid level control on local device controller design.   The major research activities in this year have been:   The modeling of a radial 35-node grid inspired from the IEEE 37-node radial test feeder in SIMULINK environment The improvement of convergence speed in the proposed communication-free method for power loss reduction The analysis of existence of solution and stability for the proposed communication-free method The implementation of the decentralized alternating method of multipliers (ADMM) approach as a benchmark The study of the proposed method in some specific scenarios           Last Modified: 09/02/2017       Submitted by: Huei Peng]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
