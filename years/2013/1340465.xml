<AbstractNarration>1340465&lt;br/&gt;Nakotte&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Division of Materials Research to New Mexico State University provides supports for students to attend the 2013-2014 Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) Schools on Neutron Scattering. The LANSCE neuton schools are intended to cover a particular science topic, for which neutron scattering has made or is expected to make a major impact. The 2013 and 2014 LANSCE Schools on Neutron Scattering will focus on Geosciences and Materials in Extreme Environments and Mesoscale Sciences and Interfaces, respectively. Each of the annual schools will run for 9-10 days and they consist of formal lectures and hands-on experiments, using the neutron scattering facilities at the LANSCE.&lt;br/&gt;The main objectives of both school are: a) to provide in-depth neutron-scattering training in a particular topic (in particular, for graduate students in their early stage of thesis research), b) to attract new users to the neutron-scattering community, c) to increase diversity among expert neutron scatterers, and d) to broaden the field where neutron scattering can develop further. &lt;br/&gt;The number of student participants is limited to ~30 students, selected from a large applicant pool using a variety of criteria. A particular emphasis is put on selecting a diverse student body in order to foster a cross-institutional, cross-disciplinary and multicultural learning environment. This grant will support travel and meals for accepted student participants.</AbstractNarration>
