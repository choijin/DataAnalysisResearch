<AbstractNarration>This project involves the development of an enhanced instrument to study the composition of trace gases in the atmosphere. The new instrument will be able to detect a large suite of atmospheric constituents (&gt;100 compounds) at very low concentrations over short time periods (samples are collected over 25-seconds). The instrument can be used at the surface and all the way to the lower stratosphere, as well as in both polluted and clean environments. This new instrument will enhance our understanding of gas phase chemistry and is likely to lead to new insights on related air quality and climate issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A trace organic gas analyzer (TOGA) will be coupled to a time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer. The development of the TOGA-TOF involves the construction of a new inlet and cryogenic sample concentrator, integration of the high resolution TOF, and optimization of the integrated system to maximize its qualitative and quantitative capabilities. The TOGA-TOF will be an analytical system capable of providing comprehensive VOC measurements throughout the volatile range (C2-C12 and possibly higher) at reasonable acquisition rates (1 minute). The suite of volatile organic compound measurements quantified by the instrument will be enough to improve understanding and modeling of the photochemical state of the atmosphere.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As a result of an MRI grant, Dr. Apel and his collaborators have recently mated a high resolution time of flight mass spectrometer (HR-TOF, from TOFWERK) to an improved version of the NCAR/NSF Trace Organic Gas Analyzer (TOGA). TOGA is a fast GC-MS system that is designed to work both on the ground and aircraft-based platforms. In recent field deployments it collects a sample over a 35 second time interval, preconcentrates the sample, injects it into a gas chromatograph, and then analyses it with a mass spectrometer. This sampling is repeated every two minutes. Previously TOGA has used a quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) as the detector. The HR-TOF is a new, specialized MS that replaces the quadrupole. It is faster and produces an even higher amount of data with more molecular information. The TOF mass spectrometer measures the entire air chemistry plume in real-time and when combined with the gas chromatograph, the resulting TOGA-TOF can fingerprint and quantitate a much larger range of atmospheric VOCs than the previous version. The instrument has the potential to detect and discover previously unknown chemicals and to analyse the complex air chemistry of polluted air masses above, for example, cities, industrial zones, and forest fires.  Also, because the HR-TOF is able to sample the compounds at a much higher rate as they elute from the GC column, an improvement of the time resolution, compared to the quadrupole, has been achieved.  This new mass spectrometer tool (TOGA-TOF) works by using a ?time-of-flight'  (TOF) method which identifies and quantifies all fragment ions simultaneously, an improvement over the quadrupole mass spectrometer, which can only measure a small number of ions at a time. After an ion is created by bombarding the analyte molecule with electrons, the ion is accelerated through an electric field. Its velocity depends on its mass to charge ratio. At a given charge, the heavier the ion, the longer it takes the ion to reach the detector. So, for example, if an unknown/unidentified species is introduced into the TOF, the species is ionized and then the time it takes to reach the detector over a known distance within the electric field is measured. When calibrated, this measurement determines the mass to charge ratio of the species and ultimately allows for the species to be identified.  The TOGA-TOF is shown in Figure 1.
