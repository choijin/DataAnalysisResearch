<AbstractNarration>This award provides continued support for the particle astrophysics group at the University of Chicago to participate in the operation and analysis of data from the Very Energetic Radiation- Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS).  VERITAS is an array of four 12-meter Cherenkov telescopes that use the imaging atmospheric Cherenkov technique to detect and characterize the flux of 50 Gigaelectronvolt (GeV) to 50 Teraelectronvolt (TeV) photons from astrophysical sources.  The VERITAS project has been very successful over the past few years of operations providing important measurements of high-energy emission from supernova remnants, pulsar wind nebulae, gamma-ray binaries, and active galactic nuclei.  A recently completed upgrade, which updates the telescope cameras and trigger systems, should lead to even greater sensitivity and promises to further accelerate the scientific output of the project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Chicago group has been a key participant in the VERITAS project since its inception.  From design and construction to commissioning and operation and now to analysis and interpretation, Chicago has assumed leadership roles in all aspects of VERITAS.  The specific scientific interests of the group involve the study of Galactic sources, including supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae, as well as more general questions in particle astrophysics.  In addition, the group will work to develop new hardware and technologies suitable for use in the next generation of ground-based TeV gamma-ray observatory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The field of TeV astronomy has impacts on many other fields of science, from the study of the high-energy particle acceleration to fundamental physics questions such as the nature of Dark Matter. The data from VERITAS have been combined with data at other wavelengths to provide unique insights into the high-energy processes powering astrophysical objects.  The VERITAS project involves both graduate and undergraduate students in significant roles. There is a strong local outreach effort at the University of Chicago, which involves a successful partnership with Adler Planetarium for producing public lectures and classes for high school teachers. Finally, the continued development of the TeVCat resource will expand the visibility of TeV astrophysics beyond the high energy gamma-ray community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main focus of this project was to support the University of Chicago group's participation in the VERITAS experiment.  VERITAS, the Very Energetic Radiation-Imaging Telescope Array System, is an array of four 12-meter Cherenkov telescopes located in southern Arizona which have been designed to measure very-high-energy (VHE) gamma rays from astrophysical sources using the atmospheric Cherenkov technique.    Measurements of this kind, known generally as VHE Astrophysics, aim to reveal details about the inner workings of the most violent and energetic objects in the Galaxy and the Universe.  This field was pioneered in the United States, and VERITAS represents the second-generation instrument designed for carrying out this type of research.   Over the past 3 years of this grant, our research team has made key contributions to the global high-energy astrophysics community through the publication of 65+ scientific papers and proceedings.  This work includes the discovery of gamma-ray emission from multiple new sources in the sky, including remnants of Galactic supernova explosions, and the super-massive black holes at the centers of other galaxies.  These results have helped improve our understanding of particle acceleration processes in extreme environments.  We have also performed searches for dark matter annihilation signals, tested models of cosmic infrared backgrounds, and looked for correlations with neutrino triggers from Ice Cube.  The University of Chicago group has been a key participant in the VERITAS project throughout this work, and has assumed important roles in all aspects of the project, from design and construction to commissioning and operation and now to analysis and interpretation.  The current grant has allowed us to maintain this commitment.    An important aspect of our work has been the training of future scientists through the strong involvement of both graduate and undergraduate students in research activities.  Since 2009, over 27 graduate students have received PhD's at US institutions working on gamma-ray science related to the VERITAS instrument, including three from the University of Chicago.  These young scientists will be the teachers and front-line researchers of the next generation of US Science, and providing them with a challenging training ground is of the utmost importance.
