<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: Research Initiation Grant in Engineering Education: Development of Innovation Capacity in Engineering Students through Virtual Internships&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The foundation for this Research Initiation Grant in Engineering Education is to understand whether the use of an immersive learning environment (epistemic game) can increase the ability of engineering students to develop innovative product designs. Innovation is a key 21st Century Skill and is important for allowing the United States to retain its competitive edge within industry. It is also a skill that can set engineering students apart when it comes time for them to seek a position within industry. The epistemic game being tested creates a virtual work environment for students, which allows them to actively participate in a product design company, interact with group design members, complete tasks for their virtual manager and gain input from consultants within the company on whether their design is meeting the needs of the company. Students will also interact with end use customers for their design which will help them develop a better understanding of the role customer input plays in the product design process.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Research Initiation project will provide a unique opportunity for the PI to determine the effectiveness of epistemic games as an instructional tool for teaching engineering students about product design. This project will also provide a great opportunity for the PI and the graduate student involved to learn more about qualitative and quantitative research techniques in education and how these can be applied to measure innovation within product design. It is anticipated that this project will allow for the PI to make new connections with other researchers within the engineering education field that will lead to future projects exploring the coupling of innovation and game based instructional tools.</AbstractNarration>

In this project, we used two versions of the materials engineering virtual internship Nephrotex to explore how students learn engineering design. By altering aspects of the simulation, we were able to study the factors that affect student design choices and to identify elements of the internship that affect innovation.  In Nephrotex, students play the role of interns at a fictitious biomedical engineering design firm. Their primary task is to develop a new filter for use in kidney dialysis systems. In the "control" version of the game, students base their designs on the preferences of stakeholders within the company, such as the production engineer, the director of marketing, and the safety engineer. A second version was created that included, in addition to the company stakeholdersÃ† preferences, the perspectives of five end users of the product: a nephrologist, a hospital administrator, a clinician, a Medicare official, and a patient. In the second version of Nephrotex, students conduct a focus group with these clients that informs their design decisions; no reference to customers or clients is made in the control version.  Both versions of Nephrotex were implemented in engineering courses at the University of Pittsburgh.
