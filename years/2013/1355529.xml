<AbstractNarration>The proposed activity investigates the commercial potential of self-adaptive, ultra-low modulus alloys for biomedical implants and other technological applications. The proposed technology offers a solution to complications caused by the mismatch in elastic modulus between human bone and alloys used in conventional medical implants that lead to the loss of bone quality, possible loosening of the implant, and the reduced resistance of the bone to fracture from accidents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed technology offers unprecedented advantages for orthopedic and dental implants.  Considering the notable increase in the number of orthopedic implants every year and the need for longer lifetime implants due to continued increase in life expectancy and ever-decreasing age of patients receiving implants, the improvement in implant lifetime and reliability offered by the proposed technology has potential to significantly reduce both the probability of disabling injuries from accidents and the frequency and necessity for revision surgeries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The major goal of this NSF I-Corps project is to explore the commercialization potential of a novel Ti-Nb metallic alloy technology based on work from a previous NSF-funded project, and to provide entrepreneurial training to students and faculty.  At the conclusion of the project, our efforts have resulted in the development of two medical implant devices based on the material technology, better understanding and utilization of the symbiotic relationship between academic research and entrepreneurship, and the establishment of a startup company that is actively pursuing commercialization.     The intellectual merit of the project was reflected in advancements made both in technological development and the growth in the entrepreneurial experience of the project team members.  Research and development performed during the development process has produced important technical impacts on the principal discipline of the project by improving the strength of the Ti-Nb alloy up to 50%, and developed and demonstrated localized changes in materials properties through the cyclic softening technique.  Moreover, the project engaged both faculty and students in entrepreneurial training, particularly the customer development process, where the team members learned the method to detect market pains through direct interviews with surgeons, medical device manufacturers and hospital officials.  Knowledge gained from this project will help both future commercialization activities as well as research activities by allowing the faculty to better engage with the industry to identify pressing project that could be addressed.  Furthermore, the project resulted in a number of important broader impacts.  The development of two biomedical implant devices as a result of the project may potentially drastically improve the treatment of back and neck pain by improving the postoperative comfort of the patient and reducing the recovery time from surgery.  Furthermore, the devices may simplify the surgery, particularly from a minimally-invasive approach, which may lead to reduced surgeon error that contributes to a large portion of Implant failures.  Finally, the novel growing rod technology fulfill the need for safer and more reliable treatment options for children suffering from severe early-onset scoliosis, bring in peace of mind to both the patient and parents.  Additionally, training from the project allows the faculty to incorporate concepts of entrepreneurial thinking into both classroom instruction as well as mentoring of graduate and undergraduate researchers.
