<AbstractNarration>Sampling problems are fundamental in many areas of science and engineering, for example, statistics, artificial intelligence (machine learning and vision), and biology (phylogeny). Efficiency of sampling has impact on other important algorithms, for example, the speed of statistical tests and the reliability of estimators and classifiers. This project seeks to characterize combinatorial problems that admit efficient sampling algorithms. The research under this award addresses both sides of the characterization for a broad class of ubiquitous graphical models: 1) complexity theoretic obstacles to efficient sampling and 2) efficient sampling algorithms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent results established a useful characterization for antiferromagnetic 2-spin models (for example, weighted independent sets and Ising model) in terms of the behavior of the model on regular trees. This created a connection to problems and techniques studied in the statistical physics community. This project aims to use the connection to the statistical physics and its techniques (for example, belief propagation recurrences) to generalize the characterization to models with more than two spins (multi-spin models, such as the Potts model, frequently occur in the applications). As a first step towards this generalization a relation between the efficiency of commonly used Markov chains (Glauber dynamics, Swendsen-Wang algorithm) and the behavior of the models on regular trees will be explored. Beside Markov chains the PI will also investigate other approaches to sampling problems (for example, dynamic programming and utilizing strong spatial mixing).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The product of the research will be efficient sampling algorithms and an improved understanding of obstacles to efficient sampling. The algorithmic  problems, concepts, and techniques will be transferred to both undergraduate and graduate teaching (in the form of guided problems and implementation challenges). The award will support the training of two PhD students in the area of sampling and counting algorithms at the University of Rochester.</AbstractNarration>

Theoretical results allow practioners to make informed choices for sampling algorithms and parameters of the algorithms.   The main theoretical questions addressed by this research are: 1) which problems have efficient sampling algorithms and 2) what types of efficient sampling algorithms are suitable for these problems.  This research developed a general method to identify obstacles for the existence of efficient sampling algorithms for a wide variety of graphical models (spin systems). The mathematical theory, for each spin system, connects the behavior of the model on trees (belief propagation), behavior of the model on random bipartite graphs, and induced matrix norms for the interaction matrix of the model. The theory led to sharp understanding of when efficient sampling is possible for a wide variety of specific models (ferromagnetic Potts model, general anti-ferromagnetic models).  This research examined specific (popular) sampling algorithms. It identified conditions under which specific Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods work (Glauber dynamics on dense graphs, Swendsen-Wang dynamics in the mean-field model).  The research advances our understanding of when and how one can obtain efficient sampling algorithms. The project funded the research of two PhD students at University of Rochester.
