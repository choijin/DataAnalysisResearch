<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;This Materials World Network award from the Division of Materials Research to the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) will support a collaborative computational/experimental project to obtain a fundamental understanding of peptide-peptide interactions.  This study combines state-of-the-art atomic force microscopy (AFM) hand-in-hand with advanced molecular simulation studies to obtain atomic-scale insights into peptide-peptide interactions and, in particular, their ability to mediate interactions at solid/liquid interfaces.  Using a uniquely flexible model peptide repeat scaffold, precisely controllable sequences and numbers of interacting peptides will be examined, whereby interactions and cooperativities can be tuned with exacting control.  Targeted mutations will vary hydrophobicity, charge, and backbone flexibility.  Detailed AFM measurements will be compared to molecular pictures developed by equilibrium, quantitative all-atom simulations that probe true underlying, equilibrium interaction landscapes.  In particular, the balance between hydrophobic and charge interactions and the effect of cooperative, multi-peptide interactions will be studied in a systematic and hierarchical manner.  Simulations will be performed at UCSB, while experiments will be conducted in the group of collaborator Dr. Markus Valtiner at Max-Planck-Institut fur Eisenforschung GmbH in Dusseldorf, Germany. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;Peptides have emerged as an important class of biocompatible, environmentally friendly, sustainable material alternatives.  They can be engineered as tissue scaffolds, biosensors, drug delivery agents, sacrificial templates for nanomaterials, and surface decorants that impart protecting, hydrophobic, antibiotic, or adhesive capabilities.  However, their rational engineering is limited by lack of a detailed understanding of the ways in which their many distinct molecular interactions act in concert or competition to produce complex behavior. This work aims to provide a new fundamental understanding of peptide interactions that will establish a baseline for rational peptide engineering strategies.  Thus, this project has the potential to significantly influence the next generation of peptide materials, including new high-performance and environmentally friendly nanoscaffolds, glues, and adhesives.  This international collaboration brings together two groups with complementary expertise in experimental interfacial science and molecular simulation. Moreover, the research environment will provide outstanding educational opportunities; in particular, project graduate and undergraduate students will benefit from an extensive cross-visitation and research rotation plan.  As a part of this work, Prof. Shell will also develop a two-week tutorial course on simulations, including the results of this study, which will be given during an extended rotation in Germany.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main aim of this project has been to use computer simulations to understand water-mediated interactions between heterogeneous solutes like peptides that exhibit complex patterning of different chemical groups (hydrophobic, hydrophilic, charged, etc).   Peptides are an important class of materials that can be engineered, for example, as tissue scaffolds, biosensors, drug delivery agents, sacrificial templates for nanomaterials, and surface decorants that impart protecting, hydrophobic, antibiotic, or adhesive capabilities.  However, their rational engineering is limited by lack of a detailed understanding of the ways in which their many distinct molecular interactions act in concert or competition to produce complex behavior.  Central to these interactions is the water surrounding them, as this gives rise to the predominant attractive driving force in biomolecular systems, that of hydrophobic interactions.  The fundamental understanding of interactions involving heterogeneous molecules like peptides that this work aims to unravel can provide a rational basis for engineering targeted properties, such as self-assembly, adhesion, solubility, etc.  Thus, this work has the potential to significantly influence the next generation of peptide materials, including new high-performance and environmentally friendly nanoscaffolds, glues, and adhesives.  This work involved close collaborations with two state of the art experimental groups that measure, respectively, single-molecule &amp; surface interactions, and water structure and dynamics at surfaces and near molecules.  Intellectual merit.  We made several advances. (1) We directly probed a molecular-scale peptide hydrophobic interaction accessible to both simulation and experiment, a significant challenge, and found excellent agreement between the two without any fit parameters.  This approach illustrated a novel nonequilibrium procedure to measure molecular hydrophobic interactions.  Moreover, it discovered a powerful metric by which to understand and predict the strength of hydrophobic forces, related to the angles that water molecules near a solute form with respect to each other.  (2) We showed that this distribution of angles emerges as a fundamental and "universal" fingerprint of water?s response to temperature, pressure, and the presence of nearby solutes, varying in simple and predictable ways.  The nature of the variation classifies solutes based on the nature and strength of the hydrophobic forces they experience.  Moreover, we found that the way by which a solute perturbs water?s angle distribution is starkly correlated with that solute?s solubility, providing a powerful and new approach to predicting solute properties and interactions merely by examining water structure.   (3)  We used simulations to show how chemical heterogeneities (e.g., hydrophobic-hydrophilic patterns) presented by molecular surfaces can influence water?s thermodynamic and dynamic properties, as well as hydrophobic driving forces that govern peptide and biomolecular assembly.  We developed a computational genetic algorithm that designs surface chemical patterns to influence water and water-mediated interactions in targeted ways.  Broader impacts.  The design of new, multifunctional biomaterials inherently requires a deep understanding for how heterogeneous molecules like peptides interact with one another through water.   The knowledge gained from this study provides a new understanding of the importance of water properties to interpreting its response to such complex molecules, and suggests a water structure-based path towards rational engineering strategies for peptides and beyond.  On the educational front, the Shell group has mentored several undergraduates in this area, of which many have gone on to top graduate programs.  The group has also founded a campus-wide seminar series for graduate students in the areas of modern simulation advances.  This award also saw the development of a five-Saturday course on modelling and simulation in science and engineering for high-school students from underrepresented groups.  PI Shell has also been very active in outreach and other educational activities at UCSB, regularly delivering professional development workshops and engaging with student programs.  Prof. Shell is also active in department and campus administrative efforts, particularly those seeking to improve diversity and inclusion.        Last Modified: 10/25/2019       Submitted by: M.
