<AbstractNarration>This award will support the participation of an early science career female scholar in the Northern Research Forum, which will be held in Akureyri, Iceland in the Fall 2013.  The Northern Research Forum (NRF) holds an Open Assembly every two years. Each assembly focuses on a different theme of relevance to northerners and northern research. This years Assembly theme is Climate Change in Northern Territories: Sharing Experiences and Exploring New Methods, Assessing Socio-Economic Impacts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the main objectives of the NRF is to promote the next generation of Arctic researchers by involving emerging scholars in leadership and by selecting a cohort of early career researchers to present their research projects and findings at the Open Assemblies. The aim is to engage early career researchers in dialogue with senior scientists and other professionals and experts as well as representatives of various stakeholder groups and the public. This proposal will support the involvement of an early science career scholar from the United States: Robin Bronen.  She will join more than 20 other Young Researchers from other Arctic nations, offering an opportunity for exchange of ideas and network building.  Dr. Bonen's participation will create an opportunity to contribute to the discussion on the impacts of environmental change in the Arctic and raise awareness about the policy challenges related to environmental change, community habitability, and population displacement.  Through participation in the Northern Territories conference, the goal is to begin the process of creating an international research team focused on understanding the nexus between environmental change and population displacement in the Arctic.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     The objective of this proposal was to attend the æClimate Change in Northern TerritoriesÆ conference in Akureyri, Iceland on August 22-23, 2013.  My research on climate-induced environmental change and the displacement of Alaska Native communities from their ancestral lands addressed a central theme of the Northern Territories conference: building the capacity to adapt to climate-induced environmental change and developing a methodology to assess climate change impacts to the habitability of communities.  Specifically, my research examines how the combination of repeated extreme weather events coupled with accelerating slow onset biophysical change, such as erosion, threatens the lives, livelihood, homes, health, and basic subsistence of human populations that have inhabited Alaska for millennia.  For several Alaska Native communities protection in place is not possible and community relocation is the only adaptation strategy that can protect them from accelerating climate change impacts.  My research also proposes a new adaptive governance framework which will allow local, state and federal institutions in the United States to dynamically respond to these climate-induced environmental changes through a continuum of adaptation strategies, which includes protection in place and community relocation.  Attendance at the Northern Territories conference allowed me to share my research with social scientists working in the Arctic and researching community-based adaptation to climate-induced environmental change.  Attendance at this conference fostered integrating my research into existing Arctic social science research.  Building this network of social scientists in the Arctic is critical because of the rapidity with which climate change transforming ecosystems and impacting populations residing in the Arctic.
