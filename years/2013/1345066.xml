<AbstractNarration>This is an EAGER project to test the reliability of geophysical reconnaissance methods to identify buried Christian churchyards and cemeteries in Iceland. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will allow the joint Icelandic/US team to evaluate the reliability of two geophysical methods on five known or suspected early Viking Age churchyards that are in a variety of geophysical environments. Currently, the most reliable geophysical method to detect Viking Age Christian cemeteries in Iceland is GPR. The problem is that for GPR to be effective, it is necessary to strip off the grass in advance of survey. This is expensive and potentially destructive to archaeological contexts. The team will employ electromagnetic (EM) surveying with new multi-sensor instrumentation as an alternative method for locating preserved walls of churchyards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Positive results from this unique opportunity to evaluate these geophysical applications could greatly expand our knowledge of early Christian practices of the Viking Age. More broadly, many of the innovations, especially in identifying cemeteries and mapping graves, have applications in other archaeological regions and periods, as well as other fields (e.g., forensic sciences). The ability to identify cemeteries and map the distribution graves and possibly to assess skeletal preservation has obvious value to archaeological investigations, heritage management efforts, and forensic scientists around the world.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the summer of 2013 with NSF support (PLR #1345066) the combined Skagafj&ouml;r&eth;ur Church and Settlement Survey (SCaSS) used this EAGER grant to complete the development of a protocol to effectively and reliably identify abandoned and/or relocated church complexes in Northern Iceland.  By surveying a number of known abandoned cemetery sites, we demonstrated that new multi-sensor electromagnetic (EM) units are effective in identifying structures associated with Christian cemeteries, especially circular enclosure walls.  The results of Trase measurements (TDR) suggests that burial shafts in these Christian cemeteries have little contrast with the surrounding soil and that ground penetrating radar (GPR) is probably detecting a contrast with bones and void spaces in the burial itself rather than the grave shaft.  Intellectual Merit: The primary goal of this research was to see if innovative geophysical survey techniques could be used to systematically find early Christian churches and cemeteries from Viking Age Iceland.  Little is known about the practice or organization of early Christianity just after the Viking Age in Iceland.  Many Icelandic farmsteads had their own churches and cemeteries. The problem is that most of these churches were not recorded in any historical writings and were buried long ago, leaving few traces of their presence to be identified by archaeologists.              Iceland was settled starting about A.D. 870 by Viking chieftains and their families.  The resulting society seems to have been somewhat egalitarian, at least for the first few hundred years.  In A.D. 1000, the people of Iceland elected to set aside their pagan traditions and adopt Christianity as the national religion. This event is one of the few historical instances in which Christianity was adopted in the apparent absence of Christian missionaries and by popular decision. While the conversion event is recorded in later Icelandic histories, there is a substantial gap between the official conversion and organization of formal church institutions.  For example, the first bishop was appointed in A.D. 1056 and the tithe instituted in 1096.  By A.D. 1500, and probably much earlier, Icelandic society had become profoundly stratified. Understanding the nature of the adoption of Christianity in Iceland, starkly visible in the layout of household cemeteries, will help us determine if the post-conversion social stratification was a consequence of the institutions that came out of the conversion or a result of an initial inequality that began at the time of settlement.  Broader impacts: Our research efforts in Iceland over the past 13 years, including this project, have been in close collaboration with the Skagafj&ouml;r&eth;ur Heritage Museum.  Part of the museum's mission is the protection and public presentation of Iceland's cultural heritage.  These efforts are especially important in rural areas like Skagafj&ouml;r&eth;ur where modern farming practices are a constant threat to the preservation of cultural heritage.   It is those same farmers that are the closest to, and best potential guardians of, that heritage. The museum has promoted our efforts and the efforts of its own archaeological division - now directly collaborating on this research - as a means to call attention to the nature and value of archaeological remains in the region. This effort has seen real changes in the awareness, interest, and sense of responsibility to this heritage on the part of the local community. Many farmers are excited about the prospect of having archaeological research conducted on their land.              Our work has impacts beyond Iceland.  The same geophysical methods and techniques tested in Iceland will be useful for archaeology conducted in the US, where it is logistically more difficult to ground truth burials.  Currently, the most useful geophysical method to detect burials in general and Viking Age Christian cemeteries in Iceland in particular, i...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
