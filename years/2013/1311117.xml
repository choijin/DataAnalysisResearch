<AbstractNarration>Tropical rainforests harbor the highest tree diversity on earth, yet very few evolutionary studies are aimed at understanding the mechanisms involved in the process of speciation in tropical trees. This study will improve our understanding of evolution by systematically examining the factors involved when one species begins to diverge and become two species. The Amazonian tree, Protium subserratum provides an ideal study system because populations on white-sand habitats and clay habitats have different leaf characters and are easily distinguished in the field. Genetic studies show that populations that are specialized on different soil types mate with each other less frequently than would be expected despite the fact that their reproductive structures are similar and they flower at the same time. These results suggest that populations found on different soil types are diverging and in the process of forming a new species. A combination of field experiments, population genetics and natural history observations will be used to determine what factors are most important in driving the creation of new tree species in tropical environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to being among the first studies to explicitly examine the role of reproductive isolating mechanisms in trees, this research will foster the training of undergraduate students in population genetic techniques and support collaborations with Peruvian students. The results of this research will also be disseminated widely through publication in Spanish.</AbstractNarration>

The process of new species formation has been intriguing biologists ever since Darwin and Wallace first posited the theory of natural selection; however the majority of evolutionary studies today primarily focus on temperate flora and faunal systems. The Amazon rainforest, the most bio-diverse place on earth, and subsequently where the evolution of new species has been hypothesized to occur at a comparatively higher rate and frequency has been largely ignored.  When compared to the mountains, deserts, canyons and coasts of more temperate regions the lowland Amazon basin is often mistakenly thought of as a contiguous stretch of singular rainforest habitat while in fact, it encompasses a vast amount of environmental heterogeneity. The lowland rainforest of Northwestern Peru is particularly noted for its mosaic of different forest types, each housing a different suite of unique animal and plant inhabitants. Particularly notable are the white sand forests which are found on ancient quartz sands dating prior to the Andean uplift and which are patchily distributed as habitat islands surrounded by more common clay and terrace soils. Because many endemic tree species found on these white sand soil types are often very closely related to tree species growing nearby in clay soil forests they provide the perfect opportunity to study how ecological adaptation and natural selection can drive the formation and maintenance of new species.  The Protium subserratum species complex (Burseraceae) provides a rare opportunity to study the isolating mechanisms that contribute to ecological divergence as it is occurring. The genus Protium (Burseraceae) is a diverse clade of ca. 140 tree species, 100 of which are found in the rainforests of the lowland Amazon Basin. While the majority of Protium species are soil specialists, P. subserratum represents one of the few soil generalists in the genus, with genetically and morphologically differentiated subspecies found on the more fertile clay soils and the nutrient-poor white sand soils. The tree species is widespread and has morphologically differentiated subspecies found on patches of clay and white sand soil habitat found directly adjacent to each other. Additionally, while population genetic analysis suggests the presence of low gene flow across habitat boundaries populations of both morphotypes are clearly maintaining their genetic and morphological integrity, suggesting that strong barriers to reproduction exist.  This research aimed to investigate the broader role of divergent natural selection as an agent in generating and maintaining Amazonian tree diversity using soil specialist populations of Protium subserratum.  Using a combination of molecular population genetics field observations and hand-pollination experiments we: (1) Developed nuclear microsatellite markers in order to evaluate population level differentiation and gene flow between populations of P. subserratum associated with different soil types.

(4) Systematically evaluated the role of multiple pre- and post-zygotic barriers to reproduction in maintaining population integrity between parapatric populations of white-sand and brown-sand P. subserratum.  We found evidence that suggests that specialization onto different soils has occurred multiple times in P. subserratum and that natural selection may be driving divergence across soil boundaries.
