<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes a transformative technology to overcome state of the art mid-wavelength infrared (MWIR) detector technology by developing a novel nanostructured detector architecture sensitive to infrared photon absorption. Traditional planar MWIR photodetectors are fundamentally limited by both the electrical junction area being equivalent with the optical collection area and the dark current being limited by generation recombination current.  The requisite large collection thickness of the absorbing material to maximize quantum efficiency results in a deleterious effect for dark current density reducing signal to noise ratio.  The proposed technology is based on a 3D plasmonic antenna of self-aligned III-V nanopillars. The proposed technology is expected to result in a 1 - 2 order improvement in detectivity in the 3 - 5 micron wavelength range compared to state of the art planar detectors. The proposed technology is expected to substantially reduce the size, weight and power consumption requirements of IR cameras. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project offers several routes to societal benefit by transitioning academic research into technology advancement and subsequent product development. This proposal will elucidate the fundamental science of 3D plasmonic antennas and nanostructures in the MWIR which will be disseminated to the research community. The company will also pursue the development of a MWIR camera product in partnership with larger industry collaborators which will bring employment opportunities to the local community. The successful implementation of the proposed technology will result in a MWIR camera product with a small form factor at a lower price point. The resulting camera product would be a disruptive technology in both the surveillance and home automation markets.</AbstractNarration>
