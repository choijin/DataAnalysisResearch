<AbstractNarration>This project is testing, refining, and disseminating a promising evidence-based model for guiding effective undergraduate research.  The model is based on five years of data.  Additional testing and refinement activity are underway to ensure applicability across diverse institutional settings. The project will create and provide the resources needed to support successful implementation at any undergraduate institution.  Through collaborations with the Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR) and the Science Education Resource Center SERC) at Carleton College, the project intends to foster national communities of STEM scholars who are trained and motivated to sustain and expand this model.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The model is designed to ensure that the student learning outcomes from participation in undergraduate research are as strong as possible. It deliberately generates formative guidance during the research through a series of quantitative, built-in formative evaluations conducted over the duration of each research experience. Evaluation is a central component of this model. The model emphasizes multiple progress assessments by both faculty and students across a wide range of desirable outcomes, so that the evaluation process provides essential information used by both students and faculty to advance learning objectives.  The design approach transcends specific STEM disciplines.  This transcendent feature offers an opportunity to aggregate impact results across a series of undergraduate research experiences.  The model's built-in evaluation feature will provide summary data on student learning that could be used to inform resource allocation decisions.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="p1">The main goal of this five-year WIDER project, led by PI Jill Singer at SUNY Buffalo State (hereafter Buffalo State) was to refine and broadly disseminate a successful undergraduate research (UGR) professional development and assessment model (EvaluateUR) that has been in place at Buffalo State since 2008. EvaluateUR is based on a theory of how student outcomes can be improved by incorporating evaluation into UGR experiences, leading to the design of a unique, evidence-based approach to teaching and learning.&nbsp; A guiding principle was the desire to obtain reliable independent assessments of program impact without creating a measurement burden, while at the same time providing information to participating students that could help them gain new insights into their academic strengths and weaknesses. To accomplish this, 11 outcome categories each defined by 3-4 components were identified. The 11 outcome categories are: communication, creativity, autonomy, ability to deal with obstacles, practice and process of inquiry, nature of disciplinary knowledge, critical thinking and problem solving, understanding ethical conduct, intellectual development, culture of scholarship, and content knowledge skills/methodology. Repeated structured interactions between the student and mentor include completing identical surveys before the research begins, in the middle of the research, and at the end of the research experience. This increases the likelihood that mentors have multiple opportunities to review and assess student work and time for students to reflect on their strengths and weaknesses. Particularly innovative aspects of the EvaluateUR approach include its applicability to all disciplinary areas, support for students, faculty mentors and campus-based undergraduate research offices, and a phased approach to assessing student skill development throughout the course of UGR experiences. EvaluateUR also includes the capability to produce detailed, statistically-valid, and reliable reports of student skill development through UGR.&nbsp; These reports are of significant usefulness to institutions seeking to quantitatively measure student growth and success in high-impact practices such as UGR. Through collaborations with the Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR) and the Science Education Resource Center (SERC), the project successfully fostered national communities of STEM scholars empowered to sustain and expand the EvaluateUR model. By the end of the five-year grant, 44 programs at 37 institutions had implemented EvaluateUR, and hundreds of faculty mentors and UGR directors were provided with information concerning the EvaluateUR approach, through a variety of presentations and webinars at national UGR and STEM meetings.&nbsp; As an example, the 2019 EvaluateUR cohort included 781 mentors and 799 students as part of 799 student-mentor pairs.&nbsp; (A few mentors mentored more than one student.)&nbsp; All EvaluateUR assessment components saw statistically significant positive growth from the perspectives of both students and mentors when tested by a paired sample t test (alpha =.05).&nbsp; It can be concluded with great confidence that the EvaluateUR evaluation methodology successfully measured objective student growth as measured by student self-reports and mentor feedback. With regard to stakeholder perceptions of EvaluateUR?s value, in a survey conducted in 2019 with 189 student respondents, nine out of 10 survey respondents said that these discussions with mentors through the EvaluateUR program helped them to achieve a deeper understanding of their academic and professional strengths and weaknesses and become more aware of the knowledge, skills and competencies they needed to do well in graduate school and/or the workplace. Similarly, in a 2019 survey conducted of 136 faculty mentors from 22 different institutions, nine out of 10 survey respondents also confirmed that the EvaluateUR discussions helped the student gain a better understanding of their academic and professional strengths and weaknesses.&nbsp; EvaluateUR is positioned well to sustain and grow, through a subscription-based service to support robust operations systems at SERC and Buffalo State, production of a series of instructional videos to support new and existing EvaluateUR users, and through continued promotion within CUR and other organizations.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/23/2020<br>      Modified by: Elizabeth&nbsp;L&nbsp;Ambos</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent"
