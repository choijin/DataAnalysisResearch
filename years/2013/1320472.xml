<AbstractNarration>The exponential growth of wireless data traffic causes spectrum depletion and significantly stresses the capacity of existing and future wireless networks. The massive unlicensed bandwidth in the 60 GHz band provides great potential to meet the surging wireless data demand. The goal of this project is to gain a deep understanding of the 60 GHz propagation and channel characteristics, and to develop effective 60 GHz network protocols. This project falls into four interacted thrusts: (i) 60 GHz 3-D channel propagation measurement and modeling; (ii) MAC scheduling in 60 GHz networks; (iii) 60 GHz mesh network protocols; and (iv) enabling rich multimedia communications in 60 GHz networks. Various methods including field testing and measurements, mathematical modeling, network protocol design, distributed control, and cross-layer optimization are adopted to address the research challenges.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is part of a broad and ambitious global effort to develop novel techniques to exploit the huge license-free spectrum in the 60 GHz band in face of the exponential wireless data growth. It has the potential to accelerate the deployment of more powerful, bandwidth intensive, ubiquitous and cheaper wireless applications and services, and the support of more versatile, robust and rich-multimedia wireless networks. Complementary to the research agenda, the project also carries out a broad range of education and outreach activities, including integration of research findings into wireless engineering courses, textbook development, promoting underrepresented and undergraduate populations, collaboration with an HBCU, and participating in existing programs at the PIs' institutions for outreach to K-12 students and teachers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has provided fundamental knowledge about the radio channel that is vital for the wireless communications research community. The work here is enabling the development of future wireless systems and equpment that will use directional antenna technologies to support multi-Gigabit per second data transfers in future wireless mobile networks.  By moving up to the millimeter wave frequency bands, it becomes possible to use, for the first time, highly directional and adaptive antennas to enable wideband communications, using channel bandwidths that are orders of magnitude greater than any used in today's 4G cellular systems.  Working with Auburn University, this project developed new measurement equipment that led to fundamental channel knowledge, and created new algorithms that will allow mobile devices to rapidly steer their directional antennas to "find" other users, so that rapid link connections can be established. This project also developed a popular open source channel modeling software tool, NYUSIM, that allows researchers to reproduce the realistic statistical nature of  millimeter wave radio channels across a wide range of frequencies, channel bandwidths, and antenna beamwidths. NYUSIM has already been used by about 10,000 engineers around the world, and is becoming a de facto standard for wireless research at millimeter wave frequencies. Version 1.6 of NYUSIM was released in December 2017, thanks in part to funding on this project.  This project also developed fundamental knowledge about how radio signals travel in and around buildings, urban canyons, and in rural environments, thereby providing the industry with the earliest results of channel knowledgethat enables the design and development of data transfer protocols and antenna approaches in 5G wireless networks.  Some results in this project were incorporated in channel models that were incorporated in international standard groups such as 3GPP and ITU.
