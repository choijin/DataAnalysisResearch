<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Title: Private Information, Liquidity, and Financial Crises&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No: SES - 1326068&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Shimer, Robert&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will develop and explore theoretical models of private information in financial markets.  In many situations, the seller of a financial asset, such as a mortgage-backed security, may have information about the asset's quality that is unavailable to potential buyers.  For example, a mortgage securitizer may be affiliated with the company that originated the mortgages that underlie the security.  In this case, an investor who is considering purchasing a mortgage-backed security from the securitizer will be aware that the seller may have soft information about the homeowners' characteristics.  Since this soft information affects the seller's willingness to sell, it will also affect the investor's willingness to purchase the security and hence the functioning of the mortgage market.&lt;br/&gt;The starting point for this research is an analysis of an environment in which there are gains from trade in financial assets.  For example, a mortgage originator needs to sell some of its mortgage portfolio in order to raise money for new loans; or a mortgage securitizer needs to sell some of its existing securities in order to raise money to purchase to new mortgage pools.  A buyer would like to purchase from a seller like this, with a strong intrinsic reason to sell.  At the same time, sellers may have private information about the quality of the assets they own.  A buyer would prefer not to purchase from a seller who is selling because he believes he has a low quality asset.  Buyers are unable to tell whether a seller is selling an asset because the seller needs to raise funds or because the seller believes the asset has a low quality.&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary research establishes that the seller's asking price gives the buyer some of the seller's private information both about the asset's characteristics and about the seller's characteristics.  The key insight is that in markets with a shortage of buyers, sellers can use their asking price as a costly signal.  Sellers know that the shortage of buyers is more acute, and so a sale is less likely, at a higher price.  Sellers who value holding onto their asset more, either because they perceive that the asset has a higher quality or because they do not have a strong intrinsic reason to sell the asset, are more willing to set a higher price at the risk of failing to sell their asset.   Buyers know this and are willing to pay a high price to the extent that they expect to be compensated with a high quality asset.   In equilibrium, the extent of the private information problem determines the shortfall in the number of buyers and hence the illiquidity of the market.  More precisely, the equilibrium depends on the joint distribution of two types of private information: sellers' perception of asset quality and sellers' intrinsic reason for sale.&lt;br/&gt;The theoretical environment generates a rich set of empirical predictions.  For example, identical assets may trade at different prices, with the price dependent on the owner's characteristics.  On the other hand, heterogeneous assets may trade at the same price, so the price only imperfectly reveals an asset's quality.  Some investors may simultaneously buy and sell assets in an effort to take advantage of their private information.&lt;br/&gt;The theoretical model suggests two notions of a crisis that leads to a breakdown in financial intermediation.  The first involves a change in fundamentals.  Sellers may get bad information about the quality of the assets in their portfolio.  For example, a decline in house prices may increase the default risk for mortgage-backed securities that previously appeared to be safe.  Alternatively, sellers may realize fewer investment opportunities, which lowers the gains from trade.  For example, a decline in house prices may reduce the demand for new mortgages, moderating sellers' need to sell assets for cash.  Both of these shifts imply that it is more likely that a seller is selling an asset because the seller has bad information about the asset, worsening the adverse selection problem and potentially leading to a collapse in trade.&lt;br/&gt;The second notion of a crisis involves a shift in behavior without a change in fundamentals.  Preliminary research establishes conditions under which multiple equilibria can exist, with each indexed by the number of buyers in the market.  Sellers pricing incentives are always determined by their desire to signal the quality of their asset.  In an equilibrium with fewer buyers, sellers are perversely induced to set higher prices for their assets, which in turn drives out the buyers.  This type of crisis may occur because of contagion which carries a crisis from one market (mortgage-backed securities) to another (securities backed by auto loans).  &lt;br/&gt;The solid theoretical foundation that this research project will develop should be important for understanding and quantifying the importance of private information in financial markets.  This in turn will be useful for evaluating the potential impact of politically feasible policy responses to a crisis and for formulating an optimal policy response</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PI and CO-PI investigated how private information can generate illiquid markets.  The starting point of the research project is Akerlof's (1970) observation that buyers' concerns about sellers' private information constrains trade in many asset markets.  In contrast to the bulk of the existing literature on private information and adverse selection, the investigators' research recognizes that both buyers and sellers are able to choose the price at which they trade.  Sellers know that they can always sell an asset quickly by setting a low price, while a higher price might entail a delay in selling.  To the extent that sellers with different private information have different preferences over the tradeoff between price and delay, the sale price reflects their private information.  Uninformed buyers then recognize that the price is a noisy but costly signal of the sellers private information.  Equilibrium entails both illiquidity (delays in sale) and price dispersion for identical assets.  A significant component of this research focuses on an environment where sellers are privately informed both about their need to sell assets and about the quality of the assets that they hold.  Buyers only care about the quality of a seller's assets.  A seller may set a low price either because he is desperate to sell or because he has a low quality asset.  Indeed, sellers with different asset qualities may perceive that the tradeoff between selling price and selling probability is the same.  When different sellers perceive the same tradeoff, the research shows that buyers cannot infer an asset's quality from its selling price.  This has two novel implications.  The first is that, even though sellers may set any price for their asset, they choose to sell different quality assets at the same price.  That is, there is price dispersion.  The more surprising implication is that this naturally leads to multiple equilibria.  Even standard signalling game refinements are not useful for pinning down buyers' beliefs when they encounter a price that is not supposed to be offered in equilibrium, since many different types of sellers have the same incentive to deviate from the prescribed equilibrium.  This ambiguity in "off the equilibrium path beliefs" creates the possibility of multiple equilibria.  Different equilibria have different welfare properties.  For example, in some equilibria, sellers of high quality assets cross-subsidize sellers of low quality assets.  Equilibrium may also be inefficient for a distinct reason: it is constrained by the need for buyers to earn the same profit at any price that sellers set in equilibrium.  Optimal allocations, in contrast, require cross-subsidization of the uninformed buyers.  This framework is useful for understanding the market for financial assets such as mortgage-backed securities.  Mortgage originators often have superior information about the underlying quality of the mortgage, including prepayment risk for insured mortgages and default risk for uninsured mortgages.  Once the mortgages have been securitized and tranched, it may be very difficult for buyers to evaluate these risks, creating an asymmetric information problem.  This reduces the liquidity of the market for informationally sensitive assets: the equity tranche during normal times, and even the most senior tranche in an environment with declining house prices and high default and foreclosure rates.    This project has a broader impact along three dimensions. First, asymmetric information affects a variety of asset markets, including the  market for used cars and the market for sophisticated financial instruments such as mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations.  Asymmetric information may also be relevant in other markets, including the labor market.  Thus the tools developed in this project should be relevant to a broad set of economics researchers.  Second, there is interest within the economics policy and practitioner communities, for example at Federal Reserve Bank of the U.S. and at regional Feds, in understanding why asset markets sometimes break down.  This interest was sparked by the 2007--2009 financial crisis and the subsequent recession and slow recovery.  The findings in this project may clarify the role of outside interventions in asset markets, including asset purchase programs.  Third, the PI and co-PI employed a graduate student for much of this project.  This furthered her professional development. She recently completed a Ph.D. thesis proposal which builds on the research agenda developed here.        Last Modified: 06/08/2017       Submitted by: Robert Shimer]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
