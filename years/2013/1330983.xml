<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant helped support students attending IEEE EnergyTech 2013, held May 21-23, 2013 at Case Western Reserve University.  This conference was initiated in 2011 and grew in consecutive years through 2013, and it will be merged with the Int. Energy Conversion Engineering Conference (IECEC) in 2014.  EnergyTech was created in response to increasing emphasis of energy issues.   This grant helped make it possible for students to attend, with the aim of encouraging more U.S. engineering students to enter education, research and careers in energy.    EnergyTech 2013 had approximately 200 attendees, with 83 peer-reviewed papers published on IEEEXplore, in addition to unpublished presentations from industry.  Student support was provided based on priorities of: co-authorship, student presentation, current involvement in energy at a U.S. educational institution, and endorsement of their advisors.   In all, 30 students were provided with full registration, 13 students were provided with housing, and 8 were provided direct travel support.  NSF's support of IEEE EnergyTech has achieved the goals of expanding technical conferences in energy in the U.S. and of providing opportunities for U.S. students to get exposure to current energy research.  It is anticipated that this support will have long-term benefits in terms of recruiting U.S. engineering students to careers in energy.
