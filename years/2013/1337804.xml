<AbstractNarration>1337804&lt;br/&gt;Payne&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Super-resolution fluorescence microscopy provides 20 nm resolution using visible light. This&lt;br/&gt;level of resolution allows scientists and engineers to investigate cells, organelles, viruses,&lt;br/&gt;and nanoparticles on their relevant length scale. A group of 23 Georgia Tech faculty members&lt;br/&gt;in 7 departments propose to acquire a Zeiss LSM 780 Elyra PS1 Combi super-resolution fluorescence&lt;br/&gt;microscope to advance research along 3 themes; Cellular &amp; Engineering Bioscience, Complex&lt;br/&gt;Systems, and Nanoscience. The microscope will be part of the Georgia Tech core facilities&lt;br/&gt;located in the Parker H. Petit Institute for Bioengineering and Bioscience (IBB). These core&lt;br/&gt;facilities are available to any academic or industry researcher and we expect the super-resolution&lt;br/&gt;microscope will be a valuable tool for researchers throughout the Southeast. The core facilities&lt;br/&gt;also provide professional staff to oversee maintenance and training, as well as long-term&lt;br/&gt;stewardship of the microscope. In addition to advances in research, this microscope will be&lt;br/&gt;a valuable educational tool for high school students, undergraduates, graduate students, and&lt;br/&gt;postdoctoral researchers, both at Georgia Tech and in Atlanta.</AbstractNarration>
