<AbstractNarration>RESEARCH OBJECTIVES AND APPROACHES&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this research is to explore how one can use low-energy collective plasmon excitations of individual nanotubes to tailor the optical properties of periodically aligned, densely packed, parallel arrays of carbon nanotubes. The rigorous quantum electrodynamics approach, developed earlier by the PI for individual nanotubes, will be used. The approach starts with single-tube band-structure calculations and allows one to go beyond the ideally-conducting-cylinder and effective-medium restrictive approximations employed previously by others.&lt;br/&gt;INTELLECTUAL MERIT&lt;br/&gt;Mixing surface states with bulk-periodic dielectric properties brings dense, periodically aligned carbon nanotube arrays into the highly demanded broad-band spectral range of microwave to visible, which can be tuned by adjusting inter-tube separation, tube diameter and chirality, and by varying dielectric host material. Clear understanding of the properties of low-energy collective electronic excitations in periodically aligned carbon nanotube arrays and how individual constituent nanotubes communicate with one another and what it does to the collective properties of the array, is a natural prerequisite for the realization of a variety of practical applications ranging from the enhanced electromagnetic absorption, conversion and rectification of ambient electromagnetic fields to nano-biosensorics and advanced plasmonic metamaterials development.&lt;br/&gt;BROADER IMPACT&lt;br/&gt;This research will result in novel optoelectronic device concepts for advanced electromagnetic meta-materials engineering for use in future energy related applications. Increased exposure of under-represented minority students from NCCU, nation's first state-supported public liberal arts college for African Americans, to this exciting cutting-edge nanotechnology research will lead to increased minority participation in graduate studies in scientific disciplines and in scientific careers in general.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Quasi-two-dimensional closely packed periodic carbon nanotube arrays (thin films) offer extraordinary stability, flexibility and precise tunability of their physical properties by varying the nanotube diameter, chirality and periodicity as well as the film thickness and length.&nbsp; The key features that make them interesting from the theory perspective are the periodic cylinder alignment and spatially periodic anisotropy associated with it. Finite-thickness closely packed carbon nanotube array films have been in the process of an intensive experimental development in the hope of creating a new generation of ultrathin flexible multifunctional plasmonic metasurfaces and nonlinear optical devices with characteristics adjustable on demand. Individual carbon nanotubes of different diameters and chiralities feature similar electronic band structure that enables both exciton and plasmon excitations to control the nanotube electromagnetic properties over a broad range of excitation energies in the far- and near-field zones, respectively. With this in mind, many new nanoengineering applications can be realized on the basis of finite-thickness (in-plane anisotropic) carbon nanotube array films and related ultrathin (in-plane isotropic) metallic film systems, including controlled electromagnetic absorption, enhanced light scattering and tunable polarized light emission, to mention a few. Modern material fabrication techniques allow one to produce stoichiometrically perfect metallic films of controlled thickness down to a few monolayers which opens up challenges and opportunities for the theory development to reveal new universal functionalities of the finite-thickness ultrathin plasmonic films, both isotropic and anisotropic ones, at the nanoscale.</p> <p>In this effort, we have performed theoretical studies into the electron quantum confinement effects and their manifestation in the optical response of thin metallic films of finite thickness and lateral size --- the simplest in-plane isotropic case, a prototype and an important example to show how the quantum-dimensional effects therein can help realize new functionalities of planar metallic nanostructures whose particular case is closely packed periodically aligned carbon nanotube array films. The plasma frequency of the film, while being constant for relatively thick films, is shown to acquire the spatial dispersion typical of 2D materials shifting to the red as the film thickness decreases, which explains well the measurements done on ultrathin TiN films of controlled variable thickness. This spatial dispersion and the associated nonlocality of the dielectric response yield the sharp resonance structure of the film magnetic permeability as well as the IR-frequency negative refractivity effect for the properly tuned ultrathin films of finite lateral size. These are the universal features peculiar to all plasmonic thin films, which can be controlled not only by varying the material composition of the film but also by changing its thickness and lateral size as well as by choosing deposition substrates and coating layers appropriately.</p> <p>We also studied single-tubule hybrid systems such as atomically doped single-walled and pristine double-walled carbon nanotubes. We have developed a quantum electrodynamics theory of resonance Raman scattering for an atomic dipole emitter coupled to the plasmon resonance of a single-walled carbon nanotube. The Raman cross-section exhibits a dramatic increase when the emitter is in close proximity to the nanotube surface. Our developed electron transport theory for a one-atom-thick metallic wire encapsulated into a semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotube helps to understand the interplay between the intrinsic one-dimensional conductance of the wire and the nanotube mediated near-field effects. The electron transmission through the wire exhibits the Fano resonances making the entire hybrid metal-semiconductor system transparent at energies where neither wire nor nanotube is individually transparent. This effect can be used to optimize the charge transport in nanotube based metal-semiconductor devices for nanoscale energy conversion, separation and storage. Last but not least, we studied a possibility for the quasi-one-dimensional exciton Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) effect in double-walled carbon nanotube systems with the excitons of one tubule coupled to the plasmon-induced local field of the other coaxial tubule. We demonstrate the possibility for achieving the optimum coupling regime to allow the room-temperature exciton BEC effect in properly selected double-walled nanotube combinations. The effect will manifest itself as the highly coherent exciton emission resonance polarized along the nanotube symmetry axis. This effect opens up new avenues for the fundamental science and engineering applications with the double-walled carbon nanotube systems.</p> <p>This NSF project has attracted good students, both local and international, to join the Master Program in Physics at the North Carolina Central University. Three Master theses were completed during the time of the project implementation. Participation in research efforts like this increases exposure of students to this exciting rapidly expanding field of modern nanotechnology. Students carry their experiences all the way through their professional careers. Even though some of them may decide to switch to non-science majors, they will still be more prepared intellectually in terms of the cutting-edge nanotechnology knowledge to take it to their newly selected non-science disciplines and thus to contribute to new knowledge dissemination.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/10/2018<br>      Modified by: Igor&nbsp;Bondarev</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1306871/1306871_10262987_1541910484705_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1306871/1306871_10262987_1541910484705_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1306871/1306871_10262987_1541910484705_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1</div> <div class="imageCredit">Igor Bondarev, NCCU</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Igor&nbsp;Bondarev</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1306871/1306871_10262987_1541910540680_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1306871/1306871_10262987_1541910540680_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1306871/1306871_10262987_1541910540680_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 2</div> <div class="imageCredit">Igor Bondarev, NCCU</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Igor&nbsp;Bondarev</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1306871/1306871_10262987_1541910596835_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1306871/1306871_10262987_1541910596835_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1306871/1306871_10262987_1541910596835_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 3</div> <div class="imageCredit">Igor Bondarev, NCCU</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Igor&nbsp;Bondarev</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1306871/1306871_10262987_1541910855769_Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1306871/1306871_10262987_1541910855769_Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1306871/1306871_10262987_1541910855769_Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 4</div> <div class="imageCredit">Igor Bondarev, NCCU</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Igor&nbsp;Bondarev</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 4</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1306871/1306871_10262987_1541911110324_Figure5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1306871/1306871_10262987_1541911110324_Figure5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 5"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1306871/1306871_10262987_1541911110324_Figure5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 5"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 5</div> <div class="imageCredit">Igor Bondarev, NCCU</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Igor&nbsp;Bondarev</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 5</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
