<AbstractNarration>How and why do languages vary? Studying closely related languages can tell us important details of the nature of human language, by holding most grammatical properties constant while varying others, across a set of languages. Understanding the limits on such variation?and how such differences arise historically?requires an accurate description of a group of related languages. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The heterogeneous varieties of Luyia, a group of Bantu languages of Kenya and Uganda, provide a laboratory for investigating such micro-variation in grammar. This project will produce the first comprehensive descriptions and formal analyses of four underdocumented Kenyan varieties of Luyia: Bukusu, Logoori, Tiriki, and Wanga. A series of monographs will be developed for each language which include a grammatical outline, a detailed description of the tonal system, in-depth studies in syntax, a collection of texts, and a dictionary. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The diverse tone systems of Luyia are a major focus of this work. Luyia tone has many notable features, including a rare process by which High tones spread leftward across and within words. Complex tonal patterns mark inflectional differences among verb tenses, and syntactically conditioned rules are also found in the phrasal tonology. A solid understanding of these processes bears crucially on theories of the phonology-syntax interface, which are concerned with what kind of syntactic information can be used by a phonological system. These theoretically and typologically interesting features of Luyia tone will be systematically investigated through targeted paradigmatic elicitation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project models team-based, data-rich and theoretically informed linguistic description and analysis. The Luyia team draws on the expertise of linguists in multiple subfields and brings together US-based and Africa-based scholars, enriching the practice of linguistics by each group. The monographs, text collections, and dictionaries produced by the project will be made freely available online, and relevant materials will be disseminated within the appropriate local communities.</AbstractNarration>

Noam Chomsky’s syntax research framework (the Minimalist Program) draws significant theoretical conclusions based on perception verb constructions like seem and appear: an embedded subject (the boy) may appear in the main clause only if the embedded clause is an infinitive (it seems that THE BOY ate vs. THE BOY seems to have eaten). It is not possible to say something like, "*THE BOY seems that ate." This has been well-established as a persistent cross-linguistic generalization, which has been taken to tell us how human languages are cognitively represented. Specifically, it bears on the question of "noun phrase licensing" &ndash; the linguistic system that determines the licit positions of subjects and objects of the verb. This project has demonstrated that for all four Luyia varieties, it is in fact possible to say the equivalent of "THE BOY seems that left," where "the boy" appears in the main clause, but the sentence is perfectly natural. We systematically show that this conclusion isn’t simply apparent, but that this "raising" of the subject is in fact a real property of Luyia syntax. The Luyia languages show many layers of complications arising out of their complex agreement systems, however, which show promise to help understand why they might behave differently in this respect. The hope is that this will help lead to a more universally accurate theory of noun phrase licensing.     Turning to object marking, these constructions are well researched across the world’s languages. In Spanish, this is exemplified by the small pronoun that can appear before the verb:  vimos a Juan "we saw John" vs. lo vimos "we saw him." Some varieties of Spanish also allow the pronoun and the object to co-occur: lo vimos a Juan "we saw John." This latter construction is called clitic doubling, and is largely thought to be related to the specificity of the object.  We investigate similar constructions in Luyia, with a focus on Bukusu (though engaging the other three languages as well). This resulted in one publication so far (Sikuku, Diercks, and Marlo. 2018.
