<AbstractNarration>Through the CheM Scholars project the team at La Roche College seeks to increase the number of economically disadvantaged students who complete chemistry and mathematics degrees by supporting for 14 chemistry and mathematics B.S. majors.  A unique feature of the project is the S-STEM scholar participation in the Chemsolve 2.0 program which exposes high school students to spectroscopy.  Through Chemsolve, interdisciplinary teams of scholars design and develop hands-on activities and analyze products for their younger peers.  The Chemsolve experience provides the S-STEM student with an opportunity to graduate from novice lab assistance to quality control directors over the course of four years.  Moreover, participants are provided with opportunities to be mentored by a team of faculty, alumni, and corporate guides and to participate in professional societies and internships. In order to broaden participation the project recruits students from groups that are under-represented in STEM (women and African American).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The technical merit of this project lies in the establishment of an innovative, interdisciplinary team-based methodology for delivering academic, social, and financial supports.  The objectives of the CheM scholars project are to: (a) double the enrollment in undergraduate chemistry and mathematics B.S. programs by 2016, (b) retain and graduate 100% of CheM scholars by 2020, and (c) increase entry to STEM workforce or graduate study.  Data generated through assessment and evaluation is expected to support the rationale that a multi-disciplinary, team-based approach to the student's academic and social development will lead to the high retention and graduation rates.  Formative and summative evaluation will focus on assessment of the effect of the team-based initiatives on student learning, retention and job/graduate program placement.  Every aspect of the project including recruitment and enrollment benchmarks, course performance, and student-developed outreach materials is evaluated.   The students are tracked after graduation and interviewed about the project's impact.  Dissemination of the project results provides a model for using teamwork as a means of retaining STEM students.  The project team plans to present their work locally, to other STEM departments at LaRoche College and nationally through websites and meetings of the American Chemical Society and the American Mathematical Society.  Project deliverables include results of summative evaluation and the student-developed Chemsolve 2.0 learning materials.</AbstractNarration>

Four math majors completed B.S. Mathematics degrees at LRU (3 in 2019 and 1 in 2020); 2 others switched majors to accounting/finance (1 completed a BS in Accounting/Finance in 2020, and the other is on track to earn a B.S. in Accounting/Management in Dec 2020); 1 withdrew from LRU after one semester, as a freshman in cohort 1.  14 chemistry majors completed BS Chemistry or Biochemistry degrees at LRU (5 in 2019, and 9 in 2020); 2 completed other STEM degrees (BS Biology and a BA Health Science in 2019);  1 transferred to another university to pursue a PharmD degree;1 has taken a leave-of-absence with less than 1 year to complete a B.S. (we anticipate this student returning soon); and 1 withdrew from LRU after one semester as a freshman in cohort 1.     Among chemistry majors, the graduation percentage in chemistry/biochemistry programs was 14/19, or 74%; chemistry scholars who completed STEM Bachelor degrees were 17/19, or 89%.  Moreover, we anticipate that one student will return to complete a BS Chemistry degree soon.  Among mathematics majors, the graduation rate for students completing a BS in Math was 4/7, or 57%.  Two others are completing Bachelor's degrees in accounting/finance (one in May 2020, one in Dec 2020) -- majors for which their math backgrounds proved beneficial.    Of the 21 who completed BS/BA STEM degrees, 8 are attending graduate programs (1 in PhD Mathematics program, 3 in PharmD programs, 1 in MAT Secondary Math Education, 1 in MS Biomedical Sciences program, 1 in MS. Crop Science program, 1 in MS Nursing program).  Seven BS Chem grads are working full-time in the chemistry sector; two BS Math grads are working in the math analytics/education fields.  Two others are applying to graduate programs for 2021 admission.  During the latter years of this NSF grant, the Chemistry Department collaborated with our Computer Science Department to create the first draft of a software package that we call AAAA (for Academic Assessment Analytics and Advancement) which enables Chemistry faculty to track the academic progress and learning of its chemistry majors via a unified database, and to implement effective learning interventions in at risk individuals.  Additional work on AAAA is continuing in 2020-21.                Last Modified: 10/29/2020       Submitted by: Don Fujito]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
