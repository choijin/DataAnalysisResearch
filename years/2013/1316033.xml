<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professors Steven Weinberg, Willy Fischler, and Jacques Distler at the University of Texas at Austin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work done by this group of professors ranges from physics at the most fundamental level to computations relevant to current observations in particle physics and cosmology. As part of this research project, these professors intend to pursue their quest for a deeper understanding of the various challenges confronting theoretical physics, ranging from attaining a fundamental understanding of its intricacies when combining quantum mechanics and gravity including cosmology to the phenomenology of particle physics. Making progress in these areas will require a many-pronged approach, using insight gained from existing concepts like holography to developing a deeper mathematical understanding including new tools in field theory and string theory.  Professor Weinberg will pursue new approaches to quantum measurement theory and investigate alternative regularization schemes for cosmological perturbation theory.  Professor Fischler will continue his work on Holographic Space Time, AdS/CFT and exploring alternative theories of dark matter.  Finally, Professor Distler will continue his work on Gaiotto Duality and on the theory of orientifolds, while pursuing new ideas on heterotic string compactification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These three faculty members also have a strong track record of making physics accessible to a wider audience through popular lectures and through various other media including Press, Radio, TV and the Internet.   These activities are envisioned to continue in conjunction with the current research project.  These activities also include the development of Web technologies and the authoring of graduate textbooks in physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The Theory Group has during the grant period pursued research in areas ranging from particle physics phenomenology to cosmology including fundamental questions pertaining to foundations of quantum mechanics, the development of a theory of quantum gravity and state of the art quantum field theory.  Quantum mechanics has been remarkably successful in describing nature, but since its creation there have lingered deep questions about its interpretation. Professor Weinberg has explored a new approach to quantum physics in which the description of reality, in particular measurements of physical quantities, is obtained using mathematical entities that replace the more conventional wave-functions.  He has also recently used this approach to consider theories in which quantum mechanics is modified in ways that avoid its long-standing problems of interpretation, with special attention to experiments that might reveal tiny effects of these modifications.   Classical general relativity and quantum mechanics have indeed been extremely successful in describing physical phenomena. However, the development of a fully quantum mechanical description of gravity remains one of the most deep and challenging problems in theoretical physics.  Professor Fischler in collaboration with Professor Banks is in the midst of pursuing a formulation of quantum gravity based on the holographic principle. That principle states that the amount of information in a region of space does not scale like the volume of that region but rather like an area associated to that region. They have been able to recover well known results both in black hole physics and cosmology. In addition, they were able to shed light on some of the theoretical puzzles associated with black holes. In that pursuit of a theory of quantum gravity, Fischler with student Kundu discovered new intriguing physical phenomena. These phenomena manifest themselves on the boundaries of space-time beyond which no events are detectable to observers. These regions are known as the horizons of black holes and cosmological space-times.  These discoveries allow in principle and possibly in the future, practical measurement of constants of nature which otherwise would be impossible to determine. In the context of particle physics phenomenology, Fischler with students explored the implications of the possible existence of a dark electromagnetic field interacting with particles carrying a dark charge. In addition they built a class of models improving the naturalness of extensions to the standard model of particle physics. Quantum field theory is the primary theoretical tool of the high energy theorist and -- though the subject is more than half a century old -- a full understanding is still elusive. Among all quantum field theories (QFTs), the conformally-invariant ones (CFTs) play a special role. The short-distance behaviour of an arbitrary QFT is governed by some CFT. In the traditional paradigm of "asymptotic freedom," the short-distance CFT is a free theory and while the long-distance physics can be quite complicated, the short-distance physics is simple. But that is far from the general case and to understand the set of all quantum field theories, one must first understand the (interacting!) conformal field theories.  This is quite a formidable task, but if we add the requirement of supersymmetry, then considerable progress can be made. With N=2 supersymmetry, a very large (though not exhaustive) subset of the N=2 superconformal field theories (SCFTs) are those of "Class-S". Professor Distler and his collaborators have greatly improved our understanding of these SCFTs. They have developed a systematic classification procedure, and used it to uncover a vast (essentially infinite) number of new N=2 SCFTs and, using the Class-S construction, they explored the quantum-mechanical dualities between these theories. Their results have yielded a wealth of information useful to those studying N=2 QFTs in general. ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
