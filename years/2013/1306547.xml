<AbstractNarration>This research program is centered on experiments addressing fundamental issues of nuclear physics. An experiment is being designed to search for a non-zero electric dipole moment of the neutron, whose possible existence is of fundamental interest and would significantly challenge the theoretical extensions of the Standard Model of elementary particle physics. Another experiment under analysis measured second order effects in electron-proton scattering to address a present puzzle on the proton structure data. And there are on-going experiments with cold neutrons measuring the strength of the weak interaction among quarks to be followed by precise new measurements of the parameters governing the neutron decay, which can have an important impact on our understanding of both nuclear physics and astrophysics. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed activities will produce new scientists at the Ph.D. level, will give research experience in fundamental physics to undergraduate students, will continue to produce partnerships within the field to develop new detector technologies, and will contribute to the ascent of a large state university as a premier research institution. The advancement of the careers of women and ethnic minorities is an integral part of this process. Furthermore, the demand for state-of-the-art equipment utilizes the ASU research support services and the technical workforce of the society at large.</AbstractNarration>
