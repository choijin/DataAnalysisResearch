<AbstractNarration>Proposal Title:   2009 Research Infrastructure Improvement&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution:   South Carolina Research Authority&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The South Carolina 2009 NSF EPSCoR RII proposal unites Claflin, Clemson, MUSC, SC State University, and USC and presents an integrated plan to implement a statewide vision that will give South Carolina a competitive edge in the field of biofabrication ?an emerging ?transforming? technology ? operationally defined as computer-aided, layer-by-layer deposition of biologically relevant material with the purpose of engineering functional 3D tissues and organs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Research Plan to engineer a 3D vascular tree is divided into five ?thrust? areas. Thrust I focuses on analysis of structural-functional properties of an authentic (natural) branched vascular tree. Thrust II focuses on directed differentiation of adult stem cells into monomer units of vascular cell types, specifically to induce stem cells isolated from fat tissue to enter a smooth muscle cell lineage. Thrust III requires functional biomechanical testing of engineered, sequential segments and comparison to naturally occurring (authentic) branched vascular trees. Thrust IV is biofabrication of a branched vascular tree; that is to create linear 3-D, hollow tubular segments representing branches that can be transformed into branched ?Y? or ?T? vascular units. Thrust V focuses on accelerated tissue maturation of bioprinted, branched vascular tubes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit. A major challenge in tissue engineering is the ability to maintain viability of large masses of cells or tissue constructs upon transfer from in vitro culture conditions to in vivo hosts. Most current efforts focus on rapid fabrication of solid scaffolds, or on 2D and 3D cell biopatterning. Less emphasis has been placed on applying the principles of developmental biology and the fundamental biological process of cell and tissue self-assembly. The proposed infrastructure enhancements are essential components for engineering branched, lumenized tubules that can be scaled up (industrialized) to assemble in the future a functional, branched vascular tree, addressing perhaps the greatest obstacle to successful engineering of tissue and organ replacements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. Proposed RII activities will lead to: (1) innovative partnerships for training a new workforce in an emerging high tech, high impact industry; (2) dissemination and public education regarding advances and breakthroughs at the interface of engineering, science, and computation; (3) academic-industrial collaborations in developing and improving prototype devices for bioprinting, bioreactors, and biomechanical quantitation; (4) a vanguard position in a new S&amp;T field that is truly global, unfettered by geographical, cultural and historic boundaries, with prime opportunities to attract underrepresented groups into a new field at the cusp of bioengineering, computation and biomedical science; and (5) opportunities for social sciences and other professional disciplines to evaluate and integrate ethical, legal, social and economic implications of ultimately implanting biofabricated replacement tissues and organs. These considerations highlight the importance of a highly science-literate, well informed press corps and public in order to understand and fairly represent multiple sides of complex issues.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The primary objectives of the 2009 NSF Research Infrastructure Improvement (RII) award (OIA-1317771) &ndash; to create a statewide transdisciplinary culture of innovation in tissue science and engineering research while producing a diverse group of graduates and trainees who will be creative innovators in an emerging tissue engineering industry -- have been achieved. Major outcomes include the recruitment of 29 new tenure-track assistant professors across seven different institutions. Faculty participants have secured &gt;$44M in non-EPSCoR/IDeA grants while generating 295 research publications. Of the 29 faculty members hired: 27 have been retained, 10 have completed 3rd year pre-tenure review, 3 received early promotion with tenure, and together they have secured &gt;$20M in non-EPSCoR/IDeA support. For the award, 2 utility patents and 1 continuation patent have been granted (US 8,409,603; 8,241,905; and 8,680,182), 1 continuation patent allowed (US 20130236431 A1) and one under review (US 20120288938 A1), and 12 inventions have been disclosed. Project investigators also established Synovidah, LLC, a woman-owned startup medical device and wound healing company that filed three patent disclosures in 2015: 1.) <em>Fibroblast endothelial cell constructs treated with S1P</em>, Inventors Yost, Drake, Czajka; 2.) <em>Biodegradable Bile Stent</em>, Inventors <em>Rodriguez-Rivera</em>, <em>Yost </em>and <em>Chavin</em>; and 3) <em>Smart Wound Healing Matrix</em>, Inventors <em>Yost, Fan, Rhett</em> and <em>Rodriguez</em>.</p> <p>The most significant outcome was progressive development of the printing technology (Figure 1) and biological materials (bioink) needed to construct, layer by layer, a prototype blood vessel 4-5 mm in diameter and 27-30 mm in length, anatomically similar to naturally occurring blood vessels (Figure 2). This and other scientific outcomes were published on <em>NSF's SEE Innovation</em> website (http://go.usa.gov/3kn9z). The intellectual merit of this work is that this represents the first demonstration that a blood vessel can be printed from living, 300 um spheroid-shaped, building blocks (Figure 3). This was achieved by <em>new</em> faculty members hired under the aegis of this project. The breakthrough is now facilitating the assembly of complex tissues not attainable with conventional tissue engineering approaches. Computational simulation of mechanisms of cellular and tissue component interactions underpinned the development of this new bioprinting technology. The simulation and modeling efforts were led by nine new interdisciplinary tenure-track hires made at the University of South Carolina (USC), and two non-tenure track hires having complementary computational expertise. A cluster-based hiring approach established a core of 3 faculty in applied biomathematics engaged in the project, of which the first 2 received early promotion with tenure (P&amp;T) and the third has successfully completed her third year review. All three have received independent non-EPSCoR NSF support totaling &gt;$10.1M (DMS-1318866, 1308948, 1019544, 1410047, 1620219 and 1620212). The third faculty member (hired at USC in 2013) will put forth her folder for early P&amp;T in 2017. An assistant professor hired into the Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy at USC in Year 1 has independently secured &gt;$3M in non-EPSCoR research funding for which he served as PI or Co-PI (AHA-10SDG4110005, NHLBI-R21HL106325, and R01HL106845; NCCAM/OD-R21AT006767; and NIH/PPG- P01AT003961). This faculty member was provided early P&amp;T during Year 4 of the award. Four junior faculty targeted by <em>Clemson University</em> garnered more than $2.5M in non-EPSCoR NSF support including one CAREER award (CBET-1254609).</p> <p>The NSF EPSCoR RII Track-1 program, when used as a new tenure-track hiring initiative, is shown to have a significant impact on diversity and broadening participation in the STEM professoriate through the engagement of a diverse set of institutions and disciplines. Of 29 faculty additions, five are African American, one is Hispanic, with expertise in genomics and cell biology (2), biomathematics (2), and materials chemistry (2). Faculty members were hired into two different HBCUs, one predominantly undergraduate institution, and a comprehensive research institution. Three of six women faculty hired under the award were additions to Departments of Computer Science (2) and Chemistry and Biochemistry (1), yielding a net outcome of 31% (9/29) in the recruitment of underrepresented minorities and individuals from underrepresented groups into tenure-track positions. Workforce development goals were focused on establishing new B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. programs. With the newly hired faculty: the Department of Mathematics at USC now offers new M.S. and Ph.D. tracks in applied and computational mathematics; USC at Beaufort established a new B.S. program in Computational Science; Clemson University established a new M.S. program in Biomedical Engineering; and USC developed a new Biomedical Technology track as part of the M.S. in Biomedical Science. A URM hire at Furman in materials science was instrumental in securing<em> </em>an NSF S-STEM proposal (DUE-1154413); while three faculty hired under the award secured an S-STEM at the University of South Carolina at Beaufort (DUE-1259283) to sustain their computational science program. A new hire acquired at Voorhees College during the award generated the first single investigator NSF support in institutional history<em> </em>(HRD-1238332).</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/29/2016<br>      Modified by: Prakash&nbsp;Nagarkatti</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1317771/1317771_10138296_1475089174520_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1317771/1317771_10138296_1475089174520_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1: South Carolina's Palmetto Printer"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1317771/1317771_10138296_1475089174520_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1: South Carolina's Palmetto Printer"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This bioprinter, named the Palmetto Printer, was developed by project personnel and used to create a viable blood vessel.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Roger Markwald, Medical University of South Carolina</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Prakash&nbsp;Nagarkatti</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1: South Carolina's Palmetto Printer</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1317771/1317771_10138296_1475089258460_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1317771/1317771_10138296_1475089258460_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2: 3-D Vascular Tube Construct"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1317771/1317771_10138296_1475089258460_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2: 3-D Vascular Tube Construct"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A viable, vascular tube with properties of natural blood vessels created by 3-D printing.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Roger Markwald, Medical University of South Carolina</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Prakash&nbsp;Nagarkatti</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2: 3-D Vascular Tube Construct</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1317771/1317771_10138296_1475089404114_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1317771/1317771_10138296_1475089404114_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3: Spheroidal Building Blocks of Vascular Tissues"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1317771/1317771_10138296_1475089404114_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3: Spheroidal Building Blocks of Vascular Tissues"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Different sizes of spheroids used as building blocks within the Palmetto Printer to create tissues.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Xuejun Wen, Clemson University</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Prakash&nbsp;Nagarkatti</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3: Spheroidal Building Blocks of Vascular Tissues</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
