<AbstractNarration>The proposed work will address the advanced analysis, full integration, and careful interpretation of space-geodetic and seismic data over the central creeping section of the San Andreas. To this end, three time series of the surface deformation, using C-Band, L-Band and X-band SAR data and spanning period 1992-2013, will be generated. The SAR images are acquired by ERS1, 2, Envisat and ALOS and Cosmo-SkyMed satellites, which will be jointly explored with a dense network of GPS data and catalogue of repeating earthquakes, through a time-dependent inverse modeling scheme. This modeling scheme allows resolving the 4-dimensional distribution of slip in the upper crust. It also enables us to conduct a systematic and detailed study of the spatial and temporal association of the aseismic slip pulses and events. This project, in particular, is focused on exploring the nature of interactions between seismic and aseismic deformation processes that occur in the fault zone and characterizing the kinematic models of creep pulses along the Central San Andreas Fault (CSAF). Characteristic repeating earthquakes will provide unique information on transient activity in the Earth?s crust. Fault slip is tied to the mechanical properties of the fault zone rocks and adjoining crustal blocks and the proposed activity can also evaluate the first order changes of crustal properties. The time-dependent kinematic model of transient slip will also allow investigating the possible relationships between long-term, and short-term transient behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An improved understanding of the spatially and temporally varying deformation field of fault zones to great depth is critically important for understanding active tectonics, fault-fault interaction and the occurrence of large earthquakes. To this end the results from this NSF funded project will allow us to assess the role of aseismic fault slip transients in earthquake occurrence and clustering. We anticipate long-term societal benefits from improved understanding of aseismic slip transients, their relation to regional strain anomalies, and improved models of the earthquake cycle that should improve earthquake forecasts and intermediate to longer-term predictions. This project will also provide partial support for an early-career scientist as well as valuable research experience for two graduate students who are planned to directly involve in this project. The issues and results obtained from this research project will be incorporated in undergraduate and graduate teachings. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Fault creep, a mechanism through which the accumulated strain on the fault is released aseismically is a prominent factor in earthquake cycle. Spatial distribution of creep is used to pinpoint the location of locked asperities, which are susceptible to rupture in large earthquakes. Moreover, assuming a nearly-constant and continuous creep in time, one can estimate the slip deficit and determine the fault&rsquo;s seismic potential. Time-dependent observation of the kinematics of creeping segments, on the other hand, indicates that creep evolves as a series of transient accelerating events during the interseismic period. These transient events, known as Slow Slip Events (SSE), can load surrounding locked patches and possibly trigger seismic events. Central San Andreas Fault (CSAF), a 140 km fault segment bounded by Parkfield to the southeast and San Juan Bautista to the northwest, is recognized as an aseismically creeping fault segment with average creep rates reaching more than 30 mm/yr. The average rate of creep declines moving toward the bounding transition zones, ultimately reaching to near-zero on the surrounding locked segments, which were ruptured during the 1857 Fort Tejon and 1906 San Francisco Mw7.9 earthquakes. In this project, we used the time-dependent geodetic observation of surface deformation and fault kinematic model during 1992-2011, as well as creep measurements obtained from characteristically repeating earthquakes (CRE) during 1984-2000 and show that creeping behavior of CSAF consists of cyclic occurrence of SSEs and subsequent near-zero rate episodes. We further explore the multiscale characteristics, and statistical properties of the fault creep history along the CSAF for the period 1992-2010.&nbsp; Our study is the first to use observations from advanced multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data to detect slip &ldquo;pulsing&rdquo; on the CSAF, confirmed using continuous GPS sites of the Plate Boundary Observatory. The associated high-resolution time-dependent model of creep allowed us to estimate an annual rate of slip deficit accumulation equivalent to a magnitude 5.6&ndash;5.7 earthquake. We found that at the decadal time scale, creep acceleration characterized some parts of the fault, imparting stress on the neighboring decelerating and locked zones. We showed that a similar decadal-scale acceleration preceded the 2004 Mw 6 Parkfield earthquake on the adjacent creeping segment. We further showed that the rate of creep additionally varies on shorter (<em>&lt;</em>two years) timescales. Our observation suggested that in a short time scale, the fault is mostly creeping at rates below that required by long-term tectonic shear, interrupted by episodes of avalanche-type fast creep. We suggested that pressure changes of fluid trapped between the grains of fault zone material are causing the observed creep rate changes.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/01/2018<br>      Modified by: Manoochehr&nbsp;Shirzaei</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1357079/1357079_10298722_1533134935449_figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1357079/1357079_10298722_1533134935449_figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Central San Andreas Fault"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1357079/1357079_10298722_1533134935449_figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Central San Andreas Fault"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The central San Andreas Fault (green) is flanked by sections (red) that are far more active.</div> <div class="imageCredit">M.
