<AbstractNarration>Femtocells are capable of providing wireless broadband access coverage in cellular weak zones and indoor environments; they do this by improving link quality and enabling spectral reuse. A femtocell access point (FAP) is a low-power, low-cost, short-range, plug-and-play, cellular base station typically deployed in residential area or small office. Femtocells not only provide better quality of service to indoor users, but also reduce maintenance cost and power consumption of base stations. Consequently, they are attractive to many classes of users. The goal of this project is to develop a technology-disposition plan, addressing value proposition of the wireless capacity improvement technology, the products' customer base and emand, revenue model, partnership strategy and resource requirement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project may impact the nation's wireless industries. All the wireless carriers need technologies that can increase spectrum utilization and reduce interference thereby enabling them to enhance network performance (support more users) without increasing cost. This project is an attempt at meeting this need. In addition to serving wireless carriers, this technology may also have broader impacts on organizations that use wireless networks, such as enterprise, entertainment, healthcare and transportations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Award Title: I-Corps: Commercialization Feasibility Research and Demonstration Preparation for Increasing Cognitive Femtocell Network Capacity  Entrepreneurial Lead: Longfei Wu, Ph.D. student, Temple University Mentor: Andrew Maxwell, Innovation and Entrepreneurship Institute, Temple University PI: Xiaojiang Du, Associate Professor, Dept. of Computer and Info. Sciences, Temple University      In this I-Corps project, our goal is to conduct commercialization feasibility research and demonstration preparation for increasing the throughput/capacity of femtocells networks. During the I-Corps workshop and training, the team, including the entrepreneur lead Longfei Wu, the PI Xiaojiang Du and the mentor Andrew Maxwell conducted 102 interviews to identify customer segments, value proposition, key resources, key activities, key partners, cost structure, channels, and customer relationships for our technologies. We have interviewed most of the major wireless carriers (including AT&amp;T, Verizon, and Sprint) and femtocell manufacturers (such as Alcatel-Lucent, Samsung, Ericsson, QualComm, NEC, Airvana, Fujtsu, Texas Instruments, and ip access).     Based on the interview feedbacks, we have been revising our technology and developing new technology. Specifically, we developed an efficient resource allocation scheme for OFDMA networks (including femtocells networks). Combined with the previous technology, our solution can increase the femtocell throughput up to 110%. The wireless carriers were very interested in the improved technology, and we are working to move to the next step.     Intellectual Merit: In this project, we have developed four novel technologies for wireless cellular networks, which can significantly improve network performance:    (1) A scheme to align spectrum holes of multiple macrocell users and hence reduce the total size of spectrum holes.  (2) Femtocell BSs identify spectrum opportunities by combining two technologies: listening to scheduled information from Macrocell BSs and sensing the spectrum of nearby area.  (3) A one-to-one matching policy based on the Gale-Shapley theorem, which can avoid collisions among multiple femtocell users; and  (4) An efficient OFDMA resource allocation scheme that considers both  the transmitter and receiver energy consumption, as well as the time slot, sub-carrier (frequency) and power allocation policies.  Broader Impacts: The developed technologies not only can be used in femtocell networks, but also in other wireless networks, such as small cell networks, and macro cell networks. The line of work has good impact on the research and development of wireless networks and systems.     This project provides the PI and several students the training and development opportunity on technology commercialization and entrepreneurship. Two undergraduate students (include a female student) were trained on both research experience and technology commercialization.
