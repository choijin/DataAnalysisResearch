<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop a new type of microscope and interferometer that&lt;br/&gt;uses the hydrogen Lyman-alpha (HLA) line at 121.6nm as the source wavelength. This&lt;br/&gt;wavelength is convenient, because it is short enough to provide transverse resolution&lt;br/&gt;improvement of 5X above visible light microscopes and, although it is in the vacuum ultraviolet&lt;br/&gt;(VUV) portion of the electromagnetic spectrum, it has an atmospheric transmission window of&lt;br/&gt;up to several centimeters in dry air. Therefore, samples do not need to be in vacuum. Subnanometer&lt;br/&gt;vertical resolution is expected from the interferometer configuration. The intellectual&lt;br/&gt;merit is a first demonstration of imaging and interferometry at the HLA wavelength for a variety&lt;br/&gt;of objects, like graphene, silicon nanophotonic circuits and metamaterial structures. Potential of&lt;br/&gt;this technology will be investigated with advanced optical designs, and an attempt will be made&lt;br/&gt;to measure auto-fluorescence of biological structures, like electrospun fibrinogen fibers. The&lt;br/&gt;broader impacts of this technology are numerous, where the instrument transforms the range of&lt;br/&gt;practical optical microscopy into the VUV. Many researchers are now studying nano-devices&lt;br/&gt;and structures, and evolution of this instrument will enable characterization on this scale, which&lt;br/&gt;is between optical microscopy and electron microscopes or atomic-force microscopes. As the&lt;br/&gt;source technology improves, this system could enable sub-nanometer transverse resolution by&lt;br/&gt;application of stimulated emission-depletion ideas for fluorophore-tagged proteins in biological&lt;br/&gt;membrane samples. With respect to commercial interests, this technology provides a potentially&lt;br/&gt;useful tool for inspection of wafers and masks in the semiconductor industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was directed at the first demonstration of imaging using the very short wavelength (121.6 nm) of a hydrogen Lyman alpha (HLA) light source in a classical microscope system.  A primary advantage of the high-resolution HLA microscope system is that objects in air can be imaged in a wavelength range that normally must be used in vacuum, like with a scanning electron microscope.  Due to the narrow bandwidth of the HLA emission line, it was also intended to demonstrate the first interferometer working at HLA, where feature height resolution four to five times smaller than what can be achieved with visible wavelengths is possible. Unfortunately, the greatest difficulty in producing research results was successful operation of a bright HLA light source.  Since the custom light source that was purchased used a mixture of neon and hydrogen, the gas was prohibitively expensive.  A great amount of effort went into development of a helium-hydrogen gas mixture that would work with the lamp, and success was achieved toward the end of the project.  This light source is, in itself, an accomplishment that could have a positive effect on science using this wavelength.  In parallel to the light source development, a custom objective lens was fabricated using state-of-the-art diamond turning in a soft aluminum alloy.  Although the surface micro-finish was sufficiently smooth, the macro-scale surface figure of the mirrors was not adequate for imaging at the HLA wavelength.  A corrector plate was designed and evaluated, and through analysis it was determined that fabrication of the corrector surface would produce low image contrast due to light scattering.  The light scattering problem is common to elements of this type and with diffractive elements.  However, our analysis shows insight into the causes of this characteristic in terms of mid-spatial-frequency phase error.  This realization could have a significant impact on the design and fabrication of diffractive optical elements.  Although a functioning microscope was not demonstrated, many engineering problems associated with its development were solved.  In addition, there was not time to demonstrate the HLA interferometer.        Last Modified: 12/29/2016       Submitted by: Tom D Milster]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
