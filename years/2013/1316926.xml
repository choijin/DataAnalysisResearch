<AbstractNarration>This action funds Cory James Kleinheksel of Iowa State University to conduct a research project in the Computer and Information Science and Engineering area during the summer of 2013 at Seoul National University in Seoul, Korea.  The project title is Bioinformatics Big Data Workflow Processing on Heterogeneous Computing Resources. The host scientist is Dr. Sun Kim.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bioinformatics data is exponentially growing and is one of the dominant big data fields.  Many researchers in the field create tools and techniques to process such data.  It is common for one tool or technique to feed results into another tool forming a workflow.  This research focuses on the challenging optimization problem to target workflow tasks to the optimal available heterogeneous computing resources.  This requires consideration for management of data movement and computation planning to effectively utilize resources even during communication.  Bioinformatics is just one of many big data problems, but arguably health is certainly a very important and challenging problem facing scientists today.  Research like this helps bioinformatics computations keep swimming where they are currently facing the possibility of drowning in data as DNA big data becomes cheaper to acquire.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  Bioinformatics data is growing exponentially.  This is enabling personalized healthcare down to our genetic makeup, but the complex computations can be a bottleneck holding back progress and the improvements to world health.  Research like this is contributing to making this a reality.  Computation processes that used to require hours or days are being reduced to minutes or seconds.  Things that used to require large machines; now smaller ones.  This is accomplished by using state of art distributed computing, cloud computing, and modern computation frameworks to take advantage of commodity resources available to us at low cost.    Analyzing key algorithms revealed opportunities to reorganize bioinformatics data storage and consequently streamlining data accesses.  This may allow unnecessary computations to be avoided and data processing to occur at the speed of access rates.  This can enable some problems to run on smaller machines that once required larger machines.  This research also looked at healthcare privacy and preserving health privacy during each of the computation steps through the use of local computations or encryption on the cloud.  Privacy will be a critical component to wide adoption of these impactful personalized health improvements.  Genetic codes define our makeup and often many of our traits are private and cannot be determined simply through casual observation.  If this makeup were to be divulged it may influence work, school, insurance, and many other aspects of our lives, making privacy during computation a critical component.  Broader Impact:  The EAPSI program introduced society, culture, and language through organized orientation programs.  During this time the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of South Korea was shared.  Working alongside a team of 20 researchers at Seoul National University provided additional opportunities to share American Culture and learn Korean Culture.  This included the research environment, sharing meals together, and language exchange.  Weekend travel enabled further cultural immersion through activities throughout the country.
