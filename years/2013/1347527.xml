<AbstractNarration>This mixed methods research project investigates the puzzling problem of variations in student learning gains that are observed at different institutions of higher education when implementing the same research-based instructional method in highly interactive classrooms. The study investigates model implementations of algebra-based studio physics to identify and analyze the critical features of this instructional method.  The study is guided by the following questions.  Research Question1: How is algebra-based studio physics implemented at a variety of institutions and for what types of students?  Research Question2: Why are departments implementing algebra-based studio physics in those ways?  Research Question3: What factors are associated with student outcomes that indicate student learning gains? Algebra-based studio physics comprise the physics experience for many students who enroll in introductory physics courses.  However, this approach to teaching physics remains understudied relative to calculus-based studio physics. Therefore, the research takes advantage of a unique opportunity to examine student learning gains.  The study examines how different types of students respond to interactive teaching strategies in model implementations of this instructional method to teach physics and how institutional types influence teaching and learning. Three initial institutions serve as the basis for Phase 1 of this multi-phase study. One of the institutions has reported high student learning gains in the algebra-based studio physics courses.  The other two institutions have observed low student learning gains. Phase 1 is designed to establish baseline measures for the research.  During Phase 2 the research team is examining a total of twelve additional institutions that utilize algebra-based studio physics.  The twelve institutions represent a range of those in the U.S. implementing this approach. Institutions that are included in Phase 2 provide settings in which the research team tests emergent hypotheses and the robustness of findings from Phase 1. Specifically, the project is investigating (a) characteristics of model implementations of algebra-based studio physics by faculty at different institutions and (b) the characteristics of students engaged in these types of courses, to investigate and explain the observed variations in student learning gains.  Research methods include classroom observations, interviews, surveys, and student outcomes assessments.</AbstractNarration>

To clarify this problem, we analyzed critical features of studio physics implementations to determine what works and what does not.  Research questions include:  1)  How is studio physics implemented at various institutions?  2)  Why are departments/ instructors implementing it that way?  3)  What factors are associated with better learning outcomes for students?  This was a collaborative effort among three institutions:  George Washington University (GW), Georgia State University (GSU), and University of Central Florida (UCF).

Initially, we developed an observational protocol to categorize the actions taking place in an active-learning classroom.  Starting with the Teaching Dimensions Observation Protocol (TDOP, University of Wisconsin), we made significant modifications, yielding an "improved" scheme better suited to data-taking in studio physics classrooms.  Our redesigned protocol was named Studio Classroom Observation Utility (SCOUT).  This protocol was tested by first using classroom videos and in-class observations at our own institutions, and then performing field tests through site visits at GW, GSU and UCF.

We acquired an extensive data set for 11 institutions (three collaborating partners, plus eight external) covering large universities to liberal-arts and two-year colleges.  Next, we identified salient features of our multi-dimensional data for detailed analysis.  Conclusions from instructor interviews related to instructor-specific implementations of SCALE-UP and variations from the "model" deployment.  Some instructors added classroom lecture time to address the concern that students were unprepared for class activities.  Instructors also altered guidelines for forming/changing student groups and enforcing group dynamics.  Sometimes instructors allowed students to form their own groups, and reconfiguring groups at mid-semester was not always accomplished.  Management of TA's or Learning Assistants (LA's) was also not consistent.  The recommended weekly TA/LA meeting with the instructor was not always scheduled on a regular basis, if at all.  This results in compromising the smooth operation and uniform monitoring of the active-learning classroom, leading to poor student interactions.   Results from observations using SCOUT were more objective; here we also found differences between classrooms and instructors at our external sites.  While extensive lecturing was generally not observed, the time dedicated to small group work was inconsistent.  Instructors typically addressed the whole class by way of interactive feedback, rather than lecturing.  Having students report their solutions or pose their own questions was often less than desired for a collaborative classroom.   Surprisingly, we discovered that variations between classes within one institution were often greater than classes at different institutions.  One might expect an institutional "standard" delivery of SCALE-UP, where this "standard" varies by institution.  However, we found wide variations within institutions themselves.  Future work could be directed towards professional development to establish more uniformity among SCALE-UP classes at a given institution.    An unanticipated opportunity arose when PI Feldman was invited for a sabbatical at ETH Zurich (Switzerland) to implement an introductory SCALE-UP physics class.  The research question: can an experienced instructor with successful SCALE-UP teaching in one environment (GW) transfer that success to a different environment and student population.  The experiment involved 50 students in SCALE-UP and a parallel lecture section of 320 students with an ETH professor.  Identical assessments, conceptual surveys, and student feedback questionnaires were given to both sections, facilitating direct comparisons of the academic experience and outcomes.  In this experiment, two major variables were completely controlled -- the instructor and the technique were consistent with the same classes at GW.  The remaining variables were the students’ academic preparation and their attitudes towards a novel active-learning environment.  The results were especially interesting, in view of the traditional European system of education in general, and in Switzerland specifically.  The SCALE-UP class scored higher in the mid-term exam given to both sections, as well as in the pre/post-test gain for the Force Concept Inventory.
