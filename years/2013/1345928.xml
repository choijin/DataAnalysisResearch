<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will test the efficacy of high-volume scaled microorganisms with the ability to induce cementation for masonry applications using methods proven at laboratory scale. Sporosarcina Pasteurii, a common non-pathogenic soil bacterium, has the ability to induce the creation of a biocement material, fusing loose grains of aggregate. Mineral growth fills gaps between the aggregate grains, biocementing the particles together in a structural bond, a process that takes a few days or less. The resulting material has a composition and demonstrates physical properties similar to natural sandstone. Traditional masonry manufacturing is reliant upon expensive fuel sources for hardening the final product, and these represent a large percentage of total manufacturing costs.  Biocementation at ambient conditions as a method for binding material into masonry units allows a cost advantage by eliminating the need for firing the final product.  The objectives of this effort include an extension of the baseline fermentation process for microorganism scale-up, testing of the efficacy of cell recovery, and efficiacy testing of the full-scale masonry product.  This research will also focus on testing the process efficacy with inexpensive industrial media in conjunction with high-volume fermentation and recovery practices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the demonstration of the commercial viability of an optimized production process for masonry units (bricks) based on biocementation.   Over 80% of global construction uses masonry. Masonry manufacturing is a $24 billion business in the US. According to the Carbon War Room, 1.23 trillion fired bricks are manufactured globally each year, emitting over 800 million tons of carbon emissions.  Due to increased regulations introduced by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), several masonry companies have had to either shut down or invest significant sums in cleaner production methods due to these associated emissions. Government incentives for green construction, compounded with increasing sustainability concerns - for example, end users such as architects, are specifying the use of more sustainable materials - have created an opportunity for the adoption of "greener" cementitious materials. The societal impacts of this research will include a significant reduction of carbon emissions and the addition of manufacturing jobs in the US. Biocementation has also been investigated for use in soil stabilization and mine recovery. This project will enhance the technological understanding of this process, will help to establish commercial viability, and will generate additional practical data including durability and physical performance.</AbstractNarration>

The research carried out in this process included optimization of the costs associated with the feedstocks for biomass production at BTEC (Biomanufacturing Training Education Center) and the viability of those fermentations on the biocement manufacturing process at bioMASON. Throughout the Phase I grant, bioMASON and BTEC worked to optimize the organism in scaled fermentation to test with current prototype production processes, in both small batch and masonry scales.     In the SBIR Phase 1, objectives included optimization of large batch fermentation process using industrial grade feedstockÆs, biomass recovery, and efficacy testing of the produced biomass for use biocements at laboratory scale. Additional funding was requested and awarded as "Phase 1b" to test the efficacy of regional nutrient feedstockÆs for the biocementation process in field use in combination with the nutrient supply chains in biomass production. BioMASON seeks to source supply chains in near proximity to masonry production. Lower cost industrial and food grade nutrient sources were explored in the SBIR Phase 1 for biomass fermentation; and Phase 1b tested the field use application of  feed grade and recovered nutrients during biocement masonry manufacturing.
