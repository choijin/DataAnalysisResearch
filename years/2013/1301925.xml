<AbstractNarration>Assessing the degree to which geological hazards in the Aleutian archipelago disrupted prehistoric human and ecological systems has important lessons for current inhabitants of the northern Pacific Rim. The Islands of Four Mountains region embodies environmental instabilities that, in the last 10,000 years, include changing subarctic climate, volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, tsunamis, and sea level fluctuations. Compared to adjacent regions to the east and west, strong ocean currents and smaller island size magnify ecologically-driven resource extremes, perhaps creating a physical bottleneck and the cultural boundary that persisted into the early 20th century.  These islands provide an excellent opportunity to assess the development of prehistoric human adaptations to geological hazards and environmental change. That such research has not already occurred is understandable. The same volcanic activity, precipitous coastlines, high winds, and strong riptides that may have posed profound risks to prehistoric individuals hinder modern research expeditions. The Four Mountain prehistoric sites are little studied but are highly significant in light of new geologic data indicating volcanic activity during human migration and societal development in the Aleutian archipelago. A team of professional and student archaeologists, geologists, ecologists, and zoologists will conduct a comprehensive, interdisciplinary three-year investigation in the Islands of the Four Mountains.  Extensive new radiocarbon, geological, paleoenvironmental, and cultural data expected from these sites will yield novel insights into the record of geological hazards, human coping mechanisms, changing subsistence, and adaptations during the prehistoric and European contact periods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Islands of the Four Mountains are located in an ecologically and economically important region of the world - the north Pacific and Bering Sea. People on two continents rely on fish from its marine ecosystem, and, given the sensitivity of airplanes to volcanic ash and of coastal cities to tsunamis, its geologic hazards potentially affect all nations of the northern Pacific Rim. Comprehensive research on long-term human-environmental interactions in the Bering Sea region, set against a backdrop of accelerated global change, is vital to understanding the dynamics of Aleutian biological and human systems and effectively addressing the social, political, and economic issues that arise from changes in those system dynamics today. The island group lies in a zone of high catastrophic potential in that one of its volcanoes, Mt. Cleveland, has erupted explosively more than 20 times in the last decade (as recently as May 2013) and during the time of prehistoric human habitation. The Aleutian plate boundary is the site of four earthquakes having a magnitude greater than 8 and dozens with magnitudes greater than 7, and these have generated tsunamis historically and prehistorically. Through partnerships with the Alaska Volcano Observatory, the Aleut Corporation, Museum of the Aleutians, and the Keck Geology Consortium this project will bring scientists, Native Americans, students and policy makers together in education and collaboration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ My students, colleagues and I sought to (1) "[assess] the degree to which geological hazards in the Aleutian archipelago disrupted prehistoric human and ecological systems" and (2) to examine what types of rocks the prehistoric Aleutian peoples (Unangax) used for tools and what distances separated the possible quarry sites from the abandoned villages where our team found the tools. Our work multiplied the project funding to achieve project outcomes, scientific collaborations, and training for students far beyond what was originally anticipated.  Expanding scientific collaboration and monitoring volcanoes for public safety  We pioneered an extremely successful collaboration with the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to collect data about how frequently IFM volcanoes erupted in the last ~10,000 years, including the time of prehistoric occupation, and to interpret what the data mean for the eruption frequency of IFM volcanoes today.  Training the next generation of geoscientists in interdisciplinary work  Our senior scientists provided vital interdisciplinary research training to nine undergraduates &mdash;five women and four men&mdash;who are entering graduate school in science, architecture, and medicine.  Building senior STEM leadership at Whitman College  Associate Professor Nicolaysen?s experience with this project strengthens her application for promotion to full professor, which would increase the gender diversity of senior science faculty at Whitman, where only two women now serve at that level.  RESULTS OF SPECIFIC STUDIES:  New understanding of the volcanoes of the Islands of Four Mountains  The geology team provided the first evaluation of the eruptive histories of the volcanoes Herbert, Carlisle, Cleveland (Chuginadak), and Tana. We discovered that volcanic ashes interrupted habitation of prehistoric, indigenous villages and that Tana and Herbert volcanoes are still steaming. This result led the USGS and AVO to consider reclassifying their potential for future eruptive activity.  What does a glacier on Tana volcano tell us about climate change in the last 4,000 years?  In 2015, we examined how water, gravity, glaciers, and other processes changed the surface landscape of the Islands of Four Mountains. Our results suggest that several advances and retreats of Tana glacier occurred during the last 3,700 years when Unangax inhabited the Islands of Four Mountains.  Prehistoric tools of the Unangax    During the field research, the archeology and geology teams found that local, prehistoric people used lava, jasper, low quality opal, and obsidian (volcanic glass) for tools. Our chemical analyses led us to conclude that with a few exceptions the Unangax used a single obsidian resource for ~3700 years, that the primary obsidian is similar to local IFM lavas, and that obsidian from distant islands show significant differences to IFM tools. We are finishing our evaluation of the four, local, volcanic glass candidates in comparison to flakes from the sites by using two additional analytical techniques.   Identifying hidden volcanic ashes and landslides in the village sites   Student Loopesko used grain size analysis data and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) data from two villages to investigate whether debris flows (watery flood and landslide deposits) and small volcanic eruptions may have interrupted village occupations. She discovered clear indications of volcanic ash layers and cryptic (hidden) signals of human occupation like obsidian micro-flakes and bone fragments too small to be seen by the eye.  Identifying chemical signals of human occupation in village sites  The subsurface water that moves through the sediments of ancient Aleutians villages is rather acidic and eventually dissolves bone and shells from discarded Unangan food rubbish. Student Deacon and I hypothesized that dissolved bones and shells may leave a lasting but invisible record of human activity. Unusual levels of the chemical elements calcium, phosphorus, nitrogen, and carbon were detected in layers both below and from the floors and fill of pit houses in the IFM villages.
