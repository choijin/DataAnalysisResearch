<AbstractNarration>This project will focus on a community-based approach to providing middle and high school students living in low-income public housing with opportunities to learn about STEM higher education and STEM careers and to develop interests, identities, and skills to pursue STEM higher education and workforce opportunities. The University of Washington 3DL Partnership, a collaboration between the College of Education and School of Social Work, together with the University of Washington Undergraduate Academic Affairs' Dream Project will partner on this effort with Neighborhood House a community organization that has served Seattle and King County?s low-income, immigrant and refugee communities since 1906.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Building on a robust, existing program, Youth Empowered with Leadership Strength (YELS), new YELS STEM programming will take place in two cohorts - a middle school cohort and a high school cohort.  Each cohort will experience 120 hours of programming time, which includes mentoring through the University of Washington Dream Project, a Making and Tinkering Studio, and exposure to a multicultural STEM curriculum designed to increase awareness of the role of people of color in the STEM workforce.  A formative assessment will explore the strengths and weaknesses of the program on a yearly basis in order to modify and improve it on the ground.  A summative evaluation component will study the effects of STEM enhancements on youths? knowledge of STEM careers and higher education opportunities, interests and motivation to pursue STEM learning, and identification with STEM disciplines. Embedding this project in a wrap-around community organization with a long history of serving community needs will ensure long-term sustainability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activities use innovative programming methods to increase opportunities in STEM learning for underserved youths of color. These methods will be widely disseminated locally, nationally, and internationally through practice, research and policy channels to provide knowledge for similarly planned efforts in other settings.  This study will involve 116 youths in intensive YELS STEM programs and will build understanding of STEM learning and STEM careers within the community through Neighborhood House public events.  Findings from this study will help develop programs to increase the diversity of the STEM workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of Washington (UW) and Neighborhood House (NH) created the STUDIO: Build Our World program to provide 125 low income, immigrant, and refugee middle and high school students with engaging experiential STEM activities to build interest, motivation, and identification with STEM, offer positive STEM role models, and provide access to information about STEM higher education and exposure to STEM careers.  Three cohorts of youth participated in the year long program. Findings from our project indicate that: STUDIO helped youth learn about STEM higher education and STEM careers. &middot;       STUDIO participants increased their knowledge about STEM careers and career pathways after participating in the program. Results indicate that youth made gains in their knowledge of STEM careers and educational pathways after participating in STUDIO.  Focus groups with youth and observations of the program also indicate youth learned about STEM higher education and career options, especially through informal conversations with the UW mentors. &middot;       Survey results indicate STUDIO participants said their conceptions of engineering became richer and more complex because of what they learned in the program. Participants enjoyed the STUDIO program and found it to be an engaging way to learn about STEM. &middot;       Youth from all three cohorts overwhelmingly said they enjoyed coming to STUDIO. The vast majority of youth (more than 90% each year) gave STUDIO a grade of "A" or "B." &middot;       STUDIO?s hands-on, project-based pedagogy effectively engaged youth and made learning about STEM fun. Youth said they found the activities interesting and did things in STUDIO they didn?t get to do anywhere else. &middot;       Participants said the Neighborhood House staff and UW mentors were caring and supportive. The adults who ran STUDIO were key to the program?s ability to attract and retain youth. STUDIO helped participants see themselves as STEM learners. &middot;       Evaluation results suggest that STUDIO helped many participants see themselves as STEM learners who were "good" at STEM.  &middot;       As the program matured, STUDIO appeared to have a greater impact on participating youth?s STEM-related identities. Each successive cohort of STUDIO participants reported larger increases in their confidence in science, technology, engineering, and math. By Year 3, 96% of participants agreed that STUDIO helped them see they are good at engineering, science, and technology, and 87% agreed that STUDIO helped them see they are good at math. &middot;       The majority of STUDIO youth believed they could succeed as a STEM professional if they wished. Almost all the youth who participated in focus groups said they thought that if they wanted to, they could become a scientist, be an engineer, or work in technology. More work is needed to better understand and measure low income, immigrant, and refugee youths interest in STEM and in pursuing STEM educational pathways and careers. &middot;       STUDIO participants? survey responses suggest that the majority of youth were already moderately interested in engineering and science prior to participating in the program, and most remained equally interested after participation in STUDIO. &middot;       On the pre-survey, the vast majority of STUDIO participants from all three cohorts already perceived STEM careers as being "good" jobs to have, leaving little room for improvement in their perceptions of STEM careers following participation in the program. &middot;       Post-surveys included questions where youth were instructed to think back and indicate what their attitudes toward STEM careers had been before they began participating in STUDIO. Results from these questions and the "traditional" pre-survey questions which were administered shortly after STUDIO started were inconsistent. Comparison of the fall pre-survey results to post-survey results suggests that youth became less interested in science, technology, and engineering careers after participating in the program, while the questions that asked youth to think back to the beginning of the program suggest that STUDIO participants became more interested in having careers in these areas. More research is needed to identify effective and reliable strategies for measuring changes in youths? career interests. In summary, this unique partnership between a university and community-based organization successfully engaged middle and high school youth in programming that helped them learn about STEM education and career pathways, and to see themselves as STEM learners. More research is needed on this population to identify or create more effective strategies to measure youths? STEM career interests.
