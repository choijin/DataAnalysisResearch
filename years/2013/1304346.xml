<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests support for an integrated geophysical study of the crust and upper mantle of Greenland. The study aims to characterize the seismic velocity structure of Greenland's crust and upper mantle in three dimensions; and to integrate these results with gravity and heat-flow data, laboratory estimates of material properties, and petrological data to map variations in temperature, composition, and heat flux. The project would make use of seismic data from the NSF- and internationally funded GLISN seismic network, supplemented by targeted collection of data at a limited number of temporary PASSCAL stations. The proposed research will lead to a greatly improved understanding of the crust and mantle structure of Greenland, the way this structure has evolved with time, and its influence on modern-day geophysical processes in the cryosphere and solid Earth. The results of this study will provide important inputs for ice-sheet models and models of glacial isostatic adjustment. The accuracy of both types of models is critical for accurate predictions of sea-level rise. The findings of this study will be relevant for understanding continental assembly and preservation worldwide. The seismological models derived in this project will also allow improved estimates of source parameters for tectonic and glacial earthquakes. Raw data and derived data products will be publicly available through the IRIS and UNAVCO archives. The educational materials produced through this project will be available for general use, and project outreach efforts will support U.S.-Greenland partnership in education. The project will train one graduate student and 2 to 3 undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>
