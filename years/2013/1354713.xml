<AbstractNarration>In all birds, reproduction (ability of the ovary to produce eggs) is dependent upon the initial development of a group of small, undifferentiated ovarian follicles. It is from this cohort that a single follicle is selected, often on a daily basis, to initiate growth prior to ovulation. The novel concept tested is that follicle selection, followed immediately by rapid growth and final differentiation, is dependent upon the acquisition of Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) receptor responsiveness. Initial studies using the domestic hen as the primary research model will establish the cellular mechanisms that prevent receptor signaling and maintain follicles in an undifferentiated state prior to follicle selection. One objective of the project is to test the hypothesis that ovarian follicle selection in birds represents a process in which a single undifferentiated follicle per day escapes inhibitory mechanisms and begins rapid growth and final maturation prior to ovulation. A second objective will focus on cellular mechanisms that regulate follicle growth and differentiation immediately subsequent to selection, including the initiation and entrainment of circadian rhythms within the ovary. The data generated from these studies are expected to: 1) enable initial predictions about mechanisms regulating follicle selection in non-avian vertebrates (e.g., reptiles and mammalian species); 2) describe cellular mechanisms that determine a bird's reproductive potential, and possibly identify mechanisms that enable multiple ovulations in mammals (including fraternal twins in humans); and 3) have practical implications to enhancing fecundity in both threatened/endangered species and food-producing animals. Research results will be regularly presented at professional society meetings, and all completed studies will be published in high quality research journals in a timely fashion. The funding provided will support both undergraduate and graduate student research projects. The Principal Investigator actively recruits and encourages the participation of women and students from underrepresented populations.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Studies conducted within this proposal investigated the cellular process of ovarian follicle selection (recruitment) and the subsequent final maturation of a preovulatory follicle in the reproductively active avian (chicken and turkey) ovary. Specifically, we studied the process by which a single immature, slow-growing ovarian follicle initiates final differentiation and enters the rapid growth phase prior to ovulation&nbsp;each ovulatory cycle. To date, the most proximal cellular process that mediates follicle recruitment remains undefined in both birds and mammals. An important outcome of the present studies is the determination that a major difference exists between mammals and birds regarding the ability of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) to initiate cell signaling within the follicle graulosa cell (GC) layer at the time of recruitment. Specifically, recruitment and initiation of rapid growth of the dominant follicle in monovulatory mammals (primates, cattle, horses) occurs in the single follicle with the greatest FSH-responsiveness in the face of declining concentrations of FSH avaiiable to the ovary. By contrast, results from both the chicken (Johnson and Lee, 2016) and turkey (Ghanem and Johnson, 2018) ovary have established that follicle recruitment and rapid growth occurs in a single immature (prehierarchal) follicle only following the initial capacity of the GC layer to initiate receptor-mediated signaling via cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Both the FSH receptor (FSHR) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) receptors (VPAC1, VPAC2) are members of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family that signal via cAMP.&nbsp;Evidence is provided that follicle recruitment in both the chicken and turkey ovary occurs only following the loss/removal of inhibitory signaling via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and/or protein kinase C (PKC) specifically within the GC layer. Consequently, GC from prehierarchal follicles remain in an undifferentiated state and have virtually no capacity for steroidogenesis due to a deficiency of cAMP-dependent STAR protein and <em>CYP11A1</em> gene expression. Subsequent studies focused on the cellular mechanism that precludes (desensitizes) agonist-induced FSHR and VPAC cell signaling in prehierarchal follicles prior to recruitment.&nbsp;Significantly, desensitization of vertebrate GPCRs can occur via a &beta;ARRESTIN-mediated event (<em>e.g</em>., Marion <em>et al</em>., 2002). One component of GPCR desensitization is the phosphorylation of the intracellular (C-terminal) domain by a G Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase (GRK) which enables recruitment of &beta;ARRESTIN and prevents the G&alpha;s subunit from initiating GPCR-mediated signaling via cAMP. In our studies, knockdown of &beta;ARRESTIN mRNA in cultured, undifferentiated GC using small interfering RNA (siRNA) facilitated FSH- and VIP-induced cAMP formation, STAR expression and progesterone production. Conversely, over-expression of bovine &beta;ARRESTIN1 and G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR KINASE 2 constructs in actively differentiating GC significantly decreased cAMP accumulation and progesterone production following a challenge with FSH or VIP. We conclude that a &beta;ARRESTIN-mediated mechanism maintains FSHR and VPAC unresponsiveness in undifferentiated GC from prehierarchal follicles, and as a result maintains GC in an undifferentiated state until the time of follicle recruitment. Ultimately, the process by which the granulosa cell layer from the single recruited follicle selected each ovulatory cycle escapes inhibitory (MAPK/PKC) signaling and receptor desensitization to initiate FSH- and VIP-responsiveness is the subject of ongoing studies.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/06/2018<br>      Modified by: Alan&nbsp;L&nbsp;Johnson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354713/1354713_10300440_1528294713799_20150925_No6_6copy--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354713/1354713_10300440_1528294713799_20150925_No6_6copy--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Turkey hen ovary"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354713/1354713_10300440_1528294713799_20150925_No6_6copy--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Turkey hen ovary"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Ovary of a turkey hen with a preovulatory hierarchy, the most recently recruited follicle, undifferentiated prehierarchal follicles together with smaller slow-growing follicles.</div> <div class="imageCredit">A.L.
