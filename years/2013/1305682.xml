<AbstractNarration>The research goals of the project are focused on understanding the strong-field regime of Einstein's theory of general relativity. This encompasses both astrophysical and theoretical aspects of general relativity. On the astrophysical side, the main effort is an ongoing study of sources of gravitational waves in our universe, in particular binary black hole, black hole-neutron star and binary neutron star collisions. When neutron stars are involved in the collision, further questions involving potentially observable electromagnetic counterpart emission and production of r-process elements in ejected material will be pursued. The theoretical work includes studies of gravitational collapse and corresponding critical phenomena, the ultrarelativistic regime of particle collisions where gravity dominates the interaction, and the nature of gravity in higher dimensional spacetimes. Of particular interest for the latter subject are asymptotically Anti de-Sitter (AdS) spacetimes, where the gravitational dynamics can be related to the physics of strongly coupled conformal field theories (CFTs) via the AdS/CFT correspondence of string theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will contribute crucial information to our understanding of sources of gravitational waves in the universe and so form an integral part of the burgeoning field of gravitational wave astronomy. It will further provide a deeper understanding of the dynamical strong-field regime of general relativity, and help expand our knowledge of the interrelations between general relativity, high energy physics, and quantum gravity.  The pursuit of these projects will involve graduate students, undergraduates and postdoctoral fellows. They will thus be trained to do leading scientific research, become knowledgeable in corresponding areas of physics, and adept in high-performance computing and numerical methods. These skills are invaluable to many professions, and would thus also benefit and further the development of those students and postdocs that subsequently wish to pursue careers outside academia.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The work supported by this project focused on studying the dynamical, strong-field regime of general relativity, broadly split into two sub-areas : gravitational wave astrophysics, and theoretical problems in general relativity.  In the area of gravitational wave astrophysics, the focus was on gravitational wave and electromagnetic signatures of binary compact object (black hole, neutron star) mergers, as well as what we can hope to learn about properties of neutron stars and nuclear matter from future observations. On this latter front, using simulations of neutron star mergers, our group discovered that under certain conditions when a so-called hypermassive neutron star remnant (temporarily) forms after the collision, this spinning remnant becomes unstable to a kind of wobbling motion, where the dense core of the star is displaced from and rotates about the center of mass of the star (sort of like an unbalanced washing machine). This wobbling produces a distinct gravitational wave signature, and though weak, if observed by future observations could give many clues to the structure of neutron stars and matter at nuclear densities. The recent historic discovery of gravitational wave emission from black hole collisions by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration has ushered in the era of gravitational wave astronomy. These detections have provided the first scientific data that directly probes the dynamical, strong-field regime of general relativity. A significant effort of our group has been to use this data to quantify the consistency of the signals with the predictions of Einstein's theory, and constrain alternative theories and "exotic" alternatives to black holes. The bottom line is that the observed signals are, to within experimental and statistical uncertainties, entirely consistent with the general relativistic description of the merger of two black holes.  On the theoretical gravity side, a couple of the projects undertaken include a first study of the non-linear regime of black hole superradiance (where  a gravitational wave scatters off a rapidly rotating black hole and gains  energy in the process, causing the black hole to lose rotational energy),  and continued work exploring the ultra-relativistic limit of black hole  collisions (where the black holes slam into each other at near the speed of  light).
