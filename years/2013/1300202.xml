<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of NSF Award ID 1300202 was to provide students with travel grants to the ACM Sigmetrics 2013 conference, which took place June 17-21, 2013.     A total of forty students sought  travel grants to the conference.   The grant of 10K provided awards for a total of 18 students.   Thirteen were from the US and Canada and received awards of $500 each;  four students were from Europe and received awards of $700 each; one student was from China and received an award of $700.   Preference was given to students who did not have a paper at the conference.  Students who received travel grants were also offered half-price registration for the conference.    We also provided students with many activities at the conference.   In particular, there was a Smart Interviewing Practices panel, which was highly attended.   Also there was an Industrial Fair where students heard presentations from 6 different companies and then had the opportunity to meet with representatives from these companies.    In addition to the 10K provided by the NSF, we raised an additional 45K for the conference from industry, including Intel, Microsoft, Facebook, Akamai, NetApp, IBM, VMWare, Google, and HP .  Of this, 3K was allocated towards providing an additional 6 student travel grants and another 10K was used to provide students with half-price registration fees.   Finally, all excess funds from the 2013 Sigmetrics were donated towards the 2014 conference, which will provide free registration for all student attendees from 2013.  The conference website acknowledges the generous support of the NSF:  http://www.sigmetrics.org/sigmetrics2013/  Summary of Intellectual Merit:  The travel grant provided eighteen students from around the world the opportunity to attend the ACM Sigmetrics conferece and the 4 associated workshops.   In additional to hearing all the talks, the students also participated in specially planned activities to help with job training and job opportunities.  Summary of Broader Impact:   The funding provided by NSF was matched 4-fold by industry.   The industrial funding was used to provide an additional six travel grants.   It was also used to provide students with half-price registration fees.   Finally, all students who attended in 2013 will receive free registration at the Sigmetrics 2014 conference.
