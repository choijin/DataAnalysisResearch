<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on one of the central problems in number theory: connecting special values of L-functions to associated algebraic quantities, such as class groups or Selmer groups. In the case of elliptic curves, which is addressed by the celebrated conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer, the research described in this proposal aims to establish simple p-adic criteria for an elliptic curve to have both algebraic and analytic rank one, to use this criteria to prove a converse to the work of Kolyvagin and Gross-Zagier, and to show that this criteria holds for a positive proportion of all elliptic curves over the rationals (when ordered by height), thereby proving that both the average algebraic and analytic ranks are positive. It also aims to connect the vanishing of the central critical value of the L-function of an elliptic curve over the rationals or a totally real number field to the non-triviality of the associated p-adic Selmer group through methods involving the Iwasawa theory of unitary groups, extending some of the investigator's prior work on such problems. This project includes further development and  generalization of these methods so as to apply to L-functions arising from more general unitary groups, especially groups of higher rank, and to connect values of p-adic L-functions to Abel-Jacobi maps of cycles of positive dimension on unitary Shimura varieties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research described in this proposal aims to connect certain algebraic and analytic objects that are fundamental for many problems in number theory. The analytic objects are L-functions - a special class of functions built from number-theoretic data (this class includes the celebrated Riemann zeta function which is built from the prime numbers).  For over a century and a half L-functions have been a crucial ingredient in efforts to tackle the most central problems in number theory (for example, understanding the distribution of prime numbers or the structure of the set of rational number solutions to cubic curves). An important feature of L-functions is that their values at certain special points are expected to encode information about the orders of algebraic quantities also associated with the number-theoretic data defining the L-function. The investigator aims to prove the existence of such relations, with an emphasis on the important case of elliptic curves. Understanding the structure of the set of rational points on an elliptic curve - essentially the rational number solutions to a cubic equation - has been an aim in number theory for over a century, with connections to open problems that go back even further (even to classical Greek geometry). The problem of connecting the structure of this set with the special values of the L-function of the elliptic curve is often listed as one of the most important unsolved problems in mathematics. It is expected that this project will especially further the understanding of this connection and that it will develop new methods that will be useful for making progress on more general problems of a similar nature. The methods will draw particularly on the theory of automorphic forms, which are closely connected to both analysis and algebra and a rich supply of L-functions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One major goal of this project was to make progress on the Birch--Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD) Conjecture for elliptic curves. The BSD Conjecture has influenced the development of algebraic number theory since it was first formulated, and its importance was high-lighted by its choice as one of the seven `millennium prize problems' in mathematics.  The BSD Conjecture asserts that the algebraic rank of the group of rational points on an elliptic curve should equal the order of vanishing, or analytic rank, of a related analytic function -- the L-function of the curve -- at a special point. Furthermore the leading Taylor series coefficient of this function at the special point should satisfy a particular formula (the BSD formula).  Major outcomes from this project include:  (1) Proofs that elliptic curves defined over the rational numbers are ordered by height  A proportion of at least .6 (60%) satisfy the BSD conjecture.   A proportion of at least .2 (20%) have both algebraic and analytic ranks both equal to one (and so have infinitely many rational points). Consequently, the average rank of elliptic curves is positive. A proportion of at least .16 (16%) of elliptic curves have algebraic and analytic ranks both equal to zero (and so have only finitely many rational points).   (2) A proof of cases of Kolyvagin's conjecture about properties of the Heegner points on an elliptic curve defined over the rational numbers. This was an ingredient in the proofs in (1).  (3) A proof that for semistable elliptic curves defined over the rational numbers and having analytic rank one, the BSD formula is true up to at most a specific finite number of prime factors.   The BSD Conjecture uncovered a very general phenomenon in mathematics that should be true for more than just elliptic curves. One major goal of this project was to generalize the methods and techniques used to study elliptic curves (such as Euler systems and Iwasawa theory) to these other cases. Outcomes include:   (4) The construction of an Euler system for genus two Siegel modular forms.   Additionally, the above outcomes stimulated the start of a number of other research projects that are presently ongoing.
