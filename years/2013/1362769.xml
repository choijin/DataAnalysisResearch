<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in the international conference Number Theory at Illinois hosted by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on June 5-7, 2014. The conference will bring together distinguished number theorists to report on current research trends and recent advances in the field, particularly in the areas of analytic, algebraic, and combinatorial number theory, all of which have seen spectacular recent breakthroughs. It will provide an opportunity for graduate students and young researchers to learn about the latest research in these areas, to interact with leading experts in the field, and to gain exposure for their own research through contributed talks. The conference is expected to attract around 150 participants. It will feature about 20 invited speakers representing a broad spectrum of areas in number theory, as well as contributed talks.  The proceedings of the conference will be published in a special volume of the International Journal of Number Theory.  The grant funds will support the participation of approximately 30 graduate students, recent PhDs, and other research-active faculty without external support, and approximately 9 invited speakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Number theory is a central field of mathematics, one that is rich in history, but also serves as the theoretical foundation for important modern day applications such as data encryption and compression. The conference serves as a forum to disseminate recent advances in this field and to exchange ideas and engage in collaborative discussions, thus promoting further advances in this field. The conference will showcase number theory as a lively, attractive, and important area of mathematics to a broad and diverse group of participants, thus helping draw more people into this field. Special efforts are made to encourage participation of graduate students, recent PhDs, and younger researchers who do not have their own support, including women and under-represented minorities.  To further encourage and facilitate participation by graduate students and young researchers, a graduate student number theory conference will be held on the University of Illinois campus on the two days preceding the Number Theory at Illinois meeting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site: www.math.illinois.edu/nt2014</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This grant supported the meeting "Number Theory at Illinois: A Conference in Memory of the Batemans and Heini Halberstam," held on June 5-7, 2014 and the "Illinois Number Conference," held on August 13-14, 2015.  The conference Number Theory at Illinois was an international gathering of experts in the field to present current research trends and recent advances in several areas of number theory, and for collaborative research discussions.  Participants ranged from recent PhDs and rising young stars to leading figures in number theory. A total of 22 invited talks and 10 contributed talks were presented, reflecting a broad spectrum of topics.  Altogether, 138 mathematicians, representing 15 countries, took part; from the U.S., 22 states were represented.  An attendee of note was Eira Scourfield, who came from England to honor her mentor, Professor Halberstam.  Of those who attended, 78 were graduate students or postdocs, and 33 were  women and underrepresented minorities.  The conference was immediately preceded by the 10th Midwestern Conference for Graduate Students and recent Ph.D.s in Number Theory, also held at the University of Illinois.  This contributed to the large turnout among early career mathematicians.  Additional conference activities included a banquet at the Illini Union with talks and video clips about the honorees; a party for Grad Conference participants; and group photos, which are posted on the conferences' website, .  A conference proceedings volume was prepared, edited by Bruce Berndt and Harold Diamond, as a special issue of the International Journal of Number Theory:  the Special Issue in Memory of Paul T. Bateman and Heini Halberstam is vol 11, no. 5, 2015, pages 1357-1724.  Most of the papers are by conference speakers, and many of papers are on the content of their talks.  The Illinois Number Theory Conference, held August 13-14, 2015, was a smaller meeting, with primary participation from mathematicians from North America. The goal of the conference was to represent the vast range of interests in our department's number theory group, including topics such as modular forms, Galois representations, elliptic curves, arithmetic of thin groups, prime number theory and much more. There  were 14 invited speakers, including plenary speakers Jeff Lagarias of the University of Michigan and William Duke of UCLA, spanning a great amount of cutting edge research being conducted in number theory today.  In addition, 16 contributed talks were given, a large percentage by early career mathematicians.  A very lively, open problem solving session was held the evening of the first day.  The conference had a turnout of nearly 100 participants, of whom approximately 50% were graduate students, 30% were junior faculty, and 20% were senior faculty.   Special efforts were made to attract women mathematicians to the conference, both among participants of the conference and among invited speakers: in both cases the female-to-male ratio was around 1 to 2.   Among the aspects which contributed to this were the invited speaker list with a high percentage of women (5 out of 14) and a number of well-advertised resources for participants with young children, including play and nap/nursing rooms set up especially for the conference,  as well as funding opportunities for caregivers and small children accompanying younger conference participants.
