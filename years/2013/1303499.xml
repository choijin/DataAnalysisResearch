<AbstractNarration>The objective of the proposed collaborative research is to develop a plasmonically enhanced optical&lt;br/&gt;ring resonator (PEORR) sensor array for unlabelled biomolecule detection at the single molecule level.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed hybrid sensor synergizes microfabricated ring resonators and nanofabricated plasmonic&lt;br/&gt;nanostructures. It takes advantage of the excellent sensing resolution associated with the ring resonator&lt;br/&gt;and the tremendously enhanced sensitivity arising from the plasmonic nanostructures to achieve single&lt;br/&gt;molecule detection, and of the carousel effect from the ring resonator for efficient capture and transport of&lt;br/&gt;biomolecules for sample enrichment and expeditious detection. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Detection and study of biomolecules at the single molecule level allow to probe and&lt;br/&gt;characterize molecules in unprecedented detail. Traditional single molecule detection relies primarily on&lt;br/&gt;fluorescence microscopy, which requires sophisticated instruments and complicated dye labeling&lt;br/&gt;processes that may adversely affect a molecules functionality.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed project will be carried out synergistically by the terms from the University&lt;br/&gt;of Michigan and the Polytechnic Institute at New York University. Graduate students will be&lt;br/&gt;trained in interdisciplinary science and will work in each of the two labs through an exchange program.&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students will be paired with graduate students to obtain hands-on experience. Videos on&lt;br/&gt;Youtube will be jointly created to publicize the research findings. Finally, the PI will work with local non-&lt;br/&gt;Ph.D. granting colleges to develop a summer program for their students to conduct research in the PI's&lt;br/&gt;lab at the University of Michigan.</AbstractNarration>

The proposed hybrid sensor synergizes microfabricated ring resonators and nanofabricated plasmonic nanostructures. It takes advantage of the excellent sensing resolution associated with the ring resonator and the tremendously enhanced sensitivity arising from the plasmonic nanostructures to achieve single molecule detection, and of the carousel effect from the ring resonator for efficient capture and transport of biomolecules for sample enrichment and expeditious detection.      In the project, the researchers investigated the PEORR both theoretically and experimentally. The findings are summarized as follows.  1. Precision nanoparticle sizing can be achieved by monitoring the spectral shift of the different azimuthal modes of the whispering gallery mode.  2. Nanoparticles (such as plasmonic nanoparticles) can be attached to the ring resonator surface with precise control of the particle location through a method called "light force assembly".  3. Nanoparticle sizing can be significantly improved by considering the large field gradients associated with the evanescent decay of a whispering gallery mode.  4. A novel optofluidic ring resonator (stand-alone or coupled ring resonator) can be precisely fabricated using femto-second laser inscription (or standard photolithographic method).  5. A side waveguide can be created adjacent to the optofluidic ring resonator using femto-second laser inscription. The coupling between the optofluidic ring resonator is theoretically analyzed and calculated, and experimentally demonstrated. It is shown the ring resonator has a Q-factor of 10^4 &ndash; 10^5.     The above outcomes were disseminated via a number of peer-reviewed journal articles, conference presentations, book chapters, and seminars. In addition, quite a few post-doctors, graduate and undergraduate students were trained.          Last Modified: 08/01/2017       Submitted by: Xudong Fan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
