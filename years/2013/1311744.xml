<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: &lt;br/&gt;With financial support provided by the Division of Materials Research (DMR) at the National Science Foundation and the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, this collaborative effort between the Applied Optics group of Holger Schmidt (UC Santa Cruz, USA) and the Magnetic Nanostructures group of Manfred Albrecht (Chemnitz University of Technology, Germany) will investigate techniques, materials, and applications of all-optical magnetization switching in ferro- and and ferrimagnetic nanomagnets. Specific project goals include (i) demonstration of all-optical magnetization switching in single-domain nanomagnets using ferrimagnetic materials; (ii) fabrication of exchange-coupled heterostructures using magnetic materials with adjustable magnetic anisotropy, Curie temperature, and crystallography; (iii) demonstration of ultrafast switching of single nanomagnets in various combinations of ferro- and ferromagnetic materials; and (iv) investigation of the all-optical switching process as a function of the three-dimensional nanomagnet, and the magnetic environment in a dense array.  This research is enabled through the combination of the materials expertise of the Albrecht group and the single nanomagnet detection capabilities developed in the Schmidt group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: &lt;br/&gt;Nanomagnets have been under consideration for next generation data storage media and other spintronics applications for some time. Recently, the discovery of ultrafast all-optical switching of magnetic orientation in ferrimagnetic materials has received a lot of interest due to the potential to create data storage media with unprecedented response times. The potential combination of such an optical switching layer with an exchange-coupled ferromagnetic storage layer is highly intriguing and raises a number of exciting material questions. This project will systematically explore novel combinations of such materials in the context of nanoscale storage media.  In addition, the project will provide students at different levels with a broader and more complete education than what would be possible in a uni-national setting by creating a unique and rewarding educational experience. Mutual visits between the participating groups for a substantial amount of time (2-4 weeks per year) will allow for meaningful training in the technique used by their collaborators to broaden student knowledge, communication skills, and professional competitiveness.  Aside from one graduate student and one postdoc, undergraduate students from underrepresented groups will be recruited through the UC LEADS or UC CAMP program, and will be given the opportunity to complete their senior theses in collaboration with researchers from abroad.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual merit:  Over the course of the project, a number of new insights into the dynamics of magnetic structures and methods to characterize them were gained. Specific examples include:  With the help of surface acoustic waves present in patterned nanomagnet  arrays in the highly magnetoelastic FeTb material, the spin wave spectrum and damping in patterned  nanomagnet arrays of this material were measured and analyzed for the first time. FeTb is important as it forms the basis of one of the most promising materials for all-optical magnetization switching. The influence of nanomagnet array geometry on magnetization dynamics via magneto-elastic coupling of surface-acoustic waves was systematically studied for the first time and the experimental behavior was successfully modeled from first principles. The eliimination of the influence of pattern-induced surface-acoustic waves on the magnetization dynamics was successfully demonstrated by arranging nanomagnets into a randomized pattern. A novel way to SELECTIVELY suppress  or enhance the magnetization precession in different magnetic layers was implemented using a second optical pump pulse. This technique was  demonstrated experimentally and applied to studying the potential impact  of mutual precession in Fe/Pt/FePt sandwich structures. Surprisingly, it was found  that the precession of the FePt layer does not influence the damping of  the Fe precession and vice versa. The technique can also be used to  suppress mechanical surface-acoustic waves in nanomagnet arrays that  otherwise interfere substantially with the magnetization dynamics.   Broader Impact: (Nano)-magnetic devices form the technological backbone of many essential electronic devices and technologies in our daily lives such as data storage and novel computer memories. Studies of technologically relevant materials and device architectures and the development of novel methods for such studies are essential for pushing the boundaries of our understanding and implementation of these spintronic approaches.  In addition to this impact on science and technology, the project contained a strong  educational component. Graduate and undergraduate students were trained  in the fields of nanofabrication, nanocharacterization, magnetism, and ultrafast laser spectroscopy.  Collaboration on an international level was another critical element of the project. UCSC graduate students and their German counterparts met and communicated throughout the course of the project.

Undergraduate students at UCSC participated as REU  students. In addition to acquiring technical knowledge about nanoscale  fabrication and characterization, they also gained valuable experience in  how advanced research is carried out as well as how to give  presentations to a technical audience.   Finally, several cohorts of high school students were trained in hands-on nanoscale imaging using a scanning electron microscope as part of UCSC's COSMOS summer outreach program.
