<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1308266, Principal Investigator:  C. Robin Graham&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigator will carry out several research projects studying various aspects of conformal geometry and asymptotically hyperbolic metrics.  These include investigation of boundary rigidity for asymptotically  hyperbolic metrics, investigation of minimal submanifolds of products of  asymptotically hyperbolic spaces with compact manifolds, study of boundary terms for conformally invariant integrals, and study of twisted Dirac operators on asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds and relation to  conformally invariant operators on the boundary.  The main objectives are  to further understanding of these geometries and their relationship.  The  methods are analytic, geometric, and algebraic, with an intimate  connection between these different aspects of the study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will focus on the relationship between two different  geometric structures: conformal geometry on the one hand and  asymptotically hyperbolic geometry on the other.  Conformal geometry is  the study of properties of space which depend only on angles but not on  distances.  Hyperbolic geometry involves spaces of negative curvature, in  which the analogues of straight lines separate more than in usual flat  space.  The asymptotic structure of hyperbolic geometry is related to  conformal geometry on the lower dimensional boundary at infinity.  Several  projects will study the relationship between these geometries.  Apart from  the intrinsic geometric interest, one motivation is the AdS/CFT  correspondence in physics, a proposed holographic correspondence for  certain physical phenomena.  In recent years, the AdS/CFT correspondence  has been used to model many strongly coupled physical theories, for  instance in condensed matter physics.  The proposed activity will further  enable the development of human resources through educationally oriented  activities of the investigator, including advising, mentoring and teaching  graduate students, and curricular development.  International cooperation  and partnership will be promoted through collaboration between the  investigator and researchers in Japan and France.  Ties between the  mathematics and physics communities will be enhanced.  The results will be  effectively disseminated through attendance and speaking at meetings and  conferences and through posting and publication of articles.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project studied topics in differential geometry and geometric analysis; more specifically questions in conformal geometry related to the geometry of asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds.  Much of the study involved ideas of holography, in which a phenomenon in one dimension is studied via objects and constructions in another dimension.    One holographic construction studied was the extension of a submanifold of a space realized as a boundary at infinity to a minimal submanifold of the bulk space.  A precise analysis of the asymptotics of the minimal submanifold was carried out when the bulk space is the product of an asymptotically hyperbolic manifold with a compact manifold.  The log term coefficient in the expansion of the area was studied In the simpler setting in which the compact manifold is trivial.  It was shown that this coefficient defines a conformally invariant energy of the submanifold at infinity whose variational properties were studied in detail.  A study of the renormalization of the volume of a metric of singular Yamabe type was carried out.  Such metrics were first introduced by Loewner and Nirenberg in 1974.  The log term coefficient in the expansion of the volume  of such a metric was shown to define an energy whose variation is the obstruction density, thus resolving a question posed by Gover and Waldron.  Further work in collaboration with Matthew Gursky has shown that in the case that the dimension is 4 and the boundary is umbilic, the renormalized volume can be modified to be conformally invariant by the addition of the integral over the boundary of an explicit local expression, and that the modified renormalized volume appears in a formula of Chern-Gauss-Bonnet type for the singular Yamabe metric.   The inverse problem of determining an asymptotically hyperbolic metric from the renormalized lengths of the geodesics connecting boundary points was studied in collaboration with Colin Guillarmou, Plamen Stefanov, and Gunther Uhlmann.  This involved first identifying an appropriate extension of the cosphere bundle and geodesic flow to the boundary.  Injectivity results for X-ray transforms in this setting were also proved.  FInally, a derivation of conformally invariant operators on the boundary at infinity of a Poincare-Einstein manifold (a special type of asymptotically hyperbolic manifold) from twisted Dirac and deRham operators on the interior was obtained in joint work with Olivier Biquard.  A concrete description of the discrete series of Lorentz groups was derived as a part of this work.  This project contributed to the development of human resources via the involvment and mentoring of graduate students Stephen McKeown and Nikolas Eptaminitakis and postdoc Nicholas Reichert.  McKeown completed his Ph.D. under the direction of the PI during the period of this project, working on related topics.  Reichert collaborated with the PI on the project on conformally invariant energies via minimal submanifold extension.  Eptaminitakis is currently working under the direction of the PI and Gunther Uhlmann on local versions of the X-ray transform and boundary rigidity results on asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds.   Another broader impact of this work is its interaction with researchers studying the AdS/CFT correspondence in physics.  The project on asymptotics of minimal submanifolds in product spaces was carried out jointly with physicist Andreas Karch and was published in a physics journal.  It is anticipated that the work on asymptotically hyperbolic boundary rigidity will be of interest to physicists working on AdS/CFT.             Last Modified: 03/05/2018       Submitted by: C.
