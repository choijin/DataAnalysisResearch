<AbstractNarration>This 3 year project was initially submitted to the ITEST program, but was deemed more appropriate to the DRK-12 assessment strand. The project seeks to develop diagnostic assessments to identify specific statistical misconceptions (datasets as entities, comparing datasets, and overreliance on the mean procedure), teacher tutorials to bolster and reinforce teachers? understandings of these concepts and misconceptions, activities to engage students in applications of statistical reasoning including supplemental activities for individualized instruction, and an efficacy trial to evaluate the effect of the resources on students? knowledge and affect in statistics. They will use cognitive labs to address validity and a randomized control trial to address initial efficacy. Teacher pre-activity tutorials and student activities will be made freely and publicly available. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
