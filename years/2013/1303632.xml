<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2013 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Mark Allen is "Free Boundaries on Manifolds with Singularities." The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Texas at Austin, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Luis Caffarelli.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Intellectual Merit: While under this grant, the PI did research on free boundary problems and nonlocal differential equations. Free boundary problems arise when there is an interface or boundary between two areas and it is not known from the outset how the interface will move over time. The movement and shape of the interface is determined by mathematical equations that are determined by physical laws or experimental observation. The PI did research on how free boundaries interact with topological singularities. In one particular instance the PI considered when a free boundary is allowed to pass through the vertex of a cone.
