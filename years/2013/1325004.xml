<AbstractNarration>In this Cyberlearning: Transforming Education DIP (Development and Implementation) project, the PIs focus on understanding the kinds of tools and help for teachers that will support them as they integrate use of learning technologies into their classroom practices. There are a variety of challenges in creating and managing "blended learning" environments where students are learning in the classroom and also using tools and resources online and communicating with distant collaborators online. The PIs posit seven critical research and development needs in learning how to design such environments and help teachers learn to practice in these environments: better understanding of the types of interactions that are uniquely afforded by networked technologies and the ways those interactions contribute to learning; shared datasets that document and link face-to-face and online instructions in ways that enable analysis of learning outcomes; design principles for online learning tools to be integrated into such learning ecosystems; flexible instructional tools for teachers and data that help teachers to adjust classroom orchestration and allow them to realign online interaction structures; sharable frameworks for analyzing the affects of online learning tools; appropriate collaboration tools; and professional development facilities. The PIs in this project take a design research approach to the design of these technologies and approaches and to investigating the ins and outs of socio-technical systems that best support blended learning -- the types and patterns of online interactions that create opportunities for learning, what leads to learning outcomes, how and which data to capture to analyze learning, the kinds of analyses that are needed to inform understanding of interactions within online social learning networks, and ways of supporting practitioners in effectively using the affordances of the socio-technical system to create learning ecosystems that promote digital literacy and learning of 21st century skills along with disciplinary learning. This research is being carried out in the context of the robust ecology of the Digital Youth Network (DYN), an already-existing infrastructure for connecting youth to each other in after-school contexts that includes a variety of tools for digital inquiry and expression.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While many teachers understand the utiity of technology in their personal lives, the norms of classroom instruction make it difficult for the majority of teachers to make effective use of networked technologies in their classrooms. However, it is essential to make sure that our educational systems integrate digital and technological learning experiences into daily learning activities to ensure that all youth become technologically literate and learn the skills they need for engaging in the 21st century workforce. This project focuses on designing "blended learning" environments and helping teachers take on and learn to productively use digital technologies in their classrooms to help students learn disciplinary content, disciplinary skills, and the many communication, collaboration, and inquiry skills so important to their futures. As well, investigation focuses on how to use the data collected while learners are engaging in learning activities online to help teachers visualize the capabilities and understanding of individual students so as to be able to give appropriate attention to every student's needs. It is expected that analysis of the data collected, along with future analysis by other researchers, will contribute novel forms of online analytic tools to document the relationship between interactions and outcomes related to digital literacy, including evidence of skills and understandings and also other important capacities such as developing interest, spreading knowledge, engaging in creative practices, taking on independent learning, and expanding ideas for future careers.</AbstractNarration>

While the results do not present definitive evidence that learning actually occurred, they do demonstrate that the online learning platform provided opportunities to build 21st century learning skills for students.</span></p> <div><span><br /></span></div> </span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/19/2017<br>      Modified by: Denise&nbsp;C&nbsp;Nacu</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1325004/1325004_10274393_1495211617728_ThemesofPractice--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1325004/1325004_10274393_1495211617728_ThemesofPractice--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Themes of Practice: Teaching in Blended Learning Classrooms"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1325004/1325004_10274393_1495211617728_ThemesofPractice--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Themes of Practice: Teaching in Blended Learning Classrooms"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Our suite of materials are anchored around a cyclical set of practices that identify specific ways to reflect, plan, and act around the use of online platforms in learning environments.</div> <div class="imageCredit">DePaul University</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Denise&nbsp;C&nbsp;Nacu</div> <div class="imageTitle">Themes of Practice: Teaching in Blended Learning Classrooms</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1325004/1325004_10274393_1495212216225_OnlineLearningSupportRoles--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1325004/1325004_10274393_1495212216225_OnlineLearningSupportRoles--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Online Learning Support Roles"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1325004/1325004_10274393_1495212216225_OnlineLearningSupportRoles--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Online Learning Support Roles"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">We developed the Online Learning Support Roles (OLSR) framework,an approach using both automated analytics and qualitative interpretation to identify and explore online teaching roles.</div> <div class="imageCredit">DePaul University</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Denise&nbsp;C&nbsp;Nacu</div> <div class="imageTitle">Online Learning Support Roles</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1325004/1325004_10274393_1495212458098_ScreenShot2017-05-19at11.45.06AM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1325004/1325004_10274393_1495212458098_ScreenShot2017-05-19at11.45.06AM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Examples of coded log data"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1325004/1325004_10274393_1495212458098_ScreenShot2017-05-19at11.45.06AM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Examples of coded log data"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Using our frameworks which highlight both student and educator actions to described learning activity online, log data can be coded for data mining and pattern analysis.</div> <div class="imageCredit">DePaul University</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Denise&nbsp;C&nbsp;Nacu</div> <div class="imageTitle">Examples of coded log data</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The notion of a "digital divide" has shifted from a focus on inequities of access to equipment toward one of inequities of access to opportunities. There is a recognized "opportunity gap" that characterizes differences in access to learning activities and networks, resulting in a "participation gap" between youth in underserved communities and their more affluent counterparts. Online social learning networks have affordances for supporting 21st century learning in ways that can potentially bridge inequities by offering learning opportunities, resources, and social supports beyond the physical boundaries that demarcate underserved populations. As teachers in formal and informal learning settings are increasingly willing to make use of such systems, and as schools and districts increasingly adopt and require the use of online platforms, there is anticipation that the gap will be minimized. These systems generate massive use data, and there is excitement around the potential of harnessing this data to reveal insights about learning and to design interventions that can level the playing field.       Our project used the robust ecology of the Digital Youth Network to examine various formal and informal blended learning contexts that made use of networked technologies. Examining blended learning environments, we focused on understanding online educator-learner interactions and designing tools/visualizations to support those interactions.    We aimed to go beyond more traditional metrics of time on task and completion rates to build new theoretical models of how networked social interactions occur between youth and adults and how they can play out in blended online and face-to-face environments. To help reveal and make sense of educator-learning interactions occurring in online platforms, we developed two frameworks which highlights both learner and educator actions. We studied iRemix, an online social learning platform, as it was used as part of several informal and formal blended learning environments.   The Online Learning Support Roles framework is an approach using both automated analytics and qualitative interpretation to identify and explore online teaching roles. Building from prior research that identified ways in which adults provide supports for youth learning and development, we defined 14 specific roles educators play in online learning environments. These include: Encourager, Promoter, Audience, Learner, Learning Broker, Resource Provider, Define/ Present, Organize student interaction, Seed work, Friend, Prompt, Evaluator, Monitor, and Model. Using this framework, we coded and analyzed log data generated from an online learning platform used in informal and formal blended learning environments. This approach helped to reveal differences in how educators play these roles and to explore questions about educator goals and intentions in using online learning platforms in various contexts. Applying the framework to understanding the coded log data also allowed us to examine the design of learning platforms themselves, putting a spotlight on the ways in which particular features and the system as a whole enable educators to support learning.    Building on prior DYN design-&shy;based research and theoretical constructs from recent work in the fields of learning sciences and human-&shy;computer interaction, we developed a framework of 21st century learning opportunities to understand learner actions attending to three main themes: Creative production, Self-directed learning, and Social learning. We used this framework to code and analyze traces of learners? online activity. We found patterns of user trace data logs that triangulated with self&shy;-report measures of 21st century learning dispositions that DYN was designed to foster. Specifically, students with more creative production activity on iRemix were more likely to identify themselves as pursuing possible futures as engineers, designers, and video producers, suggesting personal identification as a technological creator.
