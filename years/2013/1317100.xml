<AbstractNarration>This action funds Eric G. Gharakhanian of University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST) in Nomi, Ishikawa.  The project title is "Development of Poly(peptide) Materials Demonstrating Thermally-Activated Shape Memory." The host scientist is Dr. Tatsuo Kaneko.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research develops and studies naturally-derived polypeptide biomaterials which show shape memory in response to thermal stimulus.  This work involves the preparation and study of poly(glutamate) materials functionalized with a photo cross-linker.  These materials are being cross-linked to varying degrees and the thermo-mechanical properties of the resultant plastics are being investigated.  The knowledge gained from these studies provides a guide towards the development of bio-resorbable materials with thermally stimulated shape memory.        &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, biomaterial devices inspired by this research will help improve the well-being of individuals in all societies.  This work will continue a scientific partnership with the Kaneko lab, helping maintain the U.S. scientific infrastructure through this international collaboration.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this research, progress towards a new biodegradable material has been made, which is designed to have thermal-shape-memory.  Shape memory is a property where a material may be deformed from its original shape, but after exposure to a stimulus such as light or heat, it will return to its original shape.  Biodegradable shape memory materials primarily have been used for medical applications, particularly for minimally invasive surgeries.   In this application, a medical device that must be implanted into the body may be deformed from its original shape to a more compact and easier to insert form.  After implantation, the material is triggered by a stimulus to return to its larger, therapeutically useful form.  A new material was proposed which is a polymer derived from glutamic acid and 4-hydroxycinnamic acid, both of which are naturally derived materials.  The cinnamic acid groups on the polymer are designed to undergo a previously developed cross-linking reaction, which allows the permanent shape of the polymer to be æprogrammedÆ.  If the material is deformed, these crosslinks allow the material to return to its original shape upon being heated.  A key barrier for the manufacture of this material is the synthesis of a monomer which may be polymerized to provide a polymer with the appropriate functionality.   In this research, a synthesis has been developed which has allowed the desired monomer to be produced.  Additionally it was found that another route for making this material was unsuitable, due to instability of the monomer.  The merits of this synthesis are that it is short, and provides this polymer from very inexpensive starting materials.  Additionally, this synthesis may be easily be modified to prepare the material on large scales necessary for materials research.  Early attempts to polymerize this material were made, but the monomer was of insufficient purity to provide consistent chain lengths.  For this reason, future work should aim to increase the purity of the material.  Therefore this research has overcome a key step in reaching the goal of a biodegradable shape memory material.  Using this synthesis, polymers may be developed which allow the development and increase the understanding of shape memory materials.  This understanding is necessary for the development of these high performance materials which have important applications in the fields of materials science and bioengineering.  This research and its results have been shared through poster presentations and visits to other universities in order to widely disseminate the results of this work.
