<AbstractNarration>This action funds Steven Thomas Callen of Saint Louis University to conduct a research project in Biological Sciences during the summer of 2013 at the Kunming Institute of Botany in Kunming, Yunnan, China.  The project title is "A comparative analysis of floral reproductive traits between native and introduced kudzu (Pueraria montana)." The host scientist is Dr. Hong Wang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability of invasive plant species to reproduce in new environments may be limited by the availability of compatible mates and pollinators.  In such situations, shifts in plant mating systems (for example, from outcrossing to self-fertilization) may promote invasion by providing enhanced fruit and seed production.  Current understanding of mating system shifts during invasion is limited, particularly for perennial (long-lived) invaders that reproduce both sexually and clonally.  In this study, the Fellow uses the vine kudzu (Pueraria montana), one of the most potent plant invaders in North America, as a model to investigate the consequences of invasion for the mating systems of perennial, clonal plants.  The reproductive biology (pollinator and pollen availability and its capacity for fruit/seed set and self-fertilization) from its native range (China) to that from its introduced range (North America) are compared.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, this study supplements other comparative studies of plant invasions among China and North America to identify common factors driving invasion success between the two countries.  Photos and videos will be integrated with the knowledge and results generated from this fellowship for presentations at national and international scientific meetings, reports for conservation organizations, and teaching activities.  Establishing international collaborations allows the Fellow to connect undergraduate and high school students with Chinese researchers through video conferencing, helping to expand student concepts of scientific research to a global view.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ways in which plants reproduce (e.g. outcrossing, selfing, clonal reproduction) are important for their ability to colonize new areas, for establishing populations, and for range expansion, particularly if they have been introduced from one range into another.  The evolution of plant mating systems, such as from a shift from outcrossing (self-incompatibility; SI) to selfing (self-compatibility; SC), following introduction into non-native areas may promote invasion success by providing increased seed production when compatible (genetically-distinct) mates or co-evolved pollinators are lacking.  Comparative analyses documenting shifts in plant mating systems during invasion are limited, particularly for long-lived perennial species that reproduce both sexually (by flowers) and clonally (by shoots or roots).  This is surprising considering about 44% of non-native plant species in both North America and China reproduce at least partially through clones.      SI clonal plants offer an interesting system to explore the evolution of mating systems in species that are mate-limited.  On the one hand, clonal reproduction serves a similar purpose as SC by offering an easy way to reproduce when compatible mates are lacking.  On the other hand, clonality decreases the number of unique individuals (genotypes) in a population and is thus itself a source of mate limitation in SI plants that require cross-pollen for reproduction.  A remaining question is whether non-native plants introduced into a new range achieve reproductive assurance through increased selfing relative to their native ancestors when compatible mates are limited.      To investigate mating system evolution following invasion in clonal, perennial plants, I conducted a comparative analysis of the mating system of kudzu (Pueraria montana), one of the most widespread and damaging invasive species in North America, in its native (China) and introduced (North America) ranges through the EAPSI Fellowship program (2013).  I worked with my host researcher, Prof. Wang Hong, and her research team at the Kunming Institute of Botany (KIB; Yunnan, China) performing controlled hand-pollination experiments in a local village, collecting pollinators, and processing samples at KIB.  While the plant didn't flower until two weeks before the program was ending and while rain prevented us from performing fieldwork once it was flowering, we were able to collect a limited amount of data to compare with results we had generated from populations in Missouri.  We found there are more pollinators in China and that kudzu in China seems to invest more energy in sexual than clonal reproduction, compared to introduced populations.  We are still collecting and analyzing data, and I have plans to go back to China in 2014 to perform a follow-up pollination study.     Biological invasions are the second leading cause of global biodiversity loss and inflict over one trillion dollars of damage each year.  While this work is ongoing, the results from this study of plant mating systems in clonal plants will eventually aid conservationists and land managers in predicting and managing biological invasions.  It will also add to the growing literature on invasive species in China and the United States, and thereby help to identify common characteristics that might promote successful invasion between the two nations.  Eventually these results will be published in peer-reviewed journal articles.     Aside from this first-hand research experience, the EAPSI fellowship provided me with the opportunity to learn about the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure in China and with an orientation to their society, culture, and language.  This has thus provided me with many benefits beyond the scope of my research.  I was able to present my research in two presentations, one at KIB and one at Yunnan University, give a small class to graduate students on niche modeling and using the software program R, and sp...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
