<AbstractNarration>The last decade has seen a resurgence of debate over the role of extreme events such as earthquakes, landslides and floods in long-term erosion and landscape evolution. Yet progress in this area is fundamentally limited by the difficulty of observing extreme events on human timescales and linking them to million-year average erosion rate measurements. This project helps bridge the gap by combining field, laboratory and computer modeling approaches to investigate the first direct evidence of the legacy of prehistoric megafloods in one of the most rapidly eroding natural landscapes on Earth, southeastern Tibet.  This project will integrate glacial lake deposit chronologies, field observations and dating of flood deposits, provenance data for sediments deposited in different magnitude flows, and computer simulations of flood events to (1) model flood hydraulics, landslide triggering, slackwater sediment deposition and flood hazard; (2) relate flood conditions to erosion processes and evaluate the extent to which megafloods focus erosion in the gorge; and (3) begin to constrain the timing and frequency of megaflood events to better understand their relationship to climate and impact on long-term erosion.  Ultimately, this novel approach of chemically "fingerprinting" flood sands (using zircon U-Pb ages) to investigate erosion processes will improve our understanding of possible feedbacks between river incision and rock uplift, Tibetan plateau margin evolution, and links between climate and erosion on glacial-interglacial timescales.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The modeling study will benefit society by evaluating flood hazard associated with hydropower dam development in the region.  The project involves collaborations among the University of Washington, US Geological Survey, and a disaster management agency in India.  Graduate and undergraduate research students will be trained in field, laboratory, and computer modeling methods. To promote K-12 STEM education in minority-serving high schools, the researchers and students will work with a teacher to develop a lesson and activity on floods and megaflood erosion for the University of Washington outreach program, Rocking Out.  Additionally, research findings will be disseminated broadly through University of Washington's outreach and high school programs, Indian disaster management personnel, university courses, conferences and publications.  This project is jointly supported by the Geomorphology and Land Use Dynamics and International Science and Engineering programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project investigated the history, hydraulics, and erosional impact of modern and prehistoric megafloods in the eastern Himalaya, with the goal of understanding how rugged mountain topography influences flood flows and hazard, mechanisms of landslide triggering and erosion during floods, and the role of extreme events in long-term river incision. The study region in the eastern Himalaya and Tsangpo gorge is one of the fastest eroding natural landscapes on Earth, where glacial- and landslide-dam breaks are capable of unleashing devastating outburst floods that shape the land over thousands of years and threaten millions of people downstream in the Brahmaputra river catchment today.  New observations and numerical modeling of the second largest historical outburst flood on record shed light on these infrequent, difficult to observe events, and the erosion and sediment deposition they cause.  Observations of the year 2000 Yigong landslide-dam flood included field and remote sensing surveys of flood high water marks, landslides, and sand deposits, and geochemical analyses of thousands of single mineral grains to determine where erosion from the event was focused. Numerical simulations of the outburst flood hydraulics match observations along &gt;450 km of the flood pathway. The accuracy of inundation patterns simulated for this extreme flood over hundreds of kilometers through rugged topography show the approach will be useful in future studies of flood hazard (from natural as well as man-made dam and levee failures) around the world as well as landscape evolution.  This project also studied the history and erosional processes of ancient megafloods released by glacial dam breaks, which radiocarbon and other dating results show occurred in the region toward the end of the last ice age. Geochemistry data for the flood sands show that the floods were mostly sourced from glacially impounded lakes in the western part of the drainage basin, and that the river was able to focus extremely rapid erosion in the Tsangpo gorge during megafloods to keep up with the rapid pace of rock uplift in the region.  Scientific results were broadly disseminated in peer-reviewed journal and numerical code repository submissions; conference presentations; invited lectures; public talks and outreach events. This project supported the early-career female principal investigator (PI); integrated research activities with education; and provided opportunities for new international scientific collaboration with Indian colleagues, undergraduate and graduate student education, and K-12 educational outreach. The PI taught an inquiry-based course series for undergraduates, and supervised two PhD students and two undergraduate research assistants supported by the project. The research team members volunteered with the Rocking Out K-12 educational outreach program, for which they constructed an Augmented Reality Sandbox to be used in hands-on educational activities about topography, hydrology, outburst floods, and engineering solutions to mitigate geologic hazard.  The project also funded elementary-school teacher professional development and the development and teaching of curriculum using the Augmented Reality Sandbox to increase STEM (science technology engineering and math) literacy and the participation of underrepresented groups in science.
