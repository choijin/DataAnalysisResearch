<AbstractNarration>The goal of this proposal is to pursue the study of geometry of the trace formula, which commenced with PI's work on the fundamental lemma. A particular emphasis will be put on the limiting form of the trace formula carried out in a previous his joint work with Frenkel and Langlands.  The PI also intends to work on related problems in number theory and topology including: Hausel's conjecture of the topology of Hitchin system, Deligne-Flicker's conjecture on the number of l-adic local systems and the moduli space related to Bhargava-Shankar?s work on the average rank of rational elliptic curve. These problem, in addition to their intrinsic interest, should provide insight PI's main project on the geometry of the trace formula.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With algebraic geometry of moduli space and automorphic representation as basic area of the proposed activity, it should have impact on related mathematical domain as number theory and mathematical physics. The PI will train young mathematician and give them way to some of the most exciting problems in current mathematical research. He will give popular talks on mathematics to school children in order to help them acquiring taste for mathematics and fundamental sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project aims to construct and study properties of certain geometric spaces underlying a new breed of trace formula that has been earlier introduced by Frenkel, Langlands and the PI. The outcomes of this project are threefold:  - the PI has constructed a reductive monoid naturally attached to the combinatorial data defining automorphic L-function. With Bouthier and Sakellaridis, the PI proved that the Frobenius trace function on what should be the stalks of the intersection complex of the arc space of this reductive monoid is the right test function giving rise to unramified local factor of the automorphic L-function;  - with Cheng, the PI studied the kernel of generalized Fourier transform, again attached to automorphic L-function combinatorial data, in the setting of reductive groups over finite fields. With Cheng, the PI proved a conjecture of Braverman and Kazhdan this kernel;  - Based on above-mentioned results, the PI has formulated a new strategy, with detailed intermediate steps, aiming to prove the general functional equation of automorphic L-functions.  The PI has supervised 4 Ph.D. students working on problems related to this project. He also has produced an expository paper, based on his lectures in Park City Mathematics Institute, explaining his ideas using algebraic geometric techniques in proving identities in harmonic analysis including various forms of the fundamental lemma.
