<AbstractNarration>This award will support research to examine the sociocultural factors that shape diet and physical activity practices as they influence nutritional status outcomes among Alaska Native elders (adults aged 65+ years) living in Anchorage. This project will (1) identify and evaluate the influence of sociocultural factors on dietary and physical activity patterns among urban Alaska Native elders, and (2) identify relationships between the sociocultural environment, diet, physical activity, and nutritional status outcomes (BMI) in this population. This 9-month long mixed-methods research study employs participant observation, semi-structured interviews, questionnaires, and anthropometric techniques. Ten to fifteen interviews will be conducted with Alaska Native elders in Anchorage to identify the sociocultural factors that influence diet and physical activity practices. From these data, the investigator will finalize the questionnaires which measures typical foods eaten (food frequency), engagement in physical activities, and the strength of sociocultural influences on these dietary and activity practices (a cultural survey). This questionnaire will be orally administered by the researcher as a structured interview and anthropometric measurements (height, weight, and waist circumference) will be taken with a representative sample of 75 Alaska Native elders in Anchorage. Anthropometric measurements will be used to determine BMI and the prevalence of under weight, normal weight, overweight, and obesity and will be tested with multiple regression techniques to determine the nature of the relationship between sociocultural factors and nutritional status outcomes in this population. The research project has the potential to contribute to a deeper understanding of the social and cultural context of aging and health among urban Alaskan Native elders.</AbstractNarration>
