<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses two roadblocks to reducing the cost of wind energy: the labor-intensive construction process, and size limitations imposed by road or rail transport for turbine components. The former issue drives up manufacturing costs and reduces US competitiveness with countries with inexpensive labor, while the latter forces sub-optimized tower designs and prevents turbines from growing larger and taking advantage of faster, steadier winds at higher hub heights. This project addresses both of these problems by adapting spiral welding - a well-understood system for pipe and piling manufacturing - to wind tower production. Spiral welding is highly automated, requiring as little as 10% of the labor of the equivalent manual process. It also combines multiple operations into a single machine that can be operated on-site, eliminating transport costs and barriers. This project's innovation is to adapt existing spiral welders -that can manufacture only straight,constant wall-thickness pipe - to producing tapered, variable wall thickness towers. A novel material geometry and automated control of machine parameters are the keys to transforming the standard system to one optimized for turbine tower production. With on-site spiral welding of turbine towers, significant reductions in cost of wind energy are possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be felt in many areas: technical,commercial and environmental. The system's major contribution is an increase in the use of wind energy for US electricity, enabled by both reduction in energy cost and increase in the number of cost-effective wind sites. Reducing the cost of tall towers enables increases in the height and size of wind turbines, allowing them to reach and be optimized for steadier, higher speed winds. With these increase in size and optimization, decreases in cost of wind energy of 12% (for 120m tall towers) or more are possible. In addition, the US land area for which wind energy is cost effective can be doubled at 120m hub heights. Spiral-welding of turbine towers also provides US jobs and increases American competitiveness with overseas producers. Because on-site production is inherently local, manufacturing jobs are created in the communities where wind turbines are installed. Also, this method gives local production a major cost advantage over imports by producing towers that are too large to transport from port to wind farm. This allows domestic manufacturing to not only compete, but dominate in a domestic tower market worth roughly $1B in 2011.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Keystone Tower Systems is developing a manufacturing system that adapts spiral welding to the production of wind turbine towers.  The high throughput of spiral welding enables wind turbine towers to be produced substantially faster and more efficiently than standard manufacturing methods, reducing costs for towers that can be produced in factories and enabling on-site production of towers that would be too large to ship.  These larger towers greatly reduce the cost of wind energy by lifting the turbine into the stronger, steadier winds that are present at higher heights.  This not only reduces energy costs in sites that are favorable for wind production today, but  also increases the economically developable wind resource, in the US and worldwide.  Keystone?s on-site produced tall towers can:   Double the US available wind resource Open all 50 states to economical power generation from wind, and bring wind development closer to load centers (see Figure) Lower the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) from wind, reducing or eliminating the need for subsidies Shift tower manufacturing from foreign factories to on-site operations in the US   Keystone?s tapered spiral welding machine is based on traditional spiral welding technology: a high productivity, highly automated system that is used to produce pipe and pilings, both in factory environments and at the work site.  In order to produce wind towers, this system must be modified to achieve: 1) variable diameter, for the conical wind tower shape; 2) variable wall thickness, for efficient material usage; and 3) very tight geometrical tolerances, which are set to assure tower strength and lifetime.  Keystone?s system borrows many of the elements of traditional spiral welding machines but adds advanced actuation and control systems to implement these added requirements.  In this NSF SBIR project, Keystone developed these additional systems and implemented them on a scale-prototype tapered spiral welding system.  The insights, experience and system designs gained from this work will lead directly to development and commercialization of the first full-scale tapered spiral welding system.  Major achievements and systems developed during the SBIR project include:  Sheet steering: the material that is to be rolled and welded into wind turbine towers must be steered through the rolling and joining process along a specified path, to ensure correct fit-up, roundness, etc.  Keystone developed a position sensing and feed-back system to ensure correct path-following. Thickness transitions: Unlike pipe and pilings, wind towers must contain material of varying thickness, to avoid extreme excess of weight (and cost) that would occur if only a single thickness were used.  Keystone developed a system, combining system control and material geometry, enabling a transition in sheet thickness to be rolled into a conical tower that meets geometric tolerance requirements.   Fit-up : The material must be fit-up and joined in a continuous process, to take advantage of the high throughput of the spiral welding method.  Keystone developed a set of fit-up modules that, along with an advanced control system, continuously achieve within-specification fit-up for the weld process and final wind tower.  Fit-up and error correction modeling: The tapered spiral welding fit-up system must achieve within-specification fit-up at all times, while tolerating small errors in areas such as machine operation and material geometry. Keystone developed error modeling tools that allow evaluation of the effects of any system errors and enable design of mitigating control system algorithms.   Tower-tower transitions:  In the continuously-operating spiral welding system, it is important to avoid excessive downtime in the transition from one tower to the next. To minimize both lost time and scrap material, Keystone developed a transition method that allows material to be continuously fed through the system, while requiring only a short pause to sever one tower and re-start the next. Commercial scale system: Based on research and experience gained during this SBIR project, Keystone has developed the control algorithms and architecture, and identified the major hardware, required to implement tapered spiral welding at the commercial scale.     Together, these achievements leave Keystone well-prepared to implement a commercial scale tapered spiral welding system.
