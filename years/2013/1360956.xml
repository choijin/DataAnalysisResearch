<AbstractNarration>The proposed project examines retention of diverse, engineering graduates in engineering careers by investigating how students perceive their career options, engineering skills, and educational experiences relate to their plans and to engage engineering educators and industry professionals in using our research findings to reform undergraduate engineering education. Undergraduates at six institutions from their junior year to their first year post-graduation will be evaluated using qualitative and quantitative research.  The community of practice element will convene stakeholders at each partner institution who are invested in translating the results from this project into educational practice. A Professional Pathways Model that explains how students beliefs about their career options and their own abilities affect their career decisions will be proposed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[PEPS OUTCOMES REPORT Final WHAT IS THE PROBLEM? Concerns about a shortage of engineers have led to calls to increase engineering retention. Yet, these calls often focus on retention in the major or among experienced workers and fail to consider the significant numbers of engineering students who leave the field almost immediately after graduation. To increase retention during the college-career transition, we must learn more about the factors contributing to early career engineering attrition, and particularly, "problematic attrition" (where an individual is "pushed away" from engineering by negative factors). Our study begins bridging this gap by following students from college into the postgraduate world enabling us to study how students? first career decisions unfold. Our study focuses on students? transition from their junior year to the first year after earning their bachelor?s degrees, as this enables us to explore what happens right before and right after they graduate. This national study draws on data from six U.S. institutions, and has a specific objective of bridging research findings to practice. Our mixed-methods study, based on career professional staff interviews and student surveys and interviews, addresses the following research questions: &#9679;      How do engineering students develop beliefs about their career options and abilities? &#9679;      How do these beliefs influence their career plans and preparation over time? &#9679;      How might research findings on students? beliefs and plans be used in improving career development services?   WHAT WE LEARNED---STUDENTS We surveyed juniors and seniors at our partner schools in Fall 2016, and again, one year later. Results indicate that student?s confidence in two areas, career exploration and job acquisition, are highly related and influenced by a common set of experiences, including having had an internship/co-op, having been a student leader, and taking courses that emphasizing engineering careers or skills. Some of the most impactful campus resources on students? career confidence, such as company visits and mock interviews, were found to be the least utilized among students. With respect to people, students most sought out career help from academic advisors, faculty, other students, and family members. Career counselors were sought out least and, usually, not until senior year. We also interviewed 62 survey respondents majoring in mechanical or chemical engineering. Similar to the survey results, analyses revealed four main socializer groups: family, peers, university individuals, and work individuals. How socializers influence students appears to be domain-specific, with family members influencing students? thinking about specific jobs and peers influencing their job exploration more broadly. WHAT WE LEARNED---CAREER PROFESSIONALS  Across our six partner institutions, we interviewed administrators, faculty, and staff regarding their perceptions of students preparedness for their first position after graduation and the role of career services and faculty in this regard. Findings revealed that the career services and advising offered varied across institutions. One site used high student contact means to proactively support student career search goals at an institutional level, while career services at other sites consisted mainly of individual departments directing students to resources if they request help. We also identified key behaviors and beliefs of career service professionals related to engineering students? career development, which were further characterized within career exploration, career skills, or job acquisition. Our findings suggest that career service professionals believe that while engineering students graduate with sound engineering skills, acquiring a job requires a dynamic set of professional and interpersonal skills that may not be fully addressed within engineering curriculum. An example of the impact of this study on a partner institution is illustrated by new career services implemented at San Jose State University.  Prompted by institutional-specific data that showed its relatively low counselor-to-student ratios, and comparatively low student awareness about career resources on campus and knowledge, skills and abilities required to obtain the first job after graduation, a gamified strategy was implemented involving online modules and in-person activities called Passport to Career Success, where students earn points for completion of career discovery and achievement of milestones, which are then redeemable for prizes. IN SUMMARY  The FORMAL ENGINEERING CURRICULUM largely focuses on helping students develop engineering skills and abilities.  When career-related options and skills are included, they contribute to student confidence in engineering, as well as confidence in career discovery and job acquisition skills. Engagement in EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES (including internships) has positive career discovery and engineering skills payoffs.  The group that supports students? sense of preparedness/confidence in career discovery and job acquisition skills is not homogeneous, with FACULTY,  INDUSTRY CONTACTS and FRIENDS playing particularly strong roles.  Because the group that supports students in developing career- and job-related skills is not homogeneous and a variety of activities (both inside and outside the classroom) contribute to students? preparedness it is challenging to identify the "customers" are for Career-related research findings.  Our Purdue and SJSU examples show how Career Services might use such findings.          Last Modified: 11/30/2018       Submitted by: Ruth A Streveler]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
