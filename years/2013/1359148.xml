<AbstractNarration>This project is a continuation of a program in Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of North Texas (UNT).  The Department of Political Science at the UNT runs this unique program to provide 30 undergraduate students (recruited from across the country) the opportunity to engage in graduate-level research in conflict management and peace science, in a senior faculty-mentored, in-residence, eight- week, Summer Research Experience that integrates training in civil conflict management with training in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and geospatial analysis. In this program, student articipants develop theoretical propositions that are tested empirically using geocoded data and report their findings in a national professional political science conference. Activities include workshops on theory development and research methodology, GIS, and the graduate school application process. There are also activities designed to build a sense of research community among students, faculty and graduate student mentors.  Training in conflict management that includes populations historically underrepresented in higher education (but which are growing as a proportion of the undergraduate student population) is a national imperative. This program seeks to address the need to develop further expertise in conflict management and peace science by providing opportunities to engage in advanced empirical research to students from such populations, students who would not otherwise have such research opportunities. UNT is well positioned, both institutionally and geographically, to provide such access. To that end, the PI-team secured formal commitments from the Hispanic and Native American Serving Institutions and from Historically Black Colleges/ Universities (HBCU) in Texas and Oklahoma, and the Ronald E. McNair Program at UNT to assist in broadening the pool of applicants to the program. The growing frequency of civil conflicts in the world and the security concerns these conflicts pose for the United States, the development of human capital that is equipped to deal with these challenges is critical for the national security of the country. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual focus of the program is on civil conflict management and the enhancement of peace. Indeed since 1945 civil conflicts-civil war, revolution, secessionist war, and ethnic and sectarian violence-has replaced interstate war as the most frequent and deadly form of armed conflict in the world. The program seeks to focus on understanding the causes of civil conflict occurrence (or reoccurrence) by examining sub-state data. In particular, the goal is to train students in theory building and empirical analytical skills, which will promote innovative thinking and problem solving skills. Developing skills in geospatial analysis provides undergraduate program participants with cutting edge tools to understand the causes of conflict, and hence better prepare them to devise innovative solutions regarding civil conflict management.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals and objectives for the program which were consistent with promoting the intellectual development of undergraduates in conducting graduate level research in Conflict and Peace Science (intellectual merit) and access to graduate level research training to students who do not normally have such opportunities (broader impacts), are listed below.   Major Goals:  1) to provide 10 undergraduate students (recruited from across the country) the opportunity to engage in graduate-level research in conflict management and peace studies, in a senior faculty-mentored, in-residence, eight- week, Summer Research Experience (SRE) that integrates training in civil conflict management with training in Geographic Information systems.  2)  Participants will use propositional calculus and simulations to develop theoretical propositions that will be tested empirically.   3) Participants will collect and analyze empirical data and report their findings in a national professional political science conference.  4)  Activities will include workshops on Geographic Information Systems, research methodology, and the graduate school application process.   The Specific Annual objectives (from 2014-17) were:  Ten undergraduate students  will  engage in a senior faculty-mentored, in residence, eight-week, Summer Research Experience (SRE) At least four of those students, or 40% will be recruited from other colleges and universities beyond the University of North Texas. At least four of the participants (40%) will be recruited from colleges and universities that do not offer a Ph.D. in political science (this is a measure of whether students come from institutions where participants do not already have access to research opportunities)   All participants (or 100%) will produce papers of graduate level quality All participants ( or 100%) will demonstrate improvement in the knowledge of the research process and  improvement in research skills The greatest majority of participants (66%) will apply and gain entrance to graduate school programs.    The results of the program are listed below      Table 1:  Summary of Goals   and Program Performance 2014-2017           2014    2015    2016    Total      Goal 1 (Ten undergraduate   students  will  engage in a senior faculty-mentored, in residence,   eight-week, Summer Research Experience (SRE)       10    10    10    30 (100% of goal met)      Goal 2 (At least four of those   students, or 40% will be recruited from other colleges and universities   beyond the University of North Texas)    8/10    8/10    10/10    26/30 (86.67%, goal exceeded)      Goal3 At least four of the   participants (40%) will be recruited from colleges and universities that do   not offer a Ph.D. in political science (this is a measure of whether students   come from institutions where participants do not already have access to   research opportunities)    4/10    4/10    9/10    17/30 (56.67%, goal exceeded)      Goal 4 All participants (or 100%)   will produce papers of graduate level quality    10    10    10    30/30 (100% goal met)      Goal 5 All participants (or 100%)   will demonstrate improvement in the knowledge of the research process   and  improvement in research skills    10    10    10    30/30 (100%, goal met)      Goal 6: The greatest majority of   participants (66%) will apply and gain entrance to graduate school programs    8/10    8/10    8/10    24/30 (80% gained entrance into   graduate school as of  March 2017, goal exceeded)         Further, it should be noted that 11/30 participants were from groups underrepresented in Higher Education (36.7%), and 14/30 (46.7%) were from first generation college backgrounds.
