<AbstractNarration>This project will create a simulation facility that will advance a capability to study the social interactions of two children, or a child and parent, as the two people walk or bicycle across a traffic-filled roadway. The project will expand existing infrastructure at the University of Iowa to build a new simulator that matches a recently installed simulator at the same institution, which will permit each of two experimental participants to inhabit their own separate simulated environment. The two simulators will be connected by a high-speed network and programmed to share a single, virtual environment that can be configured for either bicycling or walking. Experimental participants will control their motion by actually walking or cycling across these virtual intersections, surrounded by graphically rendered images that show a real-time, first-person view of their motion through the environment. A full-body motion tracking system will be used to create high-fidelity avatars that represent participant motions to provide a realistic experience of walking or riding with a friend or parent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On the computational side, this research will advance the technology for immersive, interactive virtual environments by developing methods to represent full-body movements in avatars moving through large-scale environments, and by studying how the fidelity of avatar movements influences rider and pedestrian interactions. On the behavioral side, this research will advance an understanding of social influences on risk taking by studying how children interact with friends or parents in the context of crossing roads, an everyday and yet risky activity. The reciprocal relations between the computational and behavioral components of this project will motivate creative solutions to the computational challenges that arise in creating realistic avatars and semi-autonomous agents and will enable new discoveries about the psychological processes underlying risky road-crossing behavior within the context of a virtual environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will help to address public health problems by contributing to an understanding of the risk factors for car-bicycle and car-pedestrian collisions. The project will create a foundation for future intervention studies that will help to reduce such collisions. Advances in simulation technology, experimental methodology, and methods to create life-like avatars will contribute to the development of virtual environments for use in behavioral research and simulation-based training. The results of this work will be disseminated to the public through scientific publications and presentations, along with community-based activities such as open house events and bicycling/pedestrian safety lectures for the public.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The primary goal of this interdisciplinary project was to upgrade and expand our facilities by building a new immersive virtual environment in which to conduct studies of pedestrian and bicyclist road crossing.&nbsp; The virtual environment consists of three large screens placed at right angles relative to one another, forming a three-walled room (10 feet wide x 14.2 feet long x 8 feet tall). Three stereo projectors rear-project images onto the front and side screens, and a fourth projector that front-projects stereo images onto the floor. The length of the side screens make it possible for participants to physically walk across a single lane of virtual traffic, allowing for a highly realistic, grounded experience in the virtual environment. When configured as a bicycling simulator, a bicycle mounted on a stationary frame sits 5 ft. from the front and side screens. The bike is instrumented to sense both steering angle and rear wheel rotation.</p> <p>The new system was connected by a high-speed network to our previously built virtual environment and programmed so that the two systems can share a single, integrated virtual world that can be configured for either bicycling or walking.&nbsp; This makes it possible for two participants, each in their own large-screen display system, to control their motion by actually walking or virtually cycling across intersections, surrounded by graphically rendered images that show a real-time, first-person view of their motion.
