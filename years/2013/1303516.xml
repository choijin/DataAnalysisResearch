<AbstractNarration>Jos√© Itzigsohn&lt;br/&gt;Marcelo A. Bohrt&lt;br/&gt;Brown University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Struggles over racial boundaries are a perennial feature of racialized societies -- where social, political, and economic resources are differentially distributed along racial lines. Yet, most studies of the transformation of racialized societies adopt a macro-level political and institutional perspective, overlooking how transformation is experienced, perceived, and participated in by concrete actors, on the ground. The project promises to make the following contributions to the study of race and racial boundaries: (1) to examine how racial discourses inform the transformation of state institutional logics, and the ways in which the racial/cultural identities of bureaucrats shape and are shaped by everyday organizational interactions; (2) to reveal how race works by examining how racial boundaries are maintained, challenged, and changed in everyday life; and (3) to better specify the link between everyday discourses and practices in the transformation of racial boundaries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through 12 months of ethnographic research and interviews this project studies the micro-dynamics of state decolonization, and the articulation of a new state structure in Bolivia. The research focuses on one facet of the larger project, the decolonization of public administration, which has, in part, resulted in the opening up of positions within the civil service to indigenous men and women. Following the process of decolonization of one state agency and using the sociological concepts of symbolic and social boundaries as analytical tools, this research seeks to understand how, in the context of macro-political change, bureaucrats on the ground interpret, negotiate, and rearticulate racial boundaries and institutional change, and to what effect.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will have practical implications of relevance to policy practitioners. It will shed light on the generally obscured area between official racial policies and their implementation on the ground. The lessons learned could possibly inform institutional change beyond the public sector and in other contexts. These lessons are important in light of the resilience of racial inequalities despite policies that seek to address them. In addition, this project will build and promote lasting research collaboration networks between researchers in Bolivia and the United States.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As a political sociologist of race, Marcelo A. Bohrt is interested in how people understand, experience and participate in ethnoracial change. With the support of the NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant, Bohrt completed research for his dissertation entitled "Racial Boundaries and the Dynamics of Transformation." During the funding period, he spent one year in La Paz, Bolivia, documenting changes in national public administration and the experiences of public servants under the government√Üs decolonization project. Bohrt was interested in understanding the micro-politics of the decolonization of public administration, which aims to incorporate formerly excluded indigenous populations and knowledge into the state bureaucracy. He specifically interrogated how bureaucrats inhabiting a new political and institutional context interpret and negotiate ethnoracial boundaries and institutional norms and practices in the everyday organizational life of a state agency, and to what effect.   During his time in Bolivia, Bohrt interviewed current and former public servants, gathered documents and news reports, and conducted participant observation within a national-level state agency. As an intern and researcher in a state agency undergoing change, including ethnoracial recomposition, Bohrt observed and documented the day-to-day workings and social life of the state bureaucracy and its entanglements with race and ethnicity. Bohrt confirmed that the Morales government and its project of change brought about a new generation of public employees, or a new guard.

Rather than simply studying the experience of the new guard, Bohrt focused on the encounters between the new and old guards. From such unique vantage point, Bohrt was able to move beyond the study of the historical relation between race/ethnicity and state building, and instead foreground the everyday (un)making of state bureaucracy as an ethnoracialized practice.  Bohrt√Üs research showed that state bureaucratic practice is embedded in competing narratives of race, nation and modernity, and particularly highlighted how ethnoracial boundaries, meanings and identities shape, and are shaped by it.

Drawing on diverse work on the state, race/ethnicity and culture within sociology, his dissertation is an important contribution because it reveals how ethnoracial projects shape modern bureaucratic practice.
