<AbstractNarration>This action funds Nicholas Craig von Sternberg of the University of Houston to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at the Dynamic Systems and Control Laboratory of National Tsing Hua University in Hsinchu, Taiwan. The project title is "Further Optimization of a Robot Inspired by Tai-Chi." The host scientist is Professor Ting-Jen Yeh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research lies within the research and development of a power-efficient walking robot. The applied power-saving technique, which was inspired by the ancient martial art of Tai-Chi, involves motion planning to use minimal actuation power to maintain balance at each point in the gait-cycle and disable unnecessary actuators. Further experimental analysis is being performed to determine additional power saving potential from the use of hybrid stepper motors and a custom controller in place of servomotors. This experiment is a result of the collaborative use of theory, hardware, and software developed by two geographically and culturally independent universities. The results of these projects could result in more power-efficient, environment friendly, walking robots with longer operation times; such robots could be used to increase the livelihood of the elderly or disabled, assist in tasks of daily life, or enter a hazardous situation in place of a human being.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>
