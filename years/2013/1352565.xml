<AbstractNarration>Seismicity on mid-ocean ridge transform faults (RTFs) is remarkably systematic and this study will explore the physical reasons for this unusual predictability in earthquake behavior. Transform fault length and plate tectonic slip rate are the basis of global scaling relations that robustly estimate the size of the largest earthquake, the seismic coupling, and the repeat time of the largest earthquakes on most RTFs. However, the processes that create this regularity in RTF seismic cycles and that limit the size of their largest earthquakes are unknown. This integrated research and education project comprises two main components:  A comprehensive analysis of RTF structure from high-resolution multibeam bathymetry and finite element modeling of RTFs; Derivation of earthquake source parameters on typical (Gofar) and atypical (Clipperton) RTFs to compare along strike variation in seismic coupling and fault properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ultimate aim of this project is to improve seismic hazard assessment by determining if time-dependent hazard models, which describe hazard as being low following a large earthquake and building with time, actually reflect the underlying mechanics of fault slip on geometrically simple faults. Part of the study will be completed through undergraduate class projects, with students trained in the use of geophysical datasets and resources. Two graduate students will gain research experience. Basic concepts on earthquake generation and predictability will be conveyed to high school physics teachers through simple analog experiments that are one component of a new professional development workshop. High school physics curricula will be developed as an outcome of the Summer workshops, and university students will gain educational experience working in the classroom with the teachers throughout the following school year.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Through this NSF CAREER award, I integrated research with mentoring and teaching to increase our understanding of why mid-ocean ridge transform faults (RTFs) exhibit some of the most predictable behaviors known to seismicity.  Specifically, I targeted five key questions with the results described below.  1. Does fault segmentation limit the size of oceanic transform fault earthquakes?    We first delineated the structure of the global set of oceanic transform faults at higher resolution than in previous studies (5-km scale vs. 35-km scale) and found that segmentation on length scales &ge; 5 km is not responsible for limiting the size of the largest RTF earthquakes.  Second, we compared the structure and seismicity at Discovery Transform Fault on the East Pacific Rise, where persistent rupture patches and rupture barriers are observed and where we had higher resolution bathymetry (&lt;1 km resolution) and local seismic recordings from an ocean bottom seismic dataset. At Discovery, large step overs in the fault trace are not required to terminate earthquakes.  Rather, minor offsets (&lt; 1 km) in the fault strike likely lead to the variation in fault properties that in turn limit the size of the largest repeating earthquakes.  Third, we used 3-D finite element simulations to calculate thermal structures and mantle flow fields underlying segmented RTFs.  From these models, we derived an empirical scaling relation for the critical step over length that marks the transition from predominantly horizontal to predominantly vertical mantle flow at the base of the lithosphere under a step over. We then define three degrees of segmentation that characterize step overs along transform faults and provide insight into frictional processes, seismogenic behavior, and melt transport.  Part of this work on segmentation was completed through undergraduate and graduate student course projects and capstone senior research projects, where students were trained in the use of geophysical datasets and resources, and the results were presented at an Undergraduate Research Conference.  2. What physical conditions cause some faults to produce larger or smaller than expected earthquakes?  In our global analysis of RTF structure and seismicity, we found five anomalous faults, where in each case fault structure provided clues as to why the seismicity deviated from the global scaling relations.  Related to this question, we initiated professional development workshops for high school teachers that demonstrated connections between earthquake science and the Next Generation Science Standards.  We focused on in-class experimentation using a brick and sandpaper earthquake machine.  The teachers developed their own curriculum and were given a set of these simple earthquake machines to use in their classroom.  3. How regular are the quasi-periodic seismic cycles on RTFs?  We found time-dependent hazard models, which describe hazard as being low following a large earthquake and building with time, do reflect the underlying mechanics of fault slip on geometrically simple faults. Specifically, we found that a Bayesian combination of time-dependent models with a mean recurrence interval of 5.5 years a coefficient of variation of 0.2 best described the observed repeat times of oceanic transform fault earthquakes.  This information is critical for hazard model development on more societally relevant faults with longer recurrence intervals.  4. Do most RTFs have fully-coupled regions that repeatedly rupture in large earthquakes?  Using a surface wave cross-correlation relocation technique, we identified 19 fully-coupled rupture patches on six East Pacific Rise and Juan de Fuca Ridge transform faults, each with multiple earthquakes between 1990-2020.  However, while many moderate to fast slipping transform faults do have fully-coupled rupture patches, other nearby transform faults, including Quebrada in the Gofar, Discovery, and Quebrada system, do not exhibit the same behavior.   5. Can variations in fault rheology be inferred from the source parameters of earthquakes that nucleate within repeating rupture patches compared with those that nucleate between rupture patches.  Yes!  From the spectral analysis of the earthquakes on Gofar Transform Fault, we find that stress drops are 3-5 times lower on average in rupture barriers compared with rupture patches and correlate with the degree of damage in a region.  As a large earthquake passes through a region it causes damage, fracturing the surrounding rock and resulting in lower earthquake stress drops following the event compared with before.
