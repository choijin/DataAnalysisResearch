<AbstractNarration>Illinois State University (ISU) proposes a project -- Teacher Education in Computer Science (TECS) -- which will create an innovative structure for preparing in-service and future high school teachers to teach Computer Science (CS). Although the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) has established standards for a CS Endorsement, currently there are no CS Teacher Education programs in the state. This project will create a state-approved program of study at ISU so that upon its completion, teaches will be well-positioned to pass the certification exam for the CS Endorsement. The TECS curriculum will mesh with existing ISU Mathematics and Technology teacher education major requirements, so that student teachers and in-service teachers in those fields can efficiently obtain the CS endorsement, making TECS graduates highly employable. The TECS program will recruit in-service math and technology teachers from school districts in 50-mile radius of ISU, as well as ISU students from Mathematics Teacher Education (MTE) and Technology &amp; Engineering Education (T&amp;EE). The TECS curriculum will be created by an interdisciplinary team of ISU faculty, out of existing courses from CS, Mathematics, and Technology, with advice from the NSF-funded "Taste of Computing" team in Chicago. UCLA's Gail Chapman will provide a design for a new CS teaching methods course to be added to existing courses, to be piloted in cooperation with the Taste of Computing institutions. Faculty and student learning communities will be formed to foster an academic, social, and cultural environment to successfully implement the TECS program. The project will utilize advanced CS majors for peer-tutoring and mentoring TECS students. Scholarships will be provided as needed for pre-service and in-service teachers in TECS. Especially for in-service teachers, TECS will offer evening, summer, or online classes. Continual multi-faceted evaluation of learning outcomes and program operation will include competency-based tests and attitude measures for TECS participants, and feedback forms for participating faculty, peer-tutors and mentors, professionals, and student teaching supervisors. The project will host statewide annual summits for relevant educators, industry representatives, and state officials to raise awareness and promote quality CS education in Illinois schools. The ISU administration, MTE and T&amp;EE Directors, and district administrators of surrounding school districts (like Bloomington, Dunlap, and Peoria) and Chicago Public Schools are highly supportive of the TECS program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Goals  The major goal of this project was to put into place a sustainable structure for providing quality CS teacher preparation to current and future Illinois high school and middle school teachers, and support the spread of newly-developed CS courses, such as the NSF-supported Exploring Computer Science (ECS) course, and the Computer Science Principles (CSP) AP course, in Illinois high schools.   Significant Results  1. Creation of the Teacher Education in Computer Science (TECS) curriculum, with clearance from the Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE), at Illinois State University (ISU):  The project created a TECS curriculum at ISU that was reviewed and cleared by the ISBE; TECS satisfies ISBE's stated standards for CS endorsement on an Illinois teaching license in another field.

Illinois State University (ISU) Student Advising and Recruiting into TECS:  The project developed four-year TECS plans of study for undergraduates in Mathematics Teacher Education (MTE) and in Technology and Engineering Education (T&amp;EE) in consultation with the faculty and advisors in those programs. These are posted online for students, university academic advisors and faculty, and will be reviewed by relevant departments as part of regular curriculum update.  4. CS Teacher Development for Chicago Public Schools (CPS) and Chicagoland School Districts:  The project created a joint Illinois State / NEIU (Northeastern Illinois University) version of the ISU TECS program offering TECS courses in the evenings and summers in Chicago and leading to ISU’s being able to recommend Chicago-area teachers for the CS endorsement.  5. CS Teacher Development for Central Illinois School Districts:  The project has put in place a structure to serve teachers from Central Illinois school districts who aspire to earn the CS endorsement, by working with relevant ISU departments to offer evening and summer classes at ISU so teachers are able to complete the TECS curriculum, leading to ISU’s being able to recommend the teachers for the CS endorsement.  6. TECS Website:  The TECS website created by the project is updated and revised as part of ISU's website updates. See http://tecs.illinoisstate.edu  7. Building Connections with Local Businesses in Support of CS Courses in Middle- and High-Schools:   The PIs have been instrumental in building connections with major firms headquartered in Illinois and they have been providing significant resources to enable central Illinois and Chicagoland schools to offer CS courses, in addition to providing incentives for teachers to earn CS endorsement.   Scalability  The model exemplified in this project has the potential for replication; successful recruiting into TECS program from current teachers and existing teacher education majors has yielded enormous dividends. The results obtained from designing TECS for allied teacher education majors are applicable at other institutions. Pre-service and in-service teachers in who are interested in computing, may complete the TECS program and seek CS endorsement.   Sustainability  A growing and sustained need for CS teachers in high schools ensures that the TECS program remains relevant beyond the tenure of this project. The project has built bridges between academic units that will allow for continuous update of the TECS curriculum, making the ISU TECS program a role model for other institutions.     Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts  Creating a path for in-service and pre-service teachers to teach CS without having to complete a new major or minor represents an innovative approach to creating a sustainable infrastructure that will produce a continual supply of CS-endorsed middle- and high-school teachers without recurring professional development costs to school districts or granting agencies. Completion of the TECS program and passing the certification exam leads to the addition of a CS Endorsement to an Illinois teaching credential in some other field.  For in-service teachers, the TECS courses fulfill their continuing education requirements while earning them a new teaching credential. Regarding pre-service teachers, it is possible to count some of the same course work for both the TECS program and for the teacher-education major; therefore, students are able to complete the TECS program with minimal additional coursework and no additional student teaching time. Thus, the TECS program is a potentially feasible and attractive option for both in-service and pre-service teachers.  Assuming, as expected, that increasing high school student interest in CS leads to increased production of CS degrees, the ultimate broad impact of a project like this is an increased support for the nation’s innovation through technology efforts.
