<AbstractNarration>The goal of this collaborative program is to use the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and morphologies of infrared luminous galaxies to study galaxy formation and evolution.  The SED will allow inference of the physical conditions in a galaxy such as the role of an active galactic nucleus in heating the dust.  Together with the observed morphology, the program will determine the mode of star formation, and whether it occurs primarily through galaxy mergers or by continuous gas accretion onto the galaxy from the intergalactic medium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate students, a publicly released SED library, and a publicly released galaxy evolution modeling code.</AbstractNarration>
