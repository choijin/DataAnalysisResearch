<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on an international collaboration between US students from the University of South Florida (USF) and students and researchers from the University of Science and Technology of Beijing (USTB) China to conduct research related to Advanced Materials. For twelve weeks, the teams of students will study advanced aspects of Materials Science, specifically focusing on thin films and nanostructures, fracture and corrosion. They will be supervised by three professors at USTB, Xiaolu Pang, Kewei Gao and Lijie Qiao, along with the Principal Investigator. US students will travel to Beijing for three months each of three summers. Training in materials characterization will be provided to students from USF prior to the international visit to ensure that they make meaningful contributions and have a stimulating international research experience. Students will be encouraged to publish their scientific results in journals. Students will also be encouraged to disseminate and share their experience through presentations to diverse audiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As a result of this project, advanced materials will be developed and the results of the research will be published and disseminated through presentations.  Students will form professional networks. Overall, this project will contribute to the development of a new generation of researchers trained with multidisciplinary and international skills.</AbstractNarration>

In the summer of 2015 Sarah McMaster (graduate), Dr. Rebecca Cai (faculty) and Travis Ingraham (undergraduate) conducted research at USTB. In the summer of 2016 Vladislav Yakubov (undergraduate), Tasha Williams (undergraduate) and Oluwawole Oyeleke (undergraduate) conducted research at USTB. In the summer of 2017 Vladislav Paley (undergraduate) and Yakubov (undergraduate) conducted research at USTB. In the summer of 2018 Moses Gekhtman (undergraduate), Paley, Yakubov (graduate), Megan Hostetter (undergraduate) and El-Zhawary (undergraduate) conducted research at USTB and HUST. Five minority students participated in the project. As a result of the work conducted over 100 research papers have been published. Students gained hands-on experience with advanced deposition and characterization equipment, significantly improving their research skills. Three of the undergraduate students decided to pursue Ph.D. degrees as a result of the research they conducted in China.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/10/2019<br>      Modified by: Alex&nbsp;A&nbsp;Volinsky</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1358088/1358088_10313440_1552222555631_USF-IRES_Highlights-JPG--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1358088/1358088_10313440_1552222555631_USF-IRES_Highlights-JPG--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Edge Geometry Effects on Resonance Response of Electroplated Cylindrical Ni/PZT/Ni Magnetoelectric Composites"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1358088/1358088_10313440_1552222555631_USF-IRES_Highlights-JPG--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Edge Geometry Effects on Resonance Response of Electroplated Cylindrical Ni/PZT/Ni Magnetoelectric Composites"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Edge Geometry Effects on Resonance Response of Electroplated Cylindrical Ni/PZT/Ni Magnetoelectric Composites</div> <div class="imageCredit">V.
