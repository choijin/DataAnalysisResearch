<AbstractNarration>Cloud computing is emerging as an attractive computing paradigm, where&lt;br/&gt;both hardware and software resources can be leased from a cloud&lt;br/&gt;provider to achieve better economy of scale, elasticity, availability,&lt;br/&gt;and flexibility for a plethora of services. A major challenge in&lt;br/&gt;designing such cloud platforms is in providing high and predictable&lt;br/&gt;performance along with Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees. The&lt;br/&gt;performance unpredictability is attributed to a myriad of factors&lt;br/&gt;including system scale, workload dynamism, virtualization overheads,&lt;br/&gt;resource sharing and contention.&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to investigate performance&lt;br/&gt;enhancement and performance quantification techniques in a cloud&lt;br/&gt;environment through three intertwined tasks.&lt;br/&gt;First, a comprehensive scheduling framework consisting of a high-level&lt;br/&gt;job scheduler and a fine-grained resource manager will be developed&lt;br/&gt;for efficient management of cloud resources for performance enhancement.&lt;br/&gt;Second, performance prediction models will be developed for estimating&lt;br/&gt;job completion time (JCT) in a cloud platform.&lt;br/&gt;Third, for providing QoS guarantees, a control-theoretic model&lt;br/&gt;incorporating the proposed scheduler and analytical models will be&lt;br/&gt;developed. Measurements on real platforms with MapReduce &lt;br/&gt;and other representative cloud workloads will be used to validate the&lt;br/&gt;proposed ideas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research addresses one of the main concerns of cloud computing -&lt;br/&gt;What are the performance implications if my application is moved to a&lt;br/&gt;cloud? If successful in answering this question, it would have a tremendous&lt;br/&gt;impact on the cloud-enabled application domains. The cross-cutting&lt;br/&gt;nature of this work can foster new research avenues.&lt;br/&gt;In addition to undergraduate and graduate student training in areas&lt;br/&gt;such as architecture, distributed systems, and performance modeling,&lt;br/&gt;special attention will be given to involving women and minority&lt;br/&gt;students in this project. The modeling tools and techniques developed&lt;br/&gt;in this research will be made publicly available.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
