<AbstractNarration>The Texas A&amp;M International University (TAMIU) Robert Noyce Mathematics Teacher Scholarship Program is supporting thirty-six individuals in becoming highly-qualified teachers committed to teaching mathematics in high-need high schools in the Laredo, Texas area.  The project is increasing the collaboration between mathematics faculty in the College of Arts and Sciences and faculty in the College of Education, to ensure well-prepared teachers enter the workforce.  To support the effort, the project is adding an integrated course that combines mathematics content and teaching pedagogy preparation, all based on best practices research.  Scholars are being supported through Professional Development workshops, membership in the Texas Council of Teachers of Mathematics, and travel to an annual mathematics conference.  The scholars being awarded Noyce support are recruited both from students already enrolled at TAMIU and those graduating from Laredo Community College who are academically strong in mathematics and continuing their higher education at TAMIU.  To aid in recruiting talented students who might otherwise not consider a teaching career, thirty-six, one-month-long summer internships are offered to freshmen or sophomores at the place of their choosing.  These hands-on internships occur at the Laredo Community College Lamar Bruni Vergara Environmental Science Center or at the Imaginarium of South Texas.  Working with students on mathematics project in these informal settings is reinforcing participants' career choices.  The school districts partnering with TAMIU include the Laredo Independent School District and the United Independent School District.  To help address the sense of professional isolation that too often leads to lack of retention in newly hired teachers, the project is supporting scholars during the induction period both with face-to-face and virtual mentor that includes both an education faculty and a mathematics faculty member.</AbstractNarration>

Among the many successes of the program was identifying the evidence-based strategies that enhance the retention of the workforce of teachers, who are sufficiently equipped to accept the challenges in high-need school districts through the multifaceted components unique to the program. These included: week-long bootcamps for recruitment, mandatory mentoring for all scholars, Texas Examinations of Educator Standards (TExES) weekend review sessions, summer internship programs, conference participation, and active participation in other Noyce forums, including attendance at the Noyce Regional Conferences and Noyce Summits. Several journal articles stemming from this unique experience were published. Passing TExES became an essential part to continue with the Block III courses in their final semester. The Pedagogy and Professional Responsibilities (PPR) exam is administered to all those seeking teaching certification. This, together with TExES, are needed to receive a teaching certificate in the state of Texas. All graduates from the Noyce scholarship program were immensely prepared to take up positions of Mathematics teaching upon their graduation. Block III courses are carefully tailored for pre-service teachers to gain necessary clinical, field, and student teaching experiences prior to their graduation.
