<AbstractNarration>The principal investigators will purchase a new instrument (a mass spectrometer) that they will use for two main purposes.  They will perform chemical analyses on cave deposits collected from caves in North America, South America, and Eurasia. The analyses will provide information about the climate history at each of the cave sites.  The climate records will provide us with an idea of the extent of natural climate change, how much, how rapid, how extensive geographically.  They will also help us to understand the causes of natural climate change.  The principal investigators will also use the new mass spectrometer to develop capabilities for more sensitive and precise measurements of trace amounts of uranium present naturally in seawater.  These measurements will provide insight into how rapidly the ocean circulates and information about the chemical cycles of carbon and uranium in the ocean.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To the extent that this project furthers our knowledge of the character of past climate change and our understanding of the causes of climate change, it is of broad societal value. This project will also stimulate the already extensive collaboration among hundreds of scientists nationally and internationally with the University of Minnesota group and contribute to the training of the next generation of Earth scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main purpose of this project was to purchase, test, and use a very sensitive and precise instrument called a multicollector, inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometer. This kind of instrument is designed to measure very small amounts of varieties of elements. We use it to measure rare varieties of trace amounts of the elements uranium and thorium, which we extract out of natural deposits. Some of the deposits that we study include cave deposits such as stalagmites and stalactites or fossil coral skeletons.  By analyzing this type of deposit in this way, we are able to date the layers within the deposit, very precisely. The layers that we date also contain information about the climate at the time the layer formed at the cave site. In this way, we are able to reconstruct climate records at cave sites around the world.  Over the course of this project, we constructed climate records of the sort, 150,000 years of record from the Death Valley area near the California-Nevada border, 600,000 years, decade by decade of waxing and waning of monsoon rainfall ineastern China, and 45,000 years of changing rainfall in the Amazon rainforest.  These records help us to understand what causes the earth's climate to change through natural phenomena.  During this project, not only did we reconstruct climate as described above, but we also improved upon two methods of dating deposits.   In the first case, we improved on the uranium-thorium dating method described above.  The new method results in more precise ages with smaller amounts of sample.  In the second case, we have improved the accuracy of the well known radiocarbon dating method.  Both improvements improve our ability to obtain climate records, but also improve our ability to date events in the earth's past, from changes in climate to times of past earthquakes, to the ages of cave paintings, to times of human evolution.
