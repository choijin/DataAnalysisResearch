<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this project is to develop DNA nanostructures that can self-assemble into larger one dimensional and two dimensional arrays capable of programmable self-replication and programmable origami folding into complex, predictable three dimensional shapes.  The resulting nanostructured origami will organize embedded non-DNA components into intricate geometries that enable new material properties and device functionalities. This project brings together a team of leading experts and practitioners from the sciences, mathematics, and sculptural arts who will draw upon their diverse expertise and inspirations to tackle collaboratively the technical challenges from both theoretical and experimental perspectives.  The project is also educating a new generation of scientists and students capable of developing new paradigms for functional nanomaterial and communicating the excitement and possibilities of these results to the public at large.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;If successful, the benefits of this project will be to enable the easy and economical self-replication of complex three dimensional nanostructures using mass produced components, through our progress in meeting the challenges of preparing the difficult original template structures. Self-replication will also facilitate the evolution of better materials or devices from generation to generation.  Thus, in the long term, a research group may develop a DNA-organized optical metamaterial, and then  immediately obtain large quantities of the prototype by introducing the initial template into a vat of components routinely ordered from a general foundry; similarly, a medical team may be able to create a complex immunotherapeutic vaccine by evolving a DNA nanostructure which displays a variety of antigens and adjuvants in some optimal, but initially unknown, three dimensional configuration; in the same vein, an environmental cleanup crew may be able to produce rapidly large quantities of a nanodevice tailored for breaking down different water borne pollutants via the solar powered activity of multiple enzymes clustered around light harvesting complexes.  Thus, the capabilities we are developing will facilitate previously unimagined methodologies in the production of useful and valuable new materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly sponsored by the National Science Foundation and the US Air Force Office of Scientific Research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The EFRI-ODISSEI award led to extensive fruitful collaborations that advanced both experimental and theoretical aspects of DNA and RNA nanotechnology, increased our understanding of the chemistry and physics of DNA nanostructures and the nature of their biomolecular interactions, and laid the groundwork for breakthrough applications across many technological domains.  The Seeman and Goddard groups demonstrated that paranemic-crossover (PX-DNA) binds to DNA Polymerase I. Seeman and Canary demonstrated that an organic semiconductor could be organized into a 3D crystal and constructed a DNA origami-based electro-optical modulator.  A key development is that such insoluble molecules as organic semiconductors can be solubilized by the attachming DNA strands to their ends.  Seeman and Ellis-Monaghan groups worked out a design formalism for DNA Skeletons, and for scaffolding strand design tools.  Seeman and Chaikin groups collaborated extensively, including working out higher resolution crystals of self-assembled DNA by modifying their sticky ends.  In addition, the Seeman group produced litters of cross-tile origami tiles, chiral colloidal arrangements, and demonstrated sequential self-assembly of DNA-modified droplets.  In addition to the work with the Goddard group, the Seeman group did three things with PX-DNA:  Seeman found that the PX structure is likely composed of a mixture of A-form and B-form DNA;  he also demonstrated topological linkage of paranemically bonded DNA, as well as covalently linking 1D arrays of paranemically bonded DNA.  In addition to the theoretical work with the Ellis-Monaghan group, the Seeman group also collaborated with Nils Baas of Trongheim on the construction of topological links.  They have built a nanomechanical device that works within a 3D crystal.  They also functionalized self-assembled 3D DNA crystals with triple helices.  Seeman built a system to monitor the growth of self-assembled crystals by time-lapse photography.  In addition, Seeman used the tensegrity triangle motif within 3D crystals to gain a 5 &Aring; image of torsionally stressed DNA.  Finally, Seeman developed a signal-passing mechanism for strand exchange that can be used to control the growth of an array.  The Saint Michael?s group collaborated with the partner labs to devise design strategies for targeted constructs and developed mathematical theory to support future applications. Significant results included determining NP-Hardness for three common design strategies, thus confirming the difficulty of the design problems. She countered this with explicit designs for common targets and with algorithms and software for tractable situations. The Ellis-Monaghan group also developed formalism and pragmatic designs for rigid tiles and laid the first foundations for mathematical analysis of DNA knotting that usually confounds assembly designs for 3D constructs. Ellis-Monaghan developed mathematical theory for the ribbon graphs that model DNA constructs and graph polynomials that encode relevant combinatorial information and may also be targets for biomolecular computation.   The application of DNA self-assembly has led to many attractive new mathematical questions involving geometry, topology, knot theory and combinatorics, and one of the objectives was engaging other mathematicians in this work.  Thus, Ellis-Monaghan shared the mathematical formalism for problems related to DNA self-assembly through multiple plenary talks at national and international venues. An REU outreach program integrated with this project was run by the Ellis-Monaghan group that provided valuable training to undergraduates in multidisciplinary areas of mathematics, biology, biochemistry, physics, and computer science.  These students participated in both the theoretical (mathematical) and pragmatic (implementation) aspects of developing graph theoretical models for various problems arising from applications in self-assembling nanostructures.  For biological applications, the Goddard and Rossi groups developed a new type of molecular scale logic switch that can regulate gene expression in human cells according to "if : then" based logic rules.  These "conditional small interfering RNAs (Cond-siRNA)" form the basis for developing revolutionary new drugs whose molecules can tailor their own drug effects to the biological activities occurring within individual cells in the body.  In collaboration with partners at other institutions, Goddard and Rossi are in the process of starting a venture backed company to take this exciting technology into the clinic.  These advances have been fundamentally enabled by rational design of nanostructures using molecular modeling and simulations conducted in the Goddard lab at Caltech.   In addition to these scientific achievements, the ODISSEI project played an essential role in the PhD students and postdocs.  This included undergraduates that participated in the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) Program at Caltech.  Numerous summer undergraduate and high school students at Caltech and City of Hope have played important, direct roles in the development of Cond-siRNA technology. We have further shared the excitement of nucleic acid nanotechnology with diverse groups of high school students through our outreach efforts at Duarte High.
