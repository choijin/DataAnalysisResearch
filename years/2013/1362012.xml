<AbstractNarration>The research of the planned I/UCRC for Atomically Thin Multifunctional Coatings aims to focus on fundamental understanding of synthesis, integration, properties, processing and scale-up of novel 2D material systems of application importance. The proposed Industry-University partnership plans to build on a foundation of scientific innovation in 2D materials at Penn State and Rice University in such materials as graphene, MoS2, WS2, hBN, and WSxSe1-x. The planned research activities of the center are student-centric, and will include: performing transformational and applied research, developing intellectual property, low cost nano-manufacturing, doing internships at the industry, and undertaking technology transfer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned I/UCRC will closely coordinate joint activities to involve underrepresented students at all levels of education; for example, through the new Penn State - Millennium Scholars Program, supporting research summer stays at both universities. Undergraduate students will be provided opportunities to take part in ongoing interdisciplinary research in the center. In order to encourage young people to pursue science-technology research, the center will jointly conduct activities such as the Upward Bound Math and Science (UBMS) and leverage ongoing PSU/Rice MRSEC REU and RET programs. The center also intends to generate strategies to remediate current technology drawbacks and spur local and regional economic growth through Penn State's Innovation Park and The Rice Alliance for Technology and Entrepreneurship.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We organized the ATOMIC planning grant meeting at the Penn Stater together with Rice University. The meeting was held at Penn State 21-22 of October, 2014 and the NSF program director Dr. Shashank Prya and Dr. Steve McGregor (NSF evaluator) attended the meeting.  During the ATOMIC planning meeting and through a close interaction of committed industry members and faculty experts in 2D materials, we have identified five initial technology topics for ATOMIC to establish the foundation of the Center and get a competitive proposal ready for submisison.   Based on the member votes, and current commitment letters (research funding), industrialists and academics chose top four projects: Scalable Routes for ATOMIC, Synthesis and Characterization of Atomically Thin Materials Applied in Energy Conversion and Storage, Atomic Layers for Anti-Corrosion Coatings, and Tough and Transparent Multi-Functional Films. Additionally, the companies and faculty members also developed a new project focused on characterizing reliability and multifunctionality of the ATOMIC materials developed in the top four projects.  We successfully addressed the main goals of the planning grant proposal as follows:  1. We successfully created an adequate environment and brought together leading scientists and engineers from academia (Penn State &amp; Rice) and industry to discuss how 2D atom-thick layered materials can be used in the coating industry.   2. Together with Industry, we identified and prioritized key thrust areas that were strategic for the industry attending the planning meeting.  3. We discussed the foundations of ATOMIC and also discussed how the IUCRC Center would operate. In this context, attending to the boot camp and in-depth discussions with the program officers were key.  4. We planned and projected a long term sustainable vision for ATOMIC that would be part of the ATOMIC full proposal.  We also created a website for ATOMIC: https://www.mri.psu.edu/mri/facilities-and-centers/atomic  In addition we elaborated a pamphlet about ATOMIC for distribution in conferences to potential industrial partners. Finally, we were compiled a TOPICS book that was distributed during the advisory board meeting.  All this information was added into the final report of the planning grant meeting.
