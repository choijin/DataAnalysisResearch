<AbstractNarration>The research proposed here is primarily for two projects.  The first is a search for a type of particle known as a scalar meson, which has the same quantum numbers as a theoretical particle called the "glueball".  The latter is conjectured to be a bound system of only gluons, which are the force-carrying particles in the theory of QCD (quantum chromodynamics).  In practice, real particles are a quantum-mechanical mixture of scalar mesons and the hypothetical glueball, so studying the properties of the scalar mesons gives a direct connection with the predictions of QCD. Scalar mesons have been observed in some hadron-beam experiments, but there is scant evidence of these mesons in photon-beam experiments like the ones proposed at Jefferson Lab.  This research project will provide definitive results on scalar meson rates produced at the CLAS12 detector at Jefferson Lab. The second project is a hadronic-beam experiment to be carried out at the J-PARC facility in Japan.  This experiment will explore the production rate of final states where two pi-mesons are detected.  The last data of this sort was taken back in the 1970s, and now precise data for this final state are needed as input to theoretical calculations of nucleon resonances.  A nucleon resonance is an excited state of the proton, which can decay into a proton and one or more pi-mesons (or other particles).  The nucleon resonance spectrum is important because it tells us about how quarks interact with each other inside the proton.  The nucleon resonance spectrum can now be calculated using a theoretical technique called lattice QCD, which is based on the theory of QCD.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the theory of QCD (quantum chromodynamics) is one of the most important aspects of nuclear physics today.  QCD is responsible for the binding of quarks inside the proton, and also for the binding of protons and neutrons inside the nucleus.  Hence, QCD is essentially the theory that leads to a better understanding of nuclear energy and other nuclear applications.  While today's applications of nuclear processes, such as nuclear medicine, can be understood in terms of phenomenology, the applications of the future may well depend on an understanding of QCD.  Calculations based on the theory of QCD are difficult, requiring large computers, and such complex calculations need to be tested experimentally.  The research proposed here is one such experimental test that can lead to a better understanding of the nuclear force. Other broader impacts resulting from this research are the training of graduate students in building leading-edge instrumentation and in computational analysis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project is for research in particle physics and in particular to investigate the substructure of particles, such as the proton or neutron, in terms of more fundamental constituents, quarks and gluons.  The theory of how quarks and gluons go together to form particles is called quantum chromodynamics (or QCD), and experimental tests of the predictions of this theory are the basis of the current project. One theoretical prediction of QCD, which has not yet been verified by experiment, is of a particle (called a scalar meson) in which the gluons carry a significant part of the particle?s spin.  New data from the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Laboratory, located near the East coast in Virginia, are used in the current project to measure the production probability for scalar meson particles, which have only been poorly measured by previous measurements.   This result was published recently in the journal Physical Review C.  A second aspect of the current project is to measure the production of particles produced by a beam of pions (pi-mesons) at the J-PARC accelerator in Japan.  The goal of this experiment is to search for new baryon resonances, which may have been missed in previous experiments that measured elastic scattering only.  To do this measurement, it was necessary to build a new particle detector, which was funded primarily by Japan and South Korea.  During the time of this project, the experiment was proposed to the J-PARC Proposal Advisory Committee, and received approval for both stage-1 and stage-2 status.  Stage-1 means it has met the high level of scientific justification, and stage-2 means that it has met all technical requirements.  We are now waiting for scheduling by the J-PARC staff, and the measurements should begin within the next year.  Additional investigations into production of baryons that include s-quarks have been carried out as part of this research project using new data from Jefferson Lab.  In particular, the photo-production of the lowest mass baryon with a s-quark, called the Lambda particle, has been done for the first time from a deuterium target.  Also, baryons with 2 strange quarks have been measured in photo-production from the proton.  These two results were recently published in the journal Physical Review C.  Three students received their PhD based on this research.  These students have gone on to more advanced careers in particle physics. The support of the NSF is gratefully acknowledged for this project, which helps to train a high-technology workforce.  Ohio University serves to educate students from the regional area called Appalachia, and the PI and his students have contributed to outreach activities that impacts the education of this population.
