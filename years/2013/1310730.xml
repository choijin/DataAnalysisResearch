<AbstractNarration>This action funds Christien Philip Laber of Rutgers University to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at the University of Tsukuba in Tsukuba, Japan.  The project title is "Coccolithovirus Presence and Active Infection of the Phytoplankton Emiliania Huxleyi in the Northwest Pacific Ocean." The host scientist is Yoshihiro Shiraiwa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The phytoplankton Emiliania huxleyi is a coccolithophore found in most regions of the ocean and is known for producing large summer bloom populations in the North Atlantic frequently terminated by a double stranded DNA virus called coccolithovirus (EhV), "short circuiting" carbon transport to higher food web levels and influencing the biogeochemical cycling of carbon.  This host-virus interaction has not yet been documented in the Pacific Ocean.  This project uses a set of nucleic acid and lipid based molecular tools to probe Pacific waters for the presence, diversity, and activity of coccolithovirus off the west coast of Japan.  This includes the detection of evolutionarily similar sphingolipid biosynthesis genes in E. huxleyi and EhV as well as viral glycosphingolipids (vGSLs), which are reliable lipid based markers for EhV presence and activity in natural assemblage. Nucleic acid tools are used to investigate the historical presence and preservation of EhV in the sediment record as well.   Laboratory experiments are also being conducted to observe the interaction of cultured E. huxleyi and EhV with viral concentrates and coccolithophores of natural assemblage.  This approach addresses whether EhVs are prominent in the western Pacific, if the vGSL biosynthetic pathways triggered during viral infection are similar to those used by North Atlantic EhV, if natural conditions are sufficient for infection to progress, and the historical preservation of EhV infection in regional sediment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, the results will increase our understanding of EhV distribution, which will provide a platform for diversity, ecological, and biogeochemical studies.  Laber will also work with COSEE NOW at the Institute of Marine and Coastal Science at Rutgers to translate and broadcast the study and experience to the public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this study was to investigate the presence and activity of a marine phytoplankton-infecting virus called coccolithovirus in the western North Pacific Ocean.  Coccolithovirus infects the cosmopolitan phytoplankton Emiliania huxleyi, found ubiquitously in the ocean except in very high latitudes and forms extensive populations called æbloomsÆ that can be seen from space.  Despite the widespread presence of E. huxleyi, studies of the host-virus interaction and observations of coccolithovirus have been limited to the North Atlantic and Black Sea.  Coccolithovirus infection has a prominent influence on the fate of cellular materials including carbon and sulfur, terminating blooms and preventing the movement of energy through the food web, instead stimulating microbial growth.  Here, we investigated the potential role of coccolithovirus on controlling E. huxleyi populations around Japan by using previously developed genetic and lipid based biomarkers for coccolithovirus infection as well as more conventional culture based methods.  We collected seawater from five coastal areas around Japan (Akita, Shiogama, Tottori, Hakodate, and Shimoda) as well as from one scientific cruise in the Sea of Japan and two cruises off the east coast of Japan.  Samples were collected for DNA, RNA, and lipid analysis, as well as virus counts.  DNA samples were subsequently examined for the presence of the coccolithovirus Major Capsid Protein (MCP) gene to determine the presence of the coccolithovirus in the samples.  Coccolithovirus genes have not yet been detected in the coastal or cruise samples.  Analyses of the RNA and lipid biomarkers of infection are currently pending.  To explore the historical presence of coccolithovirus around Japan, sediment samples were taken from sediment cores previously collected from two distinct regions offshore of Japan, one in the Sagami Bay and one south of Hokkaido.  E. huxleyi cells and virus particles in the surface ocean can sink to the sediment during infection events, with their DNA being  preserved in the sediment under optimal environmental conditions, allowing for genetic detection of their presence.  Sediment samples were collected at 1 cm intervals in the cores to a depth of 10 cm, providing a temporal component to the sediment samples, deeper sediment being buried for a longer time.  DNA extractions from the sediment provided rich DNA yields from both cores.  Detection of the coccolithovirus MCP gene as well as the E. huxleyi COI gene was attempted from these extractions, however, the presence of chemical inhibitors also extracted from the sediments prevented clear detection and amplification of both genes.  Further analysis of these DNA extracts with modified techniques need to be completed to determine if the genes of interest can be detected in the cores.  Attempts at isolating a new strain of coccolithovirus were conducted by making concentrates of viral sized particles from seawater collected on the coast of the Izu Peninsula.  Concentrates were introduced to E. huxleyi cultures to initiate infection and produce a new virus strain.  Of the three viral concentrates created, none successfully infected E. huxleyi to  produced infective virus particles.  To determine the susceptibility of E. huxleyi strains isolated outside of the North Atlantic to coccolithovirus infection, infection experiments were conducted with three North Atlantic virus strains being introduced to two novel strains of E. huxleyi from the Chukchi and Bering Sea.  These experiments determined that at least the Chuckchi Sea strain is susceptible to infection, while the Bering Sea strain requires further analysis to determine whether infection occurred.  Results suggest that infection is not limited in this region of the ocean by E. huxleyi strains adapted to resist infection.  The results of this study have not yet found evidence of coccolithovirus infection occurring in coastal or offshore areas around Japan.  However, t...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
