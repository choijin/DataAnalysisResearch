<AbstractNarration>1337742 &lt;br/&gt;Rollin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation Award supports Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University with the acquisition of a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and remote operational capability. The instrument will support research in nanomaterials characterization, along with development and characterization of emerging aerospace materials/structures that further improve safety, performance, fuel economy, longevity, and affordability. The SEM will have an impact on research and education at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. The institution recently launched several initiatives to upgrade its research programs at both the masters and PhD level, and the undergraduate level. The SEM will be integrated in current courses in the Colleges of Aviation, Engineering, and Arts and Sciences, and support new research areas at the undergraduate and graduate levels both on and off campus. It will also help attract and retain new research-oriented faculty to help develop the new PhD programs in Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Physics. The SEM will also be used in an existing outreach program to bring high-school teachers to visit the University during summers and conduct research projects with professors. Moreover, several local companies will also be using the SEM for their own research and development.&lt;br/&gt;******&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation Award supports Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University with the acquisition of a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and remote operational capability.

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The purpose of this project was to acquire a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) with Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX) and remote operation capability. In December 2013, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University took delivery of an FEI Quanta 650 SEM with a Bruker Quantax 100 EDX. Remote operation capability was implemented for use across campus as well as from the outside. The SEM was first installed in March 2014 and full capability was reached in September 2014. This instrument added a basic capability to the University, allowing faculty and students to conduct fundamental materials science research.

Finally, local industries can use our microscope to solve their problems. They can use it on site with or without the help of one of our staff, or remotely. The final goal of the project is to introduce high school students to microscopy through their teachers.
