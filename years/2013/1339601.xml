<AbstractNarration>This project is supporting two programs at Boston College to address the need for highly qualified mathematics teachers in high-need school districts. The Boston College Department of Teacher Education (The Lynch School of Education) and Department of Mathematics (College of Arts and Sciences), working together with the non-profit Math for America (MfA) Boston and with colleagues at Boston University and Education Development Center, are offering a Teaching Fellow (TF) program and a Master Teaching Fellow (MTF) program.  Two highly select groups of preservice high school teachers (Teaching Fellows) are participating in a five-year integrated program of study  that includes a one-year Master of Science in Teaching and systematic professional development over a four-year period during their formative years as new teachers in Boston and Framingham school districts.  The project provides an integrated curriculum that seamlessly interweaves content, pedagogical content knowledge, and pedagogy.  The Teaching Fellowship program is grounded in research and based on prior successful models of mathematics teacher preparation that have a high teacher retention rate in urban districts. Eight experienced teachers (Master Teaching Fellows) from the high-need school districts of Boston and Framingham are involved in mentoring the Teaching Fellows and are participating in the mathematics professional and curriculum development seminars and workshops. With the support of their school districts, the MTFs, in close liaison with mathematicians and mathematics educators, are assuming leadership roles in reforming mathematics teaching and learning. The goals of the project are to: 1) Increase the output of the current Masters level mathematics teacher preparation program at Boston College by preparing eight Teaching Fellows (TFs) to become excellent mathematics teachers for high-need schools; 2) Recruit and support eight outstanding practicing teachers (Master Teaching Fellow) in mathematics from high-need school districts to become highly qualified instructional leaders and mentors; and 3) Build a strong and lasting professional community of mathematicians, mathematics educators and teachers in the greater Boston area by combining the resources of Boston College, MfA Boston and the EDC and to develop the long-term infrastructure neccessary to support this community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Mathematics Teacher Education Faculty and Mathematics Department faculty have collaborated to establish a Mathematics Education Colloquium Series that brings to campus outside speakers, both mathematics educators and mathematicians, who are concerned with mathematics education.

These colloquia were well-attended by BC Noyce Teaching Fellows, BC Noyce Master Teachers, other master teachers who are Math for America Boston Fellows, and students and faculty from Boston College and other universities in the Greater Boston Area. This colloquium series has increased the visibility of mathematics education in Boston area and provided a venue for faculty and students to gain understanding of the issues. The increased visibility of education and education-related issues is essential; it means that the Mathematics faculty who do wish to get involved in K-12 mathematics education are not isolated voices, but part of a community of concerned faculty and connected to Math Education faculty as well. In addition, the colloquium series has led to increased knowledge about teacher education, particularly regarding pedagogical content knowledge for teaching, which is a key factor in teacher effectiveness and student success.    The immediate impact of this colloquium and this project starts with the eight well prepared, well-supported beginning teachers and eight master teacher leaders, and then spreads through their schools and school districts. The colloquium also serves as a model for universities and organizations to share professional development opportunities.  From this project, an educational mentoring model, the Two-Way Mentoring Model, was developed to explore how beginning teachers and their mentors developed positive relationships (Albert, 2019). The heart of this model matched a beginning teacher with an experienced practicing teacher and a mathematician as mentors for a period of five years. The Two-Way Mentoring Model can change the existing mentoring model commonly used for induction of beginning teachers in two critical ways: (1) transitioning from the traditional one-on-one model to a team model of mentoring, and (2) shifting the mentors' assignment that characteristically focuses on convenience or entitlement to smart selection of mentors that are mathematicians and experienced mathematics teachers.

Burrows, &amp; R. Kitchen. Brill Sense.  Boston, MA. ISBN: 978-90-04-39997-6).  Since mathematicians from a diverse group of universities (Boston College, Boston University, Harvard University, MIT, Salem State University, and Worchester State University) have participated in mentoring TFs, we were able to establish a professional community in Greater Boston area that provided a strong supportive environment to the young teachers. This project is also a model for mathematicians and mathematics educators in sharing their expertise and perspectives to enrich teacher preparation and support.  This project serves as a model for universities and organizations to share professional development opportunities and support in order to address the serious shortage of highly qualified urban mathematics teachers. This project has influenced the development of a community of mathematically sophisticated high school teachers in the greater Boston area, including an important number of teachers of color.
