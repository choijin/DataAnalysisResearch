<AbstractNarration>An award is made to Iowa State University to develop a high-throughput, large-scale plant phenotyping instrumentation for knowledge discovery in plant phenomics area. Characterization of the complete plant phenome has posed a difficult challenge due to the large number of genes in the genomes, and changeable environmental conditions that influence plant phenotypes. Analyzing plant phenotypes on a large and multi-scale level with sufficient throughput and resolution has thus been difficult and expensive. This project will lead to the development of microsystem technology based plant phenotyping instrumentation, and therefore will constitute a transformative leap in throughput and information content over existing phenotype assays. The core of the instrumentation is an integrated plant growth system consisting of an array of miniature greenhouses, microfluidic plant chips, and microfluidic control logic. The plant growth system can provide maximal environmental flexibility in large- and multi-scale study of plant-environment interactions. The miniature greenhouses will flexibly regulate relative humidity, carbon dioxide level, and light intensity. The microfluidic plant chips will be designed to be sliding chip-like disposable components for use inside the greenhouses. Each plant chip will not only allow a number of plants to simultaneously grow for a desired period of time, but be able to automatically trap individual seeds, change growth temperature, regulate chemical concentration, and introduce biological species to the plant growth regions. A programmable imaging system will be designed to collect images of plant seeds, roots, shoots, and cells. To quantify morphological traits and determine phenotypic differences in a high throughput manner, an automated algorithm will be developed to extract and analyze images acquired during plant growth and development. Arabidopsis thaliana will be used as a model plant for biological verification of the instrumentation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will contribute to systematic analysis of plant phenotypes with a wide range of applications in gene identification, functional genomics, and genotype-to-phenotype correlations. Large and multi-scale phenotyping of plants, in concert with changeable growth environmental influences, has broad implications in applied and basic plant biology. The proposed instrumentation will make breakthrough toward solving grand challenging large-scale problems in the field of phenomics, will build resources to benefit plant biology researchers, and will create a paradigm shift in the plant phenomics area by placing powerful data analysis capability in the hands of researchers. The education plans include providing an interdisciplinary opportunity to three doctoral students and four undergraduate students including two female and minority students, creating a one-credit seminar course for the Undergraduate Bioengineering Minor Program, and adding a new lab to existing undergraduate and graduate courses at Iowa State. The dissemination plan includes providing phenotying services to plant biologists at Iowa State and beyond through extensive collaborations, organizing Plant Phenomics workshop, partnering with national laboratories to disseminate phenotying services, and commercializing the instrumentation through the small business innovation research or small business technology transfer mechanism.</AbstractNarration>

This project has resulted in the development of a microsystem-based plant phenotyping instrumentation for high-throughput screening of plant-environment interactions for rapid discovery of genotype-to-phenotype interactions.

The miniature greenhouses can flexibly regulate relative humidity, light intensity, and temperature, while the plant chips can allow simultaneously growing multiple plants, regulating different chemical concentration, and introducing biological species to the plants. The miniature greenhouses and plant chips have been integrated to provide multiple plant growth environments for the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The developed system allows measuring and tracking the height, width, color, etc. of plant organs and developmental stages over time, using a robotic arm-based imaging system and image analysis algorithm. The instrumentation has been validated by testing its&nbsp;utility for creating and controlling various environments, growing the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and studying the influences of temperature, light conditions, and chemical environments on the phenotypes of plants. The research outcome of this project has been disseminated through ten peer-reviewed journal publications, eight conference articles, ten presentations at seminars and workshops, and two doctoral dissertations. &nbsp;A utility patent application has also been filed. From the education and outreach perspectives, this project has provided ample opportunities for educating the next-generation interdisciplinary workforce at the interface of electrical and computer engineering and plant sciences. By recruiting multiple female graduate students and under-represented minority students, the project has made a direct impact on the diversity of the STEM workforce. African-American internship students with little to no background in the concept of postgraduate work in engineering were recruited and provided with the tools and skills to participate in a future of research. Furthermore, the project has provided professional training opportunities for six graduate students and ten undergraduate researchers. In addition, this project has served as a platform for outreach activities targeting both undergraduates and K-12 students and has helped to expose elementary school students to the state-of-the-art plant biotechnologies. Further, this project has integrated the research outcome into the Undergraduate Bioengineering Minor Program curriculum, added one new lab to a graduate course, and offered multiple short courses to K-12 students in rural areas. Lastly, in collaboration with the NSF-funded Research Traineeship (NRT)-Predictive Plant Phenomics program at Iowa State, this project has provided training opportunities to twenty first-year NRT graduate students in the area of plant phenomics.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/16/2019<br>      Modified by: Liang&nbsp;Dong</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1353819/1353819_10292487_1560660165378_Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1353819/1353819_10292487_1560660165378_Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1353819/1353819_10292487_1560660165378_Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">(a) Schematic of a plant-chip.
