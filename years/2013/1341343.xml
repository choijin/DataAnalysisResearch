<AbstractNarration>This award funds the travel of US scientists to attend the Second International Conference on GPS Radio Occultation (ICGPSRO) in Tao-Yuan, Taiwan.  NSF has a longstanding partnership, through the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, with the Taiwanese National Space Organization (NSPO), in the development of space-based GPS radio occultation (RO) as a technology for observing the atmosphere.  This partnership produced the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, the Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC), a six-satellite constellation of polar orbiting satellites with GPS receivers (launched in 2006).  The COSMIC mission has beeh highly sucessful, and a follow-on mission, COSMIC-2, is under development.  COSMIC-2 will consist of two six-satellite constellations, one in polar orbits and one in low-inclination tropical orbits, and the new satellites contain substantial enhancements over the previous generation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this award is to encourage the adoption of COSMIC-2 data by the US research community.  The COSMIC-2 tropical constellation, with a planned launch date in Fiscal Year 2016, will provide unprecedented vertical profiles of temperature and moisture in the tropics, as well as coverage of conditions in the tropical ionosphere.  This award will allow up to 10 US researchers to attend the meeting and determine the optimal research uses of COSMIC-2 data, and will work with their Taiwanese counterparts to identify areas of common interest and potential US-Taiwanese collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering</AbstractNarration>

Fostering collaboration between the U.S. and Taiwan science communities was also a major goal for the workshop.   A total of ten U.S. scientists from a broad spectrum of scientific disciplines directly relevant to the COSMIC-2 mission were invited to participate in the ICGPSRO Conference held at Taoyuan, Taiwan, in May 2013. These scientific presentations were extremely valuable in educating the U.S. scientists that were new to GPS radio occultation measurement techniques and applications.  Additionally, the scientific presentations given by the U.S. delegation provided an excellent review of current issues in various scientific disciplines that could benefit from the exploitation of the GPS radio occultation data to be made available from the COSMIC-2 mission.   With more than 100 scientists and students attending from 20 countries, the ICGPSRO meeting was a great success and furthered the education of the scientific community of the opportunities to be made available from the COSMIC-2 mission.

This provided the student participants with an opportunity to present their results orally before a large audience of international scientists.  By attending the workshop, the U.S. students had the opportunity to discuss their research with many of the worldÆs leading experts in GPS RO. These interactions resulted in the students receiving important feedback on their ongoing research, and also se...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
