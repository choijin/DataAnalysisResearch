<AbstractNarration>The Global Soundscapes! Big Data, Big Screens, Open Ears Project uses the new science of soundscape ecology to design a variety of informal science learning experiences that engage participants through acoustic discovery  Soundscape ecology is an interdisciplinary science that studies how humans relate to place through sound and how humans influence the environment through the alteration of natural sound composition. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) an interface to the NSF-funded Global Sustainable Soundscapes Network, which includes 12 universities around the world; &lt;br/&gt;(2) sound-based learning experiences targeting middle-school students (grades 5-8), visually impaired and urban students, and the general public; and&lt;br/&gt;(3) professional development for informal science educators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project educational components include: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- the first interactive, sound-based digital theater experience; &lt;br/&gt;- hands-on Your Ecosystem Listening Labs (YELLS), a 1-2 day program for school classes and out-of school groups; &lt;br/&gt;- a soundscape database that will assist researchers in developing a soundscape Big Database; and &lt;br/&gt;- iListen, a virtual online portal for learning and discovery about soundscape. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project team includes Purdue-based researchers involved in soundscape and other ecological research; Foxfire Interactive, an award-winning educational media company; science museum partners with digital theaters; the National Audubon Society and its national network of field stations; the Perkins School for the Blind; and Multimedia Research (as the external evaluator).</AbstractNarration>

Two guide books were developed for this summer camp program; one is an instructional guide for teachers and science educators that covers the topics of the physics and biology of sound, the geography of sound and having fun with sound (as group games). &nbsp;A second YELL guide that was developed is a student guide for youth, these serve as workbooks and simple instructional forms for youth to fill out as they complete the summer camp program. A few scholarships were offered to students not able to cover the costs of the summer camp programs and several versions were run for visually impaired youth.&nbsp; We also developed a comprehensive learning resource platform called iListen.org.&nbsp; There, youth can learn more about sound, explore sound through a variety of online tools, and then, once provided with a certain number of digital badges, they then help scientists do research. The ultimate activity in iListen.org is an online science fair where students present their results and conclusions as an online poster. The final project product, funded mostly by other sources, is a citizen science app and companion web site that allows users to record their own soundscape.&nbsp; The app is being distributed to museums as part of their larger educational program that interfaces with the Interactive Theater Show.&nbsp; Several research locations are featured in all of these curricular resources: the jungles of Costa Rica, the rich and diverse coral reefs of Hawaii and the mysterious grassland landscapes and throat singing herders of Mongolia. These learning platforms are also linked to the PIs online soundscape library, a collection of over 4 million recordings from over 54 sites around the world which can explored and listened too. As sound is a cross cutting topic in STEM, we also demonstrate in our online teachers resources the power of this one topic to teach across diverse disciplines.&nbsp; All curricular products were mapped to Next Generation Science Standards (documents developed for teachers) with specific learning objectives outlined that scaffold across the levels of learning.
