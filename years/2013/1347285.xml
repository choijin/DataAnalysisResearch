<AbstractNarration>The main research task addressed in this project is to construct a Data System for Structural&lt;br/&gt;Geology and Tectonics (SG&amp;T). SG&amp;T data are complex for a variety of reasons, including the&lt;br/&gt;wide range of temporal and spatial scales (many orders of magnitude each), the complex three-dimensional geometry of some geological structures, inherent spatial nature of the data, and the difficulty of making temporal inferences from spatial observations. To successfully implement the step of developing a SG&amp;T data system, the principal investigators must simultaneously solve three problems: 1) How to digitize SG&amp;T data; 2) How to design a software system that is applicable; and 3) How to construct a very flexible user interface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address the first problem, the principal investigators introduce the "Spot" concept, which allows tracking of hierarchical and spatial relations between structures at all scales, and will link map scale, mesoscale, and laboratory scale data. A Spot, in this sense, is analogous to the beam size of analytical equipment used for in situ analysis of rocks; it is the size over which a measurement or quantity is applicable. A Spot can be a single measurement, an aggregation of individual measurements, or even establish relationships between numerous other Spots. They will implement both a Spot and a more traditional Mapping mode for data input. To implement these approaches into a software system, they will utilize a Graph database - as opposed to a Relational database - to better preserve the myriad of potentially complex relationships. A Graph design is ideally suited for the complex relations inherent in a SG&amp;T data system. Finally, they will construct a user interface that is intuitive, open source, and spans as many operating systems and devices as possible. For these reasons, they will develop a web-application that can run in both a connected (on the internet) and disconnected mode.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[A digital data system, named StraboSpot, was developed for the recording, storage, and retrieval of scientific information in the field of Structural Geology and Tectonics.  Hence, the data system records information about faults, folds, fractures, and fabrics in rocks, as well as the materials that experienced deformation over geologic time.  This work was the result of an NSF-sponsored community workshop, in which there was a unanimous agreement for the need for a digital database conforming to community standards and allowing scientific data to be reused.   The vocabulary and data standards were built during multiple, small-group meetings and use case field trips with participants from the structural geology and tectonics community.  The user interface was also developed with community feedback, ensuring that the system is compatible with the workflow of the scientists.  As a result, the highly flexible geological information system tracks both time and location.  Because of this flexibility, StraboSpot is being used increasingly by the structural geology and tectonics community. StraboSpot is available to download free and runs on both iOS and Android devices (phones and tablets). It can be found at the app stores for iOS and Android.  There is also the main website (https://strabospot.org) that is used for storing and sharing data collected. StraboSpot is a combination of the words Spot (data collection method), and Strabo, the name of an ancient geographer who first described some of the aspects of geology and movements of the Earth's crust. The broader impacts of this work include engagement of structural geology and tectonics practitioners in a community-based activity, and successful developed of community-vetted standards for digital sharing for data.  In the longer term, this achievement will improve communication within the structural geology and tectonics community, and allow new scientific questions to be addressed by facilitating the sharing and reuse of data.  The shared database will also make these data available to be used by other scientific and non-scientific users.  A group of geoscience graduate students and post-doctoral fellows were supported, whose insights and work were essential for the successful completion of this project.  Their involvement increased their awareness of the importance of sharing data and community-based standards, and they were active participants in the efforts to advance data science within the geological sciences.  In the longer term, the availability of structural geology and tectonics data within StraboSpot will allow geologists, and those from other disciplines that require these data, to address scientific questions that need Big Data initiatives.
