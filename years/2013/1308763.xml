<AbstractNarration>Francis P. Zamborini from the University of Louisville is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program to explore the unique electrochemical reactivity of metal nanoparticles, focusing on oxidation and galvanic displacement reactions for those with diameters below 4 nm.  The team has shown that there is a negative shift in oxidation potential for Au nanoparticles with decreasing size from diameters of 250 nm to 4 nm.  The shift increases significantly below 4 nm.  A goal of the work is to characterize the specific shift in oxidation potential for Au nanoparticles ranging from 250 nm down to 1 nm in diameter.  A combination of mass spectrometry and electrochemical methods is being used to correlate the exact nanoparticle/cluster size with the oxidation potential.  This provides important fundamental information about the stability of metal nanoparticles against oxidation as a function of size and a new electrochemical method for characterizing the size of metal nanoparticles.  They have discovered that the oxidation of small metal nanoparticles also depends on the electrode material, the method of attachment to the electrode, their aggregation state, and the ligands used to assist in their oxidation.  They are exploring these parameters systematically in order to gain a full understanding of all of the factors affecting metal nanoparticle oxidation.  Galvanic displacement is an electrochemical reaction involving the replacement of one metal with another metal, which has been used to form interesting alloys, but has not been fully studied as a function of size.  This reaction is also being explored with nanoparticles of varied size and focusing on those below 4 nm.  Since the oxidation behavior changes dramatically below 4 nm, it is expected that the galvanic displacement reaction will show unique reactivity in this size regime, allowing for nanoparticle transformations and alloy formation not possible with larger sizes.  The exploration of the oxidation and galvanic displacement of very small metal nanoparticles will lead to the discovery of new chemistry, synthesis of unique metal nanomaterials, and development of a new method of metal nanoparticle characterization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has broad significance and importance in many ways.  In terms of the impact on the scientific community, this research is relevant to the discovery of new chemistry involving small metal nanoparticles, a new method for characterizing the size of metal nanoparticles, and new methods of synthesizing unique metal alloy nanomaterials.  It also provides important fundamental information about metal nanoparticle stability, which is crucial for the numerous potential applications in medicine, chemical analysis, and energy.  It further provides significant, multidisciplinary training of students of all levels, including high school, undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate students.  The results of this research are being incorporated into the undergraduate chemistry curriculum to educate students about the important size-dependent properties of materials, which is at the heart of nanotechnology research.  This information is being made available to other educational institutions for broader dissemination.  A one-day symposium is being hosted dedicated to women in science, with an emphasis on biotechnology and nanotechnology research.  This includes participation from middle school students up to science professionals, including poster and oral presentations and a keynote lecture from a prominent female scientist.  The program is being publicized to broaden the impact.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project resulted in the discovery of new fundamental information about the unique behavior of solid materials (metals) that are nanometers in size (~1000 times smaller than the width of human hair).&nbsp; We discovered especially unique behavior for nanometals of 4 nm and below.&nbsp; For example, Figure 1 shows the striking difference in the oxidation (removal of&nbsp;electrons) of gold that is 4.2 nm, 2.3 nm, and 1.5 nm in average diameter (see images).&nbsp; The observed downward peaks indicate the voltage required to oxidize the gold.&nbsp; It is near 0.65 V for the 4.2 nm gold, 0.30 to 0.50 V for the 2.3 nm gold, and -0.1 V&nbsp;to 0.2 V for the 1.5 nm gold.&nbsp; The reactivity and the signature of the peaks are strikingly different over this small size range.&nbsp; We also discovered that smaller particles undergo galvanic exchange reactions more easily and&nbsp;readily catalyze the&nbsp;oxidation of hydrogen peroxide, which enabled us to perform size-dependent electrophoretic deposition in a unique way.&nbsp; It is crucial to understand the properties, reactivity, stability, and potential toxicity of solid-state materials in this small size regime as devices become more miniaturized and nanoparticles find more use in everyday life.&nbsp; Our findings not only add fundamental knowledge about the reactivity and properties of nanoscale metals, but may lead to improved methods for their synthesis, purification, assembly, and manipulation for implementation into working devices and applications.&nbsp; Our research has also provided&nbsp;important information about&nbsp;how the electrode material and functionality (surface charge)&nbsp;impacts the metal nanoparticle oxidation potential, which is necessary to understand for incorporation of these materials into working devices.&nbsp; Applications usually require nanoparticle attachment to electrodes or some other solid support material, which can affect their properties..</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While working on this project we accidentally discovered a method for assembling one-dimensional (1D) chains of silver nanoparticles across two microelectrodes spaced less than 10 microns apart by applying a voltage in air.&nbsp; Figure 2 shows an image of this type of assembly.&nbsp; Further exploration led to our determining that the mechanism is electrochemical in nature and facilitated by humidity in the air and residual ionic surfactant.&nbsp; This allows generalization of the process and potential use of the method on other materials.&nbsp; The direct assembly of these nanostructures across electrodes allows their electronic properties to be studied and utilized for nanoelectronics applications.&nbsp; We found that the 1D silver chains that we formed had interesting resistive switching behavior, which could find use in memory storage devices.&nbsp; They exhibit fast, reversible switching speeds and are nanoscale in size, which could be useful for this application.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp;research also explored the optical properties of individual pieces of metal that are of nanoscale size&nbsp;and connected to other nanoscale metals.&nbsp; Specifically, we studied the scattering of white light off of hexagonal-shaped gold nanoplates that were about 100 nm wide and compared that to the same nanoplates after attaching a single 5 to 100 nm gold nanosphere to different locations of the nanoplate.&nbsp; The nanoplates alone scattered 600-700 nm light the most effectively.&nbsp; The exact wavelength depends on the specific shape and size of the nanoplate.&nbsp; When a gold nanosphere was attached to the nanoplate, the maximum scattering wavelength shifted to larger wavelengths by 1 to more than 100 nm, depending on the size of the nanosphere and where it attached.&nbsp; A nanosphere attached to the top terrace did not change the scattering wavelength much at all (Figure 3A), but&nbsp;a nanosphere&nbsp;attached to the edge caused a dramatic shift (Figure 3B).&nbsp; Also, as the size of the nanosphere attached to the nanoplate increased, the wavelength shift increased and there was&nbsp;splitting (2 or 3 maximum scattering wavelengths) as the coupled objects became more asymmetric.&nbsp; These fascinating optical properties of gold are dictated by the conducting electrons, which can be excited by visible light at specific wavelengths (known as plasmons) and cause enhanced light scattering at various wavelengths, depending on these and several other factors.&nbsp; A better fundamental understanding of the optical properties at the single particle level is needed in order to fully utilize them for sensing and optical device applications, for which there are many.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This research will not only impact science with the generation of new fundamental information and better&nbsp;understanding of the reactivity, electronic, and optical properties of nanoscale metals, but it also has&nbsp;had an impact educationally on high school, undergraduate, and graduate level students.&nbsp; Students of all levels participated and contributed to the research, learning how to conduct basic research and gain new knowledge in the exciting area of nanoscience.&nbsp; The experiments and techniques discovered in this work&nbsp;were also extended to the undergraduate labs at the University of Louisville in order to broaden&nbsp;the impact to more undergraduate level students, which may spark their interest in pursuing chemistry and nanotechnology as a career.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/06/2017<br>      Modified by: Francis&nbsp;P&nbsp;Zamborini</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1308763/1308763_10274555_1483736200810_Figure1_NSF_report--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1308763/1308763_10274555_1483736200810_Figure1_NSF_report--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1 - Size-Dependent Gold Oxidation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1308763/1308763_10274555_1483736200810_Figure1_NSF_report--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1 - Size-Dependent Gold Oxidation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The peaks in these voltammograms correspond to the oxidation of gold of different sizes.
