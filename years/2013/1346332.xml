<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project initiates development of a conceptually new ?seamless? micro air vehicle (MAV) design based on distributed array of synthetic-jet micro-actuators (SJMAs) operating in a closed-loop flight control system to achieve unprecedented aircraft maneuvering and gust tolerance capabilities. A radical minimalism in the robust flight controller design is proposed to make it suitable for MAVs with limited onboard computational capability. The design is particularly advantageous for high levels of parametric uncertainty and nonlinearity present both in the unsteady flight-path environment and the embedded actuator?s response. The research objectives of the Phase I research include: (i) Design of the robust SJMA-based flight controller which is easily and inexpensively implementable, requiring no observers, function approximators, or adaptive update laws needed for alternative methods, (ii) Development of low-fidelity MAV flight simulator to be used as a testbed for design and optimization of the robust flight controller concept, (iii) Technology demonstration using high-fidelity simulations, and (iv) Assessment of technical and commercial merits and commercialization feasibility. The proof-of-concept benchmark studies will demonstrate robust flutter control of elastically-mounted airfoil entering limit-cycle oscillations (LCO) due to impinging upstream flow disturbances including deterministic gust and stochastic turbulence with prescribed characteristics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project include: (i) Developing enabling robust flight control technology to meet requirements specified for the market sector of airborne combat and civil autonomous systems to conduct intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance missions with enhanced maneuverability and flight stability capabilities for operations in highly unsteady flight-path environments; (ii) Provide scientific and technological understanding of SJMA control authority required as part of the closed-loop flight control system through conducting low- and high-fidelity benchmark studies; (iii) Creating potential for the technology demonstration to grow into the first start-up company incubated by ERAU, thus opening new employment opportunities and directly meeting objectives to spearhead the development of the advanced aerospace technologies and foster the creation of the university Research Park providing synergy between industry and academia in the Daytona Beach HUB-zone area; (iv) Enhancing the aerospace engineering design curriculum with focus on novel air vehicle concepts; (v) Contributing to the research team environment in the predominantly teaching university by  involving faculty and students in research projects and collaboration between engineering departments on cross-disciplinary research subjects; (vi) Providing important rational to initiated Ph.D. program in ERAU College of Engineering; (vii) Involving female, minority and handicapped participants in the research project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Phase I project achieved the main objective of developing and validating a novel, robust nonlinear flight control technology employing an array of synthetic-jet micro-actuators embedded in micro air vehicle (MAV) wing design to completely eliminate moving parts (such as ailerons). Such innovation  proposing a new class of "seamless aircraft" designs will greatly enhance maneuverability and gust tolerance required for small fixed-wing air vehicles operating in tight, unsteady urban environments.

The study demonstrated that the designed controller is easily and inexpensively implementable, requiring no observers, function approximators, or adaptive update laws which would be required in alternative control methods.  (2)  A proof-of-concept, low-fidelity Matlab Simulink robust controller model was developed for a benchmark case of gust-induced flat-plate airfoil flutter suppression using two synthetic-jet actuators. This case served as a testbed for validation and optimization of the robust flight controller design.  (3)  The final objective of Phase I research was achieved through technology demonstration using high-fidelity numerical simulations. The benchmark high-fidelity gust-induced flutter control studies allowed to validate the technology for a real viscous airfoil design. The studies paved the way to developing a unique optimized shape of the airfoil for optimal control authority achieved using synthetic-jet actuators.
