<AbstractNarration>An animal's digestive tract is a dynamic physiological system that supplies nutrients to the body and, to ensure survival, it must respond to changes in diet and environmental conditions.  What an animal is capable of digesting, or not digesting, tells us how an animal lives in its environment and how it contributes to nutrient cycling in that environment.  Recent studies have shown the value of using experimental evolution to reveal how the digestive tract responds to diet changes over different time scales.  In this preliminary study, researchers from the University of California-Irvine and expert international counterparts from the University of Zagreb, in Croatia, and the French Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris will begin a collaboration to investigate the nutritional physiology of Podarcis sicula, a lizard species that has shown rapid evolution of feeding and digestive tract morphology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Together, the US-Croatian-French team led in the U.S. by Donovan P. German of U.C.-Irvine will examine the results of a manipulative study that transferred breeding pairs of Podarcis sicula from the island of Pod Kopiste to another Croatian island, Pod Mrcaru, which had lacked this species.  Interestingly, after 30 generations the transferred pairs became more herbivorous on Pod Mrcaru (~36 years), resulting in marked differences in body morphology compared to the insect-eating parent population from Pod Kopiste.  The goal of this new collaboration is to initiate an investigation of the digestive physiology (including digestive enzyme activities and microbial diversity) and the gut structure of P. sicula from Pod Kopiste and Pod Mrcaru to better understand "what it takes to be an herbivore?" and how such changes in an animal's gut can occur so quickly.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work may include contributions to the medical field of gastroenterology (e.g., what happens when people suddenly become vegetarian?). Thus in the long run, this effort should benefit society by adding to our fundamental knowledge of nutritional physiology and dietary specialization, both, in animal models and potentially in humans.  Furthermore, because U.C.-Irvine and Croatian students will be involved in the joint work, broader impacts also include publication and direct outreach by the researchers and these students in schools and other public fora, as well as educational benefits for the U.S. student participants through early career training in scientific techniques and inquiry-based research abroad.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As the supply organ of nutrients to an animal, the digestive tract is a dynamic physiological system that is the focus of the growing field of nutritional physiology.  At the core of this research is the Adaptive Modulation Hypothesis (AMH), which suggests that an animalÆs digestive tract must be tightly regulated in relation to food intake and quality because the gut is expensive to maintain. Indeed, the AMH has been supported by empirical studies in a range of animal taxa, and provides the "ultimate" reasons for why specialization of the digestive tract towards diet arises.  However, experimental evolution provides potential to study the "proximate" mechanisms of how the digestive tract adapts to different diets, and the resulting consequences for animal performance.  In this study for the CNIC program, researchers from three countries with complementary skillsets investigated the nutritional physiology of Podarcis sicula, a lizard species that showed rapid evolution of feeding and digestive tract morphology.  Podarcis sicula inhabits islets off the coast of Croatia, and a manipulative study transferred breeding pairs of P. sicula from the islet of Pod Kopi&scaron;te to the islet of Pod Mr?aru, which previously lacked this species.  After 30 generations on Pod Mr?aru (~36 years), P. sicula became more herbivorous, which resulted in marked differences in head size, bite force and gut morphology in comparison to the insectivorous parent population on Pod Kopi&scaron;te.  Beyond differences in gut morphology, little was known about the digestive physiology of P. sicula, or the consequences of this dietary specialization.  We made four trips to Croatia for this project (two summer, and two spring field seasons), and found that the P. sicula from Pod Mr?aru could digest plant material better than conspecifics from Pod Kopi&scaron;te (see uploaded graphs).  Our hunt for the underlying mechanisms of this ability proved to be more elusive.  We observed few differences in detailed analyses of gut surface area (using histological sections), or in digestive enzyme activities among the P. sicula populations on the two islands in our initial analysis in summer 2013.  Interestingly, the lizards from Pod Kopi&scaron;te had elevated levels of microbial fermentation in their hindguts in comparison to the Pod Mr?aru lizards, which was the opposite pattern of what we expected. This led us to add sampling across seasons, and to add insectivorous mainland populations of this lizard species from Zagreb and Split to our analysis.  We are still in the midst of analyzing the data for this rather large-scale project, but the most exciting results suggest that the intestinal microbes in the lizardsÆ guts play a significant role in the digestive process and abilities of the lizards to respond to different diets and environments.  As we complete our physiological and biochemical analyses, the next step will be uncovering the diversity and biochemistry of the intestinal microbes in the P. sicula gut that allow these lizards to thrive on diverse diets across the globe.    Intellectual Merit:  Rarely are we afforded the opportunity to examine evolution in action in vertebrates in a natural setting.  The manipulated populations of P. sicula provide an opportunity to test how a vertebrate animal modulates its digestive tract in response to dietary changes, and to show how gut function can be matched to gut structure (i.e., AMH).  This project for the CNIC is testing the consequences of dietary specialization, which evolved over ecological timescales.  Overall, this project is one of the first to evaluate the potential metabolic costs of dietary specialization in lizards, and is leading to more detailed investigations of how dietary specializations arise in animals.  Broader Impacts: This project catalyzed an international collaboration between the PI (UC Irvine), Dr. Anthony Herrel (Mus&eacute;um National d'Histoire Naturelle, Paris, France) and Dr. Zoran T...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
