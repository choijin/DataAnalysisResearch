<AbstractNarration>The International Commission on Stratigraphy: developing global geostandards through international collaboration and consensus&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EAR-1347494&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Stanley Finney, California State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;PI requests three years of funding to support the activities of the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS), the largest and oldest constituent scientific body of the International Union of Geological Sciences (IUGS). The primary objective of ICS is to standardize the International Chronostratigraphic Chart, which is the basis for the Geologic Time Scale and serves as the global language for expressing geologic time. The funding requested would allow ICS to greatly increase its activities to include 1) field investigations and field business meetings necessary for the selection of Global Stratotype Sections and Points (GSSPs) that define the units of the International Chronostratigraphic Chart; 2) rejuvenation of websites of ICS subcommissions in order that the websites become the primary archives and portals for stratigraphic information produced by the subcommissions; and 3) travel support for young scientists and scientists from under-developed countries to participate in field investigations, field business meetings, and international symposia of the subcommissions.</AbstractNarration>
