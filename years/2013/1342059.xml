<AbstractNarration>This grant is to support the travel costs of students and postdocs to attend the Sixth Coronal Loops Workshop to be held in La Roche-en-Ardenne, Belgium, June 24th-27th, 2013. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop series provides a forum for researchers to discuss in detail the basic physical processes behind the formation, evolution, and disappearance of coronal loops in solar active regions.  The schedule of the Loops Workshop is flexible to encourage open discussion by its participants. Furthermore, the Loops Workshops have a well-deserved reputation for allowing the younger generation to assume relevant roles in the community and the scientific discussions. An open mailing list developed by the Coronal Loops Workshop community communicates with over 170 scientists worldwide, allowing those researchers to continuously exchange ideas, new results, publications, and information on coronal loops research. The workshop has traditionally been supportive of the attendance and participation of Ph.D. students and young postdocs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview  The purpose of this proposal was to request funding to support the attendance of young / early career scientists (Ph.D. students and young post-docs) at the sixth Solar Coronal Loops Workshop, which was held in La Roche-en-Ardenne, Belgium, on June 24 - 27, 2013. The Loops Workshop series began in 2002, motivated by the fact that the theory of the day was not able to adequately explain SoHO and TRACE observations, despite the riches they provided. Since then, the Solar Coronal Loops Workshops have been a series of highly successful meetings focused on the physical processes that govern these enigmatic structures.  Coronal loops are the building blocks of the Sun's atmosphere and through understanding them, we aim to unravel many more of the mysteries that the solar atmosphere presents us with. In particular, we want to know the details of how the million degree corona is created.  Enormous progress has been made, with new observatories, theories and models, working in tandem, providing many fresh insights and ideas. Several long standing problems have been solved and the field has been transformed in the twelve years since the first Loops Workshop.  Intellectual Merit  The Solar Coronal Loops Workshops are truly international, with more than 50 participants from many countries throughout the world. They bring together observers, theorists and modelers; scientists who are world-leading experts in their fields. The format of the meetings is designed to facilitate discussions and the exchange of ideas, rather than passively listening to talks. The Loops Workshops have become the international standard of reference for the debate about the nature and properties of solar coronal loops. They have been responsible for fostering new collaborations, allowing those who hold opposing views to openly debate their ideas, and have inspired new investigations.  Broader Impacts  The Solar Coronal Loops Workshops have been particularly supportive of  young / early career scientists from their very inception. It will be the first opportunity for many of the participating young scientists to present their work to an international audience of their scientific peers, but they do so in an environment that is supportive and encouraging. The Workshops are one of the very few forums that provide young scientists with the opportunity to not only observe senior scientists engaging in the key debates of their field, but to join in those debates themselves. Furthermore, the relatively small-size of the meetings, and their informal and self-selecting nature, means that young scientists can network and connect with senior scientists much more easily. This provides them with an extremely valuable resource in terms of additional mentoring, feedback, collaboration, references for Fellowships and post-doctoral opportunities later on.  The funding provided by this proposal allowed six young / early career scientists to participate in this Workshop who otherwise would not have been able to do so, and gave them an extremely valuable experience.
