<AbstractNarration>It is widely acknowledged that improving health and quality of life in the United States will require contributions and advances in many technical and non-technical areas, including computer science, engineering, economics, as well as in the social and behavioral sciences. The NSF Smart Health and Wellbeing Program focused on fundamental research in these areas and  has supported a diverse set of multidisciplinary projects and investigators that  received their awards in 2011 and 2012.  The workshop for the principal investigators in the Smart Health and Wellbeing Program was organized to bring together these researchers with diverse projects and varied backgrounds and areas of expertise to exchange ideas, network, learn from each other, form new collaborations, and help to shape the future of this dynamic and rapidly growing set of fields. In addition to the presentation of posters associated with the funded projects, the participants have the opportunity to attend several invited presentations by leaders in several relevant fields focused on healthcare challenges and potential solutions.  To capture their creativity and innovative ideas, the workshop attendees were invited to participate in several breakout sessions.  The summary of the workshop outcomes will be accessible at http: http://nsfsmarthealthwellness2013.usc.edu/</AbstractNarration>
