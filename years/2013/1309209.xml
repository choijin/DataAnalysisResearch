<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research program is to develop a practical quantum measurement technology - attosecond-resolution quantum interferometry. The need for the highest possible resolution in optical interferometric measurements is increasing with modern trends in fiber sensing, optical device characterization, optical identification of folded-unfolded and engaged protein markers, biological imaging of tissue and brain, and in hundreds of other science and technology applications. The approach is based on the utilization of polarization- and frequency-entangled states of light accompanied by the non-classical effect of dispersion cancellation. This use of several mutually entangled variables (hyper-entanglement) will boost the resolution of numerous sensing applications. The goal is the development of quantum interferometry for group velocity delay evaluation that has two orders of magnitude better resolution than the best classical optical apparatus could achieve. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit.  The availability of quantum interferometry with attosecond resolution will be capable of revolutionizing optical measurement and sensing in multiple areas from telecommunication to biology.  The project must go significantly beyond the current state-of-the-art, and will rely on an interdisciplinary approach at the intersection of quantum optics, material science, and optical measurement. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts.  Novel scientific devices as well as environmental and biophotonics sensors always strive for greater resolution in order to reveal effects that are currently hidden from modern optical sensors. Quantum optics and quantum measurement are highly potent modern research fields, and the current project holds promise for attracting talented undergraduate and high-school students who are eager to join the development of future technological breakthroughs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has been concentrated on the development of quantum measurement techniques based on the generation and manipulation of broadband entangled states in Ti-diffused waveguides imposed on periodically poled LiNb. The first practical application of this newly developed structure was to demonstrate a high-fidelity quantum frequency conversion between quantum memories based on atomic transitions in the visible spectrum and quantum networking communication lines operating in the infrared. The second thrust targeted a reliable production of super-broadband sources of spectrally entangled photon pairs in strongly chirped nonlinear waveguided structures for high-resolution sensing. Such a strong chirping required the development of special nonlinear crystal poling techniques when the periodicity of poling varies significantly in different areas of the crystal. We discovered a new approach to poling nonlinear crystals and engineering broadband spectral entanglement that enabled us to eliminate several existing roadblocks associated with the long-standing issue of maintaining spectral and temporal distinguishability of photon pairs created in different parts of the chirped structure.  The main achievements during the course of this project are:  1)   Established the first in the US research and development facility for designing and manufacturing Ti diffused waveguides in LiNb that are capable of supporting type-II nonlinear parametric interactions.  2)   Demonstrated generation of polarization and frequency hyper-entangled states in the on-chip integrated circuit.  3)   Developed principles of apodised non-symmetric periodic poling leading to parametric generation of spectrally broadband down conversion with a constant phase profile within ultra-broad 200 nm bandwidth thus enabling the quantum interferometry with a sub-fs temporal resolution.   Intellectual merit. This novel design of compact integrated sources of polarization and frequency entangled photons serves as a universal building block for many applications in areas of quantum information, communication, and quantum sensing. The quantum interferometry with such states opens a way for super resolution sensing in multiple areas from industrial fiber sensors to biomedical applications.   Broader impact. Our graduate students took part in several outreach activities during the course of this project such as regularly teaching seminars on rocketry and spaceflight at The Montessori School of the Berkshires and participating in the new Women in Photonics podcast series by Photonics Media.
