<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;This project will produce a new compilation of Ross Sea seismic stratigraphy, including new interpretations, that can be used to provide boundary conditions on the tectonic and glacial evolution of West Antarctica and the Ross Sea. The principal goals include compilation of, and interpretation of, all available existing seismic reflection data for the Western Ross Sea, coupled with geophysical modeling to produce paleo-bathymetric reconstructions for the entire 800 km-wide Ross Sea. Specific tasks will include: extending existing work on mapping travel time to reflectors, identifying relations in the seismic data that indicate subsidence through sea level, constructing velocity models for converting travel time to thickness, and using the velocity models to estimate density and porosity of sediments for backstripping analysis. Modeling/backstripping efforts will be used to constrain past bathymetry.  Digital interpretations and stratigraphic grids will be provided as supplements to publications. In that way the results of this study can be used in thermal subsidence modeling and restoration of eroded rock to other parts of Ross Embayment and Marie Byrd Land by others. Digital products may be provided in advance of publication to modelers in a way that will not hurt publication chances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The results of this work will be important for paleo-geographic reconstructions of Antarctica and will therefore be of use to a broad range of researchers, particularly those working in the Ross Sea region.  The digital products can be used to test models for the past fluctuations of West Antarctic ice sheets, and in planning for future sediment drilling projects.  Two undergraduates to be chosen from applicants will be involved in summer internships held at the University of Rhode Island.  Outreach will also include a new website and one or more Wikipedia entries related to Ross Sea sub-sea floor characteristics.   The project includes an international collaboration with Dr. Chiara Sauli and others at Instituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e di Geofisica Sperimentale (OGS) in Italy.</AbstractNarration>

This subsidence to the current water depths is important because elevation or water depths affect whether ice sheets will grow and advance given environmental condistions such as CO2 level and ocean water temperatures.</p> <p>We interpreted the stratigraphy of most of Ross Sea, using mostly erosional surfaces (unconformities) dated between ~29 and ~15 Ma.&nbsp;This was done using acoustic imaging below the sea floor (seismic reflection data). Figure 1 shows a map of the depth to one of these unconformities. We created velocity models of this area and converted grids of 6 unconformities from sound travel time to depth. These depth maps were then modeled together with other information to create depth/elevation maps for times in the past.</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p> <p><strong>Terror Rift 23-13 Ma Passive Subsidence vs. Ongoing Extension</strong></p> <p>The part of Terror Rift north of Ross Island is almost 400 km-long (Fig. 1). Several publications propose that southern Terror Rift did not experience active extension and crustal thinning between 23 and 13 Ma. [example, Fielding et al., 2008]. In these interpretations, there was renewed rifting after 13 Ma. Our interpretations indicate active faulting across the east side of northern Terror Rift after ~21 Ma., and possibly before then. Furthermore, our interpretation does not support significant change in subsidence rates of the deepest part of Terror Rift after 29 Ma.</p> <p><strong>Age of an Unconformity and Processes Responsible for it</strong></p> <p>We investigated whether glaciers eroded Ross Sea soon after 34 Ma. Figure 2 images the reflective syn-rift section (sedimentary rocks deposited at the same time as crustal stretching) and the unconformity that caps it. Different members of our Italian-American research group prefer different processes for the last erosion of the unconformity, and the time when this occurred. Possibilities include subaerial erosion in an arid rift basin ending about 55 Ma., submarine canyons or rivers last eroding soon after 55 Ma., and erosion by ice soon after 34 Ma. However, the paleo-depth of top syn-rift is 2.5 km for the deepest part of Central Trough if 34 Ma. This may be too deep for grounded ice given the CO2 levels and ocean water temperatures at this time. However, ice may have eroded less deep flanks of this trough.</p> <p><strong>Paleo-depth of Ross Sea</strong></p> <p>Douglas Wilson performed paleo-depth reconstructions for several unconformities, including ~15 Ma, ~21 Ma., ~25 Ma., ~29 Ma. +/-, and top syn-rift/acoustic basement. The resulting digital maps indicate that much of Ross Sea was close to sea level at 25, 21, and 15 Ma. It seems logical that a Global Climate Model using these reconstructions might predict ice sheets advancing and retreating across a shallow Ross Sea after 25 Ma.</p> <p>We have more direct evidence that grounded ice advanced north of the current edge of Ross Ice Shelf into Eastern Basin of Ross Sea ~25 Ma. Figure 3 images a stack of unconformities, with the top one, the Blue "Mid-270" ~25 Ma. unconformity, cutting deeper eastward towards the center of Eastern Basin. The paleodepth map (bottom of Figure 3) for this unconformity has the area of this seismic reflection profile near sea level.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p> <p>The international collaboration with OGS, located near Trieste, Italy, continues. An Italian Ph.D. student is part of this collaboration, as is a University of North Carolina Ph.D. student who completed his degree. These student projects respectively model 14 Ma. paleo-topography of Ross Sea (Olivo et al., 2017), and analyze glacial marine stratigraphy dated between 21 and 29 Ma. beneath eastern Ross Sea. Other researchers can use our more accurate paleo-topography of this part of Ross Embayment in their Global Climate Models including ice sheet growth and retreat.</p> <p>References are in a separate part of this NSF Final Report.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/09/2018<br>      Modified by: Christopher&nbsp;C&nbsp;Sorlien</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1341585/1341585_10269550_1525877937761_PLR1341585-Sorlien-Outcomes-Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1341585/1341585_10269550_1525877937761_PLR1341585-Sorlien-Outcomes-Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure1-PLR1341585-C.Sorlien-B.Luyendyk-D.Wilson, 2018"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1341585/1341585_10269550_1525877937761_PLR1341585-Sorlien-Outcomes-Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure1-PLR1341585-C.Sorlien-B.Luyendyk-D.Wilson, 2018"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1: The depth-converted part of a 21 Ma unconformity.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ OCE PLR 1341585, Outcomes, Subsidence, Tilting, sedimentation, and Oligocene-Miocene paleo-depth of Ross Sea  Christopher Sorlien, Bruce Luyendyk, and Douglas Wilson  Introduction  Ross Embayment, including Ross Sea, Antarctica, was a high-elevation plateau that has been subsiding since 104 million years ago (Ma.) due to crustal stretching and thinning [Luyendyk et al., 2001; Bialis et al., 2007]. This subsidence to the current water depths is important because elevation or water depths affect whether ice sheets will grow and advance given environmental condistions such as CO2 level and ocean water temperatures.  We interpreted the stratigraphy of most of Ross Sea, using mostly erosional surfaces (unconformities) dated between ~29 and ~15 Ma. This was done using acoustic imaging below the sea floor (seismic reflection data). Figure 1 shows a map of the depth to one of these unconformities. We created velocity models of this area and converted grids of 6 unconformities from sound travel time to depth. These depth maps were then modeled together with other information to create depth/elevation maps for times in the past.  Intellectual Merit  Terror Rift 23-13 Ma Passive Subsidence vs. Ongoing Extension  The part of Terror Rift north of Ross Island is almost 400 km-long (Fig. 1). Several publications propose that southern Terror Rift did not experience active extension and crustal thinning between 23 and 13 Ma. [example, Fielding et al., 2008]. In these interpretations, there was renewed rifting after 13 Ma. Our interpretations indicate active faulting across the east side of northern Terror Rift after ~21 Ma., and possibly before then. Furthermore, our interpretation does not support significant change in subsidence rates of the deepest part of Terror Rift after 29 Ma.  Age of an Unconformity and Processes Responsible for it  We investigated whether glaciers eroded Ross Sea soon after 34 Ma. Figure 2 images the reflective syn-rift section (sedimentary rocks deposited at the same time as crustal stretching) and the unconformity that caps it. Different members of our Italian-American research group prefer different processes for the last erosion of the unconformity, and the time when this occurred. Possibilities include subaerial erosion in an arid rift basin ending about 55 Ma., submarine canyons or rivers last eroding soon after 55 Ma., and erosion by ice soon after 34 Ma. However, the paleo-depth of top syn-rift is 2.5 km for the deepest part of Central Trough if 34 Ma. This may be too deep for grounded ice given the CO2 levels and ocean water temperatures at this time. However, ice may have eroded less deep flanks of this trough.  Paleo-depth of Ross Sea  Douglas Wilson performed paleo-depth reconstructions for several unconformities, including ~15 Ma, ~21 Ma., ~25 Ma., ~29 Ma. +/-, and top syn-rift/acoustic basement. The resulting digital maps indicate that much of Ross Sea was close to sea level at 25, 21, and 15 Ma. It seems logical that a Global Climate Model using these reconstructions might predict ice sheets advancing and retreating across a shallow Ross Sea after 25 Ma.  We have more direct evidence that grounded ice advanced north of the current edge of Ross Ice Shelf into Eastern Basin of Ross Sea ~25 Ma. Figure 3 images a stack of unconformities, with the top one, the Blue "Mid-270" ~25 Ma. unconformity, cutting deeper eastward towards the center of Eastern Basin. The paleodepth map (bottom of Figure 3) for this unconformity has the area of this seismic reflection profile near sea level.  Broader Impacts  The international collaboration with OGS, located near Trieste, Italy, continues. An Italian Ph.D. student is part of this collaboration, as is a University of North Carolina Ph.D. student who completed his degree. These student projects respectively model 14 Ma. paleo-topography of Ross Sea (Olivo et al., 2017), and analyze glacial marine stratigraphy dated between 21 and 29 Ma. beneath eastern Ross Sea. Other researchers can use our more accurate paleo-topography of this part of Ross Embayment in their Global Climate Models including ice sheet growth and retreat.
