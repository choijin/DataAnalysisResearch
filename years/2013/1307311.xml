<AbstractNarration>High-energy gamma-rays are used to study the most extreme objects in the Universe, such as pulsars, black holes at the center of active galaxies, and gamma-ray bursts. Cosmic gamma-rays can also be signatures for new physics beyond the standard models of particle physics and cosmology.  Studies with very-high-energy gamma rays, above about 100 gigaelectron volt (GeV), require ground-based detectors with thousands of square meters of collection area. This research will use the VERITAS imaging Cherenkov telescope array in southern Arizona to study gamma-rays with energy greater than about 100 GeV.  The sensitivity of VERITAS is more than an order of magnitude better than previous generation instruments operating in this energy range and has just been improved further by a substantial upgrade. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award the University of California - Santa Cruz group will use VERITAS to explore the extreme behavior of the two most powerful known classes of gamma-ray source: gamma-ray bursts and active galactic nuclei. The detail mechanisms of gamma-ray bursts and the role they play in other high-energy phenomena are still being explored. Learning whether they are capable of creating very-high-energy gamma-rays will constrain gamma-ray burst models and properties of the burst environment.  Similarly, measurements of the very-high-energy gamma-ray emission from active galactic nuclei probe properties of the jets, providing crucial information about the particles being accelerated and how the acceleration works.  Data from across the electromagnetic spectrum will be gathered and used to assemble the most complete possible picture of very high-energy gamma-ray behavior. These data will also be used to study gamma-ray absorption by collisions with the extragalactic background light, a process that tests cosmological models of star formation and galaxy evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:  Graduate and undergraduate students play an important part in this research effort. Research experiences will also be made available to aspiring science teachers in the Cal Teach program and in-service teachers through a new Lick Observatory Teachers Institute. The researchers interact with the California State University to foster undergraduate interest in research and graduate education. There is an important interplay between the VERITAS data and data from other wavelengths, particularly X-ray and lower energy gamma-ray data from satellite missions such as Swift and Fermi. More can be learned from both types of data used together than from either alone.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Very high-energy gamma rays from cosmic sources can be used to study some of the most extreme objects in the universe, such as active galaxies with massive black holes in the center and gamma-ray bursts from the explosive collapse of massive stars that have exhausted their fuel.  Gamma rays from these sources can also be used to probe the intervening intergalactic medium. The research supported by this award has led to new insights about these topics.   Among the broader impacts of the research are the training of a number of developing scientists from diverse backgrounds.  Gamma rays with energy greater than 100 GeV, roughly a hundred billion times as energetic as optical light and ten million times as energetic as X-rays, are classified as very high energy (VHE).  When these gamma rays strike the Earth?s atmosphere, the energy is converted into a cascade of lower energy particles which in turn produce a brief, faint flash of light as they move through the atmosphere.  The VERITAS system of four telescopes is designed to collect and focus this light onto specialized cameras capable of recording images 500 million times a second under night sky.  The images recorded by the cameras on the four telescopes are used to determine the energy and direction of incoming gamma rays, as well as to distinguish gamma rays from other types of cosmic rays, primarily protons.  The VERITAS telescopes were the primary tool used in this research to study VHE gamma rays from celestial objects.   A few of the key results are summarized in the following.  A number of active galaxies were studied as part of this research.  VHE gamma-ray emission was discovered from several of these, including the second most distant source of VHE gamma rays known, PKS 1441+25.  The fact that enough gamma rays reached Earth to be able to detect them allowed a strong constraint to be placed on the amount of starlight in the intergalactic medium, since gamma rays that collide with starlight are absorbed.  This in turn places constraints on cosmological models of structure formation that predict the amount of starlight.  The ability of the gamma-rays to escape the galaxy where they are produced also means that they could not have originated too near the black hole, where the radiation from the hot material provides another source of light that can absorb them.  The result shows, therefore, that the gamma rays must be produced at some distance from the black hole, a new insight into the acceleration of high-energy particles in active galaxies.  Another project that was part of this research assessed the published data on the spectra of VHE gamma-ray spectra to estimate the amount of gamma-ray absorption from starlight.  This study found the starlight density to be consistent with the levels predicted from galaxy surveys and found no indication of anomalies in the amount of absorption, as had been reported in some other studies.  VERITAS data were taken as quickly as possible on the locations of many gamma-ray bursts.  While none was significantly detected, VERITAS upper limits on the amount of gamma-ray emission can still place important constraints on models of the bursts.  In particular, the results on GRB 150323A show it to be intrinsically faint at VHE, with less than about 1% of the dissipated energy radiated in VHE.  This project provided an opportunity for many developing scientists to get involved in research for the first time or to expand their skills.  Eight high school students completed summer research projects with the group as part of the Science Internship Program at UCSC.  Thirteen undergraduates participated in the research, two of whom continued to graduate study in physics, astronomy, or engineering; four of whom are now working in industrial research and development; and several of whom are still completing their degrees.  Two graduate students participated in this research, one on her thesis research and another started laying the foundation for dissertation research.  Finally, two postdoctoral scholars made substantial contributions to the research.  One is now a tenure-track faculty member and the other continues to work with the group.  In the course of their work on the project, many of the participants at all levels were involved in activities to bring the excitement and value of scientific inquiry to the general public and to younger students in particular.
