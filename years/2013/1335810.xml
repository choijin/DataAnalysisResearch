<AbstractNarration>The PIs request funding for the acquisition of an integrated system of instruments required for genomic sequencing of environmental microorganisms. This includes sequencers and supporting instruments for DNA extraction and sequencing library preparation. The requested sequencing instrumentation will complement the already existing infrastructure at Bigelow for pre- and post-sequencing analyses, to provide comprehensive support for microbial genomic studies. This acquisition will accelerate existing and new research programs, and enable novel technology development. By enabling improved and expanded Single Cell Genomics Center (SCGC) services to external users, it will also benefit the global research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The benefits of the proposed instrumentation stand to expand our understanding of marine plankton genomics at an unprecedented rate. The association with the SCGC at Bigelow Laboratory is a very strong connection; where leading research in sorting and amplifying high quality single cell genomes from bacteria, archaea and small eukaryotes has taken this facility to the top in the world for this field. The societal benefits are related to the advancement of the science to be conducted at this center using the acquired instrumentation, and through a strong outreach plan that involves curricula of a diverse suite of initiatives including training in research for undergraduates (REU), study semesters for Colby College students, workshops with the state of Maine, and specialized workshops such as have been held for scientists interested in single cell genomics. The acquired instrumentation will be used for hands-on training at student and professional levels that is very hard to find, in which the workshops can include start-to-finish experiences from DNA extraction through computational analysis.</AbstractNarration>
