<AbstractNarration>Abstract (Climenhaga, 1363024): &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of 25 US graduate students for a 10-day summer school in Houston, Texas called "Houston Summer School in Dynamical Systems".  It will also help support one lecturer who will deliver some of the lectures to the graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will be 7 internationally recognized lecturers giving expository talks on many of the recent exciting results and developments in probabilistic dynamics and applications.  Most of these techniques are not in textbook form and are only found in specialized journals in a form not readily accessible to a beginning graduate student. The school will enable the students to become familiar with main ideas and techniques of modern dynamics at a formative stage of their research career. In particular, the school will introduce recent developments in probabilistic dynamics to mathematical researchers who may go on to work in other fields that will benefit from these ideas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The "2014 Houston Summer School in Dynamical Systems" was held from May 14-23, 2014 at the University of Houston.  Participants came from around the U.S. and included 40 graduate students, 6 undergraduate students, and 2 postdoctoral fellows.  The school consisted of six short courses covering various aspects of dynamical systems theory, with an emphasis on the relationships between probability theory and dynamics; in particular, the question of how a system that evolves in time according to deterministic rules can nevertheless exhibit behavior that appears random.  This question has been well studied in the scientific literature, but many of the key ideas in the field are not readily available in the literature in a form that is accessible to graduate students; this was one motivation for the school.  Lectures were given by five professors at University of Houston (the five co-PIs of this grant) and by Renato Feres (Washington University St Louis).  As part of the school, the participants completed short projects that involved reading and reporting on a paper from the research literature.  Lecture notes from the school have been made available online at http://www.math.uh.edu/~climenha/2014-school.html.  In a survey given at the end of the school, student feedback was very positive, with 98% of respondents indicating that they would recommend the summer school to other students interested in dynamical systems.  The organizers are planning another similar event in May 2015.       Last Modified: 04/08/2015       Submitted by: Vaughn Climenhaga]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
