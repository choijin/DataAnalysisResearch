<AbstractNarration>The lack of a reliable family tree for the extraordinarily diverse beetle family Curculionidae (true weevils) has impeded taxonomic, systematic and applied research on weevils. This project will reconstruct the family tree of Curculionidae and establish a timeframe for weevil diversification by analyzing genomic and morphological (anatomical) data. The genomic data gathered will consist of DNA sequences from 1,000 species representing all major groups of weevils, obtained via an approach called anchored phylogenomics. This will be one of the first applications of this new method for gathering phylogenomic data in insects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Curculionidae contains &gt;51,000 named species and is one of the largest families of animals on Earth. Because of their intimate and often highly specialized interactions with plants and fungi, Curculionidae are among the most significant pests of agriculture and forestry worldwide, and some of the most abundant insects on Earth. This project will clarify the interrelationships of all major groups of weevils for the first time. The resulting family trees will be used to test long-standing hypotheses about weevil relationships and evolution, and will contribute to resolving the taxonomic problems that both pervade the internal higher classification of weevils and impede research on economically and ecologically important weevil species.</AbstractNarration>
