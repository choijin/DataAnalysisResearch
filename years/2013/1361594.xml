<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The award from the NSF underpinned the organization and hosting of the 9th International Conference on the Environmental Effects of Nanoparticles and Nanomaterials held at the University of South Carolina, 7-11th September 2014. An international series organizing committee and a local organizing committee were set up to ensure excellence and broad-based support internationally and locally.  The conference provided an environment for knowledge dissemination and networking between academics, regulators and industry and covered areas include nanoparticle synthesis and characterization, their environmental transformations, their fate and toxicity in the environment, as well as social and regulatory aspects of nanotechnology. Specifically the following sessions were organized:    1) Physical and chemical properties of nanoparticles as related to the environment and health    2) Ageing and effects on fate and behavior    3) Toxicology and ecotoxicology    4) Social and regulatory sciences    5) Innovation and applications of nanotechnology to environmental and health issues.    Over 130 people attended the conference from more than 15 different countries, with invited speakers from the US, Canada and Europe. In addition to the academic conference the following were held: a panel discussion on next generation nanomaterials, a session from joint US-UK research consortia, a PhD training workshop and an open day for the general public and schools attended by more than 100 people from the local populace. In addition to the general aim of producing improved discussions and networking which is integral to improving our scientific knowledge and applying this to regulatory and economic development, a number of specific items were achieved, including a number of joint papers, possibly to make a special issue in relevant disciplinary journals.
