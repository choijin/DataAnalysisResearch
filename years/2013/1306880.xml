<AbstractNarration>This award, an Industry-University Collaborative Project between the University of Wisconsin-Madison and scientists and engineers at Northrop-Grumman Corporation, demonstrates a new type of nuclear magnetic resonance using noble-gas nuclei.  The essential innovation is to use an integrated atomic magnetometer to get the best signal-to-noise ratio, while greatly suppressing potential errors introduced by the magnetometer. The resonator is of fundamental interest for searches for spin-dependent symmetry violation tests, and of practical interest in improving the state-of-the-art in NMR gyroscopes. The key to the new approach is the concept of synchronous spin-exchange optical pumping, wherein the magnetometer atoms and the nuclei are made to precess at the same frequency.  Estimates of technical noise indicate the system has a potential frequency noise level of better than 1 nHz/ Hz, with fundamental limits that are much better. The oscillator will be used to set new stringent limits on the potential couplings of potential dark matter candidates to nuclei. The resonator will also be evaluated for use as a precision NMR gyro. While the developments here represent a substantially new approach to NMR oscillators, the Industry-University collaboration will allow industrial expertise with conventional NMR oscillator technology to be leveraged for accelerated development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the normal academic research training of undergraduate and graduate students, the project provides substantive exposure of students to industrial scientists and engineers working in an R&amp;D environment. Students benefit from industrial expertise in areas such as electronics, magnetic field, and thermal design.  The work being pursued has both fundamental and practical applications and the nuclear magnetic resonator will be evaluated in particular for potential applications to navigation</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project investigated a new type of high precision method of magnetic resonance that should allow advances in the sensitivity for looking for new types of forces, and that could lead to new types of miniature gyroscopes, necessary for non-GPS inertial navigation systems.  Such devices are needed for sensitive applications that do not wish to rely on GPS for navigation.  This work is based on ideas that had been developed conceptually and patented prior to beginning the project.  During the course of this study we demonstrated the basic principles we had asserted in our patent for this device.  We also discovered some effects that we had not anticipated, and found ways to mitigate them.  We exteded the work from single to dual species, really allowing for rotation-sensitive measurments, and measured the noise levels.  This work was presented at several conferences, and the major findings were published in the journals Physical Review Letters and Advances in Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics.  The project was part of the training of several graduate students and a postdoc.  One student, Anna Korver, received her PhD based on this work and is now a teacher in Boston. The students not only learned how to do physics research, but in collaboration with scientists from Norhtrop-Grumman Corp. were exposed to industrial research and development.
