<AbstractNarration>A grant is awarded to the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography to acquire a new inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICPMS) for trace element analysis of environmental samples. This new instrument includes technology far superior to that of the existing ICPMS it will replace. The impact on research that this will have is obvious. It is more cost efficient regarding operation and maintenance and it is compatible with a number of sample introduction methodologies, providing more versatility in trace element analysis and expanding the number of analytes that can be quantified in coastal marine matrices. Because of the more user-friendly nature of the instrumentation it will enhance training of students, as well as technicians and colleagues, in its application, which in turn, will improve their understanding of the technology, and encourage their use of it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Skidaway Institute of Oceanography (SkIO) has provided facilities including research vessels, well instrumented laboratories and housing to support marine research for not only its resident faculty and staff, but also for visiting scientists and students from state, regional and international institutions. Over the past 45 years SkIO has provided logistical support for multidiscipline, multi-institution collaborations in trace element research and education along the southeastern Atlantic coast. The Institute's commitment to upgrading and maintaining analytical instrumentation, as demonstrated by this award, assures that it will continue to catalyze trace element research and education focused on riverine, estuarine and continental shelf environments. These efforts address both natural processes and human interventions that influence trace element transport and cycling in coastal systems.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant provided funds to purchase a state of the art quadrupole ICP-MS. The Skidaway Institute of Oceanography of the University of Georgia provided funds for the renovation of clean and instrument rooms and ancillary infrastructure to accommodate the new instrumentation. These modifications were accomplished in FY 14.    Two scientist attended a one week training class on the operation of thie new instrument in FY14. This training also included advanced applications in ICP-MS.  The overall goal of this award is to enhance and expand  the instituteÃ†s capability for research and education related to trace element biogeochemistry. The expected outcome of this investment is initiation of new inter- and intra-institutional cooperative research projects and graduate and undergraduate educational programs.  The new intrumentation was fully operartional in January 2015.  The institute/UGA hired a new assistant professor with extensive postdoctoral experience/training in marine trace element research in FY 14 and he will assume the responsibility for the maintenance and operation of the facility.   The upgraded facility is already being used in new collaborations in Antarctic and Arctic research  as well as in a proposed new research project on the continental shelf of southern Brazil in collaboration with scientists from other institutions in both the US and Brazil.
