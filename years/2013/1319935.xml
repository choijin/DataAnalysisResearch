<AbstractNarration>Thin-film transistors (TFTs) are one of the most important components of macro-electronic circuits used in various flexible electronic applications such as displays, large area sensors, radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, and antennas. In this context, Carbon Nanotube Thin-Film Transistors (CN-TFTs) are very promising for enhancing performance and expanding the range of operation of many flexible-electronic applications due to several reasons. However, some critical issues need to be addressed before CN-TFTs can be made available for commercial flexible electronic use. The objectives of this research are to: (a) analyze the effects of different coatings of CN-TFT substrates and self-heating on CN-TFT performance and reliability; and (b) design and analyze energy efficient and self-healing CN-TFT circuits and establish/control the effects of statistical and morphological variability of transistors on circuit-level performance. A multi-scale modeling framework consisting of an atomistic model for Carbon Nanotube (CNT) junctions, electro-thermal transport model for CN-TFTs, and circuit models will be developed to enable this analysis. The multi-scale framework will facilitate the design of energy efficient, high performance, and reliable CN-TFT circuits and establish guidelines for significant decrease in the power consumption, hot spot temperature, and performance variations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Efficient numerical methods developed for multi-scale electrical and thermal transport will boost the field of efficient computing and analysis of electronic devices. This program will develop education modules on power consumption, energy transport and heat dissipation in electronic devices and energy-efficient circuit design, which will enhance the undergraduate and graduate curriculum. Small demonstrations and hands-on sessions prepared by this program will motivate K-12 students for higher education.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Overview:</strong> Carbon nanotube (CNT) network based thin film transistors (CN-TFTs) are very promising for enhancing the performance of many large-area flexible-electronics applications such as displays, sensors, RF identification tags, and antennas. Despite their great promise, a large number of critical issues have not been understood such as power dissipation and self-heating effects and performance variability and performance limits of CN-TFT circuits. The objectives of this project was to: (i) Analyze the thermal transport mechanism at the CNT-substrate interface using atomistic simulations and identify the gateways of phonon transport for effective heat removal and enhanced performance of the CN-TFTs, (ii) Investigate the effect of self-heating on the CN-TFT performance by developing and employing a self-consistent and coupled electro-thermal model; and (iii) Design and analyze energy efficient and self-healing CN-TFT circuits and establish the effects of statistical and morphological variability of the transistors on circuit-level performance. We fabricated and characterized array of CN-TFTs and developed a multi-scale framework, spanning from atomistic simulations, device simulations and circuit analysis, which establishes guidelines for significant decrease in the power consumption, hot spot temperature and performance variations of these devices.</p> <p><strong>Outcomes (Intellectual Merit):</strong> We fabricated array of CN-TFTs of different device dimensions, and analyzed variability in the output characteristic through a combination of experimental and computational methods. We obtained distribution function for different sources of variation such as threshold voltage, CNT network density and CNT length through the measurement and network simulation using the statistical information obtained from the measurements. We developed a methodology which can be used for the reconstruction of the variability of I-V characteristics for CN-TFTs from the distribution function of the relevant parameters; this can serve as a tool for the reliability analysis and testing of CN-TFT based devices and circuits.&nbsp;</p> <p>We investigated heat dissipation at CNT junctions supported on silicon dioxide substrate using molecular dynamics simulations. We observed that temperature rise in a CNT not making direct contact with the oxide substrate but only supported by other CNTs can be hundreds of degree higher compared with the CNTs well-contacted to substrate. We performed analysis of energy transport from CNT-to-substrate in different frequency bands of atomic vibrations which will provide further insights in reducing hot spot temperature and power consumption in these TFTs. High field properties of CN-TFTs are important for their practical operation, and for understanding their reliability. Using a combination of experimental and computational techniques we show how the channel geometry and network morphology affect heat dissipation and high field breakdown in such devices. We find that the breakdown power is more susceptible to the variability in the network morphology compared to the breakdown voltage. The analysis offers new insights into the tunable heat dissipation and thermal reliability of CN-TFTs, which can be significantly improved through optimization of the network morphology and device geometry.</p> <p>We developed a very simple tuning methodology for CN-TFT enabled circuits using a ring-oscillator configuration. The effective widths of individual &ldquo;critical&rdquo; transistors of a CN-TFT based Opamp are changed randomly (transistor with programmable fingers are used for tuning). The Opamp is placed in a ring oscillator loop, configured as an inverter in a 3-inverter chain. It is seen that there is a tight correlation between the oscillation frequency of the ring oscillator configuration and the performance of the opamp. The transistor configuration with the highest resulting oscillation frequency is chosen as the &ldquo;best&rdquo; configuration for the circuit. It is seen that yield improvements of up to 12% are obtained using the proposed performance tuning methodology.</p> <p class="TAMainText"><strong>Outcomes (Broader Impact)</strong>: One of the students from Mechanical Engineering (ME) Dept. working on the modeling of CN-TFTs has graduated with doctoral degree and joined FORD Motors. Three other students (two in ME and one in ECE Dept.) are pursuing doctoral degrees in related areas. One of these students working on this project is graduating in Spring 2018 and will be joining Intel Corp in Santa Clara, CA and other two will students will graduate in 2019. The tuning work was presented at the International Mixed-Signal Testing Workshop held in Paris in September 2015. The results related with fabrication and modeling of CN-TFTs has been presented in ASME Summer Heat Transfer Conference and InterPACK conference. Two archival journal papers based on the results of this research has been published and two other papers are in review. CN-TFT device and circuit models developed in this research will be used by future students working on this project. It is expected that the research will be used to design various kinds of sensors for gas sensing and health applications. The knowledge developed for heat transport mechanism at CNT junctions supported on substrate, power dissipation in CNT networks, effect of variability on device performance and tuning methodology developed for CN-TFT enabled circuits will provide guidelines for usage of various nano-materials in making efficient devices/circuits.&nbsp;</p> <p class="TAMainText">&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>
