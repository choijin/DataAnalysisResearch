<AbstractNarration>Healthcare resources can be described either in terms of money, or in terms of health outcomes. Yet, past research suggests that people tend to use principles consistent with market norms (e.g., efficiency) to allocate money, but are reluctant to do so for &lt;br/&gt;"sacred values" such as health and lives. This research examines how people's allocation preference for healthcare resources can shift, depending on whether allocation policies are framed in terms of financial cost or health outcomes. It also explores whether people apply different allocation strategies to different types of healthcare resources based on how scarce they perceive the particular resource to be. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The United States faces an eminent need to curb healthcare spending. However, there is no obvious consensus among members of the public on how to allocate the limited healthcare resources, nor is there agreement about how to balance efficiency versus equality in such allocations. The proposed research untangles public opinions on healthcare allocation by examining the influence of policy framing and perceived scarcity. This research studies large  scale national  probaility  samples  of   American  adults and will provide rich data on public opinions for a critical health policy issue; the distribution of limited healthcare resources. It will also provide guidance to policymakers for how to design different allocation policies for different healthcare resources, as well as how to frame allocation policies to gain the most public support for proposed policies.</AbstractNarration>

In 5 years of research, we have identified some exciting and surprising results. These findings provide valuable insights both intellectually and practically.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <p>The project originally predicted that when the same healthcare resources are framed in terms of monetary cost versus the life-and-death consequence in terms of lives, people will have differential allocation preferences in response to the framing. We did not find such a framing effect.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, across 18 studies, we did find a consistent shift of the public's allocation preference when the allocation involves different kinds of consequences. That is, when the public is asked to allocate limited resources that would save lives, they focus on how to use the resources in the most efficient manner, for example, by allocating more humanitarian resources in the way that saves the most lives. In contrast, when the public is asked to allocate resources with no life-and-death consequences (e.g., rebuilding highways, allocating money to improve the economy after a disaster), they focus on how to allocate the resources in the most equal way, for example, by allocating money equally across locations regardless of the total benefit produced. We found the public also treats near-life-and-death situations like life-and-death situations, for example, by allocating hypothetical Zika vaccines in a manner that prevents the greatest&nbsp;total number of birth defects even if it means unequal allocations of the vaccine across different poplations.&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition, we discovered that this preference for efficiency in life-saving allocations is not due to the magnitude of the stakes involved, and people's implicit associations with efficiency and equality did not change when the allocation involves lives versus money. We also found that whether the resources are more or less scarce did not influence the public's allocation preference.</p> <p>These findings provide new insights to our understanding of people's allocation preference across domains. These findings are surprising, as we initially expected people to prefer efficiency more in monetary allocations, and to prefer equality more in health-related allocations, the opposite of what we found. However, prior research examined these two domains of allocation in separate literatures using different paradigms, whereas the current studies compared these different domains side by side using an experimental design, thus offering a more direct test of the public's allocation preferences across domains. These findings highlight the different moral rules that the public adopts in different allocation contexts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>These findings also have significant policy implications. Specifically, they suggest that in order to garner public support for policies governing the allocation of life-saving resources, such as vaccines for life-threatening pandemic diseases, decision-makers should pay close attention the efficiency of how these resources are allocated, whereas for policies governing other kinds of resources decision-makers should be more attentive to the public's desire for a more equal allocation. The results also suggest that, even though at a higher-level, different allocations may tap in the same pool of common resources (tax revenue), the public treats them as categorically different allocation problems. Thus, allocation policies based solely on rational cost-and-benefit analysis may be missing key factors that the public cares about when it comes to what they think is good and fair.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/19/2019<br>      Modified by: Meng&nbsp;Li</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1357170/1357170_10298299_1560971600498_MoneylivesStudy1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1357170/1357170_10298299_1560971600498_MoneylivesStudy1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Choice of Allocation Plans in Study 1 of Li et al (2019)"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1357170/1357170_10298299_1560971600498_MoneylivesStudy1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Choice of Allocation Plans in Study 1 of Li et al (2019)"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Percentages of participants choosing each plan in the ?Money? and ?Lives? conditions.
