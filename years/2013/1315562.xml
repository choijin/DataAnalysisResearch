<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will investigate development of a Lead Zirconium Titanate (PZT) analog of multilayer ceramic capacitor (MLCC) technology.  Typically comprised of Barium Titanate materials, MLCC devices are the most produced and used capacitors in electronic industry with a produced quantity of approximately 1000 billion pieces per year. However, as a piezoelectric material, Barium Titanate has been largely replaced by PZT.   However, PZT device applications have been constrained until now by both cost and performance.  In particular, although used extensively for mid-high voltages that extend from laptop transformers to actuators, such technology struggles with low voltage applications prohibiting it from key applications such as electronics power supplies and adaptors.  The aim is to emulate MLCC technology with two fundamental distinctions more complex materials poling of final multilayer devices and enabling such multilayer electroded ceramic production that eliminates the onerous cost of capital equipment to manufacture.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be that it directly enables application of PZT technology to a wide range of very low/mid voltage (low to high impedance electrical load) power electronics applications, much as has been accomplished for electronics with MLCC technology.  It will enable non-magnetic power electronics including supplies, voltage sensors, isolators, and point-of-load inverters that both drastically reduce electromagnetic interface (EMI) and radio frequency interface (RFI) issues and lead to a far greener technology solution for emergent electronics based consumer goods, such as light-emitting diode (LED) lighting and low cost solar energy.  The new technology is potentially smaller, lighter weight and less cost to produce than magnetics-based products, which, at present, is the only option for this enormous array of volume consumer products and applications that include all mobile electronics, gaming consoles, wireless communication, and indeed all control boards used in vehicular, aerospace and domestic use.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ At the present time Commerical, Industrial,  Missile &amp; Space, Medical, and Exploration communities are completely restricted to magnetic-based power equipment for all equipment ranging from simple transformers to sophisticated power handling.

The new technology of ceramic-based power singly addresses all of these negatives. It has been steadily encroaching into the traditional electromagnetic markets, especially for high voltage transformers and power supplies.

The technology developed within the Phase-I program focused on investigating multilayer ceramic manufacturing processes that could lead to &gt;30W capable step-down ceramic transformers, e.g. laptop adapter, FPGA processor boards, wall mount adaptors.

Comprehensive tests of the prototype devices manufactured with further optimized process suggest that 30W &ndash; continuous power step-down converters are well within near-term reach.  The intellectual merit of this program has been the first-ever development of a low-cost (non-bond) manufacturing method for multilayer ceramic devices. it is easy to multilayer using adhesives, but this introduces major problems in performance and durability as to be worthless.  The invented process can be applied to all multilayer ceramic capacitor design and manufacture (note that cofired multilayer ceramic capacitors dominate the entire electronics market and are manufactured in their hundreds of millions per annum).  More importantly to us, the new process can enable (non-bonded) multilayer ceramic fabrication where there is unconventional electroding.  This first-ever process enables all of the above to now be able to far more rapidly, and at substantially lower cost, develop pre-cofired multilayer ceramic capacitor devices for evaluation prior to going into, a possibly multi-million investment, production capacity manufacture.   The new invention implements an unconventional post-processing, layering and electrode layout techniques that increases the power handling, improves efficiency using conventional (piezo-) ceramic materials. The new manufacturing technique provides an economic and agile manufacturing alternative for low-volume production of multilayer ceramic-based devices that is provides the first ever ceramic analog of FPGA pre-cursor to bulk ASIC manufacture in processors.  The broad impact of technology developed in Phase I is that it applies to all multilayer ceramic capacitor manufacturing.  So, traditional ceramic capacitor manufacturers can reap the benefits with quick/cheap prototyping; but, because of its low cost, so can research institutes or small businesses who can use this new process to cost-effectively investigate new devices that might replace legacy power equipment components.  Our specific interest is to replace magnetic transformers with ceramics that can be directly applicable to the huge $7B/annum market in low voltage power supplies.  The next step in the program will be to focus specifically on the æall-ceramicÆ step-down voltage transformers by coupling the new low-volume manufacturing process of Phase I with a high-volume manufacture process ceramic-based capacitive power electronic devices by exploiting ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
