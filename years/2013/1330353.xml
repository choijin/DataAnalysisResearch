<AbstractNarration>This is a study of algorithmic systems used to automatically identify suspected victims and exploiters, which become part of the arsenal of tools deployed by anti-trafficking networks, which include law enforcement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will result in a dissertation and trained professional. Results will be disseminated to a wide range of stake-holders.</AbstractNarration>
