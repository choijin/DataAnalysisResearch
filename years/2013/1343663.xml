<AbstractNarration>The very success of the industries that produce information technology (IT) and the pervasiveness&lt;br/&gt;of their products and services in our daily lives can obscure the mutually reinforcing&lt;br/&gt;roles that industry, government, and academia play in conducting IT research and its translation&lt;br/&gt;into new products, services, and industries. This project will capture examples of such phenomena&lt;br/&gt;as how much industry builds on government-funded university research, the long incubation&lt;br/&gt;periods sometimes needed for research to be translated into major industry activities, the&lt;br/&gt;steady work and funding required to get from initial exploration to large-scale commercial&lt;br/&gt;deployment, the interdependencies between research advances in different subfields, and the&lt;br/&gt;complex nature of the IT research ecology. This project will build on earlier work by&lt;br/&gt;developing additional and/or more in-depth examples and providing updated information&lt;br/&gt;on research impacts and the other phenomena listed above in the context of these examples.</AbstractNarration>
