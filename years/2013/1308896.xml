<AbstractNarration>This action funds Ellen A. Lamont of the University of Connecticut, Center for Integrative Geosciences to conduct a research project in Geosciences during the summer of 2013 at National Cheng-Kung University, Department of Earth Sciences Tainan, Taiwan.  The project title is "Using Earthquake-Generated 3-D Imagery and GPS-Based Deformation Models to Understand a Plate Collision Zone in Taiwan." The host scientist is Dr. Ruey-Juin Rau.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant funds an integrative study of the geologically young Taiwan collisional zone that utilizes seismic, tomographic, and geodetic datasets (previously collected by a series of NSF supported instrumentation arrays).  The anomalously high convergence rate (82mm/yr toward 330°) (Lee and Chan, 2007) has created spectacular topography (~3km) adjacent to large coastal planes and has caused a complicated crustal architecture to develop.  The study area occurs at one of the youngest portions of the developing orogen and allows us to study these fundamental processes as they occur. Preliminary investigations of the area reveal a suite of earthquakes beneath the deforming orogenic material (i.e. beneath the decollément) and a conspicuous, high-velocity zone at 40km depth in tomographic imagery that may be controlling how the orogen deforms. From such findings, the Fellow hypothesizes two possible scenarios: 1) the primary decollément is stepping down into deeper continental basement possibly creating a new detachment over which the orogen is growing; 2) the deep seismicity and high velocity zone represent a change in the chemical composition of the lower crust.   A different type of crust would behave differently under stress and may well be the source of the deep seismicity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Further knowledge about the fundamental processes occurring in collisional systems is applicable to the study of other collisional systems, modern and historical. A protocol could also be developed pertaining to acceptable ways to integrate non-related datasets effectively.  More directly, active collision zones are sources for great earthquakes (i.e. the 1999 Chi-Chi Earthquake in Taiwan, the Chilean Earthquake, the 2011 Japan Earthquake, etc.) that cause millions of dollars in damage and the loss of countless innocent lives.  Advancing our knowledge of the way in which the crust deforms during collision would move us one step closer to developing more accurate models of fault locations, hazard identification and early warning systems, affectively reducing costs, both economic and human. Furthermore, Components of this project will also be used to supplement classroom lectures/activities and will enhance the research experience of early-career students in the United States and abroad. The results of this project will be made available to the wider tectonics and structural geology community through presentations at scientific conferences and the publication of the Fellow's master's thesis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Broader Impacts:    Throughout all of recorded history, humans have made their homes in close proximity to mountain ranges worldwide.  Some may argue this is because of the fruitfulness of the surrounding landscape, the accessibility to fresh water draining the range, protection from enemies, or even for simple aesthetics.  Regardless of the reason, vast populations have made these locations their home and, unfortunately, this does not come without its risks.  Mountain ranges are created as the result of collision between two plates; therefore, the regions surrounding mountain ranges are prime locations for geohazards associated with seismic activity (earthquakes). Earthquakes, and their associated hazards (i.e. landslides, damage to infrastructure, and the spread of disease), are among the most lethal natural hazards on Earth. As such, scientists have strived to understand the development of mountain ranges around the world to help in hazard mitigation efforts.  The more that is known about how a mountain range develops, the better equipped scientists are to target potential high risk hazard zones.     Intellectual Merit:    Current models of mountain growth suggest that most mountains are developed by the compression and deformation of passive margin sediments in a wedge shape above a basal detachment (decoll&eacute;ment) overriding a nearly undeformed lower plate. As such, mountain ranges are assumed to experience uniform lateral deformation with some variations attributed to heterogeneity in material type and proximity to the harder, more rigid continental margin during collision. Major simplifying assumptions of these models are that the margin over which sediments are deforming are generally straight and that the decoll&eacute;ment is a single, uniform surface spanning the extent of the deforming mountain range; however, variations in the geometry of the continental margin in addition to the existence of any pre-existing structures from older geologic events must be considered to properly understand the distribution of stress within the crust, thus leading to a more thorough identification of hazardous zones.   The fold-and-thrust belt at the front of the deforming Taiwan mountain range is an excellent place to study the deformation of a geologically young mountain range that is responding to a complex continental margin geometry. A promontory of thick continental margin material, flanked on either side by thick sedimentary basins, is acting as an indenter beneath the developing fold-and-thrust belt, forcing the overriding material to deform accordingly. Our investigation focused on understanding the mechanisms involved in accommodating deformation over the promontory and the lateral behavior of the decoll&eacute;ment from north to south as it passes over the indenter. One such interpreted mechanism is a series of transfer fault zones that developed as a connection to detachments occurring at different crustal depths that allow for the differential deformation of the range. This research suggests that more consideration must be given to the geometry of the continental margin and decoll&eacute;ment when evaluating hazards related to stress in the crust from mountain building.
