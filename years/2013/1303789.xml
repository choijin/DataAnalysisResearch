<AbstractNarration>This award will provide support for US participants, especially women, graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty, to attend the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth international conferences in Formal Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics (FPSAC), to be held in Paris (2013) and Chicago (2014). The most important annual conference series in algebraic combinatorics in the world, FPSAC offers young American researchers a unique opportunity to interact closely with top mathematicians from many countries. Somewhat interdisciplinary, the conferences link research in combinatorics to other topics in pure mathematics such as algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, representation theory, K-theory and symplectic geometry, and to topics in other sciences such as computer science, physics, and biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In June, 2013, the twenty-fifth International  Conference on Formal Power Series and Algebraic Combinatorics (FPSAC)  will be held at the University of Paris-Diderot in Paris, France.   In June, 2014, the twenty-sixth FPSAC was held in Chicago, Illinois. The conferences focused on algebraic and enumerative combinatorics and connections between these topics, other areas of mathematics, computer science, bioinformatics, and physics.  Arguably the most important conferences in the world  for the presentation of advances in algebraic and enumerative combinatorics, FPSAC's one-week annual meetings attract top mathematicians from many countries, and offer young researchers a unique opportunity to interact closely with them.   To closely follow advances in software, the conferences inluded  demonstrations of the free mathematics software system SAGE. Combining  the power of many existing packages into a common open-source  Python-based interface, SAGE fosters code sharing between researchers  and provides an extensive toolbox for computer exploration in algebraic  combinatorics.  The conference organizing committee pays special attention to including women and minorities on its mailing list and on its list of plenary speakers.  Just as many foreign countries offered financial support for their talented young researchers to attend FPSAC 2013 and FPSAC 2014, NSF grant 1303789 financially supported forty-seven talented young researchers from American institutions so that they too could attend the conferences.  All of these young mathematicians developed their careers by interacting with experts in algebraic combinatorics, making international contacts, and collaborating to obtain new and significant mathematical results.
