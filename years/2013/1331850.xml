<AbstractNarration>The goal of this multi-disciplinary project is to develop a simple, robust, generic, and scalable model-based and data-driven Fault Detection, Diagnosis and Prognosis (FDDP) process and the associated detection, inference and predictive analytics that are applicable to a variety of buildings.  The research is motivated by the observation that buildings account for more than 40% of US energy consumption. Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) constitutes 57% of energy used in commercial and residential buildings, valued at $223B in 2009. About 20% of the energy consumed by HVAC is wasted due to abrupt faults (e.g., stuck dampers), performance degradations (e.g., air filter clogging), poor controls (e.g., biases in set points), and improper commissioning (e.g., poorly balanced parallel chillers). This project will develop FDDP methodologies for HVACs to improve equipment availability, lower energy and operating costs, extend equipment life, and enhance occupants' comfort.  The FDDP process will be validated and evaluated by applying it to UConn's Tech Park Building; Duncaster, a life-care retirement community, located in Bloomfield, CT; and potentially to others.  The project contributes to the vision of green and sustainable buildings equipped with cyber-physical substrata consisting of HVAC modules, networked sensors providing information on spatial and temporal distribution of occupants, smart building management systems providing situation awareness and decision support to human operators, and improved tenant comfort.</AbstractNarration>

All of this make the FDDP in HVAC system challenging task. The work we have done provides a novel approach for FDDP in HVAC systems. Following are the highlights of our contributions. a. Augmented Reality-based Troubleshooting of HVAC Systems:          Major outcomes from this effort included (1) Testability of HVAC systems should be improved significantly; (2) Sensor optimization is salient; (3) It is reasonably straightforward to create a multi-functional model of the system; (4) It is possible to remotely monitor HVAC systems using an integrated diagnostics toolset; and (5) Integration of AR technologies can redefine traditional maintenance strategies. b. Modeling Imperfect Tests for fast and Accurate Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) Inference   Our work on a unified test model that includes the Detection-False Alarm (DFA), the Leaky Noisy OR (LNOR) and the logistic regression (LR) model as special cases provides a general framework for accurate MAP inference in bi-partite Bayesian networks used widely for fault diagnosis. c. A Fault Diagnosis Method for HVAC Air Handling Units Considering Fault Propagation        A new Statistical Process Control (SPC) rule is developed to detect state transitions with low false alarm rates by considering a fault property and couplings among components.  It represents a new and effective way to diagnose dependent faults accurately and robustly. d. Chiller Plant Fault Diagnosis Considering Fault Propagation        Our method uses model parameters relating to faults to supplement fault indicators to provide fault distinguishing information, leading to low false alarm rates. Additionally, it integrates Coupled Hidden Markov Models (CHMM) with the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to identify both the failure modes and their severities.

This work enabled us to isolate faults and estimate the severity via Deep learning techniques even when the fault is at an initial stage. h. Highly Accurate Thermal Comfort Models   Human thermal sensation is an important factor in creating a "comfortable" work/living environment.   Our thermal comfort model achieved an accuracy of 82 &minus; 85%, which is over twice that of the widely adopted Fanger?s model on a publicly available dataset. We believe that identifying factors that directly influence the thermal sensation of individuals, especially senior citizens, and using them to predict human thermal comfort in real-time will have enormous societal benefit.   This project helped in establishing state of the art education and training opportunities for students. The research and training opportunities in FDDP of HVAC system helped students in developing a strong understanding of an HVAC system, its functioning and modeling, thermal comfort models, sensors and fault propagations.  The overall experience provided a broader positive impact on their professional growth.  The FDDP algorithms developed are capable of detecting trends and degradations, and assessing the severity of hardware failures which, in turn, serve as an early indicator to the facility operators.  This will help them plan, prepare and prevent failures, reduce downtime and improve the thermal comfort in buildings.
