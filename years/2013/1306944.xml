<AbstractNarration>The University of Minnesota Duluth particle physics group of Gran and Habig is participating in Fermilab experiments MINOS+, MINERvA and NOvA, that are addressing questions of the neutrino mass hierarchy, improved measurements of the neutrino mass-squared difference and mixing parameters, improved measurements of neutrino cross sections and studying astrophysical neutrino sources. The University, an RUI institution, is strategically located close to the NOvA and MINOS detectors which are located in northern Minnesota.  This affords UMD students an excellent opportunity to participate effectively in the research program.  The broader impacts aspects of the program are extensive, as the group provides leadership for the education and outreach program of the Soudan Underground Laboratory in which the MINOS detector is located.  This program engages teachers, students and the public in the northern Minnesota region in the excitement of forefront research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF grant has supported the University of Minnesota Duluth neutrino research group in its work with the MINOS, NOvA, and MINERvA NuMI-beam based experiments and design work on the next generation DUNE experiment for the last three-plus years.   This has resulted in transformative contributions to our understanding of neutrinos, especially their interactions with nuclei and the phenomena of neutrino mixing: how they change as they travel.  One PI and multiple students? efforts produced a measurement of the way neutrinos scatter off of carbon nuclei that separates out the effects of two different processes (quasi elastic and delta interactions).  This way of looking at things is more directly comparable to the large body of knowledge out there regarding electron-nucleon scattering, allowing the strongest parallel conclusions to be drawn.  Combined with a count of how many protons are knocked loose by the collisions, this is a game-changer for the neutrino interaction community.  This analysis of MINERvA data clearly show that both "screening" effects happen in nuclei and that sometimes neutrinos hit multiple nucleons at once.  These results open up new avenues for modeling, model testing, and further precision measurements.   As this grant ended we made significant progress on the natural followup, the corresponding results for anti-neutrino reactions.    Those results were reported in summer 2017, with the same strong conclusions.  The combination of these MINERvA measurements, a reanalysis of the exceptional deuterium data from the 1980s, and close work with the theory community on modeling these "QE and 2p2h" interactions, the Duluth group has played a leading role in rewriting our knowledge of neutrino cross sections with vastly improved uncertainties.  As leader of the DUNE Near Detector physics working group for a year, one PI has already combined these new results with prior work on the parameterized Monte Carlo for evaluating the sensitivity expected of the next generation oscillation experiment.  Our other main effort on the NOvA experiment by one PI and several students has led to the first NOvA oscillation publications, one describing measurement of muon neutrino disappearance and another describing electron neutrino appearance.   These first results with a fraction of the expected total data were immediately competitive with the world?s other long-baseline neutrino oscillation measurements.  In fact, the NOvA results are the first that hint that the neutrino oscillations in the "atmospheric" sector are somewhat smaller than the maximum mathematically allowed.  If this result holds up it could be an important clue to how neutrinos work.  These initial strong results are a critical milestone for an experiment that we expect will determine the neutrino mass ordering (are the two neutrinos close in mass the heaviest ones or the lightest ones), and possibly our first hint of CP violation (which could explain the observed matter/anti-matter asymmetry in the universe).   The Duluth group has been responsible for the "trigger" software which copes with the firehose of data created by a large, surface based neutrino detector.  This is necessary for all NOvA results, but in particular the challenges of doing non-beam based physics with NOvA are large. Led by the Duluth group, NOvA will be capable of recording the burst of comparatively low energy neutrinos produced by the enxt galactic supernova.  Both PIs and one student have been active in the design of DUNE, the next generation neutrino experiment.  One PI lead the "Near Detector" working group, the other worked on the data aqcuisition system and with the detector assembly testing being done for the ProtoDUNE test.  This grant also supported work by both PIs and many students on the now complete MINOS experiment: its final years of operations, decommissioning, and writing the papers describing the experiments' results.  Improved results in the areas of neutrino interactions in iron, neutrino oscillation parameters, and comparing the cosmic rays seen in both the deep and shallow MINOS detectors resulted.
