<AbstractNarration>In this CAREER Award funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Kyle N. Plunkett of Southern Illinois University is developing new electron accepting materials based on cyclopenta-fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (CP-PAHs).  The research involves the development of general strategies to synthesize small-molecules and/or polymers that incorporate CP-PAH subunits and the characterization of their properties.  The resulting polymers are being tested as potential n-type materials in organic field effect transistors and organic photovoltaics.  A new educational program is addressing fears and anxiety in the organic chemistry classroom through non-traditional interactions with students, and an outreach program is allowing a teacher and his students from Herrin High School to participate in this research project.  The broader impacts of this work include the potential societal benefits of new clean energy technologies and economic impact through possible commercial applications.  Furthermore, public awareness demonstrations at a local farmers market are communicating the utility of this research to the Southern Illinois community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electrically conducting carbon-based (organic) molecules hold enormous promise for realizing highly efficient, affordable, and broadly available electronic and optical devices.  This project focuses on the development of new organic molecules and materials that can efficiently stabilize a negative charge.  Realizing the targeted structures is not only a significant accomplishment in the rational design of electronically conducting organic materials but also contributes to solving important problems in energy conversion technology.  The project also provides opportunities to high school, undergraduate and graduate students to perform chemical research and present their findings to colleagues and the general public.</AbstractNarration>
