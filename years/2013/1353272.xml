<AbstractNarration>EAGER: Proof of concept: U-Th Dating of Lake-level History at Mono Basin, CA&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PI(s): Sidney Hemming, Scott Stine, and Xianfeng Wang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;INSTITUTION: Columbia University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs are attempting a unique and novel way to characterize lake-level fluctuation and paleoclimate records from Mono Lake using newly refined C-14, U/Th and 40Ar/39Ar methods.  These methods bring together an interdisciplinary team that will address this high risk problem.  By documenting and characterizing this hydrographically closed basin, a greater understanding of regional climate variations can be made and this new approach can be used in characterizing other similar basins in space and time.  In addition, Mono Lake is a sensitive environment and plays a critical role in the hydrology of the Imperial and Central Valley of California, which is an economically important area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is appropriate for an EAGER because it 1) uses a new and refined technique to date these sediments, 2) is high risk because it is uncertain that this might be achievable, 3) brings together an interdisciplinary team to address this problem and 4) if successful, can be used for other systems like this one and be broadly applied to our understanding of the climate history in this region.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview:  Lake-level fluctuation records from hydrographically closed basins are among the most reliable and often-cited indicators of past climatic change. While CaliforniaÆs Mono Basin displays a particularly clear and easily accessible record of late-Pleistocene lake-level fluctuation on its landscap, it has long defied accurate radioisotopic dating using the C-14, U/Th and 40Ar/39Ar methods. Stimulated by new discoveries on the landscape of the Mono Basin, and by recent advances in radioisotopic dating, we are working to refine and revolutionize the paleoclimate record from the Mono Basin by identifying and accurately constraining the elevations of previously overlooked transgressions and regressions of the lake shore, and by more precisely determining the timing and duration of lake-level fluctuation events.  Intellectual Merit :  The field- and U/Th-geochronology-based refinements to the last glacial and deglacial (~27-12 ka) fluctuation curve for Mono Lake will allow us to place Mono LakeÆs record in a climatic context, and specifically to compare the lake level history with other deglacial lake-level histories from the Great Basin, with the timing of valley glacier that ended in the Mono Basin, and with well-known chronologies from elsewhere in the world such as ice cores and cave deposits. The PI team combines expertise in geomorphology, sedimentology, stratigraphy, sediment geochemistry, geochronology, and late Quaternary climate change.
