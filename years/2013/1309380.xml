<AbstractNarration>Neural Dynamics of Variability and Robustness in a Motor Pattern Generator&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A central goal of neuroscience research is to understand how the nervous system reliably generates rhythmic motor behaviors, including breathing, locomotion, biting and swallowing. These behaviors are important for survival, and must be robust to noise and environmental uncertainty. Furthermore, animals need to flexibly control these behaviors in order to pursue various goals or respond to stimuli. This project will investigate the hypothesis that the robustness and flexibility of motor control emerges in part due to intrinsic variability in the neural and motor activity, along with modulation by noisy sensory inputs. This investigation will utilize a combined experimental and mathematical approach, using the marine mollusk Aplysia californica as a model system. Experiments will involve the direct activation and inhibition of specific neurons in the isolated buccal mass of Aplysia, in order to better determine the role of these neurons in controlling motor behavior. These experiments will be accompanied by a mathematical investigation into biologically-inspired dynamical structures that could underlie variation, robustness, and flexibility in motor pattern generation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impact of this research extends beyond neuroscience and into engineering applications, specifically in regard to the development of robust, biologically-inspired robots and prosthetic devices. In pursuing this research, the fellow will receive training both in computational and mathematical modeling and laboratory experiments involving Aplysia. In addition, the fellow will assist with the development of novel inquiry-based curricula for undergraduate courses, which will emphasize interdisciplinary applications of mathematics and will incorporate the results of the fellow's research as examples.</AbstractNarration>
