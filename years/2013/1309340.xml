<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1309340, Principal Investigator: Anton Petrunin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal investigator proposes to continue the study of Alexandrov geometry and its applications, which include isometric group actions and Riemannian geometry.  The research is divided into the following main parts: (1) Finding new examples of CAT[0] spaces, related to isometric actions on Euclidean space, (2) Collapsing and convergence of Riemannian manifolds, and (3) Pure Alexandrov geometry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Alexandrov geometry studies metric spaces from an axiomatic point of view, which is similar to the approach given in Euclid's Elements. This theory has applications in many branches of modern geometry. In addition to to the pure research, the principal investigator proposes to continue his work with co-authors on a book which is intended to be a comprehensive text and reference in this area of geometry; he also has two other smaller projects oriented to geometric education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Jointly with Nina Lebedava, we gave a bound on the total curvature of a minimizing geodesic on a convex surface. The question was open for more than 15 years. Jointly with Dmitri Panov we prove and study a convexity type property on maximal open flat subset in a Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative/nonpositive curvature. Jointly with N. Lebedeva, V Matveev, and V. Shevchishin, we prove that any 3-dimensional polyhedral space with nonnegative curvature can be approximated by of 3-dimensional Riemannian orbifolds with nonnegative sectional curvature. We proved a globalization for non-complete but geodesic spaces. Jointly with S. Stadler, we prove an analog of Schoen--Yau univalentness theorem for saddle maps between discs. Jointly with Alexander Lytchak and Vitali Kapovitch, we introduce and study a metric-measure analog of boundary for metric space.      Broader Impacts  Jointly with Allan Yashinski we wrote notes  based on my lectures. These lectures were a part of the geometry course held during the Mathematics Advanced Study Semesters (MASS) Program at Penn State. The lectures are meant to be accessible to advanced undergraduate and early graduate students in mathematics.  We have placed a great emphasis on clarity and exposition.
