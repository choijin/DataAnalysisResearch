<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;The search for materials with desired properties concomitantly relies on the discovery of new materials and the subsequent growth of large single crystals.  To unequivocally determine the material's innate properties, large single crystals must be grown such that detailed studies can be completed.  The growth of high quality single crystalline materials allows the determination of intrinsic properties and for fundamental correlation between structures and unusual magnetic and electrical properties. This research, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program is focused on synthesizing materials of the ternary intermetallics Ln:M:X (Ln = lanthanide, M = transition metal, X = Al, In) to correlate crystal chemistry and physical properties.  The effort is focused on growing high quality single crystals of four families of intermetallics to study the competition of magnetic fluctuations and unusual magnetism, targeting the CeCr2Al20, Ho6Mo4Al43, ThMn12, and YbFe2Al10 structure types.  These structures consist of high coordination polyhedra and serve as models for investigating the role of two sublattices and packing on magnetism. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;The search for materials with desired properties concomitantly relies on the discovery of new materials and systems.  The proposed work, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program involves the synthesis and characterization of novel materials containing rare earth transition metals to understand new physical phenomena. The group's effort is aimed at growing large single crystals to perform measurements and determine intrinsic behavior of new compounds with potential energy applications. The PI's group will continue collaborations with scientists in Japan as there is a natural and mutually beneficial synergy of synthesis and characterization that exists between research groups, as well as a common mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students between the research groups.  Research and teaching are integrated by incorporating crystallography and materials science throughout two courses (General Chemistry and Advanced Inorganic Chemistry). The partnership with a local elementary school will lead to continued enhancement in curriculum development. The Chan group will continue to develop hands-on materials-related demonstrations for incorporation into LSU Chem Demo program.  An additional aim of this proposal is to involve high school chemistry and physics teachers for a summer research experience in the laboratory.  This will offer an invaluable tool to boost teachers' involvement in the sciences and their understanding of how their discipline relates to the children in the classroom.</AbstractNarration>
