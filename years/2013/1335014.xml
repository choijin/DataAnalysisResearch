<AbstractNarration>The focus of this research is to gain deeper insight into the physics of the new process of Laser Induced Plasma Micromachining, which promises better and faster micro-feature fabrication as compared to conventional micro-machining with a focused laser beam. Physics-based models will be formulated for the investigation of the mechanisms of plasma generation, plasma-matter interaction, and the prediction of machined feature geometry. New optical techniques and unique enhancements to this process, based on the optical manipulation of the shape of the plasma into plasma patterns rather than a spot, will be explored. This will increase process productivity and speed by at least one order of magnitude, and facilitate the fabrication of two- and three-dimensional geometries and patterns. Comprehensive experiments involving all aspects of the mechanics of the process will also be performed to validate the models developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successfully realized it is anticipated that the technology created by this project will enable major advances in critical areas of miniaturization technologies, given its multiple concomitant advantages such as its multi-materials capability, low heat-affected zone, high throughput, greater in-process flexibility and, most importantly, its pattern or feature/area-based rather than spot-based or writing nature of machining. This latter ability will result in significantly increased process throughput as compared to current focused laser beam based micro-manufacturing processes. Process capabilities will include the ability to generate high-accuracy features such as deep channels, dimples, through holes and other freeform structures on a variety of materials including metals, polymers, ceramics, composites and other transparent, reflective and brittle materials. The obtained results will also open doors for new research on non-lithography based single-step micro-manufacturing techniques for building and generating micro/meso-scale devices and patterns.</AbstractNarration>

In LIP-MM, unlike in conventional laser ablation, in which the laser beam is directly focused on the surface of the part to remove material, the beam is focused slightly above the surface of the part that is submerged in a dielectric medium, e.g., distilled water.

The work performed focused on the following interrelated issues: (1) Formulation and experimental verification of physics-based models for the investigation of the mechanisms of material removal and microplasma behavior in LIP-MM for process planning and control; (2) Exploration of optical methods to generate a variety of microplasma patterns for pattern generation in a single laser discharge rather than by spot-by-spot processing that characterizes the ?writing? nature of the basic LIP-MM process and of conventional ablation processes to markedly increase throughput; (3) Experimental and analytical evaluation of different dielectric media from the standpoint of their plasma generation threshold to maximize material removal rates; and (4) Preliminary exploration of the possibility of using external controllable magnetic fields to shape and enhance the microplasma?s energy density, again, from the standpoint of the ability to generate simple patterns in a single laser discharge at high material removal rates.
