<AbstractNarration>Chemical defenses are a major mechanism by which organisms interact with their environment, increasing community complexity by allowing many prey to co-occur with predators. In particular, chemical defenses commonly provide protection from predators for marine sponges and algae, as well as plants and insects found in freshwater environments. An important mystery regards the identity of chemoreceptors used by predators to detect chemical defenses and avoid noxious prey. In previous work, McCarty &amp; Kubanek discovered a small protein expressed in the heads of various fish species that appears to explain why sponge chemical defenses are rejected by these fish when placed in their food. The first goal of this work is to determine how this protein, named RL-TGR, functions.  The second goal is to determine whether other proteins, like RL-TGR, are involved in chemical sensing of other chemical defenses in aquatic environments.  These studies will enable a new level of understanding of how predators and prey interact in the marine environment.  This program includes educational opportunities for multiple undergraduates and graduate students, as well as an exploration program for high school students in association with the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The "RL-TGR" co-receptor is related to vertebrate RAMP proteins and thereby both the trafficking of this protein to cell membranes and its subsequent function require co-expression of a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) - however, the determinants of RL-TGR function have yet to be identified.  Objectives of the collaborative project include the following: 1) Determine the mechanism of action of RL-TGR in chemoreception. Both zebrafish (a model organism) and bluehead wrasse (a marine generalist predator) respond to the presence of sponge-derived deterrent compounds laced into their food.  The anatomical distribution of RL-TGR will be mapped in zebrafish and bluehead wrasse using both gene and protein expression approaches. Which portions of RL-TGR modulate responses to chemical defenses will be determined using mutagenesis, electrophysiological assays, and co-expression with GPCRs. The endogenous GPCR(s) that physically and functionally couple with RL-TGR to enable chemoreception by fish will be identified, including via mass spectrometric proteomics.   2) Explore the breadth of RL-TGR signaling and terpene glycoside-based chemical defense. The diversity and evolution of RL-TGR-like co-receptors in animals will be explored using bioinformatic approaches. We will compare RL-TGR-mediated binding and physiological responses to various chemical defense ligands from diverse prey in expression studies using RL-TGR orthologs from model fish species. These studies will apply new knowledge about the mechanism of RL-TGR signaling to enable an understanding of the breadth of RL-TGR function in chemical defense chemoreception.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was designed to investigate the function of a novel protein called RL-TGR, which was identified as the key to detection of a chemical defense compound used in the marine environment.  Many organisms that are incapable of moving, such as sea sponges, generate chemical compounds that injure animals that try to eat those non-motile organisms, or at least make them sick.  Chemical defenses of this sort are widely used by non-motile marine organisms to avoid being predated upon (eaten) by other organisms such as fish.  In fact, thousands of those chemical defense compounds have been identified as being produced by organisms like sea sponges, and other studies had shown that fish can detect those compounds as soon as they take a bite. However, the receptors -- proteins in the fish mouth that actually bind and signal to the brain that these compounds have entered the mouth -- had never been identified for any of those classes of chemical defense compounds.   Prior work leading to this collaborative research grant involved the identification of the fish gene encoding a protein involved in chemical defenses; this protein was called RL-TGR.  However, the protein was predicted to work by taking over the function of other sensory proteins in the fish mouth.  The major objective of this project was to determine where that protein was expressed, meaning in what cell types, and how that protein works.  Our results showed that the protein is expressed in cells in the fish mouth that are used for chemical sensation.  Our results also suggest that the protein does, indeed, work by interacting with other chemosensory proteins in order to change their function.  More work must be done to understand whether this novel chemical-signaling mechanism is also used for the many other types of chemicals that play these defensive roles.
