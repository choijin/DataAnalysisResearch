<AbstractNarration>Hypersaline environments are conditions where salt concentrations are five to ten times higher than seawater, such as those found in the Great Salt Lake and the Dead Sea.  Only certain interesting microscopic organisms, from all three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, Eukarya), and their viruses can live under this extreme condition.  These organisms are known as halophiles.  The conference, which is multidisciplinary, international, and focused on microbes, has been holding triennial meetings since 1978.  Its mission is to explore all aspects of biology in salt-enriched environments and to draw on expertise from numerous disciplines in order to catalyze advances in understanding life in hypersaline habitats. The objective of this award is to provide support for young US researchers, especial graduate students and postdoctoral scientists, to attend and participate in this unique international scientific gathering.  A special effort will be made to recruit members of underrepresented groups in science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this award was to provide travel funds for American researchers from underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines to attend and present oral or poster communications at the Halophiles 2013: The International Congress on Halophilic Microorganisms.  The Halophiles series of conferences is a tri-annual, multidisciplinary, international congress that dates back to 1978.  Though these meetings focus on research conducted exclusively in hypersaline environments like the Great Salt Lake, and on the microorganisms that live in them, the scientific community that attends this series of meeting is broadly interested, and constitutes a myriad of research topics including evolution and biodiversity, protein structure/function and biochemistry, genetics, genomics and applied biotechnology, astrobiology, biogeochemistry and ecology.  Travel awards thus provided training and professional development to all of the awardees.     The outcomes of this funding were that we were able to provide 11 travel awards.  Of those receiving funding, nine were women, one was African-American, one was Asian-American, one was Asian, and one was Latina.  Three were graduate students, and one was an undergraduate.  The awardees were authors or coauthors on a total of 11 published abstracts.  There is one peer reviewed journal article [BK Baxter, N Gunde-Cimerman, A Oren;  Salty Sisters: the women of halophiles (submitted to Frontiers in Microbiology, currently in review)] that details the history and contribution of women to the field of Halophiles, many of whom attended the Halophiles 2013 conference but would have been absent if not for receiving travel support from this award.
