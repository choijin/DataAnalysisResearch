<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many problems societies face are increasingly regional to global in scope.  Problems such as droughts, floods, and disease in one part of the world can have far reaching health and economic impacts on other regions. Understanding the relationship and linkages require an understanding of global scale biological processes and dynamics. International networks and "Observatories" have been emerging that could play a significant role in providing valuable data and expertise to develop this understanding. This workshop will bring together Observatory and Network scientists with the overarching goal of developing a road-map to explore a network-of-networks and observatory-of-observatories approach to answer regional to global ecological questions. The workshop will explore: i) what are the current ecological theories and grand challenge questions that span continents in order to provide a broader ecological understanding and prognostic capability to inform science and society; ii) how can Observatories/Networks be used to address among continent (global) grand challenges, iii) what attributes can be integrated among Observatories/Networks to foster a broader understanding; and iv) which are the near term strategic targets that should be followed by the scientific community. The workshop will identify related societal needs and benefits and how these networks/observatories can contribute data, knowledge and forecasts. The workshop will focus on ecological contribution of Observatories/Networks to societal benefits areas including: agriculture, biodiversity, climate, ecosystems, water, and weather.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported participant costs for a community-driven workshop (June 2-5, 2015) to discuss challenges and opportunities for collaborations of network-of-networks and observatory-of-observatories to answer global ecological questions.This workshop provided networking opportunities for graduate students and career scientists. The workshop brought a balance of senior to young researchers including postdoctoral researchers and graduate students, and the workshop included 11 women (~32%) including African American and Hispanic. Participants discussed key characteristics of Grand Challenges (GC). First, GC should help identify tractable goals and should have a common end to invest resources. Second, GC need to solve global security issues (e.g., food, ecosystems, water) that affect human wellbeing and prosperity. Third, ecology is fundamental to address global grand challenges as it provides information and theories important for solutions and adaptations. In applying a global criteria for new GCs; three primary GC themes persistently re-occurred during the presentation and breakout sessions:   a) Short-term Ecological Forecasting    Most forecasting (at 25-to-100 y time scales) provides little information for a near-term ecological understanding, and how to make decisions today.  While important, this approach disengages decision makers, public and many scientists alike.  We also recognized the need to move beyond past correlative approaches towards a process-based predictive capability.  Short-term Ecological Forecasting challenges our understanding, i) on how to downscale large spatial scale (global) processes to the short term (&lt;10-y) local-to-regional scale, ii) of the theoretical constructs governing it, and iii) how best provide actionable data.   b) Ecological Teleconnections   There are new emergent ecological properties that are becoming apparent, particularly at continental and cross-continental scales.  In other words, there are exogenous drivers outside our regional-to-continental boundaries that affect the ecological processes therein, i.e., synchrony.  In turn, these drivers and processes can also interact in ways we do not yet understand.  For example, extra-tropical land use change affecting the genesis and magnitude of the South-Pacific climate dipole, which in turn affects masting of North America Boreal Pines and the specie populations that feed off them.  Numerous examples were given that also have social implications  c) Socio-Ecological Dimension   Humans are part of the natural world.  We expressed the increasing importance of human behavior as a driver of ecological change, and a recipient of its interactions.  Currently, there are no tested theories the link human and ecological systems.  Instead, our understanding is based on use cases, specific disciplines, and/or constrained time/space domains.   The GC is to develop/test new integrative theory that can describe the social-ecological relationships, and to incorporate the human dimension into global ecological understanding.  The workshop was broadcast in real time, presentations and outcomes are hosted on a project-specific website (open access), findings and ideas were shared with the broader scientific community in Town Hall sessions in scientific meetings through year 2015, and manuscripts sumarizing the findings are in review or in preparation.
