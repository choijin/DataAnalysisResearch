<AbstractNarration>This grant supports the development of a new approach to nanotechnology-based transparent conducting electrodes. Exploiting the exceptional electrical conductivity and transparency of single or few-layer graphene, the research focuses on a key nanomanufacturing challenge, which is how to electrically connect small graphene flakes to form a large area continuous conductor.  Atomic layer deposition (ALD) will be employed to provide ultrathin conducting layers that stitch or glue the graphene flakes together, with emphasis on selective deposition nucleated at edges of the flakes and on defect sites within the graphene flakes.  Work will include continuous, roll-to-roll printing of electronics with graphene ink, and model defects on graphene surfaces to identify selective deposition processes. Tradeoffs between material distribution on the nano- and micro-scales, electrical conductivity, and optical transparency will serve as guidelines for prototype scale-up, and to assess manufacturing viability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide prototype demonstration of a novel manufacturing technology for transparent electrodes based on low-cost graphene materials and scalable fabrication processes. The project will create new knowledge in surface chemistry, nanofabrication, nano-scale material transport and optoelectronics. It will underscore the critical role of defect management in moving nanoscience to the marketplace. It will have broad technological impact in areas of nanotechnology, such as displays, solar cells, and flexible electronics. Research activities and other nanomanufacturing ?stories? will be used as the basis for development of a new senior/graduate level course.</AbstractNarration>
