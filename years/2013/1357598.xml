<AbstractNarration>The project seeks to develop new methods for modeling, estimation, and inference in panel data models with a factor error or approximate factor error structure.  This error structure has roots in economics and finance, and the usual additive individual effects and time effects are special cases of this structure. Explanatory variables are correlated with unobserved factors and factor loadings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ignoring this correlation leads to inconsistent estimates. The PI will develop a generalized Mundlak projection that is an alternative to the traditional Mundlak-Chamberlin projection for dealing with this correlation.  The generalized projection is an improvement on the traditional method, and the result may be improvements in how to handle correlations between explanatory variables and unobserved effects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this research are largely from the potential use of these methods in more applied settings; panel data are widely used for policy evaluation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project studies new methods for panel data analysis. A key feature of the proposed method is the allowance of arbitrary (unspecified) correlations between the explanatory variables and the unobserved individual effects. This correlation arises in economics and other social sciences, where individuals' decisions are correlated with the unobserved individual effects or are influenced by social trends and other hard-to-measure common shocks.  Economists have devoted much efforts to dealing with this type of correlations. The reason is that ignoring this correlation will cause unreliable (bias and inconsistent) inference, leading to incorrect conclusions about economic policy's effectiveness.  This project develops ways of modeling and estimating such data sets.   Several new methodologies for panel data models are developed, along with the corresponding estimation procedures and inferential theory.  These include estimation and inference factor-augmented vector autoregressive (FAVAR) models, testing slope homogeneity for panel data models with interactive effects, clustering high dimensional financial time series, estimating panel data models with unknown groups and identifying the group memberships, and efficient estimation with an unknown high-dimensional variance-covariance matrix.    The factor-augmented vector autoregressive (FAVAR) model is increasingly used in macroeconomics and finance. In this model, observable and unobservable factors jointly follow a vector autoregressive process, which further drives the co-movement of a large number of observable variables.  This project studies the implied identification restrictions in the presence of observable factors.  A likelihood-based method is proposed to estimate the FAVAR model, the method explicitly accounts for factors being partially observed. The projects provide an inferential theory for the estimated factors, factor loadings and the dynamic parameters in the vector autoregressive process.    A new testing procedure is developed for testing slope homogeneity in high-dimensional panel data models with cross-sectional correlations.  The procedure allows for a factor error structure and can be used to test market efficiency with a large number of assets.  A new procedure is introduced for clustering a large number of financial time series based on high-dimensional panel data with grouped factor structures. The proposed method attempts to capture the level of similarity of each of the time series based on sensitivity to observable risk factors as well as to the unobservable factor structure. The proposed method allows for correlations between observable and unobservable factors and also allows for cross-sectional and serial dependence and heteroskedasticities.  Theoretical properties are established for the procedure.  The method is applied to analyze the returns of over six thousand international stocks from over one hundred financial markets.  A panel data model with multiple groups in which each group has its own time effects (and more generally its own interactive effects) is examined. A key aspect of the model is that group membership is unknown and has to be estimated. The number of explanatory variables can be large. A regularization  approach is suggested.  The model provides a flexible way of capturing unobservable common shocks and their effects on outcomes.  New efficient estimation of panel data models with interactive effects is developed.  Conventional efficient estimation requires a fixed dimensional weighting matrix.  Panel data efficiency requires estimating a large dimensional covariance matrix. By using a consistent estimator of a high-dimensional error covariance matrix, the method takes into account both cross-sectional correlations and heteroscedasticity of unknown form.  Some sparsity is assumed on the covariance matrix, but the locations of small or zero elements of the covariance matrix are unknown. In the presence of cross-sectional correlations, the proposed estimator eliminates the cross-sectional correlation bias. The rate of convergence is also improved. In addition, when the statistical inference involves estimating a high-dimensional inverse covariance matrix, the minimax convergence rate on large covariance estimations is not sufficient for inference. To address this issue, a new ``doubly weighted convergence" result is developed.  This enables an efficient estimation of panel data models under an unknown high dimensional covariance matrix.           Last Modified: 11/03/2017       Submitted by: Jushan Bai]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
