<AbstractNarration>Objectives: The objectives of this research program is design, materials synthesis and device based co-exploration of lattice-engineered, crystallographic oriented epitaxial (100), (110) and (111) germanium (Ge) based transistors using large bandgap barrier materials. The approach is a) experimental investigation of  p-channel (110)Ge and n-channel (111)Ge quantum well transistors, b) experimental investigation of high hole mobility using (110)Ge and high electron mobility using (111)Ge surface orientation, and c) silicon compatible process flow of biaxially strained Ge transistors.   &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The key scientific merits of this proposal are: i) in-situ growth of Ge transistor structure; ii) tailor-made surface orientations of Ge enable to achieve both high-hole and high-electron mobilities; iii) biaxially strained Ge quantum well transistor using large bandgap materials to enhance hole mobility, iv) larger valence band-offsets for carrier confinement and prevents carrier spill-off, v) elimination of parallel conduction, and vi) enhancement mode transistor operation. Our approaches are most innovative and transformative of in-situ grown epitaxial surface oriented Ge with large bandgap buffers that has a capacity to bring new technologies.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed Ge research seeks to increase the speed of transistor and substantially reduce power consumption in integrated circuits. Ultra-low power and high-speed computation will benefit applications for industrial, medical, commercial and personal use. The proposed research is interdisciplinary in nature. Through collaboration with industry, we envision direct transfer of device prototypes, to open new avenues for commercialization. The project will train graduate and undergraduate students in the area of nano-scale material science, device physics, and semiconductor fabrication</AbstractNarration>
