<AbstractNarration>This project contributes to the joint work of two ongoing larger projects: The Paradigms in Physics Project, a complete redesign of the physics major, and the Vector Calculus Bridge Project, an effort to bridge the gap between the mathematics and physics of vector calculus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project looks at representations of the quantification of change, particularly partial derivatives, across many STEM disciplines, with the goal of aiding students in moving toward the robust and multifaceted understandings typical of STEM professionals. The project includes strands that (1) explore the ways in which STEM experts use and represent change; (2) develop and test curricular materials for middle-division math and physics courses; and (3) establish students initial and ongoing levels of understanding as they progress through the curricular materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project is advancing knowledge within physics and mathematics education as well as across other science, technology, and engineering fields that engage undergraduates in learning how to use partial derivatives to model changing quantities in complex environments. Success in upper-level undergraduate and graduate courses in these fields requires understanding what partial derivatives are and how to use them. Drawing upon expertise in mathematics, physics, and education, the team is tracing learning trajectories from what novice students write, draw, and say when encountering partial derivatives in upper-level courses through various representations experts use as they identify and interpret ways that variables change under different circumstances. Based on such research, the curricular materials include prompts for encouraging ways to help students become aware of their own thought processes while transferring their emerging expertise from one context to another. Led by the PIs of the Paradigms and Bridge projects, the team includes curriculum developers, education researchers, and recent adopters of curriculum materials from previous projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project directly impacts mathematics and physics education at the middle-division undergraduate level by providing classroom-tested curricular materials and associated instructor resources to the education community through existing, proven online resources, an activities wiki, and a textbook. Mathematics materials support learning trajectories in multiple STEM disciplines, not just mathematics and physics. The addition of the new materials makes the existing resources easier to adopt by providing more complete coverage, in line with most common course structures. The project structure itself provides a model of how to advance STEM education holistically, combining research and curriculum development. The project includes an influential national advisory committee and a local interdisciplinary panel of experts drawn from affiliates in OSUs new Center for Research in Lifelong STEM Learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This team has published 29 papers and 3 books based on previous grants in this ongoing project. In addition, there is an ongoing series of faculty workshops to aid faculty in using the materials. The developments so far have been adopted and adapted in various forms by over 100 faculty at other institutions, and that number is increasing. Curricular materials produced by this project, including group activities, instructors materials, and publications, are all openly available on the project web site.</AbstractNarration>

The Paradigms in Physics Project completely redesigned the upper-division physics major in order to better present the content the way professional physicists organize their own expert knowledge.

This redesigned curriculum is intended to remedy drawbacks of conventional curricula by using a variety of pedagogical techniques and by applying insights into the cognitive structures that are being constructed by advanced students.  While some of these techniques are inspired by those that have been successful in lower-division physics instruction, many are new.  Upper-division students must deal with problems of greater complexity and must learn to see patterns that cross the boundaries of traditional physics disciplines.  In addition, students' evolution into professional scientists is fostered by encouraging students to: draw conclusions from experiences with natural phenomena, exercise individual judgment, pool insight with peers, synthesize information from a variety of text and computer-based material, and document and communicate results appropriately.  The major goals of this part of the project were to explore how experts use and represent change, to develop and test curricular materials for university-level math and physics courses, to establish a student learning trajectory for partial derivatives, to explore and identify appropriate theoretical perspectives for analyzing student data, and to make our materials freely available online.  A supplement to the original award also allowed us to do design and implement ``Paradigms 2.0'', and to study and document both the original Paradigms curricular design and the redesign process.  Each of these goals is discussed below.  Explore how experts use and represent change.  Interviews with experts in diverse STEM disciplines showed that mathematicians understand ``derivative'' to mean an exact (algebraic) expression in the limit that the change in the independent variable goes to zero, whereas physicists and engineers have a further set of skills around approximations of derivatives using discrete data.  These extra skills need to be taught to students.  Develop and test curricular materials for middle-division math and physics courses that emphasize metacognition and transfer in order to move students toward a robust understanding of the quantification of change.  We have developed and classroom-tested several sets of curricular materials on the quantification of change.  These curricular materials include detailed tasks for students that emphasize metacognitive prompts.  They include:  Using dry-erasable plastic surfaces -- including both abstract mathematical surfaces and those tailored to specific physical systems; Using the Partial Derivative Machine, a mechanical analogue of a thermodynamic system; Using contour diagrams in dry-erasable sleeves; A free, online text.   Establish students' initial and ongoing levels of understanding as they progress through these materials -- a learning trajectory.  As reported in 15 research papers, 1 dissertation, and 2 Master's theses, our research efforts study students' use of our curricular materials and investigate student understanding of the underlying concepts, including the design and articulation of a fine-grained learning progression for partial derivatives that incorporates our research results (and the results of others) and our tested curricular materials.  Explore and identify theoretical perspectives that are appropriate for analyzing student data, especially interview data in our context.  We have extended a previous framework for ordinary derivatives to several dimensions, and developed a new analysis technique.  Make these materials freely available online.  All of these materials are now online and currently being reformatted to increase their usability.  Do a retrospective study of the original Paradigms curricular design; Study and document the redesign process; Use the retrospective study as we design Paradigms 2.0.  The results of these studies have been combined into a freely available online book.  The curriculum reform methods uncovered by the retrospective study were used as a proof-of-concept to redo and update the original Paradigms curriculum into Paradigms 2.0 in 2016/17 and Paradigms 2.1 in 2019/20.
