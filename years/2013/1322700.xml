<AbstractNarration>This dissertation examines the interaction among lexical, sentence-level and pragmatic factors in determining pitch variation in the Trøndelag variety of Norwegian. Scandinavian languages, including the Trøndelag variety, are characterized by a lexical pitch accent contrast (accent 1 vs. accent 2). The accent distinction refers to a specified pitch contour on stressed syllables which changes the meaning of words. The shape of these contours varies across dialects. The pitch contours are further affected by pragmatic and prosodic factors. The goal of this research is to explore the interaction of these factors in determining pitch variation from the perspective of both production and perception. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the direction of Dr. Smiljanic, Niamh Kelly will carry out a set of production experiments to determine which acoustic-articulatory cues are systematically produced to distinguish the two accents in the dialect and how they are modified by sentential intonation and pragmatic focus. Perception studies will examine which acoustic cues are used by listeners to distinguish between the lexical pitch contrast and how pitch variation due to pragmatic and prosodic factors further shapes listeners' responses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance our knowledge of phonetic features of lexical pitch accent distinctions (production) and of of phonetic cuing of these distinctions (perception). The findings will provide insights into phonological questions regarding the nature of the underlying representation of pitch accent contrasts and of tone bearing units.  This award will enhance the training and research experience of a female graduate student.</AbstractNarration>
