<AbstractNarration>The main goal of this mathematics education research project is to determine through experimentation specific teaching strategies that can be used to support middle school students drawing connections between mathematical representations (fractions and ratios). The potential instructional strategies were identified from the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) video analyses study as the ones that best distinguished high performing countries from low performing countries. Prior studies were used to pilot the research approach and potential results. The problem, expected solution responses, and instructional sequences are drawn from a model of a Japanese lesson. This CAREER award will be operated through the University of California-Irvine by Assistant Professor Lindsey Richland. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Six experiments will be conducted, each on one strategy and designed to help develop optimal instructional routines. The six conditions are: 1) making student responses or key ideas visible, 2) making compared student responses or key ideas visible simultaneously, 3) visually organizing the student responses or key ideas to highlight key connections, 4) using at least one well-known student response or key idea to compare with something new, 5) using gestures between connected student responses, and 6) using visual imagery. Fifth and sixth grade students from three classrooms will be randomly selected to participate in one of two conditions (high support and low support) for the six experiments. For each experiment, each condition will be studied with 30 students. Data for all six experiments will be collected from a total of 360 students. All students will be given the same word problem requiring proportional reasoning. Then students will be shown an instructional video of a teacher presenting a lesson related to the problem. Students will be given pre- and post-tests and a new problem to solve as measures of effects. An ANOVA (pretest/posttest) with conditions as a between-subjects variable (high support/low support) will be used in the analysis. Two additional case studies will investigate the training of two teachers to use the most effective of the strategies in the first six experiments. Videotapes of these two teachers using the optimal strategies in their classrooms will be analyzed using the same protocol used in TIMSS. A highly qualified advisory board will serve as the external evaluation. An education plan includes mentoring graduate students and undergraduate researchers; educating pre-service teachers; collaborating through in-service teacher professional development with teachers from regional schools; and disseminating results in academic venues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Positive results of this application of cognitive science to the teaching and learning of mathematics will inform the field of mathematics education on routine of practices that distinguish high performing countries in mathematics achievement. The work may be of greatest benefit to English language learners and other under-represented groups. If the instructional strategies are viable, then teachers will have specific ways they can reduce the cognitive load on students who may be processing two languages while trying to learn mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  This research grant was intellectually novel in its integration of cognitive scientific research on analogical thinking with educational research on mathematical discussions comparing student solution strategies. The project tested techniques for supporting discussions that derived from practices identified as commonly used by teachers in regions that outperform the United States.  The experiments focused on ratio concepts, and used a novel methodology in which real classroom lessons were videotaped and those lessons edited to produce the stimuli for subsequent experiments with new students. Each experiment tested two versions of the edited videos against each other, randomly assigning videos to students within new classrooms, meaning that the instruction and audio could be held constant while a key aspect of the lesson was varied.   Our most effective version of this practice was for a teacher to invite students to solve a challenging problem however they liked, walk around the class and select two or three solutions, and have those students describe them to their classmates while the teacher writes them on the board in an organized fashion.  Experiments revealed that it is important that the solutions are written so that learners can see them all at the same time, and throughout the discussion.  We also find that if one of those solutions is a misconception, making all of the solutions visible simultaneously is particularly important, but also it may be most helpful not to begin with the misconception. Then the teacher leads a discussion of their similarities and differences, using gestures to make links across the solutions.  These are actionable, low cost teaching strategies that have the potential to make mathematical discussions more effective, and thereby have real impact on U.S. students? mathematical thinking.   We had theorized that the role of visual representations would be to reduce the cognitive load on learners to hold other students? solutions in mind while comparing them, and we did find those with lower executive function and working memory resources were less effective at making comparisons, and learned less when visual representations had to be remembered throughout the discussion.  Prior knowledge was also important, with greater prior knowledge leading to more learning from the discussions, though this too is less important when the compared solutions were visible simultaneously.    This work has led to many peer reviewed conference presentations and publications in top journals including Educational Psychology, Cognition and Instruction, Educational Psychologist, Psychological Science, Contemporary Educational Psychology, and the Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied, as well as more broad dissemination venues such as Policy Implications of the Behavioral and Brain Sciences, WIREs Cognitive Science, and Educational Psychology Review.   Educational Plan  This research grant had important implications for the intellectual growth of my research team, both at the University of California, Irvine (School of Education, my prior institution) and at my current institution, the University of Chicago (Comparative Human Development). These have included six graduate students who have developed two dissertations, many conference presentations and peer reviewed journal articles, and one was awarded an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship on an idea deriving from this work.  The grant has also supported over time two postdoctoral researchers, three lab managers who have pursued graduate school, and over 30 undergraduates who have been part of the research lab over the period of the grant, pursuing graduate school or careers in education, cognitive science, or psychology. While at UCI, I also taught a course for preservice teachers gaining a Masters with Teaching Credential, in which research results, and the theory underlying this research, was integrated and directly provided to those who were entering teaching.  At the U of Chicago I was not able to teach preservice teachers, and so began a graduate seminar on Cognition and Education, in which I taught graduate and undergraduate scholars to build their knowledge of this literature.  Broader Impact  The project results have the potential for broad impact on mathematics teaching in the United States, which is emerging in our local region, and should unfold more broadly over time through our research partnerships with curriculum designers and charter schools, and our wide range of academic publications. Importantly, we aimed to provide strategies for optimizing teachers' existing practices, rather than for dramatic educational reform. Major changes in teaching are difficult to sustain due to the cultural nature of instructional routines (e.g., Stigler &amp; Hiebert, 1999), so we aimed for more implementable changes with ideally broader impact. Our partnerships here at the University of Chicago have increased the dissemination opportunities. The University of Chicago runs a set of charter schools, and I have collaborated with their mathematics coach and 5th grade teachers to disseminate and test the strategies identified in this grant. We also collaborate with the Everyday Mathematics curriculum designers, with the aim to incorporate well supported pedagogical practices into their widely distributed materials.
