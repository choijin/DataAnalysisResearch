<AbstractNarration>This CNIC award supports the U.S.-India Collaborative Research: Effects of Check Dams on Landscape and Society-a Catalyzing Visit to the Eco-Sensitive Shiwalik Foothills of India. PI Ranbir Kang, Western Illinois University and collaborator Elizabeth Chacko, George Washington University will initiate an international collaboration with Drs. Dhian Kaur and K.P. Singh from the Departments of Geography and Geology at Panjab University to study the geophysical and socio-economic impacts of check dams in the Punjab. The research team will gather data on the effects of check dams on channel morphology, surrounding land cover, ground water levels, and local populations. They will use official government and NGO data on agriculture, demographics, hydrology, vegetation, as well as,  focus groups and local inhabitants to understand the effects of check dams on socio-economic progress and ecological change. The proposed research is novel in that it will analyze not only the human-environment impacts of check dams in a sub-tropical developing area, but also the feed-back mechanisms between humans and the environment in such a locale. Two US graduate students will participate in the field research in India. Findings from this study will be used to refine research questions and hypotheses for a fully developed research proposal to be submitted to NSF's Geography and Spatial Systems(GSS)Program.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Small scale check dams in hilly locales experiencing environmental degradation due to deforestation and flooding may be a key for socio-ecological resilience for such areas. Our team visited six such check dams in Shiwalik foot hills of India. These checks dams included three small dams (Sukho Majri, Dhamala, and Rel Majra) and three relatively bigger dams (Perch, Siswan, and Bunga). Our field work in these reservoirs and their catchment reveal that these dams have reduced flooding by serving as sediment sinks. But the dams themselves are experiencing sedimentation primarily due to the materials brought via the tributaries. At the same time, the forest cover as well as wild life has increased in these areas. As a result of reduced flooding and water reservoirs behind these dams, the cropping diversity has increased from two primary cereal crops (millet and maize) to four crops (millet, maize, wheat, and rice) in areas served by the dams. Farmers are also growing many vegetables and fruits in this area. Our findings also reveal that level of the involvement of local community could potentially affect the life span of such check dams. Their proximity to major highways is another factor that may dictate the degree of the effects of check dams on local communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/02/2016<br>      Modified by: Elizabeth&nbsp;Chacko</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
