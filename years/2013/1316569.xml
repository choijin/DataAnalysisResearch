<AbstractNarration>This action funds Matthew Walters of Johns Hopkins University to conduct a research project in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at the University of Tokyo's Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe in Kashiwa, Japan.  The project title is "New Light Particles in the Early Universe."  The host scientist is Hitoshi Murayama.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project studies the effects of new light particle species on early universe phenomena, such as the synthesis of light elements and the production of residual background radiation.  These effects are explored in an effective field theory approach, in order to provide constraints on theories in a model-independent fashion.  In addition, this project develops calculational methods to determine the mass of new light particles which become nonrelativistic during the era of recombination, when electrons and protons began to form neutral atoms.  These results have significant implications for theoretical models and future experimental research, both in cosmology and elementary particle physics, with the potential to discover new particles and physical phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, through this research project the Fellow is developing new analyses and applications for data from multiple observational experiments.  The Fellow is both submitting these results for publication to aid experimental scientific collaborations in the use of current and future data and using them to educate the general population about current progress in physics and astronomy.  In addition, the Fellow is sharing these methods of analysis with researchers in the host country and the U.S. to encourage further collaborations and extensions of this project.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The focus of this project was the calculation of effects due to new particle species on various phenomena in the early universe. There are a large number of well-motivated theoretical models which contain new light particles, and measurements of cosmological observables can be used to constrain or confirm such models. One very important observable is residual radiation, commonly referred to as the cosmic microwave background, which was produced in the early universe. This radiation has been precisely measured by multiple experiments, and the resulting data is generally used to constrain a standard six-parameter cosmological model currently used to describe the evolution of the universe. In this project, I worked on an extension of this standard framework, which includes the effects of additional particles with light masses, which are not accommodated by the original model. This extension was then used to analyze a large set of publicly available observational data, including the recently released Planck satellite measurements of the cosmic microwave background. This analysis is currently being used to determine the resulting constraints on models containing very light particles. These results are particularly important due to the apparent tension between different sets of observational data, and this analysis will be used to interpret future cosmological measurements, as well.
