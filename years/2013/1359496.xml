<AbstractNarration>The significance of this research rests on the fact that it documents the long term effect of cultural interaction and provides insight into the mechanisms, both social and biological, which guide this process as well as the resultant outcomes. Archaeology can provide a valuable window to understanding how different cultures interact since it can take a long range perspective and follow such processes often over century long time scales. The presence of biological data in the form of skeletal remains adds an additional dimension to the study. Similar interactions are visible today in multiple regions of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the support of the National Science Foundation, an international team, led by Dr. Stuart Tyson Smith and Dr. Michele Buzon, along with other specialists, students, and local community members will conduct a bioarchaeological research project to investigate the impact of the Egypt's New Kingdom Empire (c. 1500-1050 BC) on the Nubian Kerma Culture at the Third Cataract of the Nile River in Upper Nubia.  This project builds on previous excavations at Tombos, which have documented a multi-ethnic colonial community of immigrant Egyptians and local Nubians.  Excavation will include burials in the elite pyramid field of the cemetery and the previously unexplored settlement.  In addition, a settlement (Hannek) and cemetery (Akkad) associated with the local Nubian Kerma culture will be explored in order to allow for a comparison of Egyptian imperial impacts on the health and identity before and after the conquest and colonization of the area.  Moving beyond traditional unidirectional models of colonial encounters, this research considers the actions of both the local and foreign groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project is the contribution to larger archaeological and anthropological research questions regarding the process of inter-cultural interactions, colonialism, and the cultural entanglements that result. Older acculturation models based upon a notion of dominant core and subordinate periphery have increasingly been replaced with more nuanced interaction based models like the one proposed here. This project will add an important case study from one of the world's earliest primary states that will be of relevance to scholars studying similar dynamics in different places and periods. The use of a multi-disciplinary bioarchaeological approach allows for a holistic examination of these issues through use of various types of data including material culture, social practices, biological relationships, geographic origins, and indications of health and disease. Tombos' unique historical context offers significant potential to shed light on the still largely unknown local impacts of the Egyptian empire, providing important data on the local people who played a role in the adoption, adaptation, and rejection of different cultural traits, as well as the interpenetration of Nubian and Egyptian features in both societies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further broader impacts of this project include the training of American and Sudanese students and researchers as well as promotion of international research collaboration. The excavation and curation of human skeletal remains from the project will provide secure storage of important archaeological and bioarchaeological data and collections as well as ensure the opportunity for future research on the material. The data produced from the proposed research will be widely disseminated in order to provide access for other researchers. Finally, this project will assist the people of Sudan in documenting the rapidly disappearing evidence of ancient Nubian life and culture resulting from settlement and cultivation. The proposed construction of a dam only ten kilometers downstream from Tombos would also heavily impact the sites and adds additional urgency to this project.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project at the Third Cataract of the Nile in Sudanese Nubia combined archaeology and bioarchaeology to investigate the impacts of Egypt's New Kingdom Empire (c. 1500-1050 BC) on the Nubian Kerma Culture and their interactions and entanglements with the colonists who settled at Tombos, situating the site and its ancient inhabitants within a larger cultural and biological landscape. Excavation concentrated in three different areas, the colonial cemetery at and modern village of Tombos, a Kerma cemetery at just to the south, and a Kerma settlement across the river.</p> <p>In the colonial cemetery, varied examples of Egyptian burial practices were uncovered, from simple wrapping in reed matting indicating a very low social status to burial in finely crafted wooden coffins of the elite. On individual was equipped with a set of ceramic canopic jars with human headed stoppers that still contained the very degraded remains of the internal organs, providing the first secure documentation for evisceration at Tombos, the most elaborate form of mummification. The tomb of a high ranking priest was discovered decorated with funerary cones, pointing towards a close connection to the political and religious center at Thebes in southern Egypt, where this decoration appears almost exclusively, and only the third tomb discovered to be decorated this way in the Nubian colony. At the same time, the presence of Nubian pottery and another in a series of burials of woman in a Nubian style flexed position adds to earlier evidence of local influence, perhaps mediated by women. Excavation within and to the south of the modern village of Tombos resulted in the identification of the remains of a massive fortified enclosure over 200 by 200 meters square (c. 1450-1300 BCE), making Tombos the largest fortified colonial establishment in Nubia. The colony is mostly likely the location of the lost Fortress of Taroy, according to historical sources from around 1350 BC the southernmost Egyptian colony within the larger empire. Ceramics and radiocarbon dates confirm occupation continued long after the end of the empire (c. 1070-600 BCE).</p> <p>Excavation at the Kerma cemetery of Abu Fatma has revealed a long history of burial at the site (c. 2500-1500 BCE). Burial practice included beds with preserved rawhide netting and legs carved to imitate cow hooves. Leatherwork included rawhide lining for several tombs, sandals and finely crafted skirts, loincloths, and perforated leatherwork. Distinctively Nubian style fine ware pottery was also common. Animal offerings including butchered goat and whole sheep. Radiocarbon dates from the Kerma settlement at Hannek confirmed its long span of occupation, and reinforced earlier ceramic analysis that suggested overlap with the New Kingdom colony. This is of particular interest since there is little evidence of Egyptian material culture or influence at the site, suggesting continuities in local traditions in terms of foodways, ceramics and traditional round architectural structures in spite of the proximity of the Egyptian colony. Similarly, Egyptian objects were rare in the burials at Abu Fatma, suggesting a general lack of Egyptian influence and material culture both before and after Egyptian colonization in our area.</p> <p>Finally, considerable progress was made in cleaning and stabilizing a unique and elaborately decorated wooden cosmetic box from a 25th dynasty soldier?s tomb (c. 700 BCE). He was equipped with rare set of iron weaponry and many other unusual items that reflect his wealth and connections with Egypt and the Middle East. The sides of the box depict marshy scenes with imagery of cows that represent novel adaptations of an international decorative style that spread throughout the Mediterranean world. Detailed excavation within the box revealed three faience cosmetic jars of extraordinary quality. They are unique masterworks?nothing like them has been found in either Sudan or Egypt and their discovery reinforces the importance of Sudanese Nubia as a cultural and political power during the seventh century BCE.</p> <p>Two UCSB graduate students used data from the excavations for their dissertations, Jessika Akmenkalns (PhD, 2018) and Shayla Monroe (PhD expected 2021).
