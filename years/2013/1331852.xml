<AbstractNarration>Exploiting advances in underwater robotics, sensor networks, signal processing, and biophysical modeling, the goal of this award is to create a novel paradigm for monitoring and understanding aquatic ecosystems and thus enable sustainable management of water resources. In this paradigm, schools of autonomous gliding robotic fish adaptively sample the water environment. The collected measurements are used to reconstruct high-resolution data fields with advanced multidimensional signal processing algorithms. The reconstructed data fields, along with the data samples, facilitate the monitoring of aquatic ecosystems and enable high-fidelity, mechanistic modeling of the underlying biophysical processes for accurate forecast. The objectives of this award include addressing fundamental problems at the interfaces between the building blocks of the paradigm, and demonstrating a proof of concept for the latter. Specifically, five highly integrated research thrusts are pursued: (1) developing path-planning and control algorithms for the robots to realize information-driven, energy-efficient sampling, (2) developing robust communication protocols and effective in-network parameter-estimation algorithms, (3) establishing tensor sparsification-based frameworks for data-field reconstruction using limited data samples, (4) exploiting reconstructed data fields and network-estimated sub-models to create accurate mechanistic models, and (5) evaluating and demonstrating the integrative paradigm in the monitoring and prediction of Harmful Algal Blooms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is expected to result in a new, holistic framework for monitoring, understanding, and managing freshwater and marine environments, with a myriad of applications in oil spill response, ecosystem monitoring, and drinking water safety, to name a few. The project provides interdisciplinary training opportunities for students, including those from underrepresented groups. Robotic fish demos, museum exhibits, and teacher-training activities are offered to engage K-12 students, teachers, and the public, and to pique their interest in science and engineering. Besides the dissemination of research findings through conference presentations, publications, and workshops, commercialization of the developed technologies is pursued to facilitate their practical adoption.</AbstractNarration>

Dubbed GRACE 2.0, the new robot had a modular architecture for accommodating different sensors and its interior was easily accessible for diagnosis and service. In particular, five environment sensors were integrated with the prototype, for measuring dissolved oxygen, temperature, chlorophyll, harmful algae, and photosynthetically active radiation. Control algorithms for autonomous operation of the robot were developed and field-tested. In addition, the project resulted in embedded sensing solutions by exploiting salient features of smartphones. For example, the inertial sensor was exploited to assist image processing for smartphone-equipped robots, so that energy expenditure and computational overhead were reduced for extracting the visual information from the captured images (for example, images of harmful algal blooms).</p> <p>The project resulted in a number of algorithms for reconstructing data fields using limited data samples. Significant advances were made in compressive sensing and matrix/tensor completion, where missing data points could be retrieved by exploiting the underlying structures of the data fields, such as sparsity or low-rank conditions. Fundamental contributions were also made to the area of manifold learning. A manifold in this context refers to a smooth, lower-dimensional geometric structure in a high-dimensional space than can capture highly complex relationships among different factors, such as the correlations among physical, chemical, and biological processes in aquatic ecosystems. The project contributed to the development of novel manifold learning methods for increasing the resolution of multi-dimensional data, the development of <em>fast</em> manifold learning algorithms that were less computationally complex than state-of-the-art learning algorithms, the development of manifold learning approaches robust to noise, and the application of manifold learning to the reconstruction of environmental data.</p> <p>The project also contributed to the study of limnology and aquatic ecology. The high-resolution datasets collected as part of this project combined with three-dimensional numerical modeling provided significant new insights into the role of groundwater on lake ecosystems. In addition to providing new approaches for reconstructing meteorological forcing fields to drive mechanistic models of lake ecosystems, this research quantified the changes in hypolimnetic temperatures, oxygen levels, nutrients&nbsp; and algae to provide insights into how groundwater depletion affects lake ecosystems. The results are expected to aid in identifying better management practices to protect lakes in a warming climate. In addition, the data on the dependence of harmful algal blooms (HABs) on climatic, physical and chemical parameters is expected to help improve our ability to predict HABs in the future.</p> <p>Collectively, the project contributed to over ten journal publications, over thirty conference presentations and papers, four PhD dissertations, and one Master&rsquo;s thesis. It provided training opportunities to twelve PhD students, one Master&rsquo;s student, four undergrad students, one high school student, three middle/high school teachers, and two technicians. The robotic underwater sensing technologies developed in this project can benefit various applications, such as drinking water safety, port and maritime security, underwater infrastructure inspection, and ecological system monitoring. &nbsp;Finally, the project contributed to various activities for outreaching to K-12 students and the general public, including a robotic fish exhibit, "Robofish Rendezvous", at the Michigan State University Museum, which ran from April 2016 to January 2017. While this exhibit has ended at the Museum, it continues its function as an exhibit in Smart Microsystems Lab at MSU.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/31/2017<br>      Modified by: Xiaobo&nbsp;Tan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1331852/1331852_10280602_1490977254738_IMG_3084--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1331852/1331852_10280602_1490977254738_IMG_3084--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Testing of Grace 2.0 in Gull Lake"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1331852/1331852_10280602_1490977254738_IMG_3084--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Testing of Grace 2.0 in Gull Lake"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Michigan State University graduate students Osama Ennasr and Pratap Solanki preparing gliding robotic fish, Grace 2.0, for testing in Gull Lake, Michigan.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Xiaobo Tan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Xiaobo&nbsp;Tan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Testing of Grace 2.0 in Gull Lake</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1331852/1331852_10280602_1490977127643_IMG_3053--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1331852/1331852_10280602_1490977127643_IMG_3053--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Grace 2.0 testing in a diving well"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1331852/1331852_10280602_1490977127643_IMG_3053--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Grace 2.0 testing in a diving well"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Testing of gliding robotic fish, "Grace 2.0", in an outdoor diving well at Michigan State University.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Xiaobo Tan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Xiaobo&nbsp;Tan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Grace 2.0 testing in a diving well</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1331852/1331852_10280602_1490977378362_IMG_3108--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1331852/1331852_10280602_1490977378362_IMG_3108--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Grace 2.0 testing in Gull Lake"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1331852/1331852_10280602_1490977378362_IMG_3108--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Grace 2.0 testing in Gull Lake"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Michigan State University researchers testing gliding robotic fish, Grace 2.0, in Gull Lake, Michigan.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Xiaobo Tan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Xiaobo&nbsp;Tan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Grace 2.0 testing in Gull Lake</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1331852/1331852_10280602_1490977505083_IMG_3608-Museum2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1331852/1331852_10280602_1490977505083_IMG_3608-Museum2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Robotic fish exhibit at MSU Museum"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1331852/1331852_10280602_1490977505083_IMG_3608-Museum2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Robotic fish exhibit at MSU Museum"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Visitors watching robotic fish in action at Michigan State University Museum.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Xiaobo Tan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Xiaobo&nbsp;Tan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Robotic fish exhibit at MSU Museum</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1331852/1331852_10280602_1490977642939_IMG_3639-Museum1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1331852/1331852_10280602_1490977642939_IMG_3639-Museum1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="A young student interacting with robotic fish at MSU Museum"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1331852/1331852_10280602_1490977642939_IMG_3639-Museum1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="A young student interacting with robotic fish at MSU Museum"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A young student interacting with a robotic fish at the Robofish Rendezvous exhibit at Michigan State University Museum.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Xiaobo Tan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Xiaobo&nbsp;Tan</div> <div class="imageTitle">A young student interacting with robotic fish at MSU Museum</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
