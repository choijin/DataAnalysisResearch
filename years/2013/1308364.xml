<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Jennifer Heemstra at University of Utah and her group will be developing new methods to enable high-throughput analysis of small-molecule enantiopurity.  Enzymes have recently emerged as promising alternatives to traditional catalysts for directing stereoselective chemical transformations in the laboratory.  Libraries containing millions of enzymes can be obtained rapidly using standard molecular biology techniques, but evaluation of enzyme stereoselectivity is currently limited to tens of thousands of samples per day.  Professor Heemstra and her team aim to overcome this limitation through the development and implementation of DNA-based sensors that provide a fluorescence-based readout of enantiopurity.  The use of a fluorescence-based readout will improve throughput by more than an order of magnitude compared with the currently available methods for enantiopurity measurement.  The educational broader impacts of this project include the training of graduate and undergraduate students, the design of a new Chemical Biology course, and encouraging the participation of women in science.  Additionally, this research will contribute significantly towards the development of environmentally friendly methods for the large-scale synthesis of pharmaceutically relevant compounds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is anticipated to provide faster and more efficient methods for measuring small-molecule enantiopurity.  In principle, the methods developed could be applied towards the testing and optimization of both chemical and biological catalysts.  Furthermore, it is expected that new stereoselective enzymes will be discovered more rapidly, as screening currently represents the bottleneck in this process.  Improving access to stereoselective enzymes will in turn allow for the implementation of more efficient and environmentally benign methods for generating pharmaceuticals and other high-value chemicals.  This project will also provide excellent training for students and broaden participation in science among underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of this project has been to explore the use of DNA aptamers to measure small-molecule enantiopurity rapidly and in high throughput.  Many important molecules such as pharmaceuticals must be synthesized as a single stereoisomer to have the desired biological effect.  However, finding the appropriate reaction conditions to achieve this goal can be very labor-intensive and time-consuming.  Using the DNA aptamer biosensor for L-tyrosinamide, we have shown that we can achieve enantiopurity measurement with a high level of accuracy and precision, and in significantly less time than other currently available methods.  We have also begun to lay the foundation for studies aimed at using our method to rapidly search for enzymes capable of synthesizing drug molecules with high enantiopurity.  In these studies, we have demonstrated that we can temporally control the activity of the sensors we are using, and that aptamers are capable of functioning in the presence of surfactants such as sodium dodecyl sulfate.  This latter result has potential to be of large impact beyond our initial investigations, as protein-based affinity reagents such as antibodies cannot function in the presence of most surfactants, and thus the use of aptamers can open up a number of new applications for affinity reagents.  This project has also provided training to undergraduate and graduate students, preparing them for the STEM workforce through research experiences and a literature-based Chemical Biology course.  With support from this project, the Heemstra lab has continued to participate in the University of Utah College of Science ACCESS program, which targets academically talented women who have an interest in pursuing STEM careers, and provides them with an integrated classroom and research experience to jump-start their college careers.  Each year, the Heemstra lab teaches a 1-week summer laboratory module for this program, with the most recent curriculum focused on "Urban legends of drug testing."  During this week, the students are provided with a hands-on laboratory experience in which they explore the chemistry and biology behind antibody-based diagnostics, specifically focusing on the chemical interactions of antibodies that give rise to false positive or false negative results.  This program has been shown to increase retention of women in STEM majors on our campus.       Last Modified: 08/23/2016       Submitted by: Jennifer M Heemstra]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
