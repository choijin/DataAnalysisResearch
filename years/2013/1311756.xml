<AbstractNarration>This program will investigate a new technique to explore the ?Hidden Universe? of Dark Matter and Dark Energy.  This will be accomplished via determination of the amplitude of matter fluctuations in the universe through measurements of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (the scattering of Cosmic Microwave Background photons off hot gas in galaxy clusters) and gravitational lensing. The proposed technique will be applied to real data from the Atacama Cosmology Experiment, the Planck experiment and the Subaru telescope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students. In addition,  Dr. Spergel has participated in several TV programs on cosmology per year and will continue to do so. He will also continue his program of speaking to elementary school students on measurement and cosmology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As cosmic microwave background photons travel along their 13.8 billion year path from the surface of last scatter to our detectors, the intervening matter imprints distinctive signatures.  By studying these signatures, we can infer the integrated mass, momentum and pressure towards any point on the sky through measurments of gravitational lensing (mass), kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (momentum) and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (pressure).  This proposal supported a number of analyses that made some of the first detections of these effects in cross-correlation with other tracers of large-scale structure.    Among the highlights of the work supported by the grant:-  -By cross-correlating lensing measurments with cluster measurments, we were able to calibrate the mass of clusters and determine the amplitude of mass flucatuions.    -We detected the thermal SZ signal of groups and galaxies, thus determining the relationship between gas pressure and clusetr mass.  - Hill, Spergel &amp; Flauger showed that the claimed detection of gravitational waves by the BICEP experiment was likely due to dust contamination  - We showed that precision measurements of the CMB specrum could determine the mean temperature and pressure of the unvierse. .   The grant also supported the training of a number of graduate and undergraduate students who have gone onto pursue careers in science and in industry.
