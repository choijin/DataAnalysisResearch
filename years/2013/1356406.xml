<AbstractNarration>The need to increase the number and quality of STEM graduates in the workforce both nationally and in Michigan is well documented.  A 2010 state-level analysis study by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce (http://cew.georgetown.edu/jobs2018/states) projects that by 2018  45 percent of STEM jobs in Michigan will be in Engineering and Technicians Occupations and 94 percent of these jobs require postsecondary education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kettering University, Support Through Robotics for Underserved Talented Students (STRUTS) enrolls full-time, 10 academically talented but financially disadvantaged students in their pursuit to become leaders in a high quality scientific and technical workforce.  The number of scholars is optimal for creating camaraderie within a cohort which is large enough to be diverse but not too large to marginalize students.  Kettering University attracts students interested in computer and technical fields who have financial need. STRUTS funding bridges the gap between available financial support and the cost of tuition so removing financial barriers which result in attrition of students with financial need.  Academic support through experiential learning, leadership opportunities, FIRST Robotics, multi-level mentorship, and rigorous academics ensures the success of scholars and is centered around Kettering's new FIRST Community Center (FCC), which houses high school FIRST Robotics teams on campus.  Scholars receive targeted academic support, have a strong cohort  and a cadre of peer mentors who have completed a class in mentoring.  In addition they are provided with challenging paid co-op work assignments to prepare them for professional success and workplace leadership.  STRUTS Scholars acquire essential leadership skills when they mentor the FIRST Robotics participants working in the FCC. Simultaneously, STRUTS Scholars are mentored by an extensive pool of committed Kettering faculty from a variety of disciplines. A required research-based thesis is focused on professional practice with an interdisciplinary focus which provides an opportunity to apply academic and co-op experience with research to solve a real problem at a pre-selected organization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A comprehensive, culturally responsive assessment plan for continuous improvement and overall success will be implemented.  At least 90% of STRUTS Scholars are retained and graduate. Programmatic successes are documented to insure sustainability at Kettering and replication at other elite technology schools.  Results are disseminated to enhance the benefit of need-based support, FIRST Robotics, and mentorship on STEM higher education. The STRUTS project  is a showcase to potential donors with a view to sustaining matriculation and graduation of talented students who have financial need.</AbstractNarration>
