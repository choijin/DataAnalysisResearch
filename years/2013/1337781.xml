<AbstractNarration>An award is made to Kennesaw State University for the purchase a spectropolarimeter and associated equipment for the use in multidisciplinary research and research training. Circular dichroism (CD) is an essential tool for the analysis of molecular conformations and is often used in the estimation of secondary structure in proteins. CD is a powerful probe of changes in protein conformations. It is possible, for example, to observe small changes in helical content using difference methods, and the effects of mutations and protein-protein interactions can be studied. The spectropolarimeter will be used initially by a core group of five laboratories at KSU and their collaborators. Dr. Ellen Moomaw's work focuses on structure/function relationships in bicupin oxalate oxidase. Dr. Michael Van Dyke investigates ligand-nucleic acid interactions. Dr. Carol Chrestensen studies the activity and regulation of mitogen activated protein kinase activated protein (MAPKAP) kinase 2 (MK2) involved in response to oxidative stress. Dr. Jonathan McMurry studies the type III secretion (T3S) mechanism involved in the assembly of the bacterial flagellum. Dr. John Salerno investigates catalysis and control in nitric oxide synthases (NOSs). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The spectropolarimeter significantly enhances the research infrastructure at KSU. The equipment will be used primarily in research, including projects with undergraduate researchers. This equipment is also important to the nascent masters programs in Integrative Biology and   Biochemistry at KSU. It is expected that these programs will complement and strengthen the demonstrated track record of undergraduate research participation and training at KSU. Involvement of the facility with course curricula is also planned. The initial user group has significant combined experience in mentoring undergraduate researchers. Each faculty member designs individual student-centered research projects that are carved out of the whole with well-defined goals and objectives giving each undergraduate researcher a good chance of completion in an appropriate time frame. This instrumentation will enhance the depth and breadth of opportunities that KSU faculty can offer their undergraduate researchers. The availability of advanced instrumentation is an important factor leading to the recruitment of KSU's best students into STEM careers. The instrument will enhance faculty and student opportunities to collaborate internationally and improve the visibility of the institution in the international marketplace. All members of the initial user group have strong track records of providing research opportunities to women and underrepresented minorities.</AbstractNarration>
