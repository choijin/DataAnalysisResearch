<AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;The structures and transitions of colloidal clusters may reveal local mechanisms governing bulk phenomena such as nucleation and structural arrest. Such clusters are also useful model systems for understanding self-assembly pathways. This experimental program will investigate three-dimensional colloidal clusters composed of 6-30 particles held together by weak interactions such as depletion or DNA-mediated binding. An advanced imaging method, digital holographic microscopy, will be used to measure the positions and motions of every particle in a cluster with sub-millisecond temporal resolution and 10 nm precision in all three dimensions. This technique enables detailed, quantitative studies of the ground states, equilibrium structural transitions, and topological transitions of the clusters. Results will be compared and used as input to energy landscape calculations, with the broad goal of understanding how phase transitions and nonequilibrium phenomena emerge as the size of the system increases. The program will train a graduate student and undergraduate in soft matter physics and applied optics. An outreach and education program will bring 20-40 high-school physics students from Cambridge and Boston-area public schools to Harvard for a series of discovery-based labs on waves, optics, and holography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;This award supports experimental research on unusual materials called clusters, sometimes called an "intermediate state of matter." Compared to the usual states of matter we encounter in our daily lives -- gases, liquids, and solids -- clusters consist of a far smaller number of atoms or particles. Because they are less complex than ordinary matter, they are in principle easier to understand. Studying how these clusters change their shapes over time and in the presence of external forces could help solve longstanding challenges in materials science, such as how crystals form and why they sometimes form disordered structures called glasses, both of which are important classes of materials for industry.  However, clusters remain difficult to prepare and study experimentally.  This project will take advantage of a new way to make clusters using microscopic particles called colloids, which can be seen with an optical microscope.  The motion of particles in the clusters will be observed using an advanced imaging method involving holograms. The project will train a Ph.D. student and undergraduate in physics, materials science, and holography, an emerging high-technology field. The project will also educate 20-40 public high school students in physics and optics through a series of labs designed to be fun, engaging, and aimed toward motivating them to continue studying science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Gases, liquids, and solids are well-known states of matter.  Yet we still do not fully understand how transitions between these states occur. For example, cooling a liquid sometimes yields a crystalline solid (an ordered state of matter), but in other cases yields a disordered solid called a glass.  Understanding such "phase transitions" is an important fundamental problem in physics and materials science.  It is also important for many applications: crystallization and glass formation are critical to manufacturing microchips, construction materials, and medicines.    In recent years, progress on this problem has come from studying phase transitions in colloids, suspensions of microscopic particles in a liquid.  The colloidal particles used in these studies are about a micrometer in size &ndash; small enough that they can form crystals or glasses, but large enough that they can be seen directly in an optical microscope.  As a result, researchers can watch how individual particles come together to form crystals or glasses. However, because such states of matter consist of many particles (a million billion or more) in a three-dimensional container, it is difficult to see what all of them are doing at any one time.  With support from this grant, we have studied a simpler system, colloidal clusters.  These clusters consist of up to 100 colloidal particles that attract one another &ndash; a much smaller number of particles than in a bulk colloidal suspension, but enough to show transitions that are analogous to crystallization and glass formation. The main advantage of studying such systems is that we can see how every single particle is moving, and how the entire cluster makes transitions.  To do this, we developed a technique called holographic microscopy, which allows us to quickly image many interacting micrometer-sized particles in three dimensions.  We also developed a software package called HoloPy that can be used to analyze data from a holographic microscope.  This software has been released to the public and can be freely used and modified by researchers anywhere.    Using our holographic microscope and other optical instruments, we have been able to see, for the first time, how transitions occur in a cluster.  We have also developed quantitative theories that explain our experimental results.  As a consequence, we now understand how the interactions between particles govern the transitions in a cluster, and we have developed hypotheses for how transitions occur in larger systems like bulk liquids and glasses.  Our techniques have also proven useful for studying other systems of fundamental and practical relevance, including emulsions and viruses.  The grant supported the training of five PhD students, three current and two who have graduated and are now employed in industry.  The grant also supported an outreach project with a local public school, in which 80 eighth-grade students learned about engineering design.
