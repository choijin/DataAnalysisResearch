<AbstractNarration>Investigating the influence of movement behavior on the spatial spread of invasive species: A case study with the Burmese python in South Florida&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Predicting the geographic spread of invasive species is central to understanding and predicting their ecological impacts. Numerous studies have acknowledged that an accounting of complex animal behaviors in models of spatial spread give rise to more accurate predictions of the dynamics of invasions. Individual-based models can incorporate behavioral complexity in movement and provide a method for predicting the effects of movement and dispersal strategies on spread dynamics. The Burmese python (Python molurus bivittatus), a native of southern Asia, is established in South Florida and is currently expanding its range northward through the Florida peninsula and southward into the Florida Keys. The fellow will analyze empirical studies on the movement capacity of Burmese pythons and use these data to parameterize spatially-explicit, individual-based models to investigate the influence of movement behavior on Burmese python spread dynamics. This study will provide informative predictions of spread rate and invasion routes of pythons and insight into the influence of movement and navigational capacity on species' population dynamics. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The fellow will develop expertise in computer simulation modeling, mathematical modeling, and empirical data analysis. This project will result in additions to a simulation model (SEARCH) that is available for use by wildlife and natural resource managers. The teaching plan includes training undergraduates in research, developing lectures for entry-level undergraduate science classes, and designing and implementing an upper-level undergraduate biology course in dynamic modeling. The fellow will mentor underrepresented minority students through the Davidson Research Initiative, TERRA Environmental Center, and the Ada Jenkins Center.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of my NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship in Biology was to investigate how individual-level behavior interacts with landscape features to impact the dynamics of invasive spread, using the Burmese python invasion of South Florida as a case study. We conducted field research on the movements of free-ranging neonatal Burmese pythons in their invasive range in South Florida in multiple habitats, including freshwater wetland habitat, scrub habitat, and human-modified habitats such as low-intensity urbanized habitats and agricultural edges. We additionally conducted laboratory studies of risk-taking behavior and sensory capacity of neonatal Burmese pythons. We used results from field and lab research to parameterize individual-based models to investigate the influence of landscape and behavior on the dynamics of invasive spread. Key results from this fellowship include: 1) juvenile Burmese pythons move non-randomly at habitat boundaries, and the habitat types that juveniles move through have important implications for movement metrics such as speed and path straightness, 2) juvenile survivorship and growth rate was dependent on habitat type, 3) population spread modeling is sensitive to estimates of population density and individual-level behavior, and 4) juveniles are likely behaviorally plastic in risk-taking behavior, which may be a factor in the success of the species in urban habitats. This research also led to the creation of maps predicting the suitability of habitat throughout South Florida for invasion, and also contributed to the development of a novel method of estimating densities of secretive species using spatial movement and road encounter data.
