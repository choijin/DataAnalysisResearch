<AbstractNarration>Rapid evolutionary radiations allow tremendous insights into speciation and biogeographic history.  However, reconstruction of evolutionary relationships in such radiations has often been challenging owing largely to short periods of time between lineage-splitting events.  Preliminary simulations show that using DNA sequence data from hundreds of gene regions helps improve estimates of genealogical relationships between species in rapid radiations.  This study aims to resolve relationships within the bird family Zosteropidae, a group characterized by the fastest speciation rate known among land vertebrates.  Investigators will use next generation sequencing technology to collect DNA sequence data from hundreds of genomic regions to illuminate evolutionary relationships among members of the family.&lt;br/&gt;Resolution of genealogic relationships within Zosteropidae is vital to opening novel research avenues in historical biogeography across several archipelagos in the Old World.  More broadly, this research can provide methodological insights into paths toward resolving relationships in other rapid evolutionary radiations.  This study provides an excellent training opportunity for undergraduate students supported by KU?s Office of Diversity in Science Training.  Through this project the investigators will help prepare undergraduates from underrepresented groups for careers in science through mentoring in collecting and analyzing data, as well as in presenting and publishing research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We set out to clarify evolutionary relationships in the avian family of white-eyes (Zosteropidae), one of the most rapid evolutionary radiations in vertebrates.  White-eyes colonized and diversified in a wide area from Africa to the Western Pacific with many species occurring only on small islands in this range. Using DNA sequences from thousands of locations across the avian genome and the latest approaches in inferring evolutionary relationships with such a massive dataset, we estimated a well-resolved hypothesis of relationships within the family, a result that was not possible with sequences from only a few genes.  Although a few relationships remain ambiguous, we recovered closely related groups that are endemic to known biogeographic areas.   Because of extensive analyses employed in the study, we assembled useful strategies for estimating species trees from massive sets of DNA sequence data.  We have presented our results in scientific conferences and are currently revising a manuscript to be re-submitted to the widely respected journal Systematic Biology.     This project contributed substantially to the training and professional development of graduate and undergraduate students as well as faculty at the University of Kansas.  PI Moyle and Co-PI Oliveros developed substantial bioinformatics skills that were shared not only with his lab, but also with other evolutionary biologists through a seminar course in 2015.  The scripts and contributions to bioinformatics pipelines are available on Co-PI OliverosÃ† Github page.  Co-PI Oliveros continues to mentor undergraduate student Joshua Selbe, a member of an under-represented group in science.  They are currently working on a manuscript that will be co-authored by Mr. Selbe.       Last Modified: 04/01/2016       Submitted by: Robert G Moyle]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
