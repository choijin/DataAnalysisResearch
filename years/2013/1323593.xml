<AbstractNarration>This project addresses a recognized need of the 21st century technological society - broadening participation in computing education. The project is transforming STEM education by building a nationwide community of educators, who are teaching students to synthesize the creativity and design of art with the mathematical rigor and formality of computer science, technology, and engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Computing in the Arts (CITA) model curriculum consists of 50 hours of computing courses, arts courses, and synthesis courses. Graduates of CITA are educated to create, design, and code new creativity tools. From contemporary music, art and theater production, to new forms of animation and digital media, to the visual and audio systems of tomorrow's computers, to revolutionary web applications, CITA prepares students for productive and integrated careers in the information and arts economies. The CITA model maximizes reuse of existing courses and faculty expertise, and thus facilitates adaptation. In this collaborative project the CITA model has already been successfully implemented at the lead institution, where there are currently 46 majors (a 22% increase), mainly from an underserved population - students interested in the arts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on dissemination - successes and synthesis with other complementary approaches with partner institutions to build a strong, diversified community of educators interested in adopting and further developing innovative CITA instructional materials. This community is being forged through three faculty workshops, special sessions at the annual conference for Computer Science Education, and a website of pedagogical materials. The evaluation plan involves an independent evaluator, and various quantitative and qualitative outcomes that assess (a) the formation of a thriving CITA community, (b) dissemination efforts, and (c) the impact on transforming STEM education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our NSF-supported bproject resulted in three workshops and a body of curriculum material and project ideas for computing in the arts disseminated at these workshops. The workshops, curriculum material, and project ideas have intellectual merit in that they integrate music and visual arts with a rigorous algorithmic and a mathematical approach.  The PIs of the partner institutions have the combined expertise in computer science, engineering, hardware, electronics, and music to create well-integrated material and presentations, drawing upon the interdisciplinary backgrounds of the workshop attendees.  Our model curriculum &ndash; including a degree program, synthesis courses, and arts+science instructional material &ndash; was broadly disseminated through our workshops, conference and journal papers, and SIGCSE workshops and special sessions.  One broader impact of our project lies in the way our workshops and papers introduced algorithmic, scientific, and mathematical thinking to representatives the arts disciplines.   Another broader impact lies in the way that our curriculum material engages the interest of students not traditionally drawn to computer science, attractng the students to the sciences by means of their interest in art, music, and personal creativity . It has been shown that combining computing with the arts is a way to broaden opportunities in computing for women and minorities. Thus our project has planted seeds for bringing more gender and ethnicity balance into the computing field.  The attendees at our workshops represented15 different science and art related disciplines.   Discipline     Number of Attendees in this Discipline  Math     1  Music     15  Interactive Media     1  Computer Science     23  Digital Media Librarian     1  Radio, TV, &amp; Film     1  Game Programming     1  Fine Arts     7  Computing and Digital Media     1  CS and Engineering     2  Art History     2  New Media     1  Digital Humanities     2  Education     1  Theatre and Dance     2  Digital Design     1     They came from 12 different states of the United States and one country abroad.  The collaborations and new programs engendered at least in part as a result of our workshops are listed below.        Last Modified: 10/29/2017       Submitted by: Jennifer J Burg]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
