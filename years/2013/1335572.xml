<AbstractNarration>Lang/Slegers&lt;br/&gt;1335848/1335572&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The wings of the Monarch butterfly exhibit scales with a morphological structure that has a characteristic size on the order of micrometers.  This unique micro-patterning results in a surface drag alteration, and leads to an increase in thrust and lift during flapping and gliding flight at high Reynolds numbers (Re ~= 10e3- 10e4). This reduction in energy expended would be important to the Monarch which has the longest migration of any insect. Preliminary results performed by the PIs indicate: (1) flow passing transverse to the rows of scales can decrease the local surface drag by 40% at low Re via a roller bearing effect, (2) flow passing parallel to the rows of scales can increase local surface drag by over 100%, (3) higher drag differences occur in the very low Re regime (Re ~ 5), (4) leading edge vortex strength may vary based on surface drag alteration, and (5) initial flight tests of Monarch butterflies indicate a 10% increase in flapping frequency for those without scales to maintain similar energetic free flight. Proposed work will statistically determine the increased aerodynamic efficiency of butterfly wings with scales through flight testing of live Monarch specimens in a state-of-the-art autonomous tracking facility at the University of Alabama Huntsville; preliminary results have already shown the capability to obtain mm level tracking of body and wing motion at 370 fps. Autorotating drop tests of single Monarch forewings will also be performed by a REU student to measure increased aerodynamic performance with the presence of scales. A series of dynamically scaled tests carried out in high viscosity silicone oil at the University of Alabama will allow for models of butterfly-inspired geometries with an increase in 10 to 100 times in sizing from real scales. The proposed studies will (1) measure variation in the drag coefficient over streamlined models in drop tests with butterfly-inspired surface patterning, (2) utilize DPIV measurements of boundary layer formation in tow tank studies over flat plate models with butterfly-inspired surface patterning, and (3) evaluate leading edge vortex strength variation based on surface patterning inspired by butterfly scales in pitching plate experiments. The third set of experiments will utilize the TSI V3V system for full 3-D volumetric velocity flow measurements recently acquired by the PI through a NSF MRI-R2 award.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit :&lt;br/&gt;The proposed collaborative effort will result in the potentially transformative discovery of a new and unique passive surface drag control methodology derived from butterfly scales functioning at the micro-scale level. Proposed work will test our working hypothesis that local surface drag alteration results in reduced energy requirements for butterflies in flapping and gliding flight. Additional work will better elucidate the surface drag alteration and corresponding vortex control for fluid dynamic confirmation of the hypothesized mechanisms for increased aerodynamic efficiency. This fundamental understanding will advance knowledge for the ultimate use of a butterfly-inspired surface patterning for other engineering applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts :&lt;br/&gt;Innovations in the field of boundary layer control are needed to provide efficient methodologies to decrease drag (resulting in increased payload, range or fuel savings) for MAVs as well as higher Re applications. A unique, bioinspired technology in the form of a passive microgeometry leading to drag reduction has the potential to impact this area of research with future applications with increased energy conservation and flow control. The discovery of the biological aerodynamic function of butterfly scales would also result. In addition, the proposed study involves a number of other beneficial outcomes including the training of students at all levels and broad dissemination of results in journals/conference proceedings and the public media (e.g. National Geographic Online). Undergraduate student involvement will take place through REU participation with a focus on involving underrepresented groups. Bio-inspired engineering is an excellent topic for public outreach, and butterflies generate a high level of interest.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Monarch butterfly (<em>Danaus plexipus</em>) is a member of the order <em>Lepidoptera</em> (literally meaning &ldquo;scaled wing&rdquo;) under the class <em>insect</em> which contains butterflies and moths. With its distinct bright orange, black and white color pattern, the Monarch is one of the most easily recognizable butterflies in North America. The Monarch is also known for its annual migration from the Northern U.S. and Canada to the mountains of central Mexico &ndash; a distance of up to 4000 km.

A primary objective of this research project was to explore the potentially transformative discovery of a passive, bio-inspired drag reduction methodology derived from butterfly scales that could be mimicked for use on modern micro aerial vehicles.</p> <p>A repeatable, efficient procedure for preparing butterflies for flight testing was developed. Butterflies are delivered in a chilled dormant state. Their temperature is gradually raised. While still semi-dormant, the reflective markers are attached on the butterfly wings, thorax and abdomen. The butterflies are then placed in individual terrariums with a food source. Flight testing of each butterfly is performed over two days to reduce their stress. A method for removing scales with a Q-tip with minimal damage to each butterfly's wings was also devised.</p> <p>A database of representative Monarch morphological properties was compiled including the length of the head, thorax and abdomen.

A small capture volume of 1.2 m &times; 1.2 m &times; 1.5 m was created by a metal frame with netting covering the sides and top. Twelve VICON cameras are mounted on the corners, sides and top of the capture volume. Flights were recorded at 200 fps.</p> <p>IR reflective markers are placed at strategic locations on the body and the wings of butterfly. Three circular markers with a diameter of 1.8 mm are placed on the thorax and two are placed on the abdomen. The wing markers are rectangular in shape with dimension of 2&times;3 mm. Markers are placed on the leading edge of the right forewing at 0.4<em>R</em>, 0.7<em>R</em> and 1.0<em>R </em>respectively, where <em>R</em>=48.94 mm is the average half wing span measured from the wing root. A fourth marker is placed on the trailing edge of the right forewing at 0.7<em>R</em>. To prevent marker occlusion during the upstroke when the wings fold backwards, rectangular markers of 2&times;3 mm were placed on the underside of the wings at the same position as on the upper side of the wing.</p> <p>This motion capture system enables collecting data describing the motion of the butterfly in a three-dimensional space. Measured and derived data includes the wing flapping frequency and amplitude, position and orientation of the thorax, abdomen, and wings, as well as the instantaneous lift coefficient and climb rate.</p> <p>Preliminary results indicate that flapping frequency may increase as much as 10% for butterflies with their scales removed. This suggests more energy must be expended without scales and therefore scales enhance aerodynamic efficiency.</p> <p>Significant wing deformation was recorded with the amount of deformation varying between the downstroke (power stroke) and upstroke.

Butterflies tend to glide a lot more in the presence of wind gust. From preliminary visual observations, we recorded three to four seconds of pure gliding in the presence of gusts.

The differing flight strategies of migratory and non-migratory species can provide insight into flight adaptations and their implications for flight behavior. A migratory species such as the Monarch relies on efficiency to successfully complete its migration. This may significantly differ from a species that does not migrate but has significantly more predators where maneuverability is critical.</p> <p>The insights obtained from this study can be used to identify optimum insect flight parameters as well as provide an understanding of how butterflies use synchronized body-wing motion to control their trajectory.
