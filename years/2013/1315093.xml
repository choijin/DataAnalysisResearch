<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop innovations that enable efficient design, optimization, and integration of digital systems and embedded software for signal processing in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). WSNs are used in an increasing variety of important applications, including applications in building energy management, environmental monitoring, and surveillance. However, deploying sensor nodes is challenging because such devices must be developed and operated under stringent constraints on energy consumption, cost, and reliability. The advanced signal processing solutions developed in this project will enable deployment of WSNs with significantly lower cost and energy consumption for a given set of features, and will help to maximize the performance of new WSN application features under given cost and energy constraints.  This project will build on a body of extensive research on dataflow-based design and implementation of signal processing systems. The project seeks to bridge the gap between results from this basic research on dataflow-based signal processing, and important technology requirements and market needs in the digital mobile radio domain, which is targeted as an initial application area within the WSN market.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable deployment of novel applications in the rapidly growing wireless sensor network (WSN) market. The WSN market serves application areas of great interest and societal importance, including building energy management, digital mobile radio, defense, environmental monitoring, and surveillance.  The utility of WSNs often depends on the level of functionality that can be embedded in the network nodes under severe cost and energy constraints. This project will help to enable more powerful WSN deployments through its objectives in providing energy-efficient use of more complex processing hardware, more sophisticated software, and more advanced sensors.  These optimized sensing and signal processing capabilities can be leveraged to significantly enhance important design objectives, including reliability and security, in addition to providing more functionality to end users.  Also, the innovation pursued in this project will enhance scientific and technological understanding by enabling the efficient integration of more sophisticated and heterogeneous combinations of hardware and software subsystems in WSNs. This understanding will help WSN system developers to envision new applications for their technologies, thereby helping to catalyze further innovations and economic benefits.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Through the Phase I project, we have made major advances in developing newmethods for synthesis, optimization, and integration of software for advancedwireless communications applications. The project has built on a body of designand optimization methods that have been developed through extensive research inthe "Maryland DSPCAD Research Group" at the University of Maryland.  Weacquired an exclusive license from the University of Maryland Office ofTechnology Commercialization to use DSPCAD Software technology forcommercialization.  The project has bridged the gap between the results fromthis basic research in the DSPCAD Research Group, and important technologyrequirements and market needs in the digital mobile radio (DMR) domain, whichis targeted as an initial application area.   In the Phase I project, we have developed a new cloud-based, professionalmessaging and storage management service called SETComm Service and associatedapplication products, including the SETComm App and Windows-based SETComm Litedesktop application.  This is an integrated set of software service andapplication components that are now undergoing beta testing, and that we areactively working to commercialize.  The SETComm Service is an integrated multimedia, messaging, communication andstorage management service that coordinates the sending and receiving ofpictures, video clips, documents, and other kinds of files, and providesfeatures for communicating, storing, and managing a user's files in anintegrated, professionally-oriented, and user-friendly way.  SETComm App is a mobile app that is integrated with SETComm, and allows usersto send and receive pictures, video clips, documents and other kinds of filesthrough their mobile devices over different kinds of communication links. SETComm Lite is a minimal version of SETComm App that is implemented forWindows desktop platforms and targeted specifically for mobile radiointegration.  Through the Phase I project, we have developed end-to-end system prototypesthat demonstrate practical computer vision applications, and a new optimizedimage transfer process operating within SETComm that provides added value tocustomers through integration of optimized, cloud-based, signal and imageprocessing functionality. We have also demonstrated that our optimizationtechnique can help to enable more powerful DMR deployments --- allowing usersto transfer images with customized, configurable quality levels acrosslow-bandwidth DMR networks.  The developments in this project have been motivated by market needsin areas of major societal importance, including especiallypublic safety, where DMR and efficient, reliable communication capabilities are of great importance. The new technology and prototypesdeveloped in this project have significant potential to lead to improved new products for public safety communications.
