<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program that is co-funded by the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program, Professor Gregory Tochtrop from Case Western Reserve and colleague Blanton Tolbert will acquire a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a liquid-nitrogen cooled broadband X-detect probe and an automated sampling system. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) studies of the catabolic fate of lipid peroxidation products; (b) NMR detection of RNA structures and protein-RNA contacts involved in viral replication; (c) studies of mechanically enhanced polymers; (d) advanced functional materials based upon organic conjugated polymers and molecules; (d) protein stability, structure, and dynamics; (e) interlocked polymeric architectures; (f) mechanisms by which enzymes are activated during signal transduction pathways; (g) characterization of conjugated molecules and polymers; and (h) design and characterization of fluoro-aromatic analogues of human insulin.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research of students in the departments of Chemistry, Biology, Polymer Science &amp; Engineering, Chemical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering. The instrument will enhance the research and teaching capabilities of the greater Cleveland scientific community with web-based scheduling and cyber-enabled data delivery/processing for off-site users.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The central premise behind this funded proposal is the acquisition of a 500 MHz magnetic resonance instrument to both replace an aging instrument, but more importantly augment our NMR facility whose primary mission is the characterization of small molecules and materials with state of the art capabilities to detect specific atomic nuclei (such as 13C, 31P, 15N) with an extremely high level of sensitivity.  Since installation, this instrument has effectively supported the research of more than 40 vibrant research groups that span over 12 academic departments at Case Western Reserve University.  The research that has been enabled spans from materials science to pure chemistry to fundamental biological and biochemical studies, and highlights of the research enabled include 1) the collection of key data that allowed critical insights into how molecular constituents of various mammalian bile can impact cholesterol metabolism; 2) The collection of key carbon magnetic resonance data that allowed key structural insights into the structure of the HIV virus; and 3) the collection of important fluorine magnetic resonance data that allowed for the synthesis of an ultra-stable single-chain insulin analog.     The installed instrumentation has vastly upgraded the capability of a number of departments to provide NMR training to undergraduate and graduate students.  In addition, the instrument has been utilized in four undergraduate classes spanning undergraduate majors in Chemistry, Biology, Polymer Science &amp; Engineering, Chemical Engineering, and Biomedical Engineering.  For the first time at CWRU, undergraduate students in large laboratory classes, specifically organic chemistry laboratory with an enrollment of ~350, have been able to generate their own samples, process their spectra, and interpret the results of their reactions using techniques that are commensurate with modern chemistry.
