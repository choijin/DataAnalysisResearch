<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project aims at creating novel methods for analyzing consumer behavior and product acceptance. This project will develop efficient, automated natural language processing (NLP) methods that perform at Web scale to analyze a broad spectrum of consumer experiences with products, as reported in conversations on social media, in consumer reviews, etc. Currently available representations of consumer commentary are relatively shallow. In this project more detailed representations will be built, advancing NLP technology and delivering state-of-the-art analysis of conversations that detail consumer decisions, motivations, and questions about products. In addition, the representations of consumer commentary will be integrated with third-party data, resulting in the development of predictive models of consumer behavior that exceed the accuracy of current models. This will allow product vendors to quantify the influencing factors behind product adoption and attrition, which is crucial to proving marketing hypotheses, predicting business outcomes, and improving customer awareness of product issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project lies in the ability to improve the analysis and use of consumers' perception and experience of products. Deeper analysis of millions of consumer experiences reported online will help the public, manufacturers, marketers, and regulators alike make better decisions about products. Currently, gaining representative insights about a product requires manual processing of an overwhelming range of information sources. Automatic, in-depth analysis of these disparate sources at Web scale will deliver an unbiased, authoritative stream of quantified product information and consumer opinion, improving consumer experience, product performance, and industry transparency. The richness of the resulting representation will enable an understanding of finer-grained aspects of product performance and consumer behavior, which cannot be extracted or analyzed using existing techniques such as sentiment analysis or topic-modeling. The technology developed in this project will translate to fundamental improvements in the conduct of market research, commercial campaigns and regulatory investigations, as well as enhancing the public's ability to make informed decisions about products.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The work performed under this Phase II SBIR award resulted in the development of DecisionEngine, a cutting-edge software system for tracking and understanding consumer decisions. DecisionEngine provides a strategic advantage to (a) brand teams in crowded markets, and (b) (a) advertisers seeking to create novel pitches and execute better campaigns.  Accessible as a web application, DecisionEngine provides brand managers with an easy way to obtain the pulse of the customer, by continuously tracking consumer comments on millions of relevant websites. This information is then used to understand consumer decision making, create better campaigns, and improve targeting of particular customer groups, for both measurement and outreach.  The main aspects of work under this award included:  1. Creating natural language processing (NLP) models to remove SPAM and marketing data. SPAM and marketing messages comprise the absolute majority of typical brand?s mentions online, polluting resulting analyses with irrelevant data.  2. Creating linguistic (NLP) models for tracking consumer decisions in a highly accurate manner. This effort included the design of a set of models for tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) focused on consumer decision making, as well as consumer perception of targeted brands.  3. Designing a user interface and a flexible query language, capable of answering a rich set of questions about social media data.  4. Designing a set of high-accuracy high-scale web crawlers to obtain source data from blogs, forums, and social media networks.     The work performed under this grant led to the successful accomplishment of this grant?s objective: a scalable, multi-domain version of the deep NLP components of our text processing pipeline, designed to understand consumer decisions.
