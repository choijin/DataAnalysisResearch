<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) and the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) in the Biological Sciences Directorate supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site at Texas A&amp;M University, led by Professors Holly Gaede and James Batteas. The research projects supported at this Site are in areas of biological, green, and materials chemistry. Undergraduates are recruited to this site primarily from institutions that lack extensive infrastructure to support undergraduate research, and include students from underrepresented groups. The diverse student cohort participating in research at this site is well-prepared for graduate school, and eventual employment as part of the country's technical workforce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Site supports ten students per summer in a ten week program. A sample of the projects include: (1) the synthesis of bioactive natural products; (2) the synthesis of biodegradable polymers from renewable resources; (3) the design of metal-organic framework for the reversible adsorption of carbon dioxide; (4) the tuning of surface interactions for the control of friction and wear; (5) synthesis of conjugated ladder polymers for organic solar cells, and (6) the computational design of transition metal free catalysts. Exposure to the modern research methods and tools used in the research expands the undergraduate participants' technical training. In addition, the students are exposed to areas of science with important societal impacts in health, energy, environment, and materials. In addition to conducting research during the summer, the students participating in this program will participate in a number of professional development activities, and will have expanded opportunities for presentation of their research at national disciplinary meetings.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Our program provided 38 students from 20 states and Puerto Rico with high quality research experiences in chemistry. Many of these students would not otherwise have access to this valuable training, which is a critical stepping stone to further internships, employment, or graduate studies, and therefore our program represents a critical effort for retaining students in the STEM fields. This diverse group of students included 20 women, 17 men, and 1 person of non-binary gender, of whom, 5 identified as African Americans and 7 as Hispanic American students. In additional to technical training in synthesis, instrumentation, and analysis, students also received training in safety, ethics, and scientific communication. Each student was assigned a project in either biological chemistry, green chemistry, or materials chemistry &ndash; areas of research that have broad applications across society. These projects involved a variety of approaches, including developing new synthetic methods, making new compounds, and characterizing the compounds&rsquo; structural, magnetic, and electronic properties.</p> <p>Twenty-five of these students attended a national meeting of the American Chemical Society, the largest scientific society in the world, where they presented the results of their research, attended technical presentations, and networked with professionals in chemistry. So far, five publications in high-quality, high impact journals have resulted from this work, covering a broad range of potential applications, including the design of more efficient and stable solar cells and more efficient methods of extracting oil from emulsions, as well as a number of potential commercial applications including molecular electronics, field effect transistors, and computing. Equally important from the students&rsquo; work is the increased fundamental understanding of how chemical structure changes material properties, which may in the long run lead to as of now unforeseen benefits.</p> <p>This program actively supports the creation of a diverse workforce in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Five of our participants have already entered the STEM workforce in the energy sector, hydrogen fuel cell development, high performance materials, and developing sustainable chemistry processes. So far, 23 students have opted for further study in chemistry, pursuing graduate degrees at institutions across the country, while 3 are still completing their undergraduate degrees. Three students are pursuing professional school, and the remaining are pursuing careers outside of STEM.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/14/2018<br>      Modified by: Holly&nbsp;C&nbsp;Gaede</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359175/1359175_10315850_1532464257400_tiaasiajames--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359175/1359175_10315850_1532464257400_tiaasiajames--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Tia'Asia James talks with Professor Oleg Ozerov about her work"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359175/1359175_10315850_1532464257400_tiaasiajames--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Tia'Asia James talks with Professor Oleg Ozerov about her work"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Tia'Asia James from University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff discusses her 2016 summer research work in the laboratory of Dr. Kim Dunbar at Texas A&M University with Dr. Oleg Ozerov</div> <div class="imageCredit">Holly Gaede</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Holly&nbsp;C&nbsp;Gaede</div> <div class="imageTitle">Tia'Asia James talks with Professor Oleg Ozerov about her work</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359175/1359175_10315850_1532463640004_DavidDacres--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359175/1359175_10315850_1532463640004_DavidDacres--rgov-800width.jpg" title="David Dacres presents his Texas A&amp;M research"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359175/1359175_10315850_1532463640004_DavidDacres--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="David Dacres presents his Texas A&amp;M research"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">David Dacres from Hamilton College presents results from his 2017 summer work at Texas A&M University Department of Chemistry.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Holly Gaede</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Holly&nbsp;C&nbsp;Gaede</div> <div class="imageTitle">David Dacres presents his Texas A&M research</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359175/1359175_10315850_1532463760230_ThomasReyes--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359175/1359175_10315850_1532463760230_ThomasReyes--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Thomas Reyes in front of his research poster"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359175/1359175_10315850_1532463760230_ThomasReyes--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Thomas Reyes in front of his research poster"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Thomas Reyes, a student from University of Alabama Hunstville, poses in front of a poster displaying his research results from his REU 2017 work at Texas A&M University Department of Chemistry.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Holly Gaede</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Holly&nbsp;C&nbsp;Gaede</div> <div class="imageTitle">Thomas Reyes in front of his research poster</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359175/1359175_10315850_1532463492690_REU2015--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359175/1359175_10315850_1532463492690_REU2015--rgov-800width.jpg" title="students from summer 2015"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1359175/1359175_10315850_1532463492690_REU2015--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="students from summer 2015"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">REU students on the first day of 2015 summer research in the Department of Chemistry at Texas A&M University pose on the steps of the chemistry building after receiving their lab coats.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Holly Gaede</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Holly&nbsp;C&nbsp;Gaede</div> <div class="imageTitle">students from summer 2015</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
