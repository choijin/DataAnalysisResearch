<AbstractNarration>The goal of this proposal is to apply magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modeling tools to the study of interacting close binary systems such as cataclysmic variables (CVs), with the complementary goal of improving the understanding of magneto-rotational instability in accretion disks.  While observations of CVs have provided a wealth of constraints on physical models of accretion, advanced MHD models have yet to be applied to the study of the disks in these systems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will compare results from the numerical simulations of the disks around close binary star systems to observational data in order to further constrain disk parameters such as physical disk size, angular momentum transport, and global disk features (i.e. spiral shocks, hot spots, etc.).   The project will also contribute to scientific workforce development through the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students.  The project will communicate results to the public through the development of animations and visualizations of the close binary disk models made available via the web.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the past 50 years, observations of accretion disks in close binary systems, where two stars orbit each other so closely that one is transferring mass to the other, have placed the most precise, and the most number, of observational constraints on the physics of accretion. At the same time, developments in theory have removed the greatest uncertainty in interpreting the observations, namely the origin of the angular momentum transport mechanism: it is now understood to be magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence.  Over the course of this project, fully three-dimensional MHD simulations were used to understand the physics of accretion in these systems. Our most important result was the demonstration that spiral density waves, excited by the tidal forces of the binary stars, can play a significant role in the dynamics of these systems.  In fact, when the disk is hot (as in the outburst phase of so-called dwarf novae systems), the angular momentum transport by spiral density waves can actually dominate over that by MHD turbulence, a result completely unexpected in modern theory.  A comprehensive series of simulations was used to investigate the global structure, time-dependent evolution, and turbulent dynamics of disks in these systems.  The attached image shows the results from one of our numerical models.  The results of this study are important for interpreting astronomical observations of a variety of systems (especially dwarf novae and cataclysmic variable stars), as well as to understand the basic plasma physics of accretion flows.  Numerical algorithms developed as part of the project also being used widely by other groups for other projects.  Funding from the project supported one graduate student for her PhD thesis research, and involved collaboration with postdoctoral research scholars at Princeton University.  In addition to furthering our basic understanding of the astrophysics of disks in close binaries, the project engaged students in the the use of modern high-performance computing systems, and in the development of new numerical algorithms and models that have been made publically available and are widely used by other research groups.  Results from the project were disseminated through a series of three published papers in the refereed literature, an additional three published papers in conference proceedings, including an invited review presentationa, and through over 10 research talksand seminars at institutions around the world.  In addition, the project invovled outreach and science education activities for the general public through images, animations, and resources on the web that explain the science and our results.  The project led to training of under-represented minorities in advanced STEM areas.       Last Modified: 09/16/2017       Submitted by: James M Stone]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
