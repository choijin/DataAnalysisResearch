<AbstractNarration>Recent studies have revealed that among all the tropical oceans, the Atlantic has experienced the most pronounced warming trend over the 20th century. Many extreme climate events are influenced by oceanic conditions over the Atlantic. It is therefore imperative to have accurate simulations of the Atlantic Ocean climate to be able to make credible projections of future climate in the surrounding continental regions. Unfortunately, current-generation models, including those used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), exhibit severe biases in their simulations of tropical Atlantic climate. An infamous example is a persistent warm sea surface temperature bias of at least 6°C off the coast of Namibia and Angola.  This research aims at investigating the causes of this bias which will ultimately lead to major improvements in the simulation and projection of future climate changes within the Atlantic sector.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project will explore oceanic and atmospheric biases, as well as amplification of biases from the coupled ocean-atmosphere system.  The sources of oceanic biases will be analyzed and identified from oceanic observations, ocean reanalysis products, IPCC model simulations, and eddy resolving regional ocean simulations.  Similarly, atmospheric biases will be evaluated using atmospheric reanalysis data and convection-resolving regional atmospheric model simulations.  The role of ocean-atmosphere interactions in amplifying the oceanic or atmospheric biases will be examined from high-resolution coupled regional climate model (CRCM) simulations.  The use of high-resolution (up to 3 km) regional climate models will allow processes such as oceanic mesoscale eddies, fronts and upwelling dynamics off the west coast of southern Africa, as well as atmospheric convection and steep orography effects, and thus will minimize model systematic errors due to uncertainties associated with parameterizations of subgrid-scale processes. This modeling approach will isolate sources of the biases from other ocean basins and will help to pinpoint the causes of the biases within the Atlantic basin. The study will utilize an array of fine temporal and spatial resolution data sets produced by recent intense observational programs within the Atlantic sector. Furthermore, the project will coincide with the launch of two major European research projects in the study region: a German project "Southwest African Coastal Upwelling System and Benguela Niño" (SACUS) led by Brandt, and an EU project "Enhancing prediction of tropical Atlantic climate and its impacts" (PREFACE) led by Keenlyside.  Both of these projects will generate new arrays of observations along the southern Africa coast. Close collaboration with the European colleagues will allow their new observations to be combined with US-based detailed modeling that will likely lead to new breakthroughs in solving tropical Atlantic bias problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This research will enhance our understanding of the uncertainties in projecting impacts of global climate change in the Atlantic region, which has enormous socio-economic implications for countries in the region. The CRCM is being developed within the framework of the Coupler (CPL7) software that is part of the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Earth System Model (CESM). This framework allows easy transfer of parameterizations between CESM and the CRCM, and potential partial coupling between the CESM and the CRCM.  We envision that the CRCM will become a community-modeling tool and be made available to the broader climate research community. Findings from this study on reducing climate model biases will feedback to community model development activities. The project will support one graduate student and one postdoc at Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) and provide valuable professional development for all young scientists involved, including Co-PI Patricola.</AbstractNarration>

Changes in tropical SST can have a profound impact on global weather patterns and extremes.&nbsp; For example, warm SST anomalies in the equatorial Pacific associated with El Ni?o are well known for their impact on drought and floods in various parts of the world, as well as their impact on typhoons in tropical Pacific and hurricanes in the tropical Atlantic. Anomalous SST conditions in the tropical Atlantic, particularly those associated with the Atlantic Meridional Mode, are also shown to have a critical impact on Atlantic hurricane activity. Therefore, an accurate prediction of the state of tropical SST is fundamentally important for an accurate prediction of climate variability at subseasonal-to-decadal time scales.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the current generation of climate models has considerable difficulties in accurately representing the observed tropical SST. In particular, these models have been plagued by persistent warm sea surface temperature (SST) biases in the southeastern tropical Atlantic (SETA) for decades, where the SST error can reach 3?C or more (See Figure 1, Richter et al. 2016). These SST biases can severely degrade the fidelity and realism of the representation of climate phenomena and extreme events in climate simulations.&nbsp; For example, as part of this project we show that the tropical SST biases can cause an underestimation of Atlantic cyclone activity by ~60% and an overestimation of cyclone activity in the Eastern North Pacific by ~200% using accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) as a measure (Hsu et al. 2018).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In this project, we made significant advancements in our understanding of the cause of the SETA warm SST bias. By analyzing Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) ensemble, we first show that the shortwave radiation bias caused by poorly simulated low-level clouds in climate models is not the leading cause of the warm SST bias in SETA, differentiating this case from that in the southeastern Tropical Pacific. The SETA warm bias, instead, is shown to be caused by the failure of the models to accurately simulate the location of the Angola-Benguela Front (ABF) along Southern African west coast. In fact, all CMIP5 models simulate a southward displaced ABF and many of them show more than 10? southward displacement compared to their observed location (Xu et al. 2014). We then show that the cause of the southward displayed ABF can be traced to the poorly simulated winds along the coast. This is because along the Benguela coast, there is a narrow low-level atmospheric jet ? the so-called Benguela Jet, and coarse resolution climate models, like the CMIP5 models, cannot properly resolve the jet (Patricola and Chang, 2016). As a result, a broad and weak wind pattern forms&#8232;along the coast in all CMIP5 models. This problem can be remedied by using an atmospheric model of horizontal grid spacing of less than 20 km that is 5 times finer than the resolution of current generation CMIP5 models. Finally, we investigated the dynamical reason behind the cause of the southward displayed ABF by the unrealistic broad and weak coastal winds. By conducting high-resolution regional atmosphere and ocean model simulations, we show that the broad and weak coastal winds can generate a broad wind curl off the coast, which in turn drives a southward current via Sverdrup transport.&nbsp; This Sverdrup transport is primarily responsible for the southward displayed ABF and the warm SST bias in SETA (Kurian et al. 2018).&nbsp; Therefore, the results from this project shed new light on the longstanding SST bias problem and provide a new perspective of resolving this difficult issue.
