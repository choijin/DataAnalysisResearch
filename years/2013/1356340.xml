<AbstractNarration>A unifying theory describing primary controls on mountain catchment hydrologic response continues to elude hydrologists despite valuable advances in quantitative modeling and process understanding from overland flow, to throughflow, to variables source area dynamics. This may be attributed to the near infinite complexities of natural systems, our inability to measure necessary variables adequately in space and time, and difficulties in quantifying non-linear watershed processes and threshold mediated runoff generation. We acknowledge the advances to date in catchment process understanding and modeling and are engaged in activities focused on both expanding the limits of our system behavior understanding and developing hybrid conceptual (mathematical) models internally validated and tested with synthesized process observations. We are conducting a suite of empirical and modeling studies performed iteratively at the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest (TCEF) in the Little Belt Mountains of central Montana, across seven adjacent diverse watersheds and more than five years of variable climatic forcings. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We specifically address the following challenges in catchment hydrology:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) What is the role of landscape structure (shape) in headwater mountain catchment hydrologic response and source water contributions? Follow-on: Does the relative importance of structure change across variable forcing (climatic variability)?&lt;br/&gt;2) Can we develop new quantifications (models) of watershed behavior based on hypotheses about the role of landscape structure in watershed response? Follow-on: How do field observations help infer specific model structures and parameters, and constrain predictive uncertainty?&lt;br/&gt;3) Does the effectiveness of catchment models based on landscape structure vary across multiple watersheds or under different climatic forcing? Follow-on: How do we compare the transferability of new model conceptualizations to traditional models based on topographic controls, variable source area concepts, or simple water balance representations?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address these challenges we are working to build tools and infrastructure for research and education. We focus on themes critical to watershed science to improve transferability of watershed understanding and predictability of watershed response via new process conceptualizations and model structures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Congress enacted the Clean Water Act (CWA) "to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the NationÃ†s waters". A recent Supreme Court decision further described protection for waters with "a significant nexus to navigable waters" if they are in the same watershed and have an effect on the chemical, physical, or biological integrity of traditional navigable waters or interstate waters that is more than "speculative or insubstantial." Evolving interpretation of the CWA and "significant nexus" (connectivity) requires investigation and understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of hydrologic connectivity between upland landscapes and stream networks that mediate streamflow magnitude and composition. While hydrologic connectivity is a continuum, strong non-linearities including the shift from unsaturated to saturated flow conditions lead to threshold or transient landscape hydrologic connectivity to the stream network and orders of magnitude changes in flow velocities. In this project, we measured, illustrated, and modeled the spatial and temporal dynamics of hydrologic connectivity between upland landscapes and stream networks that provide direct and proximate links between streamflow composition and its watershed sources.  We performed extensive field research and developed two new watershed models to quantify, predict, and map landscape hydrologic connectivity.  We applied these concepts and tools to forested and rapidly developing mountain watersheds in Montana to gain new understanding about the space-time patterns of where streamwater originates in the landscape.  We suggest that the concepts elucidated and tools developed are applicable across a wide range of landscapes.  We found that adjacency alone does not determine influence on streamflow dynamics and streamwater composition.  Therefore, consideration and communication of the temporal and spatial dynamics of watershed connectivity are required to address urgent needs at the interface of the Clean Water Act, science, and society.
