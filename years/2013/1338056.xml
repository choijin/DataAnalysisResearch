<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemistry Major Research Instrumentation Program, Professor Gregory Tschumper from the University of Mississippi and colleagues Brian Hopkins and Robert Doerksen will acquire a GPU-based high performance computing (HPC) cluster for use in computational science. The cluster would be operated by the Mississippi Center for Supercomputing Research (MCSR) on the University of Mississippi campus. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) molecular properties of non-covalent clusters; (b) computational studies of biomolecules; (c) interactions of nanoparticles with biological systems and small molecules; (d) morphology-structure-property correlations in organic electronic materials and (e) molecular modeling and dynamics of carboxylesterases and their substrates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Computer systems and clusters of computers are used by chemists and biochemists to investigate reactions and the properties of chemicals and materials using theoretical models and programs. The computer calculations are used, often along with experimental data, to model and better understand many types of complex chemical and biological phenomena. They are also used to predict results and guide experiments. This resource will be used in research and in course work by undergraduate students and faculty at eight institutions training them in computational chemistry methodology with a modern computer system.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this NSF funded program was to procure, install and maintain a GPU-based high performance computing (HPC) cluster at the Mississippi Center for Supercomputing Research (MCSR) to support computational research in science and engineering (particularly in the chemical sciences).  Established in 1987, MCSR provides free, assisted access to stable, highly available research computing environments to researchers and students at all eight of Mississippi?s public universities, including three traditionally minority serving institutions:  Jackson State University, Alcorn State University and Mississippi Valley State University (each &gt;90% black and &gt;60% female).  This MRI award from NSF was used to procure a hybrid Cray GreenBlade Cluster that offers a very cost effective way to accelerate the high-impact computational science of MCSR users throughout the state of Mississippi.  The instrument was installed at MCSR in December 2014, and it was being used for research by January 2015.  The cluster consists of 30 nodes (1 control node + 29 compute nodes) each of which is equipped with 64 GB of memory, two 10-core Intel Xeon E5-2680 2.80 GHz Ivy Bridge type processors and an NVIDIA Kepler K20 GP-GPU card.  At the time of its installation, the system provided a 3-fold increase in the total theoretical computing capacity of the center.  The cluster has enabled scientific projects that were not feasible with traditional CPU-based resources, and it has supported the research of numerous graduate, undergraduate and even high-school students. Students in the NSF REU Site: Ole Miss Physical Chemistry Summer Research Program (CHE-1460568) also participated in introductory workshops on scientific computing and had access to the high-performance computing (HPC) resources at MCSR for their research.  Three computer science courses from two different Mississippi universities (University of Mississippi and University of Southern Mississippi) utilized the cluster for undergraduate instruction.  Six Ph.D. dissertations and six undergraduate honors theses were completed during the project period that utilized this resource.  The scientific results generated with the cluster have been disseminated in peer reviewed journals as well as regional, national and international professional meetings.  At the end of the award period, MCSR upgraded the cluster with 18 additional compute nodes to extend its useful lifetime and its impact on computational science in the state of Mississippi.
