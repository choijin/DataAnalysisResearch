<AbstractNarration>The Aderidae is a moderately diverse beetle family containing 1,200 species that inhabit all continents except Antarctica and are currently classified into 45 genera.  Aderidae also has a rich fossil record in Baltic, Dominican, Mexican, and Lebanese amber inclusions.  Many species exhibit varying degrees of sexual dimorphism, several inhabit cave systems, and some are social parasites of termites.  This study will be the first to investigate evolutionary relationships within this family using modern molecular systematic methods.  This project specifically emphasizes currently under-utilized morphological imaging methods.   The morphological data from these fossil specimens will be evaluated and included in analyses in order to examine the historical timing of evolutionary events, such as the evolution of sexual dimorphism.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will produce a revised classification for the Aderidae in addition to the discovery and description of extant and fossil species.  The complete integration of data from extant and fossil specimens makes this an exemplar multi-disciplinary study that will investigate the diversification of these beetles within a temporal framework.  Results from this research will be broadly disseminated through presentations at research conferences and local science caf√©s to promote scientific awareness in the community.</AbstractNarration>
