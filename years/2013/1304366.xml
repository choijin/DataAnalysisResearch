<AbstractNarration>Researchers from Lafayette and Luther Colleges, together with their undergraduate students, will investigate southern hemisphere climate change over the last six million years in order to better understand key linkages and feedbacks within the Earth's climate system. This research focuses on a region of the world -- the southern hemisphere -- whose climate history has been largely unexplored previously, but that is known to play a critical role in important climate and oceanic processes related to carbon cycling, deep ocean ventilation, and tropical heat exchange dynamics. Additionally, this project will include a detailed investigation of climate dynamics during an interval in Earth's history when global temperatures were a few degrees warmer than today's and the size of the Greenland ice sheet was much reduced. Thus, this study will provide a clearer understanding of climate conditions during an interval that represents a potential analog for future climate conditions given current patterns of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, the researchers will examine the symmetry of climate evolution between the northern and southern hemispheres and the evolving response of the climate system to changes in climate forcing due to cyclic changes in the position and orientation of the Earth in its orbit relative to the Sun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the scientific questions addressed in this research, this project will also advance the early preparation of future Earth scientists who will have the skills to face both the scientific and societal challenges presented by climate change. Undergraduate student researchers involved with this project will gain hands-on experience in the nature and process of scientific research, direct training in the field of paleoclimatology, critical thinking skills related to scientific research and a deeper introduction to the systems thinking skills that distinguish the Earth scientist's approach to understanding the world. In addition, outreach to local K-12 students and educators by the principle investigators and their research students will further disseminate the results of this work as well as the broader contributions of paleoclimatic research and climate science.</AbstractNarration>

Most previous work during these time intervals has focused on the tropics and the northern hemisphere. By focusing on the southern hemisphere, we sought to complete the picture of the spatial pattern of climate during these previous warm times and document the evolution of climate during and after these climate states. Studying past intervals of climatic warmth provides insights into how the climate system might behave in the future as a consequence of human-induced changes in the greenhouse gas composition of the atmosphere. Studying how different parts of or places in the climate system respond to a known changes in the input of solar energy to Earth?s climate system can shed light on important climate system interactions and feedbacks.   Temperature gradients (contrasts) near the equator are the engines of the climate system controlling atmospheric circulation and the movement of water vapor on the Earth. Our results help show that during the last interval of sustained warmth in Earth history, there was a tight linkage between north-south (equator to mid-latitudes) and east-west (equatorial) ocean surface temperature gradients, such that reduced north-south temperature contrasts resulted in reduced east-west contrasts as well. Our colleagues demonstrated through climate modeling that this linkage should be a persistent feature of the climate system in both warm and cold climate states. In other words, decreases in north-south gradients could potentially induce conditions more like those during modern El Ni&ntilde;o events.  Many of the changes our new datasets reveal in southern hemisphere climate over the past several million years were akin to previously identified climatic changes in the northern hemisphere. Our results show that this is broadly true over both millions of years and on the timescale of cyclic changes in solar radiation caused by Earth position in its orbit relative to the Sun. Additionally, because our datasets help complete the picture of the spatial pattern of climate change on Earth they help provide support for the role of changing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations in causing dramatic changes in climate and ecosystems during the past.    Beyond these climate specific outcomes our new datasets have helped support the work of collaborators who are seeking to understand the robustness of recently developed techniques for measuring ocean temperatures and who are developing new techniques to monitor past changes in carbon dioxide concentration and document the prevalence of wildfires in the past.  The broader societal benefits of this project entail the mentoring and scientific training of five female undergraduate students, most of whom have since chosen careers in science, as well as outreach efforts via public lectures across the country and visits to local elementary schools to improve public understanding of past, present, and future climate change.
