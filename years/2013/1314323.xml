<AbstractNarration>The research objective is to utilize a suite of instruments, including&lt;br/&gt;an airglow imager, to investigate short-period&lt;br/&gt;gravity waves in the Arctic atmosphere over Alaska. Short-period&lt;br/&gt;gravity waves are an important component of the larger atmospheric&lt;br/&gt;circulation as these waves are believed to transport a large amount of&lt;br/&gt;vertical moment flux into the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT)&lt;br/&gt;region. While the propagation nature  and sources of these waves have&lt;br/&gt;been studied extensively at low- and mid-latitudes, little is known about their behavior at high latitudes. Recent efforts have&lt;br/&gt;begun to characterize the waves over the Antarctic continent, while&lt;br/&gt;the project proposed here will focus on the Arctic. Specifically, the&lt;br/&gt;proposed research will establish a long-term winter time series of&lt;br/&gt;short-period gravity waves in the Arctic, including their dominant&lt;br/&gt;source regions, and influences of large-scale tidal and planetary wave&lt;br/&gt;motion. The co-located Rayleigh lidar will provide essential high&lt;br/&gt;vertical resolution temperature measurements to help elucidate the&lt;br/&gt;vertical wave propagation, individual wave contribution to the&lt;br/&gt;Eliassen-Palm (EP) flux, and coupling between the lower and upper&lt;br/&gt;atmosphere during stratospheric warming events.</AbstractNarration>
