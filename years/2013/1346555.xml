<AbstractNarration>The IEEE Security &amp; Privacy Symposium is the premier venue for cybersecurity research, and has been for much of its 30-plus-year history. Student attendance at S&amp;P is an important part of graduate education in cybersecurity. The 2014 Symposium will consist of approximately 40 technical papers, a keynote speaker and a series of work in progress presentations. In addition to the core research papers, the symposium will also feature Systematization of Knowledge papers, which provide valuable background to students who are learning the literature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides travel support to encourage participation in this IEEE Symposium by students who would normally find it difficult to attend. Criteria for selection include evidence of a serious interest in the field, as demonstrated by coursework and/or project experience. Organizers will make particular efforts to encourage participation of women and under-represented minorities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy is the flagship conference for computer security research, attracting approximately 500 industry, government, and academic attendees from across the world.    The Student Travel Support Grants by NSF for the IEEE Security and Privacy Symposium enabled us to support the travel of 19 students: 16 to the IEEE Security and Privacy sympsoium and 3 students for the workshops.  These awards complement generous donations from IEEE, the Army Research Office, and industry donations for travel awards from Google and Facebook.  Participation in symposia like this is an extremely important part of the graduate school experience, providing students the opportunity to interact with more senior researchers and to be exposed to leading edge work in the field. Our goal was to support student and give them opportunities to improve their exposure to security topics and to increase their network of professional contacts. Preference was given to students working in security who  showed evidence of financial need, students from institutions not traditionally represented at the conference, and students from diverse backgrounds. The awards are not intended for authors of accepted papers, but students with accepted papers were also be considered for travel awards. By supporting students who (most likely) would not have been able to attend the symposium otherwise, we focused on increasing the professional development opportunities available to diverse institutions and students from diverse backgrounds who are not traditionally represented at the symposium.
