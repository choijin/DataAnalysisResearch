<AbstractNarration>This program will train U.S. undergraduate students in engineering research through a 2-week study abroad course, a semester of mentoring in experimental design, and a 10-week research immersion at the University of Costa Rica.  Protection of water quality is essential in countries like Costa Rica that rely on ecological resources for ecotourism and agricultural production.  Many wastes, such as food and animal wastes, in Costa Rica can be converted into energy through anaerobic digestion; however, current practices yield wastewater that adversely affects the environment and potentially contaminates food crops.  Using a novel system that includes a solar-assisted anaerobic digester and constructed treatment wetlands, students will research and develop integrated, ecologically-conscious systems for sustainable energy generation and water reclamation in Costa Rica.  Ultimately, the goal of the project is to train 12 students in research, development, and design while increasing the workforce of globally-trained engineers in sustainable biological systems to produce clean energy and water.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Student research will optimize and develop integrated biodigester and wetland treatment systems for sustainable energy generation and water reclamation.  The proposed project will advance knowledge of fundamental processes underlying anaerobic digestion and wetland treatment processes, crucially benefiting the future development of engineered biological systems.  Research activities will focus on a novel system that has the potential to transform engineering approaches to decentralized wastewater treatment and energy generation.  This system integrates solar heating, thermophilic digestion, and four types of constructed wetlands for treatment of combined food and manure wastes.  Students will work with faculty with a variety of expertise, including agricultural engineering, biological engineering, microbiology, and chemistry.  The proposed program will advance discovery while promoting training and learning for the 12 participants as well as the U.S. and Costa Rican students participating in the associated study abroad course, approximately 15 students per year.</AbstractNarration>
