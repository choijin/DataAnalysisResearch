<AbstractNarration>This I-Corps Site, at the University of Utah Center for Medical Innovation, enhances and builds upon their existing expertise in medical device innovation, commercialization and entrepreneurship. The Center for Medical Innovation (CMI) at the University of Utah developed as a collaborative effort between The College of Engineering, The University of Utah Health Sciences Center, The David Eccles School of Business and The Technology and Venture Commercialization Program. Their's is an integrated activity that supports faculty and student professional development, develops multi-disciplinary educational programs in medical device entrepreneurship and has the potential to improve national healthcare delivery through commercialization of student and faculty innovations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The I-Corps Site will help bridge gaps and enhance the translation of University-based Innovations to commercialization. This will allow the University of Utah to expand their innovation programs, provide more impactful resources to faculty and student innovation teams and improve recruitment of prospective and under-represented participants enhancing the diversity of entrepreneurial teams in the I-Corps program and regional commercial sector. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Utah I-Corps Site Grant will enable the University Center for Medical Innovation to facilitate and accelerate the development and commercialization of student and faculty innovations through entrepreneurial education, mentorship and seed grant funding to help bridge the gap between early prototype development and commercialization. These entrepreneurial teams will translate their innovative research ideas through early stage product development into full commercialization resulting in regional economic growth and job creation. This Site's partnership network includes University of Utah programs that support underrepresented student and faculty groups that offer the support and resources needed to help underrepresented groups thrive and participate in the process.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of the I-Corps project are to identify University faculty technology concepts that have a potential to impact patient care through commercialization.  We provide faculty of these promising technologies a small seed grant of $3,000.00, design assistance and entrepreneurial team that will make "go" or "no go" decisions regarding moving forward to commercialization based on the Lean start up concepts.  Teams are provided an experienced industry mentor and a mandatory education in stakeholder and market analysis.  The teams attended mandatory educational training sessions and workshops that focus on customer discovery, customer validation as well as on aligning the technology with market needs.   This year, the training sessions included both educational lecture and hands on training workshop sessions, during which mentors conducted training exercises, aimed at reinforcing lecture material and at responding to problems related to market or technology development/alignment for individual project teams.  * What was accomplished under these goals (you must provide information for at least one of the 4 categories below)?  Major Activities:  We created a 10-session two-hour lecture program on Lean start-up methodologies program to 25 teams.  Specific Objectives:  Identify up to 30 high potential teams to awarded I-Corps seed grants, provide mentorship and education.  Significant Results:  28 grant applications were reviewed by a panel of 6 experienced entrepreneurs. 25 grants awarded and 24 completed the program.  This year, one team participated in the National I-Corps TEAM program and 2 were identified for the 2020-21 National Teams program   We optimized the educational curriculum with by strengthening the workshops on customer discovery/validation and video-taping the program sessions. Availability of on-line materials will free-up the in-person session time for expanding the educational contents by including hands-on workshops that will allow the teams to practice customer discovery and validation, as well as enable iterative development of the interview contents, methods and delivery.    Professional development   The I-Corps program provides essential educational and practical component that allows team to understand the importance of customer discovery and validation as the first step to successful commercialization process.  Business Model Canvas training was provided to teach the complex relationship between the value proposition and various possible customer segments and financial, timeline and startup development implications of selecting different value proposition-customer choices.    * How have the results been disseminated to communities of interest?  Curriculum and outcomes shared on Utah I-Corp website Meeting abstracts and publications NSF I-Corps events Annual reports   Next reporting period goals?  Create a broadly accessible virtual curriculum Increase access to healthcare facility customer discovery Increase participation in SBIR and I-Corps TEAM-grants   Impact on development of the principal discipline(s) of the project?  Increase knowledge of LEAN Start-up approaches to the complex and regulated health sciences sector.  Impact on other disciplines  The program provides critical lessons that are translatable to other sectors, especially highly regulated business sectors.  Impact on development of human resources  Increased staffing with new hires that add capabilities to deliver the I-Corps program.  Impact on physical resources and infrastructure  The implementation of the I-Corps program has contributed to our ability to attract more than $20 million in philanthropic support since we began our I-Corps programs to fund new infrastructure, prototyping development and provide operating funds.    Impact on information resources that form infrastructure  Our Health Sciences Library is an integrated partner in our I-Corps program.    Impact on technology transfer  Our I-Corps program has markedly increased Tech-Transfer in the form of IP generation, start-up formation and licensure.  Changes in approach and reason for change  Optimized the curriculum by strengthening the workshops on customer discovery/validation and video-taping sessions.  Availability of on-line materials frees in-person time for expanding hands-on workshops, allowing teams to practice customer discovery and validation, and iterative development of interview content, methods and delivery.   Delays and actions  This year the end of the program was delayed by the University closure related to COVID-19.  We extended the training through JUL-2020.
