<AbstractNarration>DUE-1303935&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SpaceTEC, as a National Aerospace Resource Center, has created an infrastructure for a nationally-recognized performance-based certification process for aerospace and aviation technicians.  With industry and government support, the knowledge and skill sets are developed on which the certification exams are based.  Professional development is provided for examiners and college faculty.  Two four-day professional development workshops are offered each year, and articulation agreements will be coordinated.  The certifications also provide information to college faculty about the competencies the industry requires of technicians so that the college courses and curricula can be modified.  Heretofore industry has asked for a "supertech" that understands both electrical and mechanical aspects of the position.  At industry request, the certificate examinations are revised to cover less content and to be stackable.  The Center also expands its repository of materials to include NASA education and training materials and names of industry subject matter experts and increases services to veterans and under-employed technicians.  In new certificate programs, offered at ten partner colleges, SpaceTEC addresses key workforce issues by matching educational needs with qualified providers.  Most activities will be moved to fee-based over the period of the grant.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evaluation effort focuses on metrics to assess the impact of the Center certification program and the effectiveness and the use of these metrics to continuously improve programs.   The evaluation tools developed in the core certification program are used to measure the effectiveness of the adaptations to the existing SpaceTEC core curriculum and certification programs to assist veterans and other special needs groups.  Measures of success are the rate of special needs candidates who pass the credentialing exam, the benefits of taking the readiness courses on improving pass rate, and especially job placement rate and success in the workplace.   Pre- and post-surveys are used to measure participant learning in the professional development workshops.  Follow-up surveys with college faculty assess improvements made in existing college courses and labs, with particular attention to their impact on student learning outcomes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Industry driven performance-based certifications provide industry the information needed to make good hiring decisions.  The industry-recognized stackable certificates provide newly educated technicians, veterans and under-employed technicians a pathway to employment.  The feedback on the success of the certificate holders is an efficient mechanism for the Center to influence courses and curricula at community colleges nationwide.  Each partner college adapts its curricula to meet those core standards required in the workplace.  The SpaceTEC certification process and exams measure student learning outcomes.  Feedback is provided to both students and college faculty on individual strengths and weaknesses and also on deficiencies in a particular technology area so that a college can work to strengthen individual aerospace courses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The SpaceTEC National Aerospace Resource Center was originally funded in 2002. SpaceTEC programs provide industry-driven, nationally recognized credentials reflecting competencies employers demand for aerospace technicians seeking employment in the aerospace industry. SpaceTEC examinations are offered through a nationwide consortium of community and technical colleges, universities, business and industry organizations, standards and credentialing bodies, professional societies, and government agencies.  The Center has fulfilled and exceeded its four proposed goals:  - Expand the national repository for aerospace technical education to include industry Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and supporting materials, implementing a system that matches information/assistance requests to relevant experts and data.  - Promote STEM opportunities to increase enrollments/certifications for special needs groups, including returning veterans and unemployed/underemployed technicians regardless of gender or national origin.  - Offer skill-based STEM-related professional development for educators and practitioners with emphasis on assessments, career pathways, and stackable credentials.  - Strengthen/expand the national infrastructure to increase articulation and the availability of performance-based technician credentialing that is fee-bearing and sustainable.  Intellectual Merits:  SpaceTEC provides      the only FAA-recognized national      performance-based certifications available for aerospace technicians in      the United States today.  SpaceTEC and      its partner colleges offer aerospace      curricula for two-year degree programs, workshops,      seminars, and preparation courses for aerospace certifications.    Accepted by all SpaceTEC Consortium partner colleges, SpaceTEC curriculum has become the standard for aerospace technician education.  Partner colleges articulate their programs through the ACE CREDIT Program and via a formal consortium-wide articulation agreement with Embry Riddle Aeronautical University.   Graduates provide the commercial space industry a workforce uniquely qualified to assume jobs being vacated as the existing technical base reaches retirement age.  Job postings from commercial space companies list the SpaceTEC certification as "Preferred Skills and Experience" for technicians seeking commercial space work.  Evaluation by the American Council on Education (ACE) and the National College Credit Recommendation Service (NCCRS) has been completed and processes have been updated to new requirements. All SpaceTEC and CertTEC certifications carry college credit recommendations and this work is necessary and continuous.   A partnership with the ASTM International combines resources and creates programs which better address the ability of industry to source skills necessary for growth.  SpaceTEC screening tools provide an objective survey of knowledge and skills for hiring or promotion.  SpaceTEC-sponsored Space Coast Consortium Apprenticeship Program (SCCAP) offers      apprenticeships in three occupations: Mechatronics, CNC Machining and Composites. SCCAP is led by a consortium      of advanced manufacturers in the Space, Aerospace, Aviation and Defense      industries.

SCCAP primarily focuses on automated      manufacturing processes, including mechatronics, CNC, advanced composites as related to globally competitive Industry 4.0      technologies.    Broader Impacts:   1. Using its National Aerospace Technology      Advisory Committee (NATAC), SpaceTEC validates      and publishes Workplace Practices and Performance Standards.   2. For the technical workforce outside      aerospace, SpaceTEC administers performance-based      certifications and customized Industry Aptitude Surveys (IASs) through CertTEC, its      commercial industry credentialing division.   3.

SpaceTEC's Veterans      Technical Education Connection (VetTEC) works with service members      returning to civilian jobs by leveraging their skills gained in the      military. Veterans can translate military skills to civilian jobs through industry recognized SpaceTEC and CertTEC credentials in aviation      and aerospace.      All Military Credentialing Opportunities Online (COOL) sites (Air Force, Army, Marine, Navy) worked with SpaceTEC Staff to identify military skills that correlate directly to SpaceTEC and CertTEC credentials. All SpaceTEC and CertTEC certifications are approved for reimbursement through the Dept. of Veterans Affairs Montgomery and Post 9/11 GI Bills and are listed on the VA's WEAMS  webpage.
