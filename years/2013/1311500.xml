<AbstractNarration>The molecular mechanisms of ionic/salt regulation in crustaceans have only been characterized for a narrow range of species, mainly crabs with a marine ancestry. Shrimp from coastal ponds and pools represent an opportunity to address this lack of knowledge since they have a decisively freshwater ancestry but have adapted to live in environments with drastically fluctuating salinities. Previous research found that Halocaridina rubra, a shrimp species endemic to Hawaii, has atypical patterns of gene expression following salinity transfer. To examine this in an evolutionary context, the molecular mechanisms of osmoregulation from additional shrimp species from the Ryukyus Islands, Japan will be investigated using high-throughput measures of gene expression (RNA-Seq). These shrimp species represent independent invasions of these habitats (from both freshwater and marine environments) and will further our limited understanding of the evolution of osmoregulation in crustaceans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Overall, this project will illuminate the evolution of osmoregulation, a critical biological process for all living organisms. Undergraduates from underrepresented groups will be trained and mentored during the project. Additionally, this system will be used to engage K-12 students in a variety of biological concepts.</AbstractNarration>
