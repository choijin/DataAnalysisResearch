<AbstractNarration>This project is a unified study of reactions in liquids and gases with the goal of comparing the influence of vibrational excitation on bimolecular reactions in the two settings and of understanding the role played by the surroundings. In gases, bimolecular reactions can be  promoted and controlled using laser pulses to generate a reactive radical, to excite a reactant vibrationally, and to detect the reaction products. The same conceptual approach, using different technology, will be applied in liquids. Gas-phase studies rely on relatively high spectral resolution lasers to prepare and probe individual quantum states of the reactants and products. Because of the frequent encounters in liquids, studies in solution need short time resolution, with the consequence that the spectral resolution of the laser pulses is poorer. Nonetheless, it is possible to excite and probe individual vibrations in liquids by a judicious choice of time and spectral resolution in the excitation and interrogation steps. &lt;br/&gt; This project will use bromine in vibrational-mode selective single collision reactions and compare gas-phase reactions with those in solution. The high time resolution in the solution-phase experiments will allow the direct observation of the evolution of a photolytically generated bromine atom as it forms complexes and reacts with vibrationally excited solvent molecules. Single collision studies of the same reactions in a molecular beam will provide a point of comparison by observing the influence of vibrational excitation without the complication of the surrounding solvent. &lt;br/&gt; The fundamental science in this project will provide valuable experience and skills to graduate students, as well as opportunities designed to integrate research, teaching, and learning at the University of Wisconsin/Madison. The principal investigator will participate in education and policy related activities, and reach out to beginning scientists about the research enterprise.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The goal of this National Science Foundation supported project is to understand the role of different types of energy in reactions and to test theoretical descriptions of chemical reactions. The consequences of such understanding touch on processes ranging from the immediately practical, such as combustion, to the fundamental and long range, such as theoretical descriptions of chemistry and insight into reactions in exotic environments.  Chemical reactions occur only when the potentially reactive molecules contain enough energy to overcome the inherent barriers to breaking and making chemical bonds. The most common example is heating food to accelerate the chemical reactions that occur in cooking. However, the details are more subtle, and a major theme in chemical research is identifying the effects of different forms of energy. It is even possible to use that understanding to control the course of a chemical reaction.  Two forms of energy that play a big role are translational energy, the energy of relative motion of the molecules, and vibrational energy, the energy of the motion of the constituent atoms in a molecule relative to each other. Vibrational energy stretches and compresses a bond, much like a mechanical spring, and this NSF-funded research has shown that it is possible to accelerate the rate of a reaction by depositing energy in a particular bond in a molecule. Even more strikingly, it shows that it is even possible to steer the course of a reaction by preferentially exciting particular vibrations, resulting in selectively breaking one chemical bond over another. This "vibrational-state-controlled" chemistry is one long sought goal in fundamental studies of reactions.  This NSF-supported research previously demonstrated such vibrational state control of chemistry. One of the major outcomes of the current research is the extension of these studies to reactions in solution, rather than in the pristine, low-pressure environments where vibrationally excited molecules react during a single collision. Transferring these studies to solutions required bringing the technology of ultrafast lasers to bear, in order to excite molecules in a time that is shorter that the interval between interactions in solution.
