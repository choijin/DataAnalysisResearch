<AbstractNarration>The interaction of inorganic complexes, e.g., cis-platin, with DNA constitutes a major entry point into modulating the reactivity and molecular biology of this critical biomolecule.  In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism Program, Prof. Karen Brewer will design, prepare and study a group of structurally diverse inorganic complexes which undergo multiple reaction pathways with DNA, using a large array of sensitive methods.  A series of new structural motifs with multifunctional reactivity will be prepared to expand the structural diversity of known molecules and create a large class of supermolecules for which each sub-unit modulates some property or performs some function that leads to molecular machines with very complex functions. Understanding and controlling the role of each sub-unit on the properties and reactivity of these unusual multifunctional molecules will be undertaken, including unusual systems that are excited with low energy red light.  The project will explore the multifaceted reactivity of these systems including thermal binding to DNA, visible light-induced DNA photobinding via new mechanisms, red light activated DNA photocleavage, and a new paradigm for DNA modification, DNA photocondensation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The discovery of new materials which modulate the activity of DNA has many applications in medicine, including the treatment of genetic and infectious diseases.  In addition, the knowledge base assembled by the development of such complex molecules with multiple reaction pathways is applicable in many fields, including the modification and detection of biomolecules, molecular sensing, light and redox activated molecular electronics, conversion of light energy to chemical energy and metal based catalysis.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Efforts supported under this grant have generated new evidence for the promise of mono- and multimetallic complexes in biomedical applications, specifically as light-activated antibacterial and anti-cancer agents.  The work was carried out by three Ph.D. students and a number of undergraduates, resulting in presentations at two national conferences and peer-reviewed articles published in high-impact journals in the field of inorganic chemistry.  The research included preliminary investigation of the biological activities of an azine-bridged Ru(II)&ndash;Pt(II) complex previously developed in the Brewer Laboratory that was found to have unique photophysical properties that make it a particularly promising candidate for the development of enhanced photodynamic therapy agents.  This complex was also shown to have light-dependent antibacterial properties that may offer a new approach to decontamination of surfaces in clinical and hospital environments.  The project further provided the first evidence for light-induced cytotoxicity of two related monometallic polyazine complexes in vivo, in this case against rat malignant glioma cells.  The same was true of two novel Ru(II) complexes appended with anthracene, which were synthesized and characterized for the first time under this grant.  Preliminary work on the subcellular localization of the anthracene-Ru(II) complexes in glioma cells provided important insights into potential mechanisms underlying the cytotoxicity of these and related compounds.  Altogether, this work has taken important steps toward developing next-generation, metal-based agents for a variety of biomedical applications.
