<AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, a new class of high-energy-density, Li- and Mn-rich layered cathode materials has been discovered. The project aims to build the fundamental knowledge base needed to progress towards design and processing of the materials with desired properties through integrated first-principles calculations, CALPHAD modeling, materials processing, and battery assembling and testing. This fundamental knowledge base also builds the genome foundation to discover new cathode materials. The new cathode material resides in a multi-component space of xLi2MnO3Âª(1-x)LiMO2 with M being alloying elements including Mn, Co, and Ni. In the project, first-principles calculations will be used to systematically investigate the effects of these common alloying elements and potential outliers on electronic structures and charge transfers and predict thermodynamic properties of individual phases as a function of temperature and compositions. CALPHAD modeling will be utilized to establish phase relations and optimize the composition space (x and M) for superior charging-discharging performance. To validate the predictions from first-principles calculations and CALPHAD modeling, cathode materials will be synthesized with tailored composition and assemble coin cells to test battery performance. The project objectives are: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.Establish fundamental understanding of effects of alloying elements and search for potential outliers;&lt;br/&gt;2.Develop a thermodynamic description of the Li-Mn-Co-Ni-O system plus potential outliers;&lt;br/&gt;3.Synthesize and characterize cathode materials and test battery performance based on computational modeling and feedback to improve databases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nontechnical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of new materials and the capability of tailoring existing materials to meet new and demanding applications are critical for continued improvements in the quality of human life. Materials are a determining factor in the global competitiveness of the U.S. manufacturing industry as materials account for up to half of the costs of most manufactured products. Li-ion rechargeable batteries are the key constituent for low cost and high-energy-density storages needed for numerous applications such as electronic devices and electric vehicles. The development of novel cathodes is critical because of the limitations of cost and energy density for cathodes used in current rechargeable Li-ion batteries. Recently, a new class of high-energy-density, Li- and Mn-rich layered cathode materials has been discovered. The project aims to build the fundamental knowledge base needed to progress towards design and processing of the materials with desired properties through integrated first-principles calculations, thermodynamic modeling, materials processing, and battery assembling and testing. This fundamental knowledge base also builds the genome foundation to discover new cathode materials.&lt;br/&gt;The proposal's intellectual merit lies on its collaborative, synergistic approaches between theory, computation, and experiments to rapidly build a chemistry-processing-structure-property-performance knowledge base for the Li- and Mn-rich layered cathode materials. This integrated approach will be based on the combined expertise in simulations, syntheses, and evaluation of battery materials. The research project aims to move the low cost and high-energy-density cathode materials research in the US to a new level by further building the foundation to answer fundamental questions that can only be addressed efficiently via combined computational and experimental methodology. These include: what is the best combination of Li/Mn/M layers in terms of cost and performance? what are the composition/temperature variations for their robust processing? and what are the potential outliers of alloying elements for superior performances?&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include following aspects, in addition to economic impact of low-cost and high-energy-density cathode materials on battery manufacturing, a) educate students to be professionals mastering both innovative computational and experimental approaches with cross-disciplinary knowledge of materials and batteries; b) encourage students to make presentations at professional meetings to improve communication skills; c) foster students' writing skills through peer reviewed journal publications; d) participate in activities to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups through the SEEMS (Summer Experience in Earth and Mineral Science) programs for high school students and WISER (Women in Science and Engineering Research) program for first year students, e) contribute to new materials research paradigm in shortening the time for developing new materials and improving existing materials to minimize the cost to the society and the negative impact to the environment, and increasing the competitiveness of US manufacturing.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Lithium (Li) ion rechargeable batteries are the key constituent for high-energy-density storages needed for numerous applications such as electronic devices and electric vehicles. The development of novel cathodes is critical because of the limitations of cost and energy density for cathodes used in current rechargeable Li-ion batteries (LIBs). Recently, a new class of high-energy-density, Li- and Mn-rich layered cathode materials has been discovered. The proposed project aims to build the fundamental knowledge base needed to progress towards design and processing of the materials with desired properties through integrated first-principles calculations, thermodynamic modeling (Drs. Zi-Kui Liu, ShunLi Shang, and Huazhi Fang, see the Liu group photo), materials processing, and battery assembling and testing (Dr. Donghai Wang, Mr. Zhaoxin Yu, and Mr. Adnan Mousharraf, see the Wang group photo). This fundamental knowledge base also builds the genome foundation to discover new battery materials as exemplified below.</p> <p>On a synergistic approach in terms of theory, computation, and experiment, we investigated the effect of 32 alloying elements - mainly the 4d and 5d transition metal elements - on the stability and battery voltage fading of the Li- and Mn-rich layered cathode materials by means of cohesive energy and atomic migration energy, pointing out the most efficient alloying elements being such as Al, Y, Nb, Sc, Ti and Zr. We further synthesized and demonstrated that the Ti-substituted Li[Li<sub>0.26</sub>Mn<sub>0.6-x</sub>Ti<sub>x</sub>Ni<sub>0.07</sub>Co<sub>0.07</sub>]O<sub>2</sub> cathode material possesses improved structural stability and suppressed voltage fading, see the image and details shown in Journal of Materials Chemistry A 2015 (3) 17376, by Yu <em>et al</em>.</p> <p class="TAMainText">Beyond the LIBs, the present project also investigated the Na-ion batteries (NIBs), which have the potential to compete with the widely used LIBs for stationary energy storage applications and could revolutionize the landscape of electrochemical energy storage due to the abundance of sodium precursor and its cost advantage. Na-ion solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) are hence critically needed to address severe safety issue associated with liquid electrolytes used in the current NIBs. However, most of the current Na-ion SSEs suffer from low ionic conductivity (&lt; 1 mS/cm) or poor moisture stability at room temperature. Here, we discovered a new Na-ion SSE, Na<sub>3</sub>P<sub>0.62</sub>As<sub>0.38</sub>S<sub>4</sub>, with an exceptionally high conductivity (1.46 mS cm<sup>-1</sup> at room temperature), enhanced moisture stability, superior electrochemical stability and performance. An integrated approach of first-principles calculations and experiments identifies the vital role of alloying element arsenic: (i) the dual effects of arsenic regulates ionic conductivity, viz., lattice expansion for a high ionic conductivity and a weaker As-S bond for a low conductivity; and (ii) arsenic enhances greatly the moisture stability by shifting the reaction products from the easy forming oxysulfides<em> (e.g., </em>Na<sub>3</sub>POS<sub>3</sub> and Na<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>) to the difficulty forming hydrates (such as Na<sub>3</sub>P<sub>1-x</sub>As<sub>x</sub>S<sub>4</sub>&middot;8H<sub>2</sub>O) due mainly to a weaker As-O affinity compared to that of P-O. The uncovered mechanism could be applied to other Na-ion conductors, opening a new pathway for searching advanced SSEs with high ionic conductivity and promising moisture stability, see the image and details shown in the submitted manuscript to Adv Mater.</p> <p>In addition to scientific findings to discover high-energy-density cathode materials as well as other battery materials such as the Na-ion superionic conductors, we also (a) develop open-source software such as pycalphad for thermodynamic modeling and make them web-accessible, see <a href="http://pycalphad.readthedocs.io/">http://pycalphad.org</a>;
