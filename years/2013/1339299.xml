<AbstractNarration>This grant will fund the participation of early career mathematicians at a conference on Foliation theory in algebraic geometry to be held at the Simons Foundation's Gerald D. Fischbach Auditorium in New York City, September 3rd-7th, 2013.  There will be lectures on recent advances in birational geometry, foliations, hyperbolicity and related subjects.  This conference will give experts a chance to disseminate the many recent advances to young people working in these areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometry is the study of the solutions to a collection of polynomial equations.  This began more than two thousand years ago, with the study of the geometry of conic sections, such as circles. However we still cannot completely answer many simple and fundamental questions, such as find the number of solutions.  We know this number in many special cases, and these cases have interesting applications in engineering and biology.  Foliation theory studies the solutions, or flow lines, to collections of differential equations.  As differential equations model physical phenomena, foliation theory is useful in physics and engineering.  When the collection of differential equations have polynomial coefficients, there is a rich interplay between algebraic geometry and foliation theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In recent years, there has been great progress in higher-dimensional algebraic  geometry.  One of the key methods used is to slice spaces into lower-dimensional layers.  The current project was to support a conference on this topic that would disseminate the newest techniques and results, especially to young participants, to encourage further progress in the field.  This conference took places in New York City during September 3-7, 2013, and involved more than 80 participants, including many postdocs and graduate students, and with several worldwide experts as speakers.  The conference included a problem session in an open format, allowing all participants to share their ideas.  In addition, the conference included a poster session, giving junior participants the opportunity to present their research and to gain feedback from the experts in the field.  The titles, abstracts, video recordings of the talks and problems from the problem session are all available online.  Moreover, there will be a proceedings volume from the conference, to be published by Springer; this will extend the impact of the conference.  The grant was used to support the travel expenses of young participants (mostly graduate students), enabling them to attend.  After the 2013 conference, the remaining funds were used to support travel by graduate students to other conferences in the same area of mathematics, to enable them to keep up with the latest developments in the field.
