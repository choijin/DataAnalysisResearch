<AbstractNarration>This award is to support the Professional Development Program (PDP), run by the Institute for Scientist &amp; Engineer Educators. The PDP trains graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to teach effectively and inclusively as a complement to their research training, and simultaneously seeks to retain undergraduates in the STEM pipeline. The work will facilitate the expansion of the PDP to a nationwide level from its traditional Hawai?i-based roots, allowing teams of 3-4 at any US institution to apply for and participate in the program. This will help address numerous outstanding shortcomings in the astronomy workforce and educational pipeline. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will diversify and improve the astronomy-related workforce at multiple levels of degree/training and experience. The team will (1) develop the teaching, mentoring, and professional skills of graduate students and postdocs in astronomy; (2) develop the teaching, mentoring, and professional skills of current astronomy professionals with a focus on Hawai?i; and (3) advance undergraduates in STEM with a focus on broadening participation. The PDP will have a strong synergy with the Akamai Workforce Initiative, and the two programs will jointly address critical Hawai?ian workforce needs that are highly relevant to the forthcoming Advanced Technology Solar Telescope (ATST) and Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The primary goals of this project were to:   Develop the teaching, mentoring and professional skills of early-career astronomers: graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and astronomers recently hired into professional positions   Advance undergraduate students of all backgrounds, including students who are underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), by disseminating effective retention strategies across the U.S.   Build workforce development capacity at astronomical observatories and astronomy-related industries   These goals serve to broaden participation in the astronomy-related workforce and improve workforce training at several levels, at a time when there is a wave of interest in these objectives (e.g., as demonstrated by the first-ever Inclusive Astronomy workshop in June 2015).  The above goals have been accomplished by expanding the Professional Development Program (PDP) and its overlap with the Akamai Workforce Initiative (AWI) through the development of a mentor training program.

The PDP trains early-career scientists and engineers, primarily graduate students, to teach effectively and inclusively. This training complements their research preparation, bolstering their qualifications for academic or other positions involving teaching and mentoring. PDP participants experience an inquiry activity, learn about research-based strategies for teaching inclusively and for assessing students? progress, and design and teach an inquiry activity within a small team of other PDP participants (usually three participants). They then debrief and report on what they learned through the program, with many participants returning for two or more years of training.  The PDP has many positive documented outcomes, including the fact that over 97% of participants complete this intense program, including the practical teaching experience. The PDP is typically oversubscribed with applicants, indicating the growing demand for training of this kind. The Akamai Workforce Initiative centers on an internship program that places undergraduate students from Hawai?i in summer internship positions at observatory, industry, and academic sites on Maui and Hawai?i Island. The Akamai Internship Program, which has been running since 2003 and has now worked with 356 students and has achieved an 87% retention rate of interns on STEM education and career paths. The program has demonstrated the same rate of retention across demographic groups where there is more commonly a disparity in retention (e.g. Native Hawaiians, community college transfer students). The Akamai program has developed strong mentoring components, which was disseminated through this award. The Akamai preparatory course was replicated 24 times other internships (NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduate programs), and many aspects of Akamai mentoring has been translated into a mentoring workshop. More than 75 mentors were trained through this workshop.  The intellectual merits of this award have included the development and implementation of new training materials and workshops focused on 1) mentoring, with a focus on designing undergraduate research and industry projects much like how curriculum is designed, and 2) other professional skills, including piloting a leadership workshop and project management tools for PDP participants. The broader impacts of the award have included the dissemination of curriculum and strategies proven to increase retention of students of all backgrounds in astronomy related fields, by 1) opening up the PDP to participation from early-career astronomers from across the U.S., which has led to our piloting of ISEE Chapters, and 2) disseminating our "preparatory course" model across the U.S. for preparing undergraduate students for research projects. Through this award, ISEE has trained approximately 75 mentors (primarily based at observatories and industry sites in Hawaii) and will have opened participation in the PDP to ~80 astronomers and other scientists from 8 new sites; these PDP participants have in turn developed 24 short courses and overall impacted ~500 undergraduates. Publications and other products that have come from this work include initial guidelines for organizations that would like to partner with ISEE as Chapter sites (and that will be expanded and formalized through the proposed project as memoranda of understanding), and technical reports on ISEE?s inquiry framework, which can be used to for curriculum development and teaching, ISEE?s process for assessing conceptual understanding in inquiry labs units, and strategies for incorporating equity and inclusion into teaching and mentoring.
