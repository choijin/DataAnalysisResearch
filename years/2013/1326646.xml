<AbstractNarration>This award funds a series of workshops that are designed to mentor young economists.  The overall goal is to broaden participation in economics research by giving junior scholars from under-represented groups feedback on their research in progress and help in developing career plans.  The DITE (Diversity for Tenure in Economics) program matches junior scholars with senior faculty with extensive experience in research.  The junior scholars meet with their mentors each summer to discuss work in progress and receive feedback on their professional development to date and plans for the coming year.  The mentors and mentees also meet at other scientific conferences during the academic year for additional discussions about research progress and research plans.</AbstractNarration>
