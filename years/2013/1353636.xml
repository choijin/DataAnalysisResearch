<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop materials and processes that enable any composite resin system to be produced Out Of Autoclave (OOA) with excellent inner and outer surfaces. To ensure high quality and reliability, aerospace composites are processed inside autoclaves that combine heat and pressure.  The capital and labor costs and manufacturing times associated with autoclave processing are significant but necessary to ensure composite quality.  Achieving high-complexity geometries poses additional hurdles.  Current methods used in these cases include a small selection of OOA pre-impregnated parts, the use of thermoplastic bladders, or the bonding of autoclaved components. A large opportunity exists for OOA technology to reduce material and labor costs while also enabling one piece, seamless composite structures with extremely complex internal &amp; external geometries, allowing manufacturing of parts which were previously unachievable.  The Phase II project will further the development of a self-pressurizing technology that allows OOA processing of any resin system without a loss in quality. The Phase II will expand the operating temperature and pressure window, improve forming processes, and characterize performance on commercially relevant pre-impregnated systems. Phase II results will yield a mature forming process and several tooling grades with verified performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the realization of a manufacturing technology that will enable the composites industry to form more complex geometries and allow greater competition throughout the industry.  Society will see benefits through the broader use of fuel-efficient composites in air and land based vehicles and smaller carbon waste streams.  The use of advanced fiber reinforced composites in aircraft has become a necessity to achieve higher performance and greater fuel efficiencies.  Boeing's 787 and Airbus's A350 are two such aircraft that exemplify the push to increase composite content above 50% by weight.  The proposed technology will impact new aircraft as well as the design and manufacture of other vehicles.  Technologically, this project will lead to a better understanding of self-pressurizing materials and their potential applications, as well as advance domestic manufacturing capabilities.  Finally, undergraduates at the University of Arizona will have an opportunity to work on the project in conjunction with industrial scientists and engineers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ To ensure the best material quality and reliability, aerospace composites are processed inside autoclaves that combine heat and pressure to fully bond multi-layered composites.  The capital costs, labor costs, and manufacturing times associated with autoclave processing are significant but are a necessary evil to ensure composite quality.  A large opportunity exists for Out Of Autoclave (OOA) technology to reduce costs and streamline manufacturing operations while enabling one piece, seamless composite structures with extremely complex internal &amp; external geometries.  This will allow the manufacture of previously "impossible" parts.  This SBIR Phase I &amp; II project developed a new generation of composite tooling (ClaveCore) and manufacturing processes that enable composite materials to be produced without an autoclave. ClaveCore is programmed to self-pressurize when heated at discrete temperatures.  The key results of our program were:  Mandrel forming processes were optimized Raw material costs were reduced by 25% Predictive models for ClaveCore pressurization were developed Demonstrated ClaveCore produces aerospace grade composite materials without an autoclave Demonstrated ClaveCore can produce industry relevant components  Since the use of fiber reinforced polymer composites is used in transportation vehicles to reduce weight, the new ClaveCore technology is expected to help all types of vehicles become more fuel efficient.  Key technical results have been presented at international conference and trade shows.  ClaveCore technology is in varying stages of use or evaluation in the bicycle and aerospace industries.            Last Modified: 11/23/2016       Submitted by: Zachary Wing]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
