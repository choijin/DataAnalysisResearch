<AbstractNarration>The Integrative Computational Education and Research Traineeship(ICERT) REU objectives are to increase the number of STEM majors completing the baccalaureate with a scientific computation emphasis and increase the number of participants entering a graduate program with a scientific computation emphasis. The ICERT attracts a diverse pool of students to careers in computational science and engineering and prepares them to be able to turn discoveries into innovations for societal good. The ICERT REU adopts training practices from the successful NSF Integrated Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) to provide participants with the computational, problem-solving, creativity, and communication skills needed to be future global leaders in transformational science and engineering research. &lt;br/&gt;The project activities include an introductory week-long summer institute on scientific computation, a research project or assignment in an academic department research group, a mentor institute for research group graduate students designated as mentor coaches, applications seminars demonstrating current computational research enabled by the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) cyberinfrastructure, seminars on communicating science, seminars on turning discoveries into innovations that benefit society, mentoring in a triad of faculty/graduate mentor/undergraduate proteìgeì, and a final presentation. &lt;br/&gt;The impact will be increased numbers of students in multiple science and engineering domains prepared to conduct computational research that will lead to discoveries and innovations that stimulate economies and improve the quality of life. &lt;br/&gt;The ICERT will broaden the participation of undergraduate underrepresented populations in multiple computational science and engineering domains.  Graduate students participating in the mentoring triad will gain experience mentoring, teaching and training students from underrepresented populations, preparing them for careers as faculty who can involve underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students in the integration of research and education.</AbstractNarration>

The students participated in an introductory week-long summer institute on scientific computation, extended visualization training, professional development, a research project in an academic department, seminars demonstrating current computational research enabled by TACC, seminars on communicating science, and a final paper and presentation. Paired with UT faculty and TACC research mentors, students received more than 50 hours of training using the world&rsquo;s most comprehensive advanced CyberInfrastructure (CI)I for open science.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Students helped power new discoveries significantly impacting the development of principal disciplines. In geosciences, students used the Stampede supercomputer to decrease data processing time from over 17 hours to 10 minutes; in mechanical engineering, participants helped apply computational techniques to the study of protein aggregation and misfolding which is linked to amyloid diseases (including Alzheimer&rsquo;s, atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid Arthritis); in the social sciences, participants developed a game using a multi-touch screen that is helping a museum teach educational facts from the U.S. constitution; and in astronomy, the design and execution of software modules were used to calibrate an experiment to understand the expansion of the Universe. Additionally, program activities increased students&rsquo; ability to understand and explain the societal impact and implications of research and to communicate the research to multidisciplinary audiences and to lay audiences. Majority of the participants presented a poster at a national conference. &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The ICERT REU increased the number of students completing degrees that lead to scientific research careers that are critical to national interests. Thirty-five percent of ICERT REU alumni are working on completing their first, and in three cases, second bachelor&rsquo;s degree and 22% are pursuing a graduate degree. The majority of students with industry jobs are using computational skills as software developers and engineers.
