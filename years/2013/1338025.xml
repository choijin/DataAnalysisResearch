<AbstractNarration>This NSF award supports the Fourth Oklahoma Workshop on Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), which will take place at Oklahoma State University (OSU), October 26-27, 2013. This workshop will feature several PDEs modeling fluids and geophysical fluids. Among them are the surface quasi-geostrophic (SQG) equation, the Boussinesq equations and the 3D Euler equations with special spatial symmetries. There are very exciting new developments on these PDEs in the last few years and significant progress has been made on many fundamental issues concerning these PDEs such as the global (in time) regularity problem. This workshop, inspired by these recent advances, strives to fulfill four major objectives: 1) to broadly disseminate the most recent advances in the focused research field; 2) to give local (Oklahoma and neighboring states) PDE researchers an opportunity to communicate directly with the leading experts and to expose themselves to the forefront research; 3) to provide a convenient platform for our graduate students, recent Ph.D.'s, women and minorities to present their research results; and 4) to stimulate interactions and interdisciplinary collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PDEs are fundamental tools in understanding many fluid phenomena ranging from small scale blood flows to large-scale geophysical flows. The PDEs featured by this workshop have played important roles in many practical applications such as in the study of frontogenesis, the formation of sharp fronts between hot and cold air. This workshop aims to bring the state-of-the-art research in the focused research field to a broad audience in a timely fashion and to promote interactions and interdisciplinary collaborations between mathematicians and meteorologists including those in the National Weather Center in Norman, Oklahoma. It is hoped that this workshop will help accelerate the incorporation of the present cutting-edge research into the modeling and simulation of sophisticated weather phenomena such as tornadoes.</AbstractNarration>

These workshops brought together leading experts and researchers on the focused PDEs from the United States and several other countries. In addition, more than thirty-three young mathematicians (graduate students and recent Ph.D's) participated in these workshops and sixteen of them were given the opportunities to present their researches. It is worth mentioning that a very high proportion of this workshop participants are from under-represented groups.  During these workshops, senior experts as well as junior researchers presented their state-of-the-art research and involved in active direct communications and discussions. Extensive collaborations have been initiated and these combined efforts are certain to generate new ideas and strategies, which may lead to the resolution of several outstanding open problems on the focused PDES.  These workshops provided excellent opportunities for training and mentoring students and recent Ph.D.'s. Thirty-three junior mathematicians  attended these workshops with many of them given the opportunities to present their researches. They communicated extensively with the leading experts of their fields and built social and collaborative networks with other participants.  The connections and bonds will benefit them throughout the rest of their careers.  These workshops were reported in Oklahoma State University Communications. The publicity of these workshops helps raise the public awareness of mathematical researches in the focused field.           Last Modified: 05/09/2015       Submitted by: Jiahong Wu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
