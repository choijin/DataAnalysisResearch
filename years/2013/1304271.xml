<AbstractNarration>This work will coordinate data collection using standard equipment and protocols at the Alaskan borehole sites and at a selected and comparable number of sites in Russia. The Alaskan and Eurasian borehole temperature data sets will provide the baseline to reconstruct past surface temperatures, to assess the future rates of change in near-surface permafrost temperatures and permafrost boundaries, and to provide spatial data for validation of climate scenario models and temperature reanalysis approaches. This proposal provides the US contribution to the ongoing activities of Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost that obtains temperatures in a large number of globally distributed boreholes in order to provide a ?snapshot? of permafrost temperatures in both time and space. The project continues to provide opportunities for field experience and educational participation at levels ranging from elementary school (e.g., K-12) through postdoctoral internships both in Alaska and in Russia. Our technical manual on methods for permafrost temperature measurements and reporting data provides others with the procedures to conduct independent observations. Data obtained from our TSP project becomes freely available soon after quality assurance is completed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our major outcomes over the period of the projectâ€™s performance are the following.  The maintenance and extension of the ground temperature observations network in North America and Eurasia were continued. Currently the network in North America (Alaska and Northern Canada) includes over 200 observational points located across all of the natural zones in the Arctic and Subarctic regions and throughout continuous to sporadic permafrost. In Russia, the network consists of 201 observational points including 67 surface (&lt;10  m deep), 101 shallow (with depth from 10 to 25 m), 25 intermediate (25 &ndash; 100 m depth) and 1 deep (&gt;100 m) boreholes.

The data of our observations make important contributions to the Arctic Observing System and to Arctic System Science, as it offers a mechanism by which field-based and modeling research, in both climatology and permafrost geophysics, can be synthesized in the context of modeling the Arctic System.  We believe the study we are conducting will help articulate future research directions for representing the role of permafrost and high latitude terrestrial ecosystems in the Global Earth System.  The results of our observations from 2014 to 2019 show substantial increase in the permafrost temperature at all sites within the continuous permafrost zone in the North Slope of Alaska comparable to the highest rate of warming observed in this region, which occurred during 1995&ndash;2000. In the Canadian High Arctic, between 2003 and 2016, a series of anomalously warm summers caused mean thawing indices to be 150&ndash;240% above the 1979&ndash;2000 normal, resulting in up to 90 cm of subsidence over the 12&#8208;year observational period.

At the same time, the convex topography forms in the tundra,  the depth of snow cover is mostly controlled by wind redistribution and does not change significantly from year to year, thus the air temperature dynamic is the prime factor which controls the dynamics of the ground temperature.  In the western part of the permafrost domain in Eurasia (Russian European North and western Siberia) temperatures at 10-m depth have increased by ~0.4&deg;C to 0.7&deg;C decade-1 since the late 1980s at colder permafrost sites and increased less in warmer permafrost.
