<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry and the Instrument Development for Biological Research (IDBR) program in the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI), Professors Martin Fischer, Warren Warren, Robert Opila, Dr.  Jennifer Mass and their groups will develop a novel imaging method for nondestructive identification and high-resolution, three-dimensional mapping of both tissue and a broad range of pigment samples in historic works of art.  The primary focus of the proposed research will be to set up a multimodal nonlinear optical microscope for noninvasive, high-resolution imaging and use pulse shaping and time-resolved detection technology for simultaneous access to absorptive and refractive contrasts and further develop novel analysis and characterization methods for tissue samples and pigments. The groups will then set up three-dimensional (3D) imaging of thick tissue, paint cross-sections and intact historic paintings and further increase imaging depth for molecular absorption and nonlinear phase contrast. The researchers will develop a portable microscope for applications in the field and the core technology developed will then be disseminated through industrial partners.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research, if successful, will enable in situ applications in a conservation setting to avoid having to remove artworks from their climate-controlled environment, which will dramatically impact conservation science by providing a non-invasive imaging modality that can extract comprehensive structural and chemical information from historic artwork, complementing established mapping techniques.  The technology developed will also provide tools to the broad biology community to examine structural, metabolic and functional contrast in biological tissue. The program will provide training opportunities in an interdisciplinary environment spanning conservation science, art history, physics, chemistry, biology, and engineering for graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Many artworks for early 20th century, including Edvard Munch's 1910 edition of the Scream, used cadmium-based paints, which are now decaying.  This is particularly true of Cd yellow, which has been whitening over the past century.  This same pigment has been used by Monet, Matisse, van Gogh, and Picasso.  It initially has a bright sunflower shade, but has faded and whitened with age.     To gain new insights into how and why this is happening, we have extracted a thin sample of Munch's Cd-yellow paint.  We acquired spectroscopic map data, and used a pixel array detector to acquire 4D crystallographic datasets from the sample at high spatial resolution in a scanning transmission electron microscope.  Over the years, the pigment has been studied by bulk methods like x-ray diffraction, x-ray fluorescence, and x-ray near edge spectroscopy, but at the length scales accessible with these techniques, the signals from the other techniques overlap spatially, and the fine details of the structure remained a mystery.     Correlating the data allowed us to characterize the complex decaying paint structure at the nanoscale, with a level of detail we could not have obtained using spectroscopy or crystallography in isolation.  We used x-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy to map the elemental composition of the paint sample.  To narrow the composition further, we used electron energy loss spectroscopy for information about bonding to nearest neighbors.  Since many of the decay products in the pigment are stucturally complex, information about medium range order and crystal structure are necessary to full characterize the material.  To get this information, a pixel array detector was used to map local diffraction patterns with a nanometer probe.  The detector records a full electron diffraction pattern for every probe position in a sample.     X-ray mapping showed that only 30% of the Cd was bonded to S.  Energy dispersive x-ray showed that the major elements present with Cd and S where O and Cl.  Areas where only Cd and S were found correlate to CdS, the original pigment.  Areas with only Cd and Cl correspond to CdCl2, likely biproducts of the original synthesis.  Regions with only Cd and O may be carbonate, oxide or hydroxide.  Regions with Cd, S and O are likely to be CdSO4. Electron energy loss spectroscopy  of the C 1s edge showed the presence of carbonate and hydrocarbon, likely related to the binder.  Electron diffraction showed the presence of CdO and CdCO3.  These grains are comparable in size to the CdS grains, so are likely decomposition products of the original CdS.
