<AbstractNarration>This is a request to support a Chapman conference on "Soil-mediated drivers of coupled biogeochemical and hydrological processes across scales," to be held at Biosphere 2, Oracle, Arizona (the University of Arizona), from October 21-24, 2013. This conference will bring together scientists from soil systems sciences, hydrology, and biogeochemistry to discuss recent findings dealing with the role and importance of coupled hydrological and biogeochemical processes occurring in the soil system and its interfaces with adjacent compartments, such as groundwater, plants, and the atmosphere.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is intended to broaden community involvement in Earth science research and engage young investigators in furthering the development of interdisciplinary Earth science agenda. The conference is open to all scientists interested in the proposed topics. Attention will be paid to attracting early career scientists and Ph.D. students working on topics at the interfaces between the different disciplines, and specifically target underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
