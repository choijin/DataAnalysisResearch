<AbstractNarration>Although ocean margins cover only 5% of the ocean surface, they play a disproportionate role in ocean productivity. Of particular interest is the 14,500 km2 of estuarine wetlands that border the Gulf of Mexico, about 2/3 of which are intertidal salt marshes. Very little is known about the magnitude and fate of organic matter that originates in coastal marshes and enters the coastal ocean. While "outwelling," or flux of organic carbon from land to sea, of significant amounts of organic carbon was hypothesized over 25 years ago, little progress has been made in quantifying this potentially significant source. In this study, researchers at Florida A&amp;M University will continue their research to combine discrete biogeochemical and hydrologic measurements together with modeling to quantify salt marsh derived dissolved organic carbon flux to offshore Gulf of Mexico waters. Results from this study will provide the first quantitative estimates of dissolved organic carbon outwelling fluxes from salt marshes, resulting in a better understanding of the coupled terrestrial and oceanic carbon cycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: As intertidal environments have declined rapidly over the past century due to human pressures, ever-smaller quantities of terrestrial organic matter are available for the formation and export of dissolved organic carbon to the ocean. Results from this research will provide the data to accurately evaluate the importance of these intertidal ecosystems, and help to inform policy on conserving these habitats. In addition, this project will provide a broad range of interdisciplinary learning opportunities for a diversity of students in middle through graduate school. The researchers will collaborate with COSEE-Florida, COSEE-New England, and Watershed-Integrated Sciences Partnership (GK12) programs to conduct outreach to the community.</AbstractNarration>

Even with their significance in the global carbon cycle, it is still not clear whether coastal oceans are net sources or sinks of atmospheric CO2 largely because coastal processes are complex and highly dynamic, with rapid changes and large variations across small distances. Intertidal environments have declined rapidly over the past century because of human pressures (e.g. development, sewage inputs, groundwater withdrawal). As the habitats have changed, ever-smaller quantities of detritus are available for the formation and export of carbon to the ocean. This decline may have already impacted coastal ocean productivity and global biogeochemical cycles. A baseline of carbon outwelling and an assessment of its impact on aquatic food webs is therefore urgently needed to accurately evaluate the current and future goods and services of intertidal ecosystems.  A key, transformative, but often overlooked, variable to understanding the coupled terrestrial and marine carbon cycles lies in the transfer of carbon from land to ocean.  The Gulf of Mexico is a major source of uncertainty in the North American carbon budget, and is characterized by a significant land-ocean boundary, coastal wetlands, shallow estuaries and dynamic carbon exchange across short distances. Of particular interest is the 14,500 km2 of estuarine wetlands that border the Gulf of Mexico, about 2/3 of which are intertidal salt marshes. Very little is known about the magnitude and fate of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) that originates in coastal marshes and enters the coastal ocean.  While "outwelling" of significant amounts of DOC from these wetland systems was hypothesized over 25 years ago, little progress has been made in quantifying this potentially significant flux due the complexity of the tidal creek-marsh system, the dynamic nature of intertidal and freshwater-driven fluxes, and the limitation of terrestrial organic matter tracers.   In 2009 my collaborators and I were awarded funding to combine high spatial and temporal resolution observations with discrete biogeochemical sampling and spatially explicit modeling to quantify this important dissolved organic carbon (DOC) flux for the first time.   The objective of this work was to link hydrology and biogeochemistry effectively to assess the role of saltmarsh DOC outwelling in coastal systems. Specifically, we sought to create a carbon budget for a pristine non-river dominated NE Gulf of Mexico saltwater marsh located Apalachee Bay. Critical to these efforts was to have a better understanding of the sources and fate of the DOC to this dynamic system.  My role in this 2009 collaborative research and the presently funded project was to use natural carbon isotopes to trace and assess how bacterial utilization (assimilation and remineralization) of this outwelled DOC changed as it was transported from the marsh tidal creek waters to offshore.  Interpreting this data and evaluating how it fits in with the overall carbon budget for the site is still underway. However, our review of this data indicates that recently produced terrestrial carbon is supporting bacterial production in the marsh tidal creek. However, as the water moves æoffshoreÆ away from the tidal creek, older marsh generated particulate organic carbon (POC) together with marine derived DOC appears to be preferentially assimilated by the bacteria . It also appears that the tidal creek is outwelling older POC æoffshoreÆ and hence serving as a source of carbon to the coastal system.  These results provide some of the first isotopic tracing data for outwelled carbon from coastal wetlands.  The data from this specific grant, together with that collected from the larger collaborative 2009 grant is needed for paramaterizing global carbon budgets as well as to more accurately assess the impact on of this o...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
