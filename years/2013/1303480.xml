<AbstractNarration>This project engages Ursinus College undergraduates in experimental nuclear structure research. The project is part of an ongoing collaboration with colleagues at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) and Florida State University (FSU). The proposed work will contribute to the understanding of the evolution of shell structure and core polarization in neutron-rich calcium isotopes beyond 48Ca and the collapse of the N = 28 shell in 42Si via inverse-kinematics proton scattering measurements at the NSCL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the project includes maintaining an active research program in nuclear structure on the Ursinus College campus. Ursinus College is a national liberal arts college of about 1700 students with a long history of strength in the sciences. This project will provide students opportunities to apply their knowledge of physics outside the classroom, gain practical skills in data acquisition and analysis, observe and participate in the operation of a nuclear accelerator facility, and present their work to colleagues. The project will span three years and support two students for 8-10 weeks per summer. Participants will travel to the NSCL to perform experiments and analyze the data at Ursinus. They will present their results to the Ursinus community as part of the Ursinus College Summer Fellows Program and to the nuclear physics community at American Physical Society/Division of Nuclear Physics meetings.</AbstractNarration>

Advances in radioactive beam technology have enabled the study of nuclei away from this "valley of stability." This largely uncharted frontier contains the lion's share of the roughly 3000 nuclei that current theoretical models predict to be bound by the nuclear force.

These measurements provide sensitive tests for theoretical nuclear models and thereby deepen our understanding of nuclear structure away from stability.

These measurements were made at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University (NSCL) using the GRETINA gamma-ray tracking array and the NSCL/Ursinus College liquid hydrogen target. This work has contributed to the understanding of the evolution of shell structure in neutron-rich calcium isotopes beyond Ca-48.

The group has also continued the development of UCGretina, a Geant4 simulation code used for the planning and analysis of in-beam gamma-ray measurements made with the GRETINA gamma-ray detector array and the liquid hydrogen target.   Undergraduate participants have gained 8-week, full-time summer research experiences, including work at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University (NSCL), and they have presented their work at meetings of the Division of Nuclear Physics of the American Physical Society.
