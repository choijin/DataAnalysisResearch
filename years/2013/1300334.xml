<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Clay S. Bennett of the Department of Chemistry at Tufts University will examine the development of methods for the stereoselective construction of deoxy-sugar linkages using shelf stable glycosyl donors.  While approaches to deoxy-sugar construction do exist, they frequently rely on the use of temporary directing groups to control selectivity.  This introduces multiple additional steps in their synthesis.  The proposed research will involve developing a set of reagents to activate deoxy-sugar donors in such a fashion that they undergo SN2-like reactions, thereby eliminating the need for directing groups.  Through proper choice of reagent it will be possible to selectively synthesize either diastereomer of a deoxy-sugar starting from the same glycosyl donor.  Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies directed at understanding the mechanism of these reactions will also be undertaken.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research could lead to the creation of a modular set of reagent combinations for the facile construction of stereodefined glycosidic linkages with a broad set of substrates.  By streamlining oligosaccharide construction, this chemistry will eliminate chemical waste arising from multiple solution-phase manipulations of temporary prosthetic groups and difficult purifications of diastereomers.  Thus, it will also provide a more environmentally benign approach to these molecules.  Importantly, the insights gained from mechanistic studies will guide the application of these methods to other classes of monosaccharides.  Successful development of the methodology will impact all areas of activity that requires carbohydrate synthesis, including the pharmaceutical, chemical, agricultural industries, and the biological and chemical research communities.  This project will also provide training for pre-undergraduate through graduate students, including students from groups that are historically underrepresented in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Oligosaccharides have attracted increased attention from scientists because of the roles they play in a host of biological processes.  This includes (but is not limited to) cellular recognition, the immune response, and modulation of protein and natural product bioactivity.  Our understanding of the exact function of oligosaccharides is limited, however, owing to the difficulties involved in the production of pure material.  Chief among these difficulties are the challenges associated with controlling the glycosylation reactions used to link monosaccharides together to form oligosaccharides.  This is because each glycosylation reaction has the possibility of forming one of two stereoisomers (termed the &alpha; and &beta; isomers), which differ in the three dimensional orientation of the newly formed chemical bond.  Since these stereoisomers can possess very different biological properties, it is critical to control the stereochemical outcome of the reaction.  For many classes of sugars, however, it is difficult, if not impossible to control the selectivity in glycosylation reactions using classical approaches.  The research supported by this grant was directed at addressing this issue by developing a new approach to glycosylation reactions in which the glycosylation promoter, a molecule that activates monosaccharides for coupling, controls selectivity.  For these studies, we chose to examine a class of sugars called 2-deoxy-sugars, since they are both an important component of many bioactive natural products, and they are generally considered to be one of the most difficult classes of sugars to synthesize in a stereoselective fashion.      Through the course of these studies, we discovered two new glycosylation reactions for the stereoselective construction of 2-dexoy-sugars.  For the &alpha;-isomers, we found that a combination of oxalyl bromide and cyclopropen-1-thiones can activate hemiacetals to react with another monosaccharide to provide the desired products in good yield and good to excellent selectivity.  Furthermore, we found that the same hemiacetals could be activated with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride and a base to generate an intermediate that reacts with another monosaccharide to provide the &beta;-isomer in excellent yield as a single stereoisomer.  Both reactions are effective with a range of substrates, and changing the three dimensional configuration of one or both coupling partners does not have a deleterious impact on the outcome of the reaction.  This is in stark contrast to conventional glycosylation chemistries, where changing the configuration of one coupling partner can potentially have an extremely negative effect on both the yield and selectivity of the reaction.  These results indicated that our chemistries are proceeding through a reaction mechanism that is different than most traditional glycosylation chemistries. In order to determine the origin of selectivity in these reactions, we used Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to identify potential reaction intermediates.  These studies demonstrated that both promoter systems converted hemiacetals into well-defined intermediates that react through SN2-like pathways to afford products with high level of selectivity.  Importantly, these studies also provided proof-of-principle that it is possible to place the stereochemical outcome of a glycosylation reaction entirely under control of an external promoter.  Due to the straightforward and predictable nature of this chemistry, we anticipate that it will greatly facilitate oligosaccharide synthesis.  We anticipate that the chemistry developed under this grant will be applicable to most classes of monosaccharides.  Thus, the work lays the foundations for chemistries that will significantly simplify oligosaccharide synthesis, which will in turn provide tools desperately needed to identify the roles oligosaccharides play in human well being.  In addition to its impact on organic synthesis and carbohy...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
