<AbstractNarration>Learning patterns from exposure to examples is a basic cognitive process and an important focus of early STEM education. It is because we know many patterns that we can make predictions about new instances: Will a goat bleat? Will it eat tin cans? Children learn about patterns in many different ways and in many different contexts (e.g., at home, in school, in museums). The goal of this project is to understand how different contexts of exposure lead to different forms of pattern learning. For example, children may learn a single pattern really well given a clear task and corrective feedback, but learn only that one pattern. If all a child is asked to do is sort animals into a pile of "bleaters" and "non-bleaters," he or she will get good at distinguishing goats from sheep, but will not learn anything more about animals. In more exploratory contexts (e.g., free-sorting or free-play) children may learn multiple patterns at the same time, but perhaps not learn any one pattern really well. A child may notice lots of things about the various animals encountered at a petting zoo, including "irrelevant patterns" (the goats are mostly brown), but may not notice complex patterns or become adept at using any particular pattern to make predictions (e.g., telling the goats from the sheep). The specific idea motivating this study is a the prediction of a theoretical tradeoff in learning between focus and flexibility. Empirical research explores this tradeoff and the conditions that lead to more or less focused and flexible learning. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central goal of the project is to understand how different contexts dispose children to different kinds of learning. The project combines laboratory experiments with exhibit design in the Madison Children's Museum (MCM). The results will help educators develop complementary experiences, using different learning contexts to achieve different goals. Sometimes we want to teach children to be very focused and efficient at responding to a particular pattern: If they see a whale, they should think "mammal."  Other times we want to provide children with a broad exposure to many different patterns: If asked whether whales are more similar to cows or to sharks, a student should be able to draw on different dimensions of comparison. This project will help educators design instruction that produces both focused and flexible learning. Work at the MCM will contribute directly to design of exhibits. Results will be shared with academic audiences, communities of museum professionals, and with the general public. Communicating research findings with patrons of the museum will help influence the kinds of informal learning opportunities parents provide to their young children. Finally, information about how parents and educators can support pattern learning disseminated through the museum will reach the diverse community served by MCM.</AbstractNarration>

The basic conclusion from the research conducted for this project is that young children tend to adopt learning strategies that are flexible.
