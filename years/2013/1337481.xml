<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemistry Major Research Instrumentation Program, Professor Erich Uffelman from Washington &amp; Lee University and colleagues Alison Bell, Donald Gaylord, Patricia Hobbs and Ronald Fuchs will acquire a fiber optic reflectance spectrometer (FORS). The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as analyses of cultural heritage objects as well as geological studies of weathering and topographical change in the Appalachians.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A reflectance spectrometer measures the radiation of the electromagnetic radiation that is reflected by different materials. The spectrometer can gather data on ultraviolet (UV) light and infrared (IR) radiation in addition to the visible ranges. It is commonly used to study minerals, planetary surfaces and in this case to analyze and screen cultural heritage objects such as paintings, porcelain and other museum-quality artifacts to aid in the preservation efforts. This instrument will be used for research and also in educational activities.</AbstractNarration>

In addition, the University funded a closely related multispectral imaging system that was part of the original NSF proposal. These pieces of equipment were partnered with existing portable and non-portable instruments to enhance W&amp;L?s ability to assist museums and academic institutions with examinations of cultural heritage objects and to train W&amp;L undergraduates, and the undergraduate students and graduate students of many institutions. During the three year grant period, hundreds of students received experience with the instrumentation, and dozens of conservators and faculty were trained in the methodologies as well.

Work at numerous institutions in the US and The Netherlands was pursued. Twenty-eight different museums and academic institutions were served directly by the portable instrumentation, enabling tremendous leverage for the grant money expended. That number does not count academic institutions that were visited for presentations or the use of the instrumentation at two NSF cCWCS Chemistry in Art Workshops which trained nearly 50 US academics in the use of the technology, so that they could return to their home institutions and spread that education among literally thousands of US students.     Cultural heritage objects examined ranged from Frans Hals paintings publicly examined at the Frans Hals Museum in the Netherlands, to 16th century Spanish panel paintings in Germany, to 17th century Spanish paintings in Texas, to medieval Italian paintings in North Carolina, to 17th century Dutch paintings in California.     In public talks and public demonstrations of the instrumentation, US students and the US public could see, in person and in real time, how modern chemical instrumentation can reveal the mysteries and secrets of old master paintings and provide crucial supporting information for the preservation of significant cultural heritage material.     Students trained with the technology are pursuing careers in medicine, chemistry, and the US defense industry. Because the instrumentation is so portable, pursuing the research and instruction all over the US and in Europe fosters and strengthens ties between US institutions and between the US and Europe.
