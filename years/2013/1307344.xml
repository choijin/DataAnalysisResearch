<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry is funding Dr. Junji Iwahara of the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB)-Galveston  to study the roles of the ion-pair dynamics in protein-DNA association. The work is collaborative with Dr. B. Montgomery Pettitt from UTMB-Galveston and Dr. David Gorenstein from UTHSC-Houston.  The team will study the ion-pair dynamics for lysine and arginine side chains interacting with DNA phosphate groups in the HoxD9 homeodomain-DNA complex. The central hypothesis in this research project is that by allowing high mobility of involved atoms, the ion-pair dynamics are entropically important for protein-DNA interactions. The research team will test this hypothesis by using approaches of NMR spectroscopy, biophysical chemistry, organic chemistry, and computational chemistry. Three specific objectives to be pursued are: 1) characterizing the dynamics of intermolecular ion pairs between protein and DNA, 2) delineating motional changes of protein side-chain cations due to ion-pair formation with DNA, and 3) elucidating the mechanism by which oxygen-to-sulfur substitution in DNA phosphate enhances protein-DNA affinity. By providing the atomic-level information on the ion-pair dynamics at the biologically important macromolecular interfaces, this project will substantially deepen our understanding of ion pairs and their roles in protein function.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite the universal importance of ion pairs in chemical and life sciences, dynamic properties of the ion pairs in life processes such as molecular recognition and catalysis are not well understood. This project aims to shed light on this fundamental problem, with a particular focus on ion pairs between protein and DNA. By unraveling the dynamics of these intermolecular ion pairs and their entropic effects on macromolecular association, this project is expected to facilitate the engineering of proteins and/or nucleic acids. The experimental data on the ion-pair dynamics for the relatively small protein-DNA complex will allow the computational chemistry community to validate and improve the molecular dynamics force fields. Moreover, in this project, research activities will be integrated into several educational/outreach activities.  The PI will organize an NMR seminar series and a local NMR workshop for the Gulf Coast Consortium comprising scientists in the Greater Houston area. Results from this project are to be incorporated into an interdisciplinary course being developed by the PI, and outreach to high school students in the area is planned.</AbstractNarration>

Ion pairs are important for proteins and nucleic acids to perform their function in various life processes. However, it is not well understood how the ion pairs actually behave when the biological macromolecules recognize other molecules or catalyze chemical reactions.  In this project, funded by the Chemistry of Life Process Program in the Chemistry Division of the National Science Foundation, the research team studied the ion pairs involved in molecular association of protein and DNA. Using various methods, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, the research team revealed the dynamic nature of the ion pairs.  Although crystallographic structures typically show a single state for each ion pair, the research team found that the ion pairs are dynamic in solution. Their research showed that the ion pairs undergo dynamic transitions between distinct states in which the charged groups are either in direct contact or separated by water. The transitions between these states were found to rapidly occur in a nanosecond (one billionth of second). The research team investigated the dynamic behavior of the ion pairs of the NH3+ groups of protein side chains and the negatively charged phosphate groups of DNA. Direct contacts of these two were found to be energetically more favorable in general, but water molecules occasionally intervene and break the direct interactions on a sub-nanosecond timescale.  The research team investigated how much energy is required for breaking the direct contacts between protein side-chain NH3+ and DNA phosphate groups. This was studied by measuring the dynamics of NH3+ groups at some different temperatures. The results suggest that the breakage requires a relevantly high enthalpy of activation. However, entropic effects substantially reduce the energetic barrier and enhance the dynamic transitions between the direct contact and water-separated states of the ion pairs.  The research team also found that by substitution of oxygen atoms in the DNA phosphate group to sulfur atoms, the ion pairs become significantly more mobile.
