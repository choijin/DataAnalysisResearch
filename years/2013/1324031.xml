<AbstractNarration>This workshop will explore factors common to the mass incarceration of women and the gendered dimensions of immigrant enforcement, detention and deportation. Prior research has examined incarceration and immigration as separate legal and political issues, affecting different communities. This workshop explores similarities and differences across these two issues to assess whether a common set of factors links policies and experiences, and how a gendered lens facilitates such understanding. The workshop will be interdisciplinary, bringing together legal scholars, criminologists and other social scientists, and practitioners to examine existing research and identify new questions. The emphasis will be on the linkages between the social, historical and cultural factors that influence public policy in these areas and on intervention strategies to support women, families and communities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research workshop will result in an edited volume incorporating the theoretical and empirical papers presented, and in a policy-oriented paper.  In addition, the workshop will incubate two or more interdisciplinary collaborative research projects between junior and more established researchers and offer opportunities for collaboration between researchers and community organizations.   A public event will close out the workshop. Legislators, state officials and grassroots leaders will be invited to the public forum.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Institute for Research on Race and Public Policy was funded by NSF to conduct a workshop on women, immigration and mass incarceration.  The workshop was designed to bring together an interdisciplinary group of scholars, policy makers and activists to share their work and develop an analysis of the ways that women are uniquely vulnerable to both the policies that govern the detention and deportation of immigrants and the arrest, prosecution and incarceration of women.  A planning group developed the agenda and 20 people from around the country, including 4 graduate students participated in the 2 and a half day meeting.   The discussion at the workshop focused on impacts specific to women in the areas of the laws and the historical patterns of exclusion, legal processes and policy formation, and community and cultural dynamics.  Presentations addressed both the theoretical issues that help explain the impact on women as well as the practical opportunities for change.  A highlight of the workshop was that the discussion moved beyond simply comparing how immigration and incarceration affects women to discussions of how the ideological and political underpinnings of state policies that influence both phenomena are linked.  In addition, the discussion revealed the importance of exploring other dynamics related to institutional racism, gender inequality, economic insecurity and urbanization and how they align with policy that negatively affects women who are vulnerable in their communities and in society.   That is, beyond merely exploring causes or rates of incarceration and deportation the workshop focuses on broader variables that create and maintain vulnerability to harsh punishment and legal processes of displacement.  The result of the workshop included the draft of a set of policy recommendations, several conference presentations, new research collaborations among the members, mentoring of graduate students who were in attendance and a plan for an edited volume.  The workshop met the overall goal of building of a cohort of scholars, policy makers and activists who understand the links between these important legal and legislative processes and establishing a foundation upon which those who are working to reverse the negative social consequences of them can be built.
