<AbstractNarration>This action funds Elizabeth Sneller of The University of Pennsylvania to conduct a research project in the Social, Behavioral and Economics sciences area during the summer of 2013 at The University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand.  The project title is "The PROICE is ROIGHT:  A Longitudinal Acoustic Analysis of New Zealand English Vowel Shift." The host scientist is Dr. Beth Hume. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses automatic vowel extraction to analyze the trajectory of vowels in New Zealand English throughout the time spanned by the Origins of New Zealand English (ONZE) corpus held at the University of Canterbury. According to Labov's (1961) Apparent Time theory, this corpus provides the opportunity to study over a century of sound change in New Zealand. This project provides a timeline and visual representation of the acoustic changes in vowel subsystems over time. It also provides an analysis of vowel shift as affected by social factors such as race, gender, and socio-economic status, with the overarching goal of providing quantitative evidence to test theories of the social motivation of sound change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, the goals of this project include educating the public about the mechanism of sound change as well as the field of Linguistics through the medium of an interactive website which will allow visitors to actually see and hear how vowels have changed throughout the course of New Zealand English.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For this project, I adapted a computer program to automatically extract vowel measurements for a database of New Zealand English speech. This database contains speech from speakers that were born between 1851 and 1987, so gathering measurements for their vowels allows us to see exactly how vowels have changed in New Zealand English over the course of 136 years.   The outcome of this project was a dataset of normalized vowel measurements for every speaker in the Origins of New Zealand English corpus, which was given to the New Zealand Institute for Language, Brain and Behaviour so that future researchers can also have access to the normalized measurements.  The major goal of this project was to collect a dataset of measurements that would allow researchers to analyze the trajectory of vowel change in New Zealand English. This is important for two main reasons:  1. This dataset allows researchers to test theories about language change as it has actually happened in New Zealand English.   2. It also allows researchers to compare the ways that world dialects of English have changed over time.   The results of number 1 are important, because before large-scale automatic vowel measurement, researchers only knew the outcomes of a change but not the step-by-step process that causes a vowel to shift in a particular way.  The results of number 2 are important because these answers begin to bear on the question of what types of change are more predictable.      The broader impact of this project includes educating non-linguists about what micro-linguistic change is and how it causes languages to change drastically and systematically over time. I'm interested in questions like "How did Latin change so that it became French, Spanish, and Italian?" Instead of studying the microchanges that resulted in these Romance languages, however, I'm using data from different dialects of English to study how microchanges in these dialects accumulate and might eventually lead to mutually unintelligible languages.
