<AbstractNarration>Heterotrophic bacteria account for about half of the respiration in the oceans and they are the main consumers of dissolved organic materials, converting approximately 80% of assimilated organic carbon to carbon dioxide. Detailed examinations of the structure of microbial communities reveal that a highly diverse community of microorganisms must be responsible for the conversion of organic materials in the oceans. Recent studies suggest that most of growth-related activity is associated with a rather small number of abundant bacteria in the oceans. It is unclear, however, if the same observation applies to respiration, the dominant fate of organic carbon in the oceans. We currently lack tools for assessing respiration by specific microbes and for linking specific taxa with their contribution to carbon conversion and to carbon cycling. The aim of this project is to develop a tool for understanding the contribution of bacterial groups to bacterial respiration. The proposed work will determine the relationship between transcription levels of oxidative phosphorylation genes and respiration rates in cultivated marine bacteria. The culture-based work is a necessary prerequisite to develop a metatranscriptomic tool for addressing ecological questions about the role of bacterial diversity in ocean carbon cycling.  The project will include chemostat and batch culture studies with pure cultures and an incubation experiment with a naturally community of estuarine bacteria. Laboratory experiments will examine important heterotrophic bacteria in the oceans such as Pelagibacter ubique of the SAR11 clade and Ruegeria pomeroyi of the Roseobacter clade. Existing genome sequences will be analyzed to address the phylogenetic resolving power of respiration genes. The overarching goal of this proposal is to determine the relationship between abundances of respiration gene transcripts and respiration rates for bacterial taxa defined at different phylogenetic distances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will involve an undergraduate in a summer research project. Laboratory tours are open to the public (about 1000 visitors per year), and all laboratories at the Lewes campus are involved in Coast Day, an annual open house that attracts about 10,000 visitors. The results of these studies will also be submitted to Limnology and Oceanography E-Lectures (www.aslo.org/lectures). This electronic journal provides a platform to make results of this project available to the wider academic community, including undergraduate teaching institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intelectual Merit    Diverse heterotrophic bacteria drive biogeochemical cycling in the ocean.  The most abundant types of marine bacteria are oligotrophs with small, streamlined genomes. The metabolic controls that regulate the response of abundant oligotrophic bacteria to environmental conditions remain unclear.  Our work revealed that low transcriptional control is one feature of a successful adaptive strategy of marine oligotrophic bacteria.  Although responses of bacteria to environmental conditions are commonly regulated at the level of transcription, gene expression in the most abundant bacteria in the ocean appears to be regulated by mechanisms other than transcriptional control.  This work obtained an unexpected result that advaced knowledge of the ecology of bacteria in the ocean.  Bacteria respond to environmental stimuli using transcriptional control, but this does not appear to be the case for marine bacteria such as Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique, a cultivated representative of the SAR11 clade, the most abundant organism in the ocean.  This bacterium has a small, streamlined genome and other genetic characteristics suggesting that transcriptional control is low in Pelagibacter and limits its response to environmental conditions.  This research examined strains of bacteria that are closely related to the most abundant types of bacteria in the ocean.  The results revealed that only 0.1% of protein-encoding genes appear to be under transcriptional control in Pelagibacter and in another oligotroph (SAR92) whereas &gt;10% of genes were under transcriptional control in the copiotrophs Polaribacter MED152 and Ruegeria pomeroyi.  The essence of the experimental results can be summed up as follows.  When growth changed transcript levels remained steady in Pelagibacter and SAR92 but shifted in MED152 and Ruegeria.  These observations suggest that low transcriptional control contributes to the adaptive strategy of Pelagibacter and possibly other oligotrophic microbes, which dominate microbial communities in the oceans.   Broader Impacts   This project supported a research scientist and provided samples and data for a M.S. student who successfully defended their M.S. thesis and published the outcomes of their work in a peer reviewed publication in 2016.
