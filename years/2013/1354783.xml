<AbstractNarration>Biological processes play an important but under-appreciated role in shaping the land.  Indeed, in some places, plants and animals are the most important factors controlling variation in topography and thus patterns of habitats and hydrology on the land surface.  This work explores the role of biology in shaping the land surface in Big Cypress National Preserve (BICY), a complex and beautiful mosaic of cypress wetlands, pine uplands and deep water sloughs in southwest Florida.  BICY is a karst landscape, where limestone bedrock is present at the land surface.  While the landscape is almost perfectly flat, small wetland depressions carved into the limestone rock are crucially important for storing water and thus providing habitat for a wide array of plants and animals.  The origin of these wetland depressions is unknown.  This research will determine if these depressions, and their remarkably regular spacing on the landscape, are created by biological processes that naturally occur in wetlands that accelerate the rate at which limestone dissolves.  This creates the tantalizing possibility that the organisms populating these wetlands are slowly creating their own habitat by initiating and expanding topographic depressions.  The research team consists of scientists across a variety of disciplines, including hydrologists, geologists, biologists and modelers, creating the type of collaborative integration required to answer these types of research questions. Combining satellite and airborne data with detailed field measurements will allow the team to address how and how fast these depressions form, what that means for regional water flow and water quality, and how the topography and resulting patterns of habitats on the land surface were created.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work contributes to an understanding of how ecological and geological processes work together to shape the land surface.  The central idea that patterns on the earth's surface arise spontaneously from interactions between plants and animals, on one hand, and rocks and water on the other, is a reminder of the strong and sometimes surprising links that exist in ecosystems.  In this case, wetland ecosystems are thought to change the shape of the land over thousands of years by dissolving rock.  This type of insight will contribute to understanding the origins of this landscape, which supports a remarkable array of organisms and habitats.  It will also improve understanding of hydrologic characteristics, and the impact of water movements on the greater South Florida system, including important elements of the Everglades.  Moreover, this work will help predict how ecosystem and biological processes may change as this very low altitude landscape is altered by sea-level rise.  Finally, the impacts of this work extend beyond south Florida because the project will contribute to an understanding of how karst landscapes form (20% of the earth's land surface) and how small geographically-isolated wetlands interact with their surroundings, a topic relevant to federal wetland protections.  A partnership with scientists within the National Park Service has been established to help communicate the results of the work, and the researchers will lead tours that allow the public to appreciate the subtleties of this captivating landscape.  The student participants will be exposed to a wide variety of disciplines and approaches, which is integral to training to address the complex questions and challenges society faces.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The shape of the land surface is a complex interaction between water, rocks and life.  The particular role of microbes, plants and animals is an important and often overlooking aspect of the processes that create landform.  This is particularly true in karst landscapes, where soluble rocks (calcium carbonate or limestone) are incrementally dissolved by slightly acidic water.  While rain water in naturally slightly acidic because of carbon dioxide in the air, the biological carbon cycle can greatly enhance this acidity, focusing the dissolution of rock in "hot spots" of organic matter processing.  This focused dissolution affects the flowpaths of water, bringing more water to areas where the rock has been dissolved, and creating a feedback loop that results in some of the most extraordinary features of karst landscapes.   Our goal with this research was to understand this feedback between water, rocks and life in the Big Cypress National Preserve, a large and important, but critically understudied, part of the South Florida system.  The landscape of the Big Cypress is a mosaic of pine uplands with exposed carbonate rocks and small wetlands (called cypress domes) where the rocks have been dissolved away.  These wetlands are arranged into a remarkably regular pattern: they are roughly the same size, and are evenly spaced across the extremely flat landscapes typical of the region.  The cypress domes are hot spots for plant productivity and organic matter storage, and they hold water for most of the year.  In contrast, the pinelands have nearly no organic matter storage, and are rarely inundated.  Our hypothesis for this work was that the cypress domes have altered the landform, creating local depressions via the action of plants of microbes, and that this process was started at the start of the Holocene when sea level stabilized at near modern levels.  We call this hypothesis the "ecological drill" to highlight that the origins of this landform are ecosystem processes.  To test this hypothesis, we carefully evaluated the existing landscape patterns to look for signals of the underlying processes.  Based on those analyses, we measured a suite of ecosystem functions, including hydrology, water chemistry, plant production, and the fluxes of gases that result from organic matter cycling (CO2 and CH4).  We also used new techniques for age-dating and landscape mass balance to explore the time-scales of the pattern origin.  Finally, we synthesized these measurements into computer models at different spatial scales to try to understand the origins of the wetland basins, their age and growth rates, and the emergence of regular landscape pattern.  Our work analysing high resolution topographic maps clearly shows that the cypress domes exhibit regular spatial patterning that is virtually impossible to explain without strong interactions at different scales. We show that wetlands hold water, and thereby greatly enhance organic matter cycling, and that the consequence of this process is to focus carbonate rock dissolution wherever water is stored.  Moreover, we show that as weltands get deeper, they limit their own growth, which likely explains why the depressions are all roughly the same size.  We also show that competition for water among adjacent basins may ultimately limit their radial expansion.  We show that vegetation patterns are strongly controlled by elevation (and thus hydrology), which is a critical element of the ecological drill process.  Perhaps most importantly, we demonstrate using several lines of evidence (landscape mass balance, carbon dating) that this basin forming process is young, having started over the time scales that we predicted.  Among the many outcomes of this work, we also developed new tools for understanding water flow within and through complex low-gradient landscapes; these tools are broadly applicable to a wide array of "wetlandscapes" around the world.  They show, for example, that the wetland depressions in Big Cypress are connected (and thus exporting dissolved rock) nearly 35% of the time, that the dynamics of an individual wetland can readily predict the behavior of the entire landscape, and that the chemistry of the water is a robust and informative measure of how connected a wetland is.    The Big Cypress preserve is a critical link in the entire South Florida system, and the current focus of renewed restoration attention as part of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.  The origins of the landform that give rise to the complex ecological mosaic is important information for establishing restoration benchmarks, and our group has been part of that dialog.  Moreover, the narrative that the plants and animals and microbes of the system have been creating their own habitat over the last 7000 years has been engaging for both the scientific community and general public in south Florida.  This project resulted in a new course (Biogeomorphology) that explores interactions between ecosystems and landform, and has supported a large number of graduate students working on questions in earth and ecosystem science in interdisciplinary teams.
