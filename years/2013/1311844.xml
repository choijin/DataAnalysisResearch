<AbstractNarration>The PI plans to investigate aspects of the interaction of topology and geometry in 2 and 3 dimensions, focusing in particular on the relations between topological and geometric complexity. A primary feature in this investigation is a certain localization of complexity that occurs in maps of surfaces, and has deep relations to the theory of 3-manifolds and their hyperbolic structure, as well as to the geometry of the Teichmuller and moduli space of conformal structures on a surface. The structure of the complex of curves on a surface plays a role in all these settings, which the PI plans to continue investigating and refining. Particular goals include genus-independent versions of existing theorems on the complex of curves, or versions where genus dependence is explicit; quantitative control of Thurston's skinning map; and better understanding of other settings where gluing maps determine the structure of hyperbolic 3-manifolds. Particular attention will be paid to the compressible-boundary case. In Teichmuller theory, the PI will investigate the behavior of Weil-Petersson geodesic flow and its relation to combinatorial invariants arising from the complex of curves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Geometry and topology play a fundamental role in mathematics. Geometric spaces arise in many settings, either as explicit objects we visualize directly, or via abstractions such as configuration spaces of systems or parameter spaces. The topology of a space is the way it is combinatorially put together without regard to geometry, but often these topological descriptions suffice to determine the geometry uniquely. This phenomenon is called rigidity and plays a central role. In low dimensions there is a confluence of many different aspects of mathematics which interact with rigidity, including analysis, complex analysis and dynamics. Moreover, the visualizability and accessibility of the low-dimensional setting brings many subtle phenomena into focus and serves as a testing ground for new mathematical ideas. Within this setting we propose to investigate a number of quantitative aspects of rigidity, particularly ways in which complexity in the topological description translates to features of the geometry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project contributed to the study of three-dimensional manifolds, with particular attention to their geometric structures and the ways in which these structures deform. A manifold is a mathematical (topological) space which is composed of patches from regular space of a fixed dimension, much as one would sew together fabric to make a surface. In three dimensions, the structure of manifolds is particularly rich: There is enough room in 3 dimensions for intricate patterns to arise, and for connections to several interesting geometries and their symmetry patterns. On the other hand a crucial role is played by surfaces, which are themselves tightly connected to the analysis of complex numbers. The work of Thurston in the 1970s and 1980s reorganized the study of 3-manifolds around the notions of geometry and symmetry, and particularly hyperbolic geometry, a non-Euclidean variant of geometry dating back to Gauss, Bolyai and Lobachevski. It turns out that "most" 3-manifolds admit hyperbolic structures, that is they can be pasted together from hyperbolic polyhedra. When these polyhedra have finite volume the structure is unique, by Mostow's rigidity theorem, but when the volume is infinite there is a large deformation space of possible shapes, and its boundary has an intricate fractal structure. In this project we used techniques from hyperbolic geometry, combinatorial topology of surfaces, and complex analysis to study this deformation space and its boundary. We obtained some results that constrain the possible deformations, and which tame to some extent some of the wild boundary behavior at certain points (technically, we proved that the boundary is "locally connected" at those points). In another subproject we studied a more combinatorial decomposition of certain 3-manifolds (those admitting a fibration by surfaces) known as a veering triangulation, and made explicit some connections between the structure of these triangulations and the hyperbolic structure on these manifolds. The "low-dimensional" setting of this project renders it particularly amenable to geometric thinking and visual analogy, but it also places it at a nexus of a number of mathematical fields: not just topology, but analysis, dynamics (the study of flows and other time-evolutions), and group theory. The exploration of these phenomena therefore provide understanding, analogy and motivation for a number of other fields of mathematics.  The visual nature of work in low dimensions lends itself also to educational efforts, and in view of this the award was also used to support a public lecture series at Yale for local families and school-age children. Topology and geometry played a major (but not exclusive) role in these lectures and contributed to Yale's outreach efforts bringing mathematics and science to the local community.
