<AbstractNarration>This project supports funding for students to participate in the International Green Computing Conference (IGCC), to be held in Arlington, VA, in June 2013. Green computing is a rapidly establishing interdisciplinary research area spanning across the fields of computer science and engineering, electrical engineering and other engineering disciplines. Green computing or sustainable computing is the study and practice of using computing resources efficiently, which in turn can impact a spectrum of economic, ecological, and social objectives. IGCC has established itself as the premier conference in this area. The conference will enable researchers and students to the study and practice of using computing resources efficiently, which in turn can impact a spectrum of economic, ecological, and social objectives. This grant will provide travel grants to 10 students who may otherwise not be able to attend IGCC and take advantage of the available learning opportunities in the newly evolving research area of green computing.</AbstractNarration>

The final versions of the papers appeared in the IGCC Conference Proceedings and the authors had opportunities to present their work at the conference.  The program committee members and external reviewers worked hard to select the best submissions for presentation at the conference. Each paper was reviewed by at least four reviewers.  In addition to these papers, the program chairs and program committee actively sought speakers who could address important areas that had not been fully represented in past instantiations of IGCC.  The IGCC 2013 program was rounded by two outstanding keynote speeches by H.J. Siegel (Colorado State University) and Krishna Kant (George Mason University).  The NSF travel funds were used to support 10 students from 7 universities to attend the conference.  Each student received a $1,000 travel stipend.  Overall, the travel grant program was highly successful, providing opportunities for several students to attend the conference.  The students participated in the Student Forum Workshop and presented their research work in the area of sustainable computing.  The students had many opportunities to interact with senior researchers in the green computing area and enjoyed networking occasions with fellow student researchers.
