<AbstractNarration>The research is about the bottom-up development of advanced lubricant coatings that are inspired by natural lubricating systems.  Specifically, the project will develop new poly(ionic liquid) coatings and investigate their rolling and sliding frictional properties in contact with a swelling ionic liquid solvent.  This system offers charged, comb-like polymer chains within a bound/mobile medium, much like natural lubricants, and a liquid with tailorable viscosity and swelling properties to fine tune the tribological performance.  The approach of the research will be to employ surface-initiated ring opening metathesis polymerization to grow the lubricant coatings from both planar silicon (oxide) surfaces and silica microparticles.  This method enables rapid polymer growth and the ability to tailor the ionic liquid side chain length, composition, and counter ion to investigate molecular-scale effects on the lubricating performance of the coatings.  The most promising lubrication systems, based on sliding results, will be employed for the rolling lubrication of silica microspheres confined in both microchannels and hemispherical polymeric cavities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will lead to new types of lubricated systems improving sliding and rolling lubrication systems.  This will lead to greatly reduced friction and wear in microfabricated systems.  Outreach will include the development of case studies from this research that will impact undergraduate classes, undergraduate research, and a week-long specialty course for gifted eight graders through the Vanderbilt Summer Academy.   Students will learn to assemble coatings, measure their surface and tribological properties and connect these properties to basic intermolecular interactions.  The research will also create a better understanding in high school by allowing a local high school teacher to participate in this research through a Research Experience for Teachers program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Introduction.  Through a complex cocktail of components, nature is able to achieve coefficients of friction that are more than an order of magnitude lower than commonly studied materials systems. Synovial fluid contains hyaluronic acid as a carbohydrate polymer that increases the viscosity of the fluid and is believed to become physically entrapped by a lubricin protein as a boundary layer on the articular cartilage to create a highly lubricating bound/mobile type system for the combined rolling and sliding motion of many joints. There is a tremendous need for new coatings and lubrication systems that are modeled after these highly effective natural systems to enable environmentally adaptive materials.  While synovial fluid functions through a highly complex mechanism and its actual use in non-biological applications would be ultra-expensive, materials systems that mimic the function and composition of synovial fluid could provide performance that approaches and even surpasses nature?s benchmark.  This project has designed and prepared new classes poly(ionic liquid) (pIL) thin films and coatings with versatile compositions for tunability of film properties and precise control over thickness.  These nature-mimicking films have covalently tethered dimethylimidazolium side chains and are compatible with various anions that can be exchanged into the film to discretely adjust properties.  Major impacts resulting from the project are described below.     Intellectual Merit.    A)  Anion-Dependent Properties of p[NB-1-dMIm] Films: Anionic Chameleons.  Dynamic, anion-adaptive pIL thin films (100 &ndash; 700 nm) can be grown by surface-initiated ring opening metathesis polymerization (SiROMP) from novel norbornene monomers containing dimethylimidazolium side chains with PF6 counter anions. The counter anions are easily exchanged from the film by exposure to an aqueous solution containing any of several smaller anions, as well as large anionic dyes (Figure 1), to tailor film mechanical, optical, and transport properties.  In fact, the resistance of the film against ion transfer varies by a factor of 2,000 depending on the selection of anion. The lower ion transfer resistances correlate with more rapid dissociation of the polycation-anion pair.  In addition, varying the anion from perchlorate to bistriflate results in a 1.7x increase in the film storage modulus and a 2.4x increase in film viscosity.  This work illustrates that anion selection can dramatically alter the properties&mdash;surface wettability, ion conductance, and mechanical properties&mdash;of pIL thin films.  B)  Co-pIL Films by Anion Exchange. We have demonstrated the ability to prepare a new type of environmentally adaptive co-poly(ionic liquid) thin film where the copolymer attributes are imparted by two or more anions that are exchanged into the film simultaneously. These films enable a continuous tunability of film properties with much simpler control than typical copolymerization approaches. These co-pIL films exhibit resistances against ion transfer and wettabilities that strongly depend on the ratio of ions in the film, and effectively bridge the gap between the homopolymer films of each anion. Our work demonstrates that the film properties are controlled over wide ranges by the anionic composition of the environment, indicating the excellent sensing capabilities of these films.  C)  Vapor-Phase SI-ROMP of Polydicyclopentadiene.  We have developed a new vapor-phase approach for the rapid growth of poly(dicyclopentadiene) (pDCPD) thin films with thicknesses controlled between 50 - 400 nm These films are smooth (roughness &lt; 12 nm), defect-free, and highly cross-linked to demonstrate remarkable stiffness (reduced Young?s modulus of 15 GPa).  As pDCPD serves many applications for its toughness and strength, including vehicle panels, the ability to make nanoscale thin films out of pDCPD in an environmentally green manner opens up new possibilities for protecting fragile surfaces or materials via an invisible nanoscale shield.  D)  IL-Loaded Polydicyclopentadiene (pDCPD) Coatings as Ionogels.  These pDCPD films can be loaded with ILs to produce thin film ionogels that improve ion conductance by 10,000x and reduce frictional coefficients of the initially dry pDCPD film by 50%.  Our novel approach to prepare these ionogels extends their functionality to robust, covalently bound surface coatings.  Films of pDCPD, grown from the vapor phase as describe above, are exposed to dilute solutions of the IL in good pDCPD-swelling solvents to distribute the IL throughout the highly cross-linked polymer network.  The kinetics of this process reveal a nucleation mechanism, with the IL swelling the pDCPD film by 25-40% based on thickness change.  We have verified that the process is compatible with multiple IL species but few solvents.  Broader Impacts.  Aside from the scientific activities, this project has provided cutting-edge examples for the PI?s courses on fluid mechanics and molecular engineering, trained seven undergraduate research students in the area of surface engineering, provided a week-long course on nanotechnology to gifted rising eighth graders through the Vanderbilt Summer Academy, provided easy classroom experiments in the area of energy for K-12 teachers, and provided Ph.D. training for an African-American student who has now earned his Ph.D.            Last Modified: 11/13/2017       Submitted by: G.
