<AbstractNarration>This project will create a Theoretical and Computational Astrophysics Network with major nodes at the California Institute of Technology, Syracuse University, Cornell University, and the University of Washington to advance the theory of merging compact-object binaries and stellar collapse. Gravitational waves from these types of events are expected to be detected by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory in coming years. The network team's goals are to develop the theoretical and computational tools needed to extract the equation of state of dense nuclear matter from gravitational wave and electromagnetic observations, and to determine the impact of compact-object mergers on the synthesis of light and heavy elements. The team will combine its expertise in numerical relativity, nuclear astrophysics, and gravitational wave detection to (1) develop an open-source, next-generation relativistic astrophysics computation framework; (2) improve the theoretical understanding of the nuclear equation of state and compute a large ensemble of equations of state for different temperatures and compositions; (3) improve the computational treatment of nuclear reactions in merger and collapse simulations; and (4) develop parameter estimation techniques to extract information on the equation of state from multi-messenger observations. The network will contribute to scientific workforce development through the involvement of graduate students and postdocs, who will receive cross-disciplinary training in modeling, microphysics, and multi-messenger observations. Outreach videos with visualizations and interviews with project scientists will be disseminated via YouTube to enhance public understanding.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Our work aims at understanding some of the most energetic explosions in the universe. These explosions produce and expell the elements of life into the interstellar medium and they regulate the formation of new stars and stellar systems.      Since ancient times people have had a great interest in the heavens and, in particular, into stellar explosions. Finally explaining these explosions will have significant cultural impact, since a long standing riddle will have been solved. This may be possible via multimessenger observations (neutrinos, gravitational waves, and electromagnetic waves), and comparison with our models, from the next nearby corecollapse supernova. Our work is directed towards being able to understand the supernova and kilonova based on its gravitational wave, neutrino, and electromagnetic signals.           Understanding these explosions are key to understanding the elements essential for life as we know it. The carbon and oxygen in our bodies were formed in the nuclear fusion in stars, and ejected into the universe by supernova. The precious metals gold and platinum are uniquitous in our lives. They are used in applications ranging from jewelry to industrial catalysts. But scientists currently do not know where the gold and platinum in the universe comes from. Supernova do not appear to produce enough gold to explain its abundance in the universe. These precious metals could be formed in neutron star mergers: two city-size atomic nuclei bound by gravity colliding at one third the speed of light. The results of this award go directly to the heart of this question by providing the theoretical tools needed to understand the origin of the heavy elements (known as r-process elements).      After LIGO's stunning detection of gravitational waves from binary black holes reported in February 2016, the next discovery to look forward to is the detection of signals from systems containing either two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole. Combining LIGO's gravitational-wave observations with observations of other messengers from the same event photons across the electromagnetic spectrum and neutrinos will revolutionize our understanding of the physics and astrophysics of these sources. The techinqies developed in this award will allow us to understand the origin of the elements that we see around us.          In addition to the scientific publications described here, this award provided training to two graduate students and two postdoctoral scholars.
