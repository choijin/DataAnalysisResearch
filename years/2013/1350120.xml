<AbstractNarration>An award has been made to Everett Community College to organize a program of self assessment for life science departments as part of the mission of the Partnership for Undergraduate Life Science Education (PULSE). In September 2012 the PULSE partners (HHMI, NIH, and NSF) appointed 40 Vision and Change Leadership Fellows to stimulate transformative changes in undergraduate life science education as recommended in the Vision and Change report. Fellows were selected from two-year colleges, liberal arts colleges, comprehensive universities and research universities. The Fellows have organized into working groups with the overarching goal of helping departments transform their programs in a national effort to increase student learning of core concepts, increase student retention in the sciences, and prepare all students to be more curious and scientifically literate citizens. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current award is to begin testing a comprehensive set of rubrics developed by the Taking the Pulse Working Group.  The Vision and Change report contained a number of recommendations for improving undergraduate life sciences education but did not furnish an implementation strategy.  The rubrics that have been developed will serve as a blueprint for departments to evaluate their own progress in adopting recommendations in the areas of curriculum development, faculty support, student engagement and inclusivity, assessment, infrastructure, and the campus climate for change.  The working group also plans to pilot a certification program to both motivate departments to adopt Vision and Change recommendations and to reward departments that have enacted Vision and Change principles.  The initial draft set of rubrics has been posted on the www.pulsecommunity.org website under the provisional title: Taking the PULSE Vision and Change Rubrics 1.0 and rubrics will be updated as more departments field-test them at all institution types.  Results from the Taking the PULSE project will be posted on the PULSE website and shared with the life sciences community at professional meetings.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being funded jointly by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate of Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to support Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>As the practice of science and challenges facing society have changed over the last several decades, the need to educate and encourage a diverse generation of scientists with innovative perspectives to problem solving and generation of new knowledge has become more urgent. The AAAS recommendations for transforming undergraduate life sciences education, documented in its 2011 report, <em>Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action</em>, highlighted strategies to achieve this goal. In this project, the Partnership for Undergraduate Life Sciences Education (PULSE) created and tested instruments to help departments assess their implementation of the <em>Vision and Change</em> recommendations (the PULSE Vision &amp; Change Rubrics), and developed a program (PULSE Recognition Program) to recognize institutional progress independent of institution type.</p> <p>The original PULSE Vision &amp; Change Rubrics (PULSE VCR) version 1.0 were published in 2013 and assessed 66 criteria across five areas: Curriculum Alignment, Assessment, Faculty Practice/Faculty Support, Infrastructure, and Climate for Change. An initial study indicated that liberal arts institutions were farther along in implementing the recommendations than other institution types. Also, overall scoring was found to be equitable among institution types. Generally, departments earned the highest scores on the Curriculum Alignment rubric and the lowest scores on the Assessment rubric (Brancaccio-Taras <em>et al. </em>2017).</p> <p>After Exploratory Factor Analysis, the original Infrastructure and Climate for Change rubrics were re-clustered to provide higher Cronbach?s alpha. Also, wording was clarified for all rubrics resulting in PULSE VCR version 2.0, with 65 criteria. Additionally, a shorter diagnostic Snapshot rubric was created for use at regional workshops and professional meetings (www.pulsecommunity.org). Four of the five long rubrics have broad applicability and can be used to evaluate departmental transformation by other science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.&nbsp; The<em> </em>PULSE VCR are evaluative tools applicable to all institution types which allow departments to reflect on their work of assessing student mastery of disciplinary knowledge and competencies, and also include the evaluation of teaching and learning, encompassing pedagogy, student metacognition, programmatic success, and faculty engagement and development.</p> <p>The PULSE VCR form the basis of the Recognition Program.&nbsp; More than 70 life sciences departments applied to the pilot Recognition Program, and eight were selected based on initial evidence of transformed and innovative educational practices, including Gaston College, Whatcom Community College, Davidson College, Stony Brook University, Georgia Southern University, the University of Wyoming, and Morgan State University. These programs represented two-year colleges, liberal-arts institutions, regional comprehensive colleges, research universities, and one minority-serving institution. Five levels of achievement were defined as PULSE Pilot Progression Levels. Of the eight departments, one achieved ?PULSE Progression Level III: Accomplished?. Six departments achieved ?PULSE Progression Level II: Developing? and one pilot department achieved ?PULSE Progression Level I: Beginning?. All schools have made significant movement towards the recommendations of <em>Vision and Change</em> relative to a traditional life sciences curriculum.&nbsp;</p> <p>Originally, rubric data were collected via Qualtrics surveys.&nbsp; Presently, a Drupal 8.0 Rubric Portal (<a href="https://pulserubrics.org/">https://pulserubrics.org/</a>) is used to collect consensus data from departments during or after Regional Workshops, Ambassador Workshops, and Recognition visits. Data have been collected for the full-length rubrics from 2013 and from the Snapshot Rubric since 2015.&nbsp; More than 250 schools have completed the Snapshot and/or one or more full-length rubric. &nbsp;Several schools have completed rubrics at multiple time-points, generating a longitudinal database to document transformation of life sciences education nation-wide.</p> <p>Organizational change in higher education is a multi-faceted process requiring many change elements to enable deep and complex transformation. Institutions of higher learning are complex systems with multiple leverage points to be acted upon to effect change. Even when change strategies are initiated, the literature suggests that institutional change takes five to ten years to occur.</p> <p>The PULSE Recognition Program uses a systems approach and addresses transformation by engaging departments in a process of self and peer evaluation, and provides assistance for departmental change. Prior to this effort there was no tangible methodology for life sciences departments to compare pedagogical practices and student learning relative to peer or regional institutions. The PULSE Recognition Program both promotes institutional change and recognizes achievement of change. Long-term monitoring of departmental transformation is a key component of this research. Project results elucidate factors of successful institutional transformation and help dissemination and propagation of reform efforts in undergraduate STEM education</p> <p>The Recognition Program is one aspect of PULSE.&nbsp; Other efforts include Regional and Ambassador Workshops. Via multiple PULSE engagements, departmental faculty learn to work as a cohesive team, adopting self-reflective, evidence-based practices for continuous program improvement. Life Sciences Departments are responsible for educating students for future life sciences careers. Research documents that changes in education are sustainable only if departmental faculty collaborate to design the programs. And thus, these changes can ultimately be expected to improve student outcomes, and cultivate development of a new generation of scientists who reflect the diversity of American society.&nbsp;<br /> <br /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/30/2018<br>      Modified by: Pamela&nbsp;A&nbsp;Pape-Lindstrom</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1350120/1350120_10279915_1543617899981_RecognitionWebsite#1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1350120/1350120_10279915_1543617899981_RecognitionWebsite#1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Recognition Website #1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1350120/1350120_10279915_1543617899981_RecognitionWebsite#1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Recognition Website #1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Image of information available on PULSE Recognition website.</div> <div class="imageCredit">screen capture</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Pamela&nbsp;A&nbsp;Pape-Lindstrom</div> <div class="imageTitle">Recognition Website #1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1350120/1350120_10279915_1543617997760_RecognitionWebsite#2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1350120/1350120_10279915_1543617997760_RecognitionWebsite#2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Recognition Website #2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1350120/1350120_10279915_1543617997760_RecognitionWebsite#2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Recognition Website #2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Image of information available on PULSE Recognition website</div> <div class="imageCredit">screen capture</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Pamela&nbsp;A&nbsp;Pape-Lindstrom</div> <div class="imageTitle">Recognition Website #2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1350120/1350120_10279915_1543618388550_DrupalPortal--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1350120/1350120_10279915_1543618388550_DrupalPortal--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Rubric Data Collection Portal"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1350120/1350120_10279915_1543618388550_DrupalPortal--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Rubric Data Collection Portal"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Image of the rubric data collection portal created in Drupal 8.0.</div> <div class="imageCredit">screen capture</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Pamela&nbsp;A&nbsp;Pape-Lindstrom</div> <div class="imageTitle">Rubric Data Collection Portal</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
