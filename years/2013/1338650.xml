<AbstractNarration>This is an application for travel funds to support 12 U.S. participants (four research mathematicians and eight doctoral students) at the conference {\it Mostowski 100} to be held at the Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics and Mechanics of the University of Warsaw, Poland, October 11-13th, 2013. The conference is organized with financial  support of the European Mathematical Society and Warsaw Center of Mathematics and Computer Science, Clay Mathematics Institute, and is endorsed by the Polish Mathematical Society.  The present application is not intended to provide any funding for the conference itself, only for funding for travel. There are several scientific themes of the conference, each represented by leading specialists. Professor Mostowski  made contributions to several areas of Mathematical Logic.  His most important work was in Set Theory, and the selection of topics reflects that.  Some of Mostowski's ideas have found their application in Foundations Computer Science. The program of the conference will include a lecture  and a tutorial on some recent  and rather unexpected developments in this area. Many can benefit from participation in the conference. In case this application is successful,  the opportunity to apply for travel grants will be advertised at the conference website, in the  Association for Symbolic Logic newsletter, and on popular logic-related websites. Travel grant applications will be reviewed by a committee set up and chaired by  Sergei Artemov of the Graduate Center  of City University of New York.  There are several faculty and graduate students at CUNY who are interested in going to the conference, but the committee will make every effort to make sure that the selection process is fair and open to everyone, with particular attention paid to applicants from underrepresented groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the conference: In the sciences generally, disciplines and workers become increasingly specialized with the progression of generations.  This has certainly been the case with mathematical logic and foundational studies.  While this is not surprising, it is unfortunate for those whose concern is the foundations of mathematics itself.  A broad, informed, and unified outlook is important.  In 2013 there is a unique opportunity to have a conference aimed at bringing together and affecting researchers across the various sub-disciplines of foundational studies, encouraging interaction.  This year is the 100th anniversary of the birth of Andrzej Mostowski.  It will not be a commemoration meeting, but rather the organizers plan to use Mostowski  and his ideas  as a central organizing device, that will allow them to bring together researchers in all the basic areas of foundational studies. The expectation is that the speakers will present not only the panorama of results directly stemming from Professor Mostowski's research, but also proposals for research directions, unsolved problems, and possibilities for new applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference website is at http://mostowski100.mimuw.edu.pl/doku.php</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We applied for, and received, a grant to enable mathematicians from the United States to attend the Mostowski 100 conference.  The grant was used to fund travel for seven mathematicians and logicians.  one graduate student and one postdoc.  The Mostowski 100 conference took advantage of the 100th birthday of Andrzej Mostowski to bring together researchers in all the basic areas of foundational studies, with the expectation that this would generate proposals for foundational research directions, unsolved problems, and possibilities for new applications, which would be cross-disciplinary.  The conference achieved this intention, with the participation of distinguished and upcoming scholars and researchers from throughout the world.  Basic themes included set theory&mdash;in particular, descriptive set theory&mdash;mathematical incompleteness phenomena, generalized quantifiers, and model theory, which are interrelated and which have impact on mathematical research beyond their immediate specific scopes.  In addition to presentations of surveys and new results, new researchers had ample opportunity to interact with senior people in their fields and related areas.  The consequences will be visible for many years to come.  The funds were also used to support twleve CUNY Ph.D. students in mathematics who traveled to major conferences in the United States and abroad and participated in professional workshops. The conferences and workshops included: Building Bridges: 2nd EU/US Summer School and  Workshop on Automorphic Forms and Related Topics, June 2014, University of Bristol, England, the 2014 Joint Mathematics Meetings, Baltimore, MD, January 2014, Introductory Workshop: Algebraic Topology, January 2014, Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, and WhatÆs Next? the mathematical legacy of Bill Thurston, June 2014, Cornell University.
