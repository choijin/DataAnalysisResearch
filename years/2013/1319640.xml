<AbstractNarration>The goal of the proposal is to study efficient mixed finite element methods for the computation of transport maps in optimal transportation problems. The focus is on problems in which the cost of transport is a quadratic function of the distance. They lead to Monge-Ampere equations. The first part of the project consists in clarifying the applicability of finite element type methods to weak solutions of the equation. The key approach here is approximation by smooth functions. In the second part, techniques of mixed finite element analysis are adapted to the approximation of smooth solutions of the equation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Optimal transportation has a growing application in various fields ranging from theoretical ones such as geometry and analysis to applied fields such as biology, pattern recognition, image processing, fluid mechanics, geophysics, meteorology, optics, oceanography and cosmology. This has created the critical need for efficient and robust numerical methods backed up theoretically to solve optimal transportation problems. The efficient and reliable methods developed from this project could be used to solve optimal transportation problems which appear in many other applications e.g. weather forecasting, traffic congestion, economics, mesh equidistribution, texture mapping, etc. The proposal studies the Monge-Ampere equation of optimal transportation with the goal of clarifying theoretically the use of the efficient mixed finite element methods. It advances knowledge towards the resolution of some open problems in analysis and geometry involving Monge-Ampere type equations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Optimal transportation problems appear in many applications e.g. weather forecasting, traffic congestion, economics, mesh equidistribution, texture mapping.  In the project I laid out a mathematical theory for the use of standard discretizations for the relevant nonlinear equation of Monge-Ampere type. The correct resolution of the discrete nonlinear equation in that setting was addressed.   Tools were also developed to address the theoretical background for other approaches to the resolution of the Monge-Ampere equation.   My fundamental work on finite element methods with D. Arnold on finite element differential forms on cubical meshes has been featured in the periodic table of finite elements. These results are now being included in textbooks on finite elements.  I also obtained efficient methods for the computation of stresses arising in a body under an external force.       Two graduate students received training as part of the project. The results of this investigation were disseminated through participation in seminars, conferences, publications and a dedicated website. The project enhanced the participation of under-represented groups. One of my students is a hispanic and two of the major results obtained as part of the project were with two African-Americans post docs. These results are critical for the resolution of the Monge-Ampere equation mentioned above for real life applications.
