<AbstractNarration>The investigator proposes to develop novel computational schemes for the study of flows of viscoelastic liquids in three spatial dimensions. A new formulation that transforms the constitutive equation for viscoelastic stress into a conservative form is proposed. This new formulation is amenable to the use of a state-of-the-art adaptive mesh refinement method on octree finite-volume meshes. The goal of this proposal is to develop discretization and solution algorithms that are designed to not only maintain the higher order accuracy, but also guarantee that the discrete set of algebraic equations possess particular characteristics that are contained in the differential form of the constitutive equations. Different constitutive models for viscoelastic liquids are incorporated into the computational framework, allowing the investigation of the effects of constitutive laws on improved fitting to the experimental measurements, especially in flows which contain stress singularities. Parallelized algorithms combined with adaptive mesh refinement and GPU optimization are expected to significantly improve the efficiency of the direct simulations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The numerical methodologies constructed in this proposed research, while focusing on addressing two-phase viscoelastic flows, will be broadly-useful in simulating and investigating a number of different complex flow applications such as polymer processing, biological flows in microfluidic devices, and emulsion flows in polymer blending. In nano/microscale geometries, flows of two immiscible liquids are often dominated by surface tension. Moreover, the interface of two liquids may undergo large deformation rates as it moves in networks of nano/microchannels. While the surface tension force discretization proposed in this work overcomes the former, the improvements proposed for discretizing the viscoelastic constitutive equations allow practical direct simulation of viscoelastic flows with strong elasticity.</AbstractNarration>

Viscoelastic liquids, e.g. polymeric liquids, are of special importance due to their presence in a broad variety of applications, such as in the food, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries, as well as in materials science. The interaction of fluid/fluid interfaces with solid boundaries is of fundamental importance with applications ranging from coating and tear films on the cornea to micro-layer formation in wall boiling and CO2 sequestration.   Interfacial instability of ferrofluid films  We study magnetically induced interfacial instability of a thin ferrofluid film subjected to applied uniform and  non-uniform magnetic fields. Numerical simulations show the patterning formation that is resulted by the subtle competition between the uniform applied field and the van der Waals induced interaction with the solid substrate or between the non-uniform applied magnetic field and the surface tension force. In the former, the results suggest a new route for generating self-assembled ferrofluid droplets from a thin film [1], while the latter results demonstrate the destabilization of the ferrofluid interface and the formation of a jet that extracts magnetic material [2], a process relevant to heavy-metal removal from contaminated water.

Instabilities of thin viscoelastic films       We numerically study thin viscoelastic films on a solid substrate subject to the van der Waals interactions. We investigate the interface instabilities in wetting/dewetting processes. The governing equations are obtained as the lubrication approximation of the Navier-Stokes equations, with a Maxwell or Jeffreys model for viscoelasticity. We show the emerging length scales due to the instability of a viscoelastic film at dewetting stage, that to date have not been reported in the literature and that are completely absent for Newtonian films.
