<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The PI requests support to analyze sediments from multi-cores and mega-cores previously collected from beneath the former Larsen B and Larsen A ice shelves. These unique cores will allow the PI to develop a time-integrated understanding of the benthic response to ice shelf collapse off the East Antarctic Peninsula over time periods as short as 5 years following ice shelf collapse up to &gt;170 years after collapse. High latitudes are responding to climate change more rapidly than the rest of the planet and the disappearance of ice shelves are a key manifestation of climate warming. The PI will investigate the newly created benthic environments and associated ecosystems that have resulted from the re-initiation of fresh planktonic material to the sediment-water interface. This proposal will use a new geochemical technique, based on naturally occurring 14C that can be used to assess the distribution and inventory of recently produced organic carbon accumulating in the sediments beneath the former Larsen A and B ice shelves. The PI will couple 14C measurements with 210Pb analyses to assess turnover times for sedimentary labile organic matter. By comparing the distributions and inventories of labile organic matter as well as the bioturbation intensities among different locations as a function of time following ice shelf collapse/retreat, the nature and timing of the benthic response to ice shelf collapse can be assessed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This study will provide important information characterizing changes occurring on the seafloor after the collapse of ice shelves. This research will support the research project of a graduate student. This project brings together researchers from both the European community and the LARISSA Project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The US National Science Foundation Project, entitled "Using Radiochemical Data from Collapsed Ice Shelf Sediments to Understand the Nature and Timing of the Benthic Response to High-Latitude Climate Change", examined sediment cores from off of the East Antarctic Peninsula that were collected from areas beneath collapsed or retreated ice shelves (i.e., Larsen A, B, and C Ice Shelves).  The research quantitatively documented the transition of sediments from the time of the overlying ice shelf (when the sediments were a biological desert with no light penetrating through the ice) to the time of collapsed or retreated ice shelf deposition (when the sediments receive an enhanced flux of fresh planktonic organic matter and are transformed into a biological oasis).  The increase in the fresh planktonic flux (known as labile organic carbon) to the seabed is the result of light penetration into the nutrient-rich water column and enhanced photosynthesis following the collapse/retreat of the ice shelf.  Our project documented the increase in the amount of planktonic material accumulating in the seabed since the time of ice shelf collapse, contrasting seabed inventories of this energy-rich organic matter (base of the benthic food web) in sediments deposited 5 and 9 years after ice shelf collapse in one portion of the study (Larsen B) and as long as 170 years since ice shelf collapse in another portion of the study (Larsen A).  Based on our data, we conclude that planktonic organic matter progressively accumulates in the seabed as a function of time after ice shelf collapse/retreat, creating a "food bank" such that bottom dwelling animals can survive the austral winter, when there is very little to no photosynthetic activity occurring in the surface waters (because of reduced light and extensive sea-ice coverage).  We have found that as bottom dwelling fauna and microbes process seabed sediments, they strip the energy-rich functional groups off of the labile organic matter, making the sediment less bioavailable and metabolized more slowly.  This study has documented the impact of high-latitude climate change (some of the biggest climate changes occurring in the world) on benthic ecosystems beneath collapsed or retreated ice shelves.  Our hope is that as we document and understand how the environment and the associated ecosystems respond to Global Climate Change, society will appreciate the urgency in responding to Climate Change challenges and predictions made by scientists.
