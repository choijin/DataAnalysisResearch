<AbstractNarration>Objective:  The objective of this program is to significantly advance the technology of the measurement of simultaneously spatially and temporally complex, ultrafast-varying light. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:  The intellectual merit is the development of two powerful single-shot devices to measure such light.  It will also involve the use of these devices to measure important, currently immeasurable light pulses, significantly advancing important fields in science and technology. One device will measure the complete temporal intensity and phase of an arbitrary light pulse and be used to measure the most complex light pulses ever deliberately generated.  Another will, for the first time, measure the complete spatio-temporal intensity and phase of a single arbitrary light ultrafast pulse, specifically, an "ultrafast lighthouse" and also a "light bullet."  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:  The broader impacts follow from the fact that the vast majority of the greatest scientific discoveries of all time have resulted directly from improved methods for measuring light.  Unfortunately, most light is currently immeasurable because it involves simultaneous complex variations in space and ultrafast variations in time.  As a result, these new devices, which significantly extend and transform humankind?s capability in this realm, should find application in a wide range of fields, far beyond those in this project.  For example, light scattered from tissue is too complex in space and too fast in time to measure using currently available methods but, if measurable, could in principle be used eventually for powerful new medical diagnostics using techniques like those being developed in this project.</AbstractNarration>

One device measured the complete temporal intensity and phase of extremely complex light pulses in time. Another measured the complete spatiotemporal intensity and phase of arbitrary light pulses with few-femtosecond temporal resolution and submicron spatial resolution.  And a third device measured the complete spatiotemporal intensity and phase of an arbitrary light pulse on a single shot.  All are very simple to build and use, and none require any assumptions about the pulse to be measured.  Much of the effort on the project was expended on developing and optimizing these devices. They were used to measure some exciting and challenging&mdash;and previously immeasurable&mdash;light pulses. First considered was the single-shot spatiotemporal measurement of high-intensity pulses with spatiotemporal distortions, both deliberately induced and the result of complex nonlinear-propagation effects. A single-shot device (whose acronym is STRIPED FISH) was built and is in use at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories measuring pulses from their powerful Titan laser.  Next a pulse with an interesting and important spatiotemporal distortion&mdash;called the ultrafast lighthouse effect&mdash;was generated and then measured using STRIPED FISH.  STRIPED FISH was also used to measure multi-spatial-mode pulses from optical fiber, showing that the modes travel with different velocities and dispersions (broadenings).   Software to plot movies of the complex results of these measurements was also developed, allowing the viewer to watch the pulse propagate in space and time.  This was critical in displaying the measurement of the ultrafast lighthouse effect. In addition, it is very important to better understand current techniques? ability to deal with optical complexity of a different sort:  trains of pulses with unstable pulse shapes. Such pulse trains represent the most difficult task in the entire field of light measurement because devices generally average over many (millions of) potentially different pulses and can only yield one result, which is only relevant when each pulse is identical.  Shockingly, this project found that, when faced with such complexity, all modern interferometric techniques significantly under-estimate the pulse length and complexity of such pulses.  Only the FROG technique succeeds in providing the correct pulse length.  FROG also provides an indication of the presence of instability. This project also studied a very common type of such instability:  unstable multiple pulsing, which is the result of pumping a laser too hard.  And it found that these interferometric techniques also simply do not see additional pulses.  FROG, on the other hand, does.  These results are simultaneously important and disturbing because shorter pulses are usually more desirable, and many laser developers and laser companies continue to use these unreliable interferometric techniques.  Even when these methods yield the correct pulse length (and instability is not present), there is no indication of whether the pulse train is stable or not, so the measurement is not convincing. Finally, it is important to note that the techniques developed for this project are very simple and easy to use.   Broader Impact:   The vast majority of the greatest scientific discoveries of all time have resulted directly from improved methods for the measurement of light. And it is in fact complex light in space and time that arises in most fields.  As a result, these devices should find application in a wide range of fields, far beyond those in which they were used in this project.  In this project, they were shown to be very useful for measuring light from high-intensity pulsed lasers; light with spatiotemporal distortions; and complex light in fiber-optics.  But all the techniques are widely applicable.  For example, many fields use ultrashort laser pulses, from surgery to telecommunications to basic research.  Results from this project on light-pulse measurement techniques? ability to measure unstable trains of pulses is important, so that these applications perform correctly.  For example, an ultrafast laser exhibiting unstable double-pulsing (and unknown to the surgeon) used for cataract surgery could do harm to a patient.  As a result, a proper measurement technique used to perform diagnostics on the laser will help to prevent injuries during such surgeries.  Ultrafast laser material processing is also common, and yields are not usually as high as one would like; better and simpler diagnostics like those developed for this project are important.   Outreach activities at a local grade school were undertaken, and a local high school class was invited to the research lab. Finally, in conjunction with this project, development of a new educational tool of complete, colorful, and elegant Power Point lectures continued.  Four courses are now available (with one translated into Chinese, French, and Spanish), and results from this project have enhanced them further. Local high-school teachers in the Atlanta area use them, and universities all around the world do as well.       Last Modified: 06/25/2017       Submitted by: Rick P Trebino]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
