<AbstractNarration>Program Director's Recommendation &lt;br/&gt;Center for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi) &lt;br/&gt;Proposal #1332047, 1332007, 1331997, 1331989 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks funding for the Center for Excellence in Logistics and Distribution (CELDi) located at Virginia Tech, Clemson University, the University of California-Berkeley, and the University of Arkansas. Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 11-570. The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Physical Internet (PI) is envisioned as a transformative, open, global, intermodal logistics system that utilizes standard, modular, reusable containers, real-time identification, and routing through shared logistics facilities. In the proposed research, the PIs focus on two aspects of operations: (1) algorithms for container-level processes so as to build loads in the PI and handle these loads at intermodal interfaces; and (2) algorithms for system-level processes so as to route, schedule and coordinate loads that flow through the PI. CELDi is in a unique position to advance the PI for a sustainable logistics future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the proposed research include the potential to dramatically increase the efficiency of freight transportation systems. Direct benefits to member organizations include access to the algorithms and operational insights developed as part of this research. Other direct benefits are likely to result as data from member organizations are used to test the algorithms through insights into their data and potential operational improvements. Member organizations will have early access to the results of the research. Indirect benefits include enhancing the reputation and attractiveness of CELDi as an organization, which is likely to lead to better retention and recruitment of CELDi members.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Theme  The Physical Internet (PI) is envisioned as a transformative, open, global, intermodal logistics system that utilizes standard, modular, reusable containers, real-time identification, and routing through shared logistics facilities.  This investigated operational issues necessary for realizing this potential.  We focused on two aspects of operations: (1) algorithms for container-level processes so as to build loads in the PI and handle these loads at intermodal interfaces; and (2) algorithms for system-level processes so as to route, schedule and coordinate loads that flow through the PI.  Addressing the research issues in these two areas allow transportation service providers to build loads that fill trailers as measured by weight and volume constraints, effectively reconstitute loads at the intermodal interfaces, and determine efficient routes across the PI to meet scheduling constraints that require a great deal of coordination in a highly distributed network.    Project Products and Intellectual Merit  Modular Container Packing  Related to packing of modular containers (m-boxes), the team developed online algorithms for grouping and packing containers as they become available for shipping.  Information regarding the number and size of m-boxes to be packed is assumed to be unknown.  The research team refers to this contribution as packing m-boxes with online arrivals.  Results suggest that information regarding package dimensions can be efficiently utilized to create high utilization of pallets without the assumption of prespecifiied packages to be packed.   Load Planning  The team developed a mathematical model and heuristic solution approach for solving the load planning problem for a collaborative distribution system.  This work is nearing publication.   The research investigates large-scale decomposition approaches for solving the problem, as well as polyhedral structure considerations that can be exploited for computational efficiency.   Auction Mechansisms   With respect to design and analysis of scheduling and auction mechanisms in this context, the team has designed a variety of linear and second order cone programming models intended to capture the value of centralizing control in a collaborative logistics environment and the process of characterizing of various matching auctions in this setting.  Broader Impact  Through this research, investigators have engaged with more than 12 companies to pursue the goal of collaborative, more efficient, logistics system.  These efforts have raised awareness of enviornmental benefits stemming from reduced truck miles and financial benefits to smaller manufacturers and retailers resulting from shared infrastructure.  The work has also provided international visibility to the mission of sustainable logistics by placing its investigators at numberous conferences, workshops and talk around the world.
