<AbstractNarration>The travel support is for 10 early career scientist from the U.S to attend the 6th conference International Conference on Atmosphere, Ocean and Climate Change scheduled to be held in Hong Kong China, August 19-21, 2013. They will present scientific findings at the event. The early career scientists will be selected by the conference organization committee following an open call for applications.  The conference theme is broad; the support will focus on topics dealing with regional problems in Asia-Pacific rim e.g. climate change, atmospheric physics and chemistry, extreme events. The conference will provide an excellent opportunity for the early career scientist to gain new ideas and knowledge from the talks and presentations, which would be helpful for their career development and scientific pursuits. This award is co-funded by NSF International Science and Engineering section, Office of International and Integrative Activities.</AbstractNarration>

The conference aims to provide a forum and platform to (1) facilitate professional contacts and to enhance interactions for professionals in atmosphere-ocean-climate fields around the world with a focus on Asia-Pacific region; (2) to exchange and share knowledge on regional weather, climate and oceanographic studies; (3) to foster interactional collaborations in tackle with some outstanding problems unique to the region such as air pollution, monsoon, Tibet plateau, etc.    Benefits of the funding include:  1.
