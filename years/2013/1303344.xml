<AbstractNarration>The California State University, San Bernardino proposal seeks to build capacity for training students in cyber security and intelligence by developing a national model curriculum at the undergraduate and graduate levels. It builds upon its two existing Centers of Academic Excellence (Information Assurance and Intelligence Community), leveraging a strong SFS Scholarship program, partnership with a grant funded ATE center, regional community colleges, and the relationship with five other California State Universities and three regional universities that are part of the IC Center of Academic Excellence (IC CAE) consortium. This grant enhances the SFS program by building a national model curriculum that reflects the needs of the federal government as described in the President's Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative. Major activities include developing new curriculum, new courses, faculty workshops to improve cross-disciplinary understanding, symposia and seminars to enhance student skills and online curriculum modules. The new curriculum provides opportunities for CSUSB students, regional articulation and transfer paths for regional community colleges as well as opportunities for graduate work for students at IC CAE consortium universities. In addition, the national model curriculum is disseminated to the Intelligence Community and Information Assurance Centers of Academic Excellence nationally. The NSF SFS Cybercorps program benefits from a new pool of highly qualified students who meet the immediate needs of the federal government.</AbstractNarration>
