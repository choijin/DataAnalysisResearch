<AbstractNarration>Science and technology (S&amp;T) indicators used to measure the overall impact of international collaboration do not currently provide universities with a comprehensive, institutional-level assessment of their international research collaborations. This project will test and refine commonly used S&amp;T indicators and develop new metrics to evaluate input, output, and the impact of international research cooperation using a combination of quantitative and qualitative methodologies. The project will process and analyze data from various sources including Elsevier?s Scopus and Thomson Reuters? Web of Science publication databases; grants and patent databases; as well as a mixed-mode survey administered to faculty researchers at Washington State University (WSU). Collectively, these tools will first be applied to WSU as a case study and further assessed with four other U.S. public research institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project will create and assess an institutional-level blue print that will assist a U.S. university to document the impact and productivity of its international research collaborations. Practical tools and information will be generated to capture the formal and informal characteristics of partnerships; the resulting guidance manual will be of interest to university policymakers and decision-makers to leverage investments resulting from strategic international alliances.  The impact of this research project will provide evidence-based approaches to U.S. institutions in implementing interventions that will enable growth in productive international research collaborations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ International collaboration in research, especially in science and technology, is increasingly recognized as an important component of both research and internationalization priorities by higher education institutions.  There are however limited tools and few studies for institutional assessment of the impact and productivity of these collaborations.   This study analyzed the input-output trends of international research collaboration at five U.S. public universities using 16 quantitative research metrics as well as a qualitative survey of faculty perspectives at Washington State University.     The quantitative measures of personnel, awards, publications, citation impact, downloads and patents showed that the number of grant applications, awards and co-authored publications with international collaborators generally increased for the five universities over the 2008-2012 period    However, there were varying trends with personnel, expenditures, citations and co-inventions involving international collaborators.   All metrics tested could be used for institutional assessment of the impact of international collaborations.  Each institution would however have to consider its priorities, and the ease of data collection and quality, in addressing questions posed in advancing its own institutional strategy.   The researcher mobility analysis for WSU provided important insights.   Active researchers (who produced 93% of all WSU publications) were very mobile during 2002-2012, mostly at the domestic level with other U.S. institutions.   Researchers who were internationally mobile produced more publications than domestically mobile researchers; the citation impact of publications by the latter group was higher than that of the former group although both groups showed higher citation impact than the world average.   Transitory researchers (those spending less than two years at an institution) represented more than half of all active researchers and, as a group, produced publications with higher citation impact than the world and WSU average.  Based on publication records, these results substantiate the benefits of researcher mobility to both domestic and international academic institutions.  The faculty survey at WSU highlighted major reasons for international research collaboration (IRC) .   More than half of survey respondents with IRC activity indicated reasons including personal gains and gains for students in research, shared common interest with international colleagues, synergy in their field of research, and expansion of their research.. The survey also documented the impediments and critical needs of researchers to further IRC, and significant challenges that need to be overcome especially funding.
