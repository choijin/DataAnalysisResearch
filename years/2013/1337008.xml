<AbstractNarration>1337008&lt;br/&gt;Axebaum&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biomass holds great potential as a fuel as it addresses two important issues ? global climate change and the demand for renewable fuels.  Biomass generally has high moisture content and is usually dried before being utilized.  Nonetheless, there are a number of applications where ?wet? biomass can be useful.  For example, when biomass is burned with oxygen in a power plant and the resulting carbon dioxide is stored underground, the process leads to carbon negative power production. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This program seeks to gain knowledge of the physico-chemical processes associated with combustion of high-moisture content fuels.  Three types of biomass/water mixtures will be studied: alcohol/water solutions, algal suspensions, and biomass solubilized in water. The vaporization and combustion characteristics will be studied in single droplet experiments and in a spray combustor. Analytical models of two-component droplet vaporization and combustion will be used to understand and interpret results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will provide fundamental data needed to support technologies for a sustainable approach to power generation with carbon capture and storage. The research will be an important educational tool, exposing our youth to novel approaches to renewable, sustainable technologies. In addition, an innovative, interdisciplinary experiential course on Energy and Environment will be developed.</AbstractNarration>

It was determined that the strong preferential vaporization of ethanol over water is the main reason why it is possible to obtain robust flames in a system which should otherwise be unignitable.  The concept of preferential vaporization was studied in detail. When an alcohol is mixed with water, a non-ideal solution is formed.

The results obtained in this project are important in several ways:  The fundamental knowledge gained on 1) how non-ideal mixtures affect preferential vaporization for multi-component fuels, and 2) how the composition of a fuel can affect spray breakup and dynamics, will be useful for studies and applications of combustion of multicomponent fuels. Since there is currently much interest in using mixtures of conventional fuels with biofuels for energy generation and for transportation, a better understanding of how changing fuel composition affects the combustion process is needed before biofuel mixtures can be widely utilized.

Spray pyrolysis is a scalable process for the manufacturing of nanostructured materials with significant advantages over other methods, including synthesis of high purity and reproducible materials with minimal wastewater production. While spray pyrolysis has been shown to address many of the criteria for successful production of nanostructured cathode materials, morphological control presents a major challenge. By utilizing wet fuels for spray pyrolysis, it is possible to fine tune the temperature history that  the material experiences, improving control over the morphology of the final product.
