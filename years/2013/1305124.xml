<AbstractNarration>Research in the Phase II Center for Chemical Innovation on Solar Fuels focuses on discovery and development of the chemical components required to use solar photons to drive water splitting to H2 and O2. Major scientific achievements of the CCI Solar Fuels Phase II project include: synthesis of Si microwire arrays; construction of functional silicon microwires-polymer assemblies; elucidation of the mechanism of Co-catalyzed hydrogen evolution; construction of NiMo/Si photocathodes with ultrahigh efficiencies; discovery of highly active earth-abundant metal-based (Co, Ni) oxygen evolution catalysts; integration of oxygen evolution catalysts onto metal-oxide semiconductors; band gap tuning of tungsten oxide; and development of new theoretical methods applicable to complex systems. Research during the Phase II renewal builds on these electronic structural and mechanistic foundations in targeting the discovery of new molecules and materials with improved performance. CCI Solar Fuels researchers are developing the enabling science required to integrate light absorption, charge transport, and multielectron redox catalysis for efficient solar water splitting. Scalability and economic viability require materials composed of earth-abundant elements. Elucidation and control of fundamental interfacial properties are essential for the integration of semiconductors, catalysts, and membranes into functional assemblies. Collaborative research efforts in CCI Solar Fuels focus on new semiconductors with optimum light-absorption and charge-separation properties. High priorities include discovering new catalysts that split water into H2 and O2 with maximum rates and minimum overpotentials; nanostructuring materials to optimize performance; elucidating catalytic mechanisms to identify bottlenecks and inform designs for their removal; integrating catalysts and semiconductors to produce functional photoelectrodes; developing ion-conductive membrane separators; and constructing photoanode-membrane-photocathode assemblies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Among the other academic and government laboratories engaged in solar fuels research, CCI Solar Fuels distinguishes itself by its precise alignment with the vision and goals of the National Science Foundation. CCI Solar Fuels research advances discovery, innovation, and education beyond the frontiers of current knowledge, and recruits future generations of scientists and engineers. CCI Solar Fuels activities directly impact thousands of students, postdoctoral scholars, and members of the public at large. A vigorous outreach program delivers Juice-from-Juice solar science activity kits to elementary, middle, and high school students. Solar Energy Activity Lab kits involve high school and undergraduate students in research through a combinatorial search for solar materials. An Informal Science Education program brings these activities to new and younger audiences. CCI Solar Fuels graduate students and postdoctoral scholars acquire experience as mentors in these outreach programs. Involving underrepresented groups is a particular point of emphasis: seven of eighteen senior investigators are members of underrepresented groups; two investigators focus exclusively on outreach activities; and two investigators are faculty members at universities with large underrepresented student populations. CCI Solar Fuels researchers deliver the message of clean renewable solar fuels in television, radio, and online programs; public lectures, scientific research conferences; and consultations with local, state, and federal government officials. The technological, environmental, economic, and social benefits of renewable solar fuels impact every human being on Earth. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center on Solar Fuels is funded as part of the Centers for Chemical Innovation (CCI) program.</AbstractNarration>
