<AbstractNarration>This effort is focused on better quantifying the emissions of aerosols and trace gases of global significance from combustion sources in Nepal and Bhutan. Very little information currently exists on emissions from sources such as brick kilns, garbage burning, and cooking fires. The broader impacts of this research include the development of a better understanding of the contribution of emissions from South Asia to the global burden of gases and aerosol important for predicting regional air quality and global climate change. This work is part of a larger international effort between the US, Nepal, Bhutan, Germany, and Italy to study atmospheric chemistry in South Asia. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chemical species to be quantified include: PM2.5 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 &amp;#956;m), elemental and organic carbon, absorption by black and brown carbon, smoke markers, a suite of particle-phase metals and ions, CO2, CO, CH4, more than 90 diverse non-methane organic gases, SO2, NOx, NH3, HCN, acetonitrile, and many other types of aerosol and trace gases. The measurements will complement ongoing regional monitoring activities by filling a critical need for better source characterization. The results will help to assess the relative importance of South Asian combustion sources in influencing air quality and climate on a local, regional, and global scale.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="Default">The project was a collaboration with the chief partners being the University of Montana, Emory University, University of Iowa, Drexel University, and the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD). The major project goal that Emory University team was responsible for was to improve the Asian air pollutant emissions estimates, specifically focused on Nepal, by including emission factors obtained from the field campaign Nepal Ambient Monitoring and Source Testing Experiment (NAMaSTE). We compared the existing emissions estimates in Asia and created new emissions estimates for the road transport, brick kilns and garbage burning in the Kathmandu Valley. Using various emissions estimates, we conducted chemical transport model simulations and evaluated them against observational data from the field campaign. Emory team was involved in six peer-reviewed journal articles, four of them led by our team, and one book chapter in a peer-reviewed book. Another book chapter and a journal article are currently under review. The project results highlight the high uncertainty in the existing emissions estimates in Asia and their impact on regional air quality simulations. Also, we quantified how much undersampled sources, such as brick kiln and garbage burning emissions, contribute to regional air pollution in South Asia.</p> <p class="Default">Three postdoctoral fellows, two of whom female, contributed to the project, resulting in the peer-reviewed articles and they mentored graduate and undergraduate students. We also involved two graduate students (one female) and nine undergraduate students (seven female) over the duration of the project. Three of the undergraduates were trained as a part of the Research Experience for Undergraduates during the summer. Both graduate students and four of the undergraduate students are included as co-authors of one of the publications. Three other students are included as co-authors of the work that are currently under review.</p> <p>Throughout the project, the team developed international collaborations and disseminated research results in conferences, as well as through invited talks. The PI has organized and led an Emory delegation to the United Nations climate change negotiations every year since 2015. The students, who attended the meeting reported their experiences through blogs, infographics, podcasts, videos, and policy papers on the website to disseminate knowledge to the general public (<a href="http://climatetalks.emorydomains.org/">http://climatetalks.emorydomains.org/</a>).</p> <p>The Emory team members were involved in teaching elementary school girls in girl scouts, as well as middle and high school students since 2013. We visited Science Day at Mill Springs Academy in 2014, King Middle School in 2015, Druid Hills Environmental Club in 2016, Tucker Middle School in 2017, DeKalb Alternative School in 2018 and Centennial Academy in 2019 to teach middle school and high students about air pollution and climate change. In 2018, the PI also participated in Punk Science outreach in Telluride, CO, giving two 45-minute sessions on air pollution to approximately 40 K-12 students.</p> <p>Members of Emory team have disseminated research results more broadly to the public by hosting Atlanta Science Festival events every year since its inception in March, 2014. The PI incorporated the project into her Atmospheric Chemistry class and the students presented their research on air pollution to middle school students and also at the Atlanta Science Festival. We have held various climate-related events on campus, including four annual Climate Weeks since 2016 and the annual Universities for Cleaner Georgia Conference, once in 2018 and the other in 2019, involving more than 50 students from universities in Southeastern U.S. (Emory University, University of Georgia, Auburn University, Georgia Institute of Technology, Oxford College, and Georgia State University). The Emory team also built and installed a low-cost air quality monitoring network on campus, as a way to raise awareness of the issue and visualize the data on the website (<a href="http://www.airemory.com/index.html">http://www.airemory.com/index.html</a>).</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/01/2019<br>      Modified by: Eri&nbsp;Saikawa</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1350021/1350021_10321744_1575215575263_CIMG3382--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1350021/1350021_10321744_1575215575263_CIMG3382--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Atlanta Science Festival Expo"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1350021/1350021_10321744_1575215575263_CIMG3382--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Atlanta Science Festival Expo"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students in class presenting their research on air pollution and showcasing how to measure air quality at the Atlanta Science Festival</div> <div class="imageCredit">Eri Saikawa</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Eri&nbsp;Saikawa</div> <div class="imageTitle">Atlanta Science Festival Expo</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1350021/1350021_10321744_1575215708386_IMG_2028--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1350021/1350021_10321744_1575215708386_IMG_2028--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Outreach at middle school"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1350021/1350021_10321744_1575215708386_IMG_2028--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Outreach at middle school"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Emory students doing an interactive teaching session at a middle school</div> <div class="imageCredit">Eri Saikawa</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Eri&nbsp;Saikawa</div> <div class="imageTitle">Outreach at middle school</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1350021/1350021_10321744_1575215417266_CIMG3609--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1350021/1350021_10321744_1575215417266_CIMG3609--rgov-800width.jpg" title="UN climate change negotiation in 2017"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1350021/1350021_10321744_1575215417266_CIMG3609--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="UN climate change negotiation in 2017"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Students presenting their research at an exhibition booth at the UN climate change negotiation</div> <div class="imageCredit">Eri Saikawa</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Eri&nbsp;Saikawa</div> <div class="imageTitle">UN climate change negotiation in 2017</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1350021/1350021_10321744_1575216122078_image4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1350021/1350021_10321744_1575216122078_image4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Outreach event at Telluride, CO"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1350021/1350021_10321744_1575216122078_image4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Outreach event at Telluride, CO"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Punk Science outreach in Telluride, CO in 2018.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jessica Tenenbaum</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Eri&nbsp;Saikawa</div> <div class="imageTitle">Outreach event at Telluride, CO</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1350021/1350021_10321744_1575257874523_IMG_2010--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1350021/1350021_10321744_1575257874523_IMG_2010--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Air quality sensor"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1350021/1350021_10321744_1575257874523_IMG_2010--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Air quality sensor"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Low-cost air quality sensor built and installed on the roof of the Math and Science building of Emory University</div> <div class="imageCredit">Eri Saikawa</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Eri&nbsp;Saikawa</div> <div class="imageTitle">Air quality sensor</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
