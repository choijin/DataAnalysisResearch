<AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is a close collaboration between theory and experiment to design molecular interfaces to tune thermal transport. Using current theoretical tools (e.g. R-matrix theory, Langevin formalism and simulations) and new ones developed under this proposal (e.g. Fokker-Planck analysis of interfaces), we will be able to rapidly analyze and optimize the thermal properties of molecular structures without having to resort to repeated simulations.  We will then synthesize these designs and test their thermal conductivity, using these results to improve our theoretical models, which will in turn suggest improved designs. This iterative loop will lead to fundamental progress in the modeling of thermal transport as well as new composites with high thermal conductivity.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our goal is to functionalize the ends of carbon nanotubes so as to minimize their Kapitsa resistance and measure their thermal conductivity. Initially, we will react alcohol [end-group] functionalized nanotubes with acid chlorides to form ester groups.  Alternatively, amine [end-group] modified nanotubes will be modified by reaction with the acid chlorides (of the desired end-groups) to form amide linkages[, progressively increasing stiffness of the coupling group]. Finally, interfacial synthetic methods can be used to directly couple end group moieties, such as long chain perfluoroalkyl groups, selectively to the nanotube ends.  These methods will also be modified to couple other end groups of interest directly to the nanotubes. These materials will be incorporated into carefully chosen polymer matrices and their thermal conductivities measured. Vibrational coupling of the nanotubes, via the endgroups, to the polymer matrix will be signaled by increases in thermal conductivities of the composites relative to those made using non-modified nanotubes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We will iterate between theory and experiment to study how size, orientation, alignment, connectivity, and interactions with the host material affect thermal conductivity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work is a close collaboration between theory and experiment to design chains of atoms that will be attached to the ends of molecules in order to improve how they conduct heat. Using current theoretical tools and new ones developed under this proposal, we will be able to rapidly optimize how different molecular structures conduct heat without having to resort to repeated simulations.  We will then synthesize these designs and test their thermal conductivity, using these results to improve our theoretical models, which will in turn suggest improved designs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our goal is to design chains of atoms that would be chemically attached to the ends of carbon nanotubes. Carbon nanotubes, themselves, conduct heat as well as many metals, but because they are very stiff, it is difficult to get  heat to flow into them from their surrounding medium. We will iterate between theory and experiment to study how size, orientation, alignment, connectivity, and interactions with the host material affect thermal conductivity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Minimizing the resistance to getting heat into and out of carbon nanotubes would be very important.  For example, polymer composites could be used in car and truck radiators to replace heavier, costlier metallic components, saving money and fuel; adhesives that conduct heat well could be used in aviation and in electronics to improve high temperature performance and lower the rate of failure. There are hundreds of potential industrial applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The development of light-weight plastic composites that conduct heat well would allow engineers to replace heavy and costly metal components in their designs. While the high thermal conductivity of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) has held promise for their use in composites, it is difficult to get heat "in" and "out" of the relatively stiff  nanotubes embedded in the polymer medium. This project examined the rational design of molecular chains to reduce  thermal interface resistance and tested these designs in real materials.  There are three types of significant outcomes of this project: outcomes that are specific to this topic, outcomes that increase instiutional resources or resources to the community at large, and outcomes that were unanticipated but may have wider applications.  The significant outcomes of this project specific to this topic include:  The synthesis of a host of functionalized carbon-nanotube systems and studies of their ability to be incorporated into polymer samples without aggregation.  The discovery of functionalization approaches that nearly tripled the measured thermal conductivity of CNT composites. The development of rapid numerical schemes to calculate the approximate thermal conductivity of functionalized nanotubes. An analysis of different composite geometries, examining how the length and allignment of CNTs might affect thermal conductivity. Experimental verification of the allignment effects of incorporants analyzed above.   The significant outcomes of this project that have broader impact on the institution and research and community include:.  The devlopment of genetic algorithms that can explore the vast space of molecular designs to find ones optimal for their thermal conductivity, or any other metric. The development of two parallel techniques to measure thermal conductivity in thin polymer films.  The exploration of functionalization schemes of CNTs to optimize their mechanical properties in composites.   Significant outcomes that were produced along the way in this research but not directly to optimizing thermal conductivity include:  The discovery of hyper-honeycomb lattices and their unique electronic properties, including a never-before seen "nodal loop" in their bandstructure. The development of functionalization techniques that allow the attachment of CNTs to gold electrodes, enabling their use in biosensors and fuel cells. The theoretical prediction of oscillating magneto-resistance in graphene ribbons due to colossal (&gt;10T) oscillating pseudo-magnetic fields.
