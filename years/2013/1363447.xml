<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop low-power, robust, and energy-efficient sensors to satisfy a wide range of current applications including large-scale networks and implantable biomedical sensors. The aim is to develop the fundamental framework for sensor systems, connecting theory and algorithms with efficient hardware implementations and circuit metrics, such as power, footprint, quantization effects, and other circuit and channel non-idealities. The approach is to develop compressed sensing techniques that result in universal and efficient sensor designs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  The transformative aspect of this research is a joint investigation into both theoretical and hardware development of compressed sensing techniques for sensor systems. The plan is to optimize energy allocation in the information chain, by shifting from (the original) randomization techniques to more energy-efficient deterministic sensing techniques. The focus is on regimes relevant to practice, and the results of this research are foreseen to greatly impact both systems and hardware communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Energy-efficient sensor nodes are in great demand today. For example in large-scale networks and implantable sensors, low power nodes are required to increase the average node life-time until maintenance, as well as improve the patient's quality of life. The goal is to convince practitioners, that compressed sensing can be mapped to hardware-efficient implementations. By creating an online portal, the project will also demonstrate the benefits of the developed sensing techniques to both experts and general population. To disseminate the fundamental systems/hardware framework, a new multi-disciplinary course will be created at MIT and offered to a wide-range of students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main objective of this project was to develop theory, analysis techniques and tools for quick and efficient design of sensors for a variety of applications (from embedded neural recorders, and special-purpose sensor networks, to the multiplicity of sensing modalities emerging as an Internet of Things).  The core algorithmic approach analyzed is compressed-sensing (CS) - one of the recent mathematical breakthroughs that allows us to digitize the analog sensory information in a very efficient way. The roadblock to these implementations is a disconnect between the theoretical community and implementation community due to a lack of tools and analysis techniques that bring practical implementation constraints into the algorithm development.  In this project, we developed such tools and made them available to the public at:  https://sites.google.com/site/mitisgcs/  The tools span both the analysis of the sensing (encoder) part of the system and the reconstruction (decoder).  For the project overall, three types of significant results have been developed:  1) Theoretical analysis of implementation constrained short block size CS encoding algorithms using U-Statistics  2) Modeling and analysis of the power/performance trade-offs for analog and digital implementation of a CS sensor/relay link (including the sensing, encoding, error-correction, link transmission and decoding)  3) Analysis of complexity/performance trade-offs for the reconstruction algorithms and chip implementation of the most promising MP algorithm.
