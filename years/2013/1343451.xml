<AbstractNarration>This project explores the extent to which personality traits predict privacy and security behaviors. Over the past decade, computer privacy and security have improved by leaps and bounds by considering human factors in the design process. However, previous work to improve the usability of privacy and security systems has only examined the behaviors of "average users," which is believed to only yield local maxima because no individual perfectly fits this profile. Therefore, this project is examining the extent to which additional improvements can be made by catering system designs to individual differences (e.g., in personality traits). Through a series of surveys and controlled experiments, researchers are discovering how these personality traits are predictive of certain privacy decisions, as well as interactions with various security mitigations. For instance, knowledge of a user's personality traits may result in more appropriate default privacy settings on a social networking website or web browser security warnings that are more salient to that user. The researchers' goal is to ultimately design systems that infer personality traits and then adjust privacy and security mechanisms so as to yield outcomes that are optimally aligned with a particular user's preferences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For decades researchers have discussed the "privacy paradox," which is the gap between stated privacy preferences and observed behaviors (i.e., people rarely act in accordance with their stated privacy preferences). The primary goal of this project was to examine how innate individual differences, such as personality, impact an individual's privacy and security preferences and behaviors.  We found that personality traits (e.g., extroversion, openness, etc.) are not predictive of privacy preferences and behavior, and other individual differences relating to decision-making style, thinking style, self-esteem and risk taking preferences predict privacy preferences better than the traditionally used personality traits. We have also found that the existing scales used to measure people's privacy preferences can be significantly improved and we have tested various successful ways to improve these scales. This will enable us to develop and validate an improved measure of privacy preferences that would improve researchers' ability to understand and predict people's privacy preferences and behavior.  Our research is helping to explain the privacy paradox by showing that certain individual differences may account for differences in behavior. Similarly, our research will help others design systems that are adaptive to the needs of individual users, rather than the needs of the "average" user.
