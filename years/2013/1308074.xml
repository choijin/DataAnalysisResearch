<AbstractNarration>Title: Annual NSF/DTRA Algorithms Workshop - November 26 to 29, San Diego, California&lt;br/&gt;Dates: November 26-29, 2012&lt;br/&gt;Location: San Diego California&lt;br/&gt;Website: http://events.SignUp4.com/AlgorithmWorkshop  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The increasing availability of new sequencing technologies has dramatically reduced the cost of obtaining genomic data from biological threats. Similarly, the recent development of new technologies for the analysis of chemical samples, such as gas chromotography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromotography-multi-stage mass spectrometry (LC-MSn), has increased the availability and complexity of data on chemical threats.  Furthermore, the availability and deluge of large scale data sets from all sources of images has increased the need for inovative algorithm development.  This deluge of information creates the need and the opportunity for the mathematical sciences community to develop technology for controlling and reducing the threat from biological and chemical attacks and the analysis of imaging data sets.  This proposal aims at securing funding for the 5th annual ATD workshop.  The purpose of these workshops is to provide a forum for scientists and mathematicians who have an interest in this NSF/DTRA/NGA sponsored program to share their results, and to foster interaction between experts in innovative algorithm development and experts in the sensor R&amp;D community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA), The National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) have formed a partnership to support the development of the next generation of mathematical and statistical algorithms for the detection of chemical and biological threats and threats detected from images. The result is a program within the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS), which is called "ATD: Algorithms for Threat Detection". This proposal seeks to secure travel support for students and postdoctoral researchers who will participate in this 5th Algorithms Workshops in addition to securing conference support and management. Providing this type of funding is critical for the training of the next generation of mathematical scientists. In particular, by providing opportunities for students and postdoctoral researchers to be exposed to problems of chemical and biological threat detection in addition to imaging the NSF creates incentives for junior researchers (and specially those from underrepresented groups) to focus on these important and timely areas of research.</AbstractNarration>

This helped fulfill the fourth goal of the workshop, as these junior researchers were unlikely to attend the workshop without the financial support provided by this award.  Average expenditures on travel support were around $1,200 per student/postdoc, but individual expenditures varied depending on physical location and availability of other funds.
