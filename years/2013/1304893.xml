<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the conference "Operator Theory Operator Algebras: GPOTS 2013" that will be held from May 21-25, 2013, on the campus of the University of California-Berkeley.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This event is the thirty-third installment of the Great Plains Operator Theory Symposium (GPOTS), a conference series that annually brings together a diverse group of mathematicians whose primary research interests are in operator theory or operator algebras. The theme of the 2013 event is the mathematical legacy of William B. Arveson (1934-2011), who was a pioneer in the operator theory/operator algebra field.  Among the main topics to be discussed by speakers at the meeting are the following: non-self-adjoint operator algebras; complete positivity, complete boundedness, and quantum information; actions by groups of automorphisms of operator algebras. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>
