<AbstractNarration>This action funds Geoffrey Zahn of the University of Arkansas to conduct a research project in Biological Sciences during the summer of 2013 at the National Institute for Agro-Environmental Sciences in Tsukuba, Japan. The project title is "The Importance of Microbial Interactions to Soil Carbon Cycling on a Warming Planet." The host scientist is Dr. Rota Wagai.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project examines the effect of microbial interactions on changes to soil carbon dynamics in response to warming conditions using microcosms with naturally-occuring bacterial populations under different temperature treatments. Soil amoebae are abundant and ubiquitous bacterial predators that play an important, yet understudied, role in regulating bacterial populations, which are vastly important for global carbon cycling. Existing climate change models have begun to examine the functions that microbial communities may play in contributing to or mitigating global warming, but they do not yet include information about how total microbial community structure impacts these predictions. Common soil amoebae are used in replicates of intact sterilized soil cores along with inoculations of naturally-occuring bacteria in a full factorial experiment. Frequent measurements of carbon dioxide emissions allow an investigation of the importance of microbial predation and food web complexity on bacterially-mediated responses to climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, this experience and the results of this research will be broadly disseminated through peer-reviewed publication, public seminars and radio interviews, and through a multi-lingual online blog geared towards middle school students. The blog will document the experience of traveling to Japan and learning about Japanese culture, but will focus on the importance of international collaborations and cultural exchanges. It will be designed to engage students at a critical point in their education with the excitement of discovery and the scientific process, while sharing insights into another culture.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[         The research undertaken as part of this project brought together an American PhD candidate in biological sciences with a Japanese Senior Researcher in soil physics and biogeochemistry to investigate the interactive effects of the composition of soil microbial communities and warming temperatures and on carbon cycling.  The goal of the project was to establish whether the presence of larger microbial predators would affect the overall response of soil to global warming.  Agricultural soil was added to microcosms under different community and temperature treatments while carbon dioxide emissions were constantly monitored for 24 days. It was found that the presence of bacterial predators and increased temperatures each separately caused a significant increase in carbon emissions from soil.  These findings supported previous hypotheses about the role of predators in global carbon cycling.  Unexpectedly, it was also observed that the presence of these predators actually decreased the response of the soil to warming.  These results show that more mechanistic research into microbial communities is necessary in order to accurately predict the fate of soil carbon under warming conditions.                       Findings from this project have been prepared for submission to peer review in order to broadly disseminate the results and solicit feedback on future directions for this line of inquiry.  In addition to the immediate scientific merit of the project, the program has also fostered a mutually beneficial research relationship between the awardee and host researcher, linking together not only the expertise across scientific disciplines required for biogeochemical questions, but also two different countries and cultures and has introduced the awardee to a new research culture and paved the way for future productive collaborations.
