<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program, Prof. Janet Morrow and her group at the University at Buffalo, State University of New York are developing new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents that utilize the biologically relevant metal ions, Fe(II), Co(II) and Ni(II).  Coordination complexes of these transition metal ions produce contrast through paramagnetic chemical exchange saturation transfer (PARACEST).  The primary goal is to design PARACEST agents with exchangeable proton resonances shifted far from those of bulk water (&gt; 100 ppm) and to optimize exchange rate constants for enhanced contrast.  Second, the extensive coordination chemistry and accessibility of different oxidation states of transition metal elements facilitates the design of contrast agents that are responsive to biological environment.  For example, PARACEST agents that are switched on by a change in pH or redox potential will be prepared.  CEST NMR experiments and CEST MRI experiments on a 4.7 T scanner will be conducted with the goal of developing imaging protocols for optimizing contrast.  Experiments for undergraduates and high school teachers and their students will be developed to make the connection between magnetic properties of metal ions and MR imaging.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MRI is a clinically important diagnostic procedure, with about half of MRI scans using contrast agents in order to better image differences in tissue.  The development of contrast agents that switch on in tissue which has characteristics of a disease state could be extremely useful for improved diagnostics and treatment.  The proposed research will focus on the development of such switchable contrast agents that contain iron, cobalt or nickel.  These metal ions, especially iron, may be potentially safer than currently utilized rare earth contrast agents because they may be metabolically recycled.  This project will develop the coordination chemistry and imaging protocols that are necessary to tap into the significant and unexplored potential of these new contrast agents for imaging applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit. The major goals of this project were to develop new MRI contrast agents based on Fe(II), Co(II) and Ni(II).  These contrast agents decrease the water proton signal by chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST).  High spin paramagnetic complexes (PARACEST agents) were formed and several of them met the goal of shifting the exchangable proton resonance at least 90 ppm from the bulk water resonance in order to overcome the magnetization transfer effect in tissue.  The most highly shifted CEST peaks were produced by complexes with amide NH, pyrazole NH or alcohol OH groups.  Complexes with additional types of pendents with exchangeable protons including imidazoles have also been developed.    A second goal was to develop pH sensitive paraCEST agents. The most promising pH-probe is a complex of Co(II) that produces four different CEST peaks.  The pH dependence of these CEST peaks can be used to give a ratiometric pH sensor.  This complex has been studied in vivo in a tumor model (see Figure 1).  New Fe(II) and Co(II) complexes with amino-picolyl pendents produce pH-sensitive CEST spectra in the range of pH 5 to 8 by producing a shift in the CEST peak with pH.  This represents a new paradigm for the development of pH probes.    A third goal was to study redox responsive paraCEST agents.  Redox-activated paraCEST agents are best prepared from 1,4,7-triazacyclononane containing three pendent groups. Heterocyclic pendent groups including pyrazole or imidazole produce redox active Co(II)/Co(III) or Fe(II)/Fe(III) paraCEST agents.  Redox potentials range from -170 mV to 300 mV.  A striking observation is that the Fe(III) complexes are low spin.  This provides a redox switch between two oxidation states of iron that both give rise to CEST contrast.  Towards the development of more sensitive CEST agents, supramolecular systems are a goal.  In this approach there is an open coordination site for binding and shifting of OH groups of water or ligand. Several new complexes of Co(II) and Fe(II) that contain inner-sphere water ligands have been prepared.  One type of complex is seven-coordinate and is based on a mixed aza-oxa macrocycle with two pendent amides.  This complex has a water ligand as shown by x-ray crystallographic studies.  A second type of complex is six-coordinate and is based on a 1,4,7-triazacyclononane ligand with only two pendent groups.  These complexes are being studied by using 17O NMR spectroscopy to determine the number of water ligands and the rate constants for ligand exchange.      Broader impacts.  Molecular imaging is an emerging topic in biomedical diagnostics.  Our smart contrast agents may contribute to this interdisciplinary field by providing new ways to image pH, temperature or redox status by using MRI.  The impact of the contrast agents as a tool may be high.  For example, smart contrast agents may be used to map tumor pH.   If the contrast agents were to be developed for human use down the road, they would be based on iron, a biologically relevant element.  They could potentially be less toxic, less expensive and less environmentally hazardous.         This project contributed in several ways to education at multiple levels.  The PI trained eight graduate students, nine undergraduates and a postdoc in her lab over the period of the award.  A new laboratory on paramagnetic Co(II) cage complexes was developed for the CHE 322 laboratory.  Undergraduate students participated with enthusiasm in the production of this laboratory experiment. They were delighted to see their efforts result in a publication.  This laboratory has been refined and an electrochemical experiment has been added. Lectures and a laboratory were incorporated into CHE 322, an inorganic chemistry course for undergraduates.  Lectures on MRI contrast agents were added to CHE 523, a graduate course on Bioinorganic Chemistry. The PI has trained a substantial number of women and underrepresented minority students and has trained several additional undergraduate students through the summer CSTEP and REU programs.  She has also participated on groups on campus such as the Women in Science and Engineering group to encourage female students in STEM.   Three US patents on our paraCEST agents have been filed and two have issued.  We are pursuing international patents as well.  The PI participated in a NSF I-CORPS program to investigate the possibility of commercializing some of the contrast agents.
