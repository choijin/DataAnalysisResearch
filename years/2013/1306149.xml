<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to investigate the properties of high power terahertz emitting devices based on impurity center transitions in the wide bandgap semiconductor, gallium nitride.  Using doped wafers from colleagues at universities and industry, terahertz emitters will be fabricated, and a series of electrical and optical experiments will determine their characteristics and limitations, and provide the data to optimize their performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is that terahertz emission is an important capability, and gallium nitride is an important semiconductor that may enable higher performance than previous emitters based on other materials and other mechanisms.  The reason is that gallium nitride, as a wide bandgap semiconductor, can accommodate high power dissipation, and the dopants and impurities have deep energy levels that are perfectly suitable for terahertz-producing transitions.  The proposed emission mechanism was effective for other semiconductors, but is not well understood in gallium nitride, so this is an exploratory project.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are that the availability of compact, high performance, low cost terahertz emitters will be transformative for global applications from medical diagnostics to pollution detection.  This research project will add to fundamental knowledge on devices and materials, and will feature the interaction of students with university and industrial researchers.  Lectures on semiconductor optoelectronics will be presented at local schools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A new kind of semiconductor device was developed that emits power in the terahertz (THz) frequency range, which corresponds to the far infrared wavelengths.  The device was fabricated from the wide bandgap semiconductor gallium nitride (GaN), which is currently important for applications in solid-state lighting and for LED flashlights.  The THz emission mechanism is based on radiative transitions in the dopant materials that are intentionally added to the GaN.  A THz emitter was designed, fabricated, and characterized, and was found to emit power at the frequency of 11 THz, corresponding to the wavelength of 27 micrometers, with an operating temperature of 70 K in the cryogenic range.  This result was a proof-of-concept that demonstrated the soundness of this research approach.  An analysis of the results suggested that the device performance can be significantly improved by increasing the doping concentration, and that the operating temperature can be increased to room temperature.  These results are important because the GaN THz emitters can be fabricated to have small size, low weight, low power consumption, and low cost.  The THz frequencies are important for applications because they can penetrate many architectural materials for see-through imaging, and can measure important resonances that are useful for the identification of materials.  These newly developed THz emitting devices are useful components for commercial applications in the fields of medicine, remote sensing, bio-chemical detection, and security.  This project resulted in the graduation of a student with the Ph.D. degree, and supported a presentation about light emitting devices to students and teachers at a local high school.
