<AbstractNarration>The project will develop Hodge theory and apply it to problems in algebraic geometry, number theory and representation theory.  The researchers intend to focus on four related topics: (1) Mumford-Tate (MT) domains, (2) moduli spaces, (3) algebraic cycles and the Hodge conjecture, and (4) mixed Hodge modules.  (1) MT domains are classifying spaces of Hodge structures, and, roughly speaking, the boundary components of Mumford-Tate domains parametrize degenerations of Hodge structures.  The PIs intend to advance number theory, representation theory and algebraic geometry by studying Mumford-Tate domains and their boundary components.  For example, the PIs plan to extend work of Carayol, which seeks to associate Galois representations to automorphic representations whose archimedian component is a degenerate limit of discrete series.  (2) The second topic concerns the realization of moduli spaces of geometric objects as quotients of discrete groups.  An example of such a realization is the moduli space of non-hyperelliptic genus 3 curves, which can be realized as a ball quotient, where the 6 dimensional ball in question sits in the MT domain of K3 surfaces.  However, there are not many examples of this type known.  The PIs intend to look for more.  (3) The third topic involves the approach to the Hodge conjecture via normal functions and their singularities due to Green and Griffiths. The PIs will develop this approach in several directions.  For example, they will study the archimedean height function associated to a normal function, and they intend to study the non-reductive MT groups associated to normal functions.  (4) Finally, the PIs will develop a flexible theory of complex variations of mixed Hodge modules and apply it to questions arising in representation theory.  In particular, they would like to understand the structure of conformal blocks viewed as complex mixed Hodge modules on the moduli spaces of stable curves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hodge theory is a central area of algebraic geometry with roots in the the classical (19th century) theory of special functions and period integrals.  From a modern point of view, the goal of Hodge theory is to relate topological invariants of algebraic varieties to arithmetic and analytic invariants.  The central notion is that of a Hodge structure on the cohomology groups of an algebraic variety.  While the cohomology groups are purely topological, depending only on the shape of variety, the Hodge structure is a much more sensitive invariant. Consequently, the Hodge structure carries a great deal of important algebro-geometric and number-theoretical information.  The most famous unsolved problem in algebraic geometry is the Hodge conjecture, a question about the relationship between the Hodge structure of the cohomology groups of a variety and the existence of certain subvarieties.  This focus on the relationship between topological objects and finer analytic invariants is typical of Hodge theory as a whole, and it is the main motivation for the research supported by this FRG.  This research will consequently impact several areas of mathematics including number theory, algebraic geometry and representation theory.  Owing to the number of techniques involved, the PIs have a diverse set of skills and points of view.  An important component of the FRG will be devoted to conferences, which will exchange ideas between the PIs and train postdoctoral fellows and graduate students in a wide range of topics having to do with Hodge theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Intellectual Merit:    Two classical problems in algebraic geometry are to understand the moduli space of curves of a given genus, and to understand the structure of the divisors on a fixed curve modulo linear equivalence. Hodge theory provides a natural framework in which to study both questions via the Torelli theorem and the Abel-Jacobi map.  For higher dimensional varieties, the question of construction of an appropriate moduli spaces of varieties of a given type, and the study of algebraic cycles on a fixed variety remain topics of active research.  Hodge theory again plays a central role, providing an often complete local description of the moduli space (Torelli type theorems) and various refinements of the Abel-Jacobi map which give a wealth of information about algebraic cycles modulo rational equivalence.      One basic way to construct projective varieties is to consider double covers of the projective plane branched along a collection of curves.  Essentially, this amounts to gluing two copies of the projective plane together along the collection of curves.  The PI and postdoc Zheng Zhang proved a Torelli theorem for bidouble covers of the plane branched along the union of a quintic curve and a pair of lines.  Similar constructions can be made in higher dimensions.  One case which the PI considered with Zheng Zhang and Radu Laza were double covers of projective 4 space branched along the union of a hyperplane and a cubic 3-fold.  In this case, we obtained a Torelli theorem and a detailed description of the corresponding moduli space using Hodge theory and a more algebraic technique called geometric invariant theory. To each smooth projective variety X, Hodge theory attaches a collection of abelian groups H^{p,q}(X) where p and q run from 0 to the dimension of X. The Hodge conjecture asserts that every rational element of H^{p,p}(X) arises from an algebraic cycle of codimension p on X. The Hodge conjecture (formulated in the 1940's) has its origins in the work of Solomon Lefschetz, who proved the case p=1 in 1924 using the technique of "normal functions" (related to the Abel-Jacobi map).  In 2007, Phillip Griffiths and Mark Green proposed a program to prove the Hodge conjecture by showing that normal functions arising from Hodge classes always acquire a specific type of singularity.  In 2017, the PI and Patrick Brosnan proved that the existence of such singularities can be detected via the asymptotic behavior of an associated metrized line bundle.   In principle, this result allows for techniques from differential geometry to be applied to the study of the Hodge conjecture. A number of more technical results related to the fundamental symmetry groups of Hodge theory (Mumford-Tate groups) and the topology (monodromy representations) of families of algebraic varieties were also obtained during the course of the project.  Perhaps the most easily stated, significant result of the project in this area is the following: The simple Lie groups occur in 4 infinite families of matrix groups along with 5 exceptional cases.  A variation on a question of Serre asks if the exceptional Lie group G_2 arises via the monodromy representation of a family of algebraic varieties. The PI and Matt Kerr obtained a positive answer to this question in the form of an explicit family of varieties.    Broader Impact: In addition to the core group of 5 faculty members and 12 graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, the project hosted 7 public workshops involving 15 outside experts who gave both public lectures at the host institution and collaborated with the members of the project.  The project also hosted one large conference with roughly 100 participants and 4 smaller conferences with 20 to 40 participants each.  Through these events, a large number of early career researchers were exposed to some of the latest advances in the subject.
