<AbstractNarration>National Parks are full of interesting and unusual STEM features which often intrigue visitors whose questions are answered by park personnel. In addition to the natural features, there are often researchers in the parks gathering data and conducting experiments. Park personnel are not apprised of these studies yet are often questioned about them. This collaborative project?s goals are to derive a mechanism to educate the park personnel so they can respond to the visitor?s inquiries. Collaborators include the National Park Service (NPS), TERC, Winston-Salem State University, and the park personnel at Carlsbad Caverns National Park. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The plan is to work through the park interpreters who are employees of NPS and often are the voice for explaining the park?s natural features. For this project, the interpreters and researchers will collaborate on the explanations of the science and TERC will work with the interpreters on interacting or educating the public visitors on the research. This is a pilot study to determine how best to bridge the scientists and their research to the park visitors. Evaluation on all elements in this study will be done by Char Associates and the Institute for Mathematics and Science Education at New Mexico State University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this study are to determine the issues in explaining the research to the park interpreters and thence to the park visitors. If successful, it is anticipated that a model will be developed in collaboration with the NPS for use in other National Parks.</AbstractNarration>

The project aims to advance STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) learning opportunities at Carlsbad Caverns National Park (CCNP) in New Mexico. iSWOOP brings together science learning researchers, scientists, and National Park Service (NPS) interpreters to incorporate site-based science into programs for the public. Drs.

Once focused on maintaining land and building scenic roads, NPS will now play a strong role in informal science learning. iSWOOP expands our understanding of STEM learning in informal settings and supports the NPS in fulfilling its evolving educational vision by enhancing interpreter-visitor interactions and providing interpreters with:</p> <ul> <li>Direct      contact with scientists doing research in the park in an interactive      format;</li> <li>Field-based experiences,      increasing their awareness of scientific park-based research;</li> <li>Compelling      visual data which can function as a jumping off point for STEM learning;</li> <li>Ongoing      opportunities to reflect on and then improve their interactions with      visitors.</li> </ul> <p>Results show that iSWOOP was successful in: increasing interpreters&rsquo; science knowledge and skills for disseminating scientific research to park visitors; engaging visitors in examining visual data, making observations, and raising questions related to park-based research; and piloting a model with transformative potential for other national parks.</p> <p><em>Broader Impacts:</em> <br /> With more than 400 units, our national parks are the site of a great deal of research because they are protected places. While millions of Americans have visited a national park within the past few years (approximately 500,000 people visited Carlsbad Caverns National Park last year), most won&rsquo;t have the opportunity to hear about the scientific research occurring on site. Thanks to iSWOOP, interpreters at CCNP are working to change this reality by giving visitors a view into the questions and technologies at work.</p> <p>iSWOOP at CCNP allows visitors to engage with park rangers to discuss the relevance of park based science for policy and decision making. Every night at CCNP, visitors ask how many bats there are. Thanks to iSWOOP, the rangers at CCNP are able to tell a rich story beyond a number. Now, when visitors ask how many bats there are, rangers have a number, a story, and visual support. They can show a video showing the bats&rsquo; flight while a computer program counts each passing bat. They can tell the story of how Drs. Hristov and Allen and collaborators figured out and fine-tuned a methodology using thermal cameras and computer vision. They can also show graphs to illustrate fluctuations by season and precipitation. Through its focus on active research, iSWOOP builds?public awareness of scientific processes and research,?and reveals aspects of parks and their species that are complex and beautiful.</p> <p>This &ldquo;Pathways&rdquo;-level project has informed the research team and contributed to the refinement of a professional development model that is now being implemented and validated with new
