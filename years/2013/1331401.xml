<AbstractNarration>This award will support the planning for a scientific software Institute in the area of computational chemistry.  Molecular simulation is an integral part of contemporary chemistry due to its broad adoption by academic researchers and industries that use molecular mechanics and dynamics methodology to advance their science.  The major molecular software programs have been downloaded by every major research university and biotech and pharmaceutical companies, and their wide usage is well exemplified by the ~30% of awarded cycles on the NSF XSEDE platforms.  However, development, testing, and validation of biomolecular simulation software, and the realization of high-throughput production runs made available on various hardware architectures, is something that the user community wants and requires, but is not something that has been adequately supported in a sustained way in the academic environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planning meetings  will enable invaluable graduate training by inviting local graduate students in the computational sciences and provide them an opportunity to understand the landscape of research opportunities at the interface of cyberinfrastructure and biomolecular sciences. The second workshop will examine education, outreach and training opportunities that an Institute of such scale and scope provides. The blueprint for the Institute will highlight multiple inter-disciplinary research problems and agenda; collectively, this will contribute to the training of the next-generation computational scientists and application-oriented cyberinfrastructure experts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Through a series of two workshops we worked with the biomolecular science simulation community to analyze the existing software and associated state-of-the-art, as well as anticipated problems. This project was focused on the conceptualization of a molecular simulation Software Institute that could bring to the computational chemistry community the abilty to advance new software initiatives. The conceptualization  workshops had multiple specific aims: First of all, they aim to help define a scientific vision that can be realized by a molecular simulation Software Institute; they also help to define the scope of services of the Institute, that is what are the existing tools and frameworks that are already well&shy;developed in the computational chemistry community but need further support, to define what are the gaps and missing capabilities that could be delivered by a Software Institute.          Three main observations emerged from the workshops: (i) An unique characteristics of (bio)molecular simulation software is that, model and methodology development are very tightly integrated with software development.  (ii) Rate of growth of software and software need is greater than the resources that can be used to support and sustain their development; (iii) Both the "unique" and general aspects point to a technical need for greater software coordination across the molecular science community, as well as for coordination of the needs of this community with other domains.
