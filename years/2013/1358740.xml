<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) and the EPSCoR Program both at the National Science Foundation supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah. The REU program will include joint and parallel activities with other STEM REU programs in the College of Science, which includes programs in the Department of Physics and Astronomy, the Materials Research Science &amp; Engineering Center (MRSEC) and the Center for Science and Math Education (CSME).  Synergistic activities will include career development events, tours of scientific facilities, optional training sessions on various modern instrumentation, as well as extracurricular outings. Students will give oral presentations beginning with their arrival on campus, to group meetings throughout the program, and culminating with an oral presentation at a final, celebratory Symposium and Poster Session.  Overall, the REU program aims to foster a sense of confidence in discussing and practicing chemistry by: (1) Providing undergraduates with transformative research experiences in innovative chemistry projects under the guidance of faculty members in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Utah, (2) Educating students about their career options and providing them with a positive image of a career in chemistry, (3) Exposing students to the greater scientific community by having our REU researchers interact with other researchers in the College of Science, many of whom will be outside of their immediate field of study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Site will offer research internships that will focus on catalysis, the unifying theme of the collaborative REU. The department's strengths span the entire spectrum of catalytic chemistry and these strengths have been consolidated to offer the REU students an interconnected program designed not only to teach them about catalytic chemistry but also to provide them with a needed foundation in the fundamentals of chemistry and chemical research. A career-development workshop as well as optional training workshops that cover modern chemical instrumentation will be offered. Built into the program are opportunities for the students to hone their communication skills, both oral and written, and a comprehensive evaluation model has been created to assess how effective the REU program is at increasing a students' ability to present scientific data.</AbstractNarration>

As a consequence, we applied to the NSF five years ago for funding our REU program that was loosely centered on catalysis in Chemistry. The focus of the program that was ultimately funded was to provide opportunities for undergraduate students to carry out state of the art research. Over the course of the first three summers of this program, we believe that we have had success in this mission. Using funds from the NSF we have successfully recruited 29 students from predominantly undergraduate institutions to the University.  We have also been able to leverage our NSF funds to obtain additional local funding to bring in an additional 22 students as a means of enhancing the overall experience. Among these 51 students were 25 women, 5 African Americans, 6 Hispanic Americans, 1 Native American, 4 Asian Americans, and 1 Pacific Islander.  Indicative of the University of Utah's commitment to the undergraduate research experience is the community of undergraduate research that has grown at the institution.  A consequence of our position as members of this community is that our REU cohorts not only learn and develop relationships in Chemistry, but they also learn from other members of the community, many of whom are not scientists.  Also indicative of our commitment to the students is that they are not only given opportunities to develop technical and analytical skills but they are provided with ample opportunities to develop professionally and to build their interpersonal and communication skills. These developments not only come as a consequence of interacting with like-minded Chemists but, because of the interdisciplinary community mentioned above,  to non-Chemists as well.
