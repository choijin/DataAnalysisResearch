<AbstractNarration>There is a growing demand at Auburn University for an on-campus cyberinfrastructure that can enable high-speed communication for data-intensive scientific simulation and analytics applications. The lack of a high-speed network cyberinfrastructure on-campus has significantly constrained the growth of multidisciplinary data-driven scientific research. Such a cyberinfrastructure is important for interdisciplinary data analytics at Auburn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project constructs a cutting-edge campus-wide network infrastructure called TigerSphere.  It deploys a fabric of 10 Gbps switches to connect colleges, schools, research centers at Auburn via dual 10 Gbps links, increasing the connection bandwidth from all colleges/schools to the Auburn backbone by 20 times (from 1 Gbps to 20 Gbps), and the bandwidth of edge networks at colleges/schools by 100 times (from 100 Mbps to 10 Gbps). In addition, TigerSphere includes a new fiber circuit of 10 Gbps to national scientific networks such as Internet2, enabling high-bandwidth, large-volume data movement from and to national data/computing centers. Furthermore, TigerSphere substantially improves Auburn University cyberinfrastructure for multidisciplinary research and training activities, particularly for data-intensive scientific computation and analytics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This network infrastructure has broader impact in several aspects, such as improving Auburn network infrastructure with a high-speed ubiquitous TigerSphere, promoting multidisciplinary collaborations within Auburn University and with nearby organizations, enhancing research training activities and broadening the participation of under-represented students in professional computing careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project implemented a high-speed network fabric called TigerSphere at Auburn University. TigerSphere  is compliant with the renovation of the  Auburn backbone network that multiplied the bandwidth to all edge devices by 100 times to  10Gbps, and the link bandwidth from the OIT backbone to all colleges and  schools by 20 times to 20Gbps.  In addition, this project allowed the development of a 10 Gbps fiber circuit that connects TigerSphere to  Internet2 and enhances the external connectivity of Auburn University  from 1 Gbps to 10 Gbps, thereby enabling high-speed, large-volume data  transfers from and to national data/computing centers.  Auburn University has multiple research centers that require very large data transfers: the College of Veterinary Medicine (CVM), the MRI Center, and Pharmacy School.  TigerShpere has improved 1) the on-campus connectivity of CVM, MRI Center, and Pharmacy by 100 times from 100 Mbps to 10Gbps and 2) the external connectivity of Auburn University  by 20 times from 1Gbps to 20Gbps, out of which 10Gbps is dedicated for  TigerSphere.  TigerSpehere improved the user experience.Auburn CVM and the MRI center reported that all their network  performance related issues have been solved.
