<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemistry Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program and co-funding from the Chemistry Research and Facilities (CRIF) Program, Professor John Hemminger from University of California Irvine and colleagues Regina Ragan, Matthew Law, Reginald Penner and Daniel Munn will acquire a combined X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) and scanning Auger microprobe (SAM). The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) XPS and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) depth profiling, SAM, and UPS studies of solar cell absorbers and device stacks; (b) characterization of metal oxide and metal chalcogenide nanocrystals for photocatalysis; (c) ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), XPS and AES depth profiling studies; (d) manganese dioxide nanowires for ultra-high capacity and rate capabilities for lithium cathodes; (e) correlating surface functionalization and transport properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes; and (f) dynamics of thermally-grown oxides in power generation and propulsion materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;X-ray photoelectron spectrometers are used for chemical analysis. The XPS technique quantitatively measures elemental composition, empirical formula, chemical state and electronic state of the elements in a given material. A sample is irradiated with a beam of monochromatic X-rays and the kinetic energies of the resulting photoelectrons are measured and related to specific elements. XPS often plays a crucial role in defining the system under study. The technique requires the use of ultra-high vacuum conditions. In Auger electron spectroscopy, energetic electrons emitted from an excited atom are analyzed to provide information on surfaces.  The work to be carried out by these investigators represents a wide array of systems requiring surface characterization. The instrumentation will be used in research activities and also for research training and education of a large number of students from diverse backgrounds.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award supported the purchase of&nbsp;an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) and scanning Auger microprobe (SAM) instrument, the Kratos AXIS Supra, to be installed in the Laboratory for Electron and X-ray Instrumentation (LEXI) at the University of California, Irvine (UCI). XPS and SAM are complementary methods that fulfill an essential need for all materials chemists, physicists, and engineers: The determination of the chemical composition and chemical state of a surface. The University of California, Irvine (UCI) campus had no XPS or SAM instruments accessible to faculty, students, postdocs, or outside users. Demand for XPS&nbsp;and SAM at UCI &nbsp;has grown as the number of research programs centered on materials on our campus more than doubled over the past 10 years.&nbsp;The project included detailed plans for: 1) The administration of this XPS/SAM instrument as part of LEXI, including dedicated space for this instrument, its installation, and staff oversight; 2) The training of new users &ndash; both external and internal; 3) A maintenance plan; 4) The promotion of the expanded capabilities of LEXI, including a new XPS and SAM capability, to surrounding colleges and universities; and 5) The creation of a low-cost fee structure for LEXI that provides for low-cost access of the facility for ALL academic users, both internal and external, as well as industry. The addition of the Kratos AXIS Supra to LEXI supports our larger ambition to develop LEXI and the new Irvine Materials Research Institute (IMRI) as a regional center for materials characterization serving both academic institutions and industry located in Orange, San Bernadino, and San Diego Counties.</p> <p>The Kratos AXIS Supra XPS/SAM instrument enables transformative research in the fields of chemistry, physics, biology, materials science, and engineering for academic and industry users throughout Southern California. Since its installation in April 2015, 84 users have been trained on the instrument, using it to advance their research. To date, the research programs of 23 UCI faculty (58 student and postdoc users), 12 non-UCI faculty (19 users), and 7 companies (7 users) throughout Southern California have benefitted by access to this powerful surface science instrument. Many of the academic programs are funded by NSF in the areas of chemical sensing, superconductivity, plasmonics, solar energy conversion, battery electrode materials, and propulsion materials.&nbsp;Total use since training began in June 2015 is approximately 433 experimental sessions totaling 2343 hours. This use has resulted in the publication of 6 peer-reviewed papers, plus 5 papers submitted or in press and at least 6 presentations at scientific meetings. Papers have been published utilizing data from the instrument in the areas of solar water splitting, batteries, photovoltaic materials, corrosion science, and electrocatalysis.&nbsp;The addition of the Kratos AXIS Supra XPS/SAM system to LEXI has added a new dimension to the materials characterization capabilities accessible within this facility, opening new avenues for scientific inquiry and creating game-changing capabilities for scientists and engineers at UCI and the surrounding institutions.</p> <p>In addition to its impact on science, the instrument has played an important role in education and training on campus and within the broader community. A professional surface scientist was hired to oversee the operation and management of the instrument and to facilitate users' science and education. The staff scientist instituted a Users Group of students and postdocs at UCI that meets regularly to discuss surface science techniques, experimental approaches, data analysis and interpretation, and to share experience in using the instrument, including problem identification and problem solving. In addition, UCI hosted the 2016 Kratos Users Meeting on May 23-25, 2016, attended by 40 people from across the U.S. and Europe. The meeting included two special-focus workshops and 4 speaker sessions with 9 presentations by Kratos Application Specialists covering Kratos' newly developed technologies and 10 presentations by users on results from Kratos instruments. UCI provided the space for the meeting, facility tours for two groups of attendees, and demonstrations with the latest spectroscopic and imaging technologies on the Kratos AXIS Supra. These and other ongoing activities serve to introduce underrepresented groups to exciting scientific research, improve materials characterization teaching, training, and learning, and promote graduate education in STEM throughout the Southern California region.&nbsp;We will continue to expand the number of users and the scientific and educational impact of this instrument in the coming years.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/29/2016<br>      Modified by: Matthew&nbsp;D&nbsp;Law</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1338173/1338173_10275446_1480458916431_Supra2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1338173/1338173_10275446_1480458916431_Supra2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Kratos AXIS Supra"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1338173/1338173_10275446_1480458916431_Supra2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Kratos AXIS Supra"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The Kratos AXIS Supra multi-technique surface science instrument in the LEXI facility at UC Irvine.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Matt Law</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Matthew&nbsp;D&nbsp;Law</div> <div class="imageTitle">Kratos AXIS Supra</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1338173/1338173_10275446_1480458969318_Supra3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1338173/1338173_10275446_1480458969318_Supra3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Supra"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1338173/1338173_10275446_1480458969318_Supra3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Supra"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The Supra?s glove box, for air-free sample preparation and transfer.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Matt Law</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Matthew&nbsp;D&nbsp;Law</div> <div class="imageTitle">Supra</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
