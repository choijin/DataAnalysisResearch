<AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;This project will experimentally investigate electronic properties of GaAs-based semiconductor nanostructures which are driven out of their equilibrium state by microwave radiation or dc electric fields. In particular, electrical resistance of such a device can oscillate drastically with the applied magnetic field and even vanish under certain conditions. By exploring similarities and differences between microwave- and dc field-induced effects, the project will develop a method to obtain detailed information on the correlation properties of the disorder potential, which will have a direct impact on other fields, such as high-mobility MBE growth. The educational component of this project rests on the development of research-based educational resources and direct involvement of students at all levels and from a variety of backgrounds in cutting-edge research to ready them for careers in nanotechnology industry, government, and academe. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Understanding electronic properties of semiconductor quantum devices becomes increasingly important as miniaturization of modern integrated circuits approaches a point where quantum effects come into play.

In particular, electrical resistance of such a device can oscillate drastically with the applied magnetic field and even vanish under certain conditions. By exploring similarities and differences between microwave- and dc field-induced effects, the project will develop a method to obtain detailed information on the amount and type of impurities in the device, which will have a direct impact on other fields, such as epitaxial growth of high-purity semiconductor nanostructures.
