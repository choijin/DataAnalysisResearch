<AbstractNarration>This action funds Melinda A. Yang of University of California Berkeley to conduct a research project in Biological Sciences during the summer of 2013 at the Ancient DNA Laboratory of Jilin University in Changchun, Jilin Province, China.  The project title is "Determining the Genetic Relationship among Early Bronze Age Peoples in the Central Plains of China." The host scientist is Professor Hui Zhou.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study applies a population genetic approach to analyze ancient population structure in geographically restricted regions and explore changes through time from ancient populations to the present day. The research focuses on human populations of the Shang (~1600-1027 BC) and Zhou (1027-771 BC) dynasties from the Central Plains of Early Bronze Age China. It compares ancient genetic material from Shang and Zhou bone specimens to each other and to modern East Asian samples to test the hypotheses that the Shang and Zhou are biologically distinct and that these ancient populations fall within the genetic diversity of present day East Asians.  Ancient DNA is being extracted at Jilin University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, the EAPSI fellowship will strengthen academic ties between UC Berkeley, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, and Jilin University. The research conducted under the fellowship is directly relevant to the history of China. The research will be communicated to Chinese populations near Jilin University and in the Bay Area of the United States. The results will be developed into a lesson to for grade K-5 students in the Bay Area Scientists in School program, of which the Fellow is an active member. The research will also be shared with scientists in archaeology and biology at conferences such as the International Symposium of Biomolecular Archaeology and the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution.</AbstractNarration>
