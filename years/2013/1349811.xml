<AbstractNarration>Dr. Curtis Williams has been awarded an NSF EAR Postdoctoral fellowship to carry out a research and broadening participation plan at the University of California - Davis. The investigator will determine noble gas systematics and develop models of mantle convection to better constrain the formation, location, and preservation of the source region for mantle plumes. Ocean island basalts (OIBs) represent the surface manifestation of plumes that originate in the lower mantle; as such, OIBs provide valuable information regarding chemical structure and dynamics of Earth's lower mantle. The study of noble gases in OIBs is crucial to the understanding of the chemical composition and structure of Earth's lower mantle, the understanding of Earth's accretion, its subsequent differentiation and degassing, and the formation of the atmosphere. Dr. Williams will contribute to the training of the next generation of Earth scientists by being a role model and engaging students from under-represented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This investigation will use noble gas systematics of OIBs to: [1] constrain the source region of the primitive noble gases in the lower mantle; [2] document the heavy noble gas signature of enriched mantle components and understand the genetic relationship between the different components as determined from the noble gases; [3] use dynamic models of mantle convection to understand the preservation of chemical heterogeneities and whether the degree of entrainment of a dense basal layer in the lower mantle is consistent with geochemical observations in mantle plumes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A grand challenge in Earth Science has been to understand how geochemical characteristics of lavas at the Earth?s surface relate to the location and formation history of specific regions in the Earth?s interior. For example, the location and mechanism for preserving a primordial reservoir, as characterized by low 4He/3He ratios in several oceanic basalts, is still unknown, although several models have been postulated. Geophysical studies of the lower mantle have identified two nearly antipodal large, low shear-wave velocity provinces (LLSVPs) that are inferred to be chemically distinct continent-sized piles sitting atop the core-mantle boundary. Here, we use recent tomographic models, simulations of mantle flow, and the helium isotopic composition of oceanic basalts to document the source region hosting low 4He/3He material in the mantle. We demonstrate that once the deflection of plume conduits by ambient mantle flow is considered, a strong correlation emerges between 4He/3He ratios in oceanic basalts and seismically slow regions at the core-mantle boundary. The correlation implies that the lowest 4He/3He material is spatially limited to the seismically slow regions in the deep mantle and the reservoir is hotter and/or compositionally denser than surrounding regions.  The primitive xenon and tungsten isotopic signatures associated with the low 4He/3He material then require the seismically slow region to have formed during Earth?s accretion.
