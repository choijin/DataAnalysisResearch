<AbstractNarration>The ongoing revolution in next generation sequencing technologies and large-scale structural genomics projects has led to dramatic increase in genomic sequences and protein structures. This has brought biological research into a data-driven era, where computational methods and facilities are needed for handling and analyzing the huge volumes of data. In this project, the PIs develop a cloud computing infrastructure called A Biology Cloud (ABC) to support research in the areas of bioinformatics and computational biology. ABC is built based on the OpenStack, which is supported by more than 180 large companies and has quickly become the standard for cloud infrastructure. ABC will enable researchers at North Dakota State University (NDSU) to conduct pioneering research in their respective fields and promote and facilitate cross-disciplinary collaborations among them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, the PIs implement comprehensive educational plans to develop excellent academic programs at NDSU and to provide new research and educational opportunities for students. Through a variety of outreach activities, the PIs introduce modern technologies to high school students and the public to enhance their interest in STEM.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
