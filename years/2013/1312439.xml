<AbstractNarration>This NRC project proposes to explore an improved data system about teacher preparation that follows up on a prior NRC report, "Preparing Teachers: Building Evidence for Sound Policy". Activities conducted through the project include a set of commissioned papers that develop proposals for the essential components of such an indicator system,critiques of the current state of teacher preparation,a planning workshop to explore the ideas in those papers, and a panel presentation at the American Educational Research Association (AERA) annual meeting to discuss the proposals, critiques and possible revisions to the framework. The project is carried out by the NRC's Board on Testing and Assessment and the Board on Science Education with input from the AERA leadership. It is anticipated that following this exploratory work, a larger project would be developed.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual merit. The grant activities provided a structured development of ideas through an iterative process that included a wider range of participation from the first convening to the next. The project involved leading researchers and policymakers in discussions about how to improve teacher preparation data. It advanced the discussion about improving the data infrastructure related to teacher preparation by detailing the program components that need to be measured, studied, and tracked and analyzing possible mechanisms for doing so.  Broader impact.  The project's primary product--an article submitted to Issues in Science and Technology--urges the creation of a high quality, efficient, and effective data system for teacher preparation. If such a system were to be created, it would provide relevant stakeholders with a much-needed mechanism for answering some of the most fundamental questions about teacher preparation. Most importantly, such a data system would build capacity for teacher preparation providers to improve their programs based on useful and credible data that can be compared and benchmarked. Those improvements, in turn, could lead to the development of a teaching workforce that is well prepared to meet the heavy burden of educating our nation's children and developing the next generation of human and intellectual capital.
