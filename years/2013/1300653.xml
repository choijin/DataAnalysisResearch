<AbstractNarration>Through this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms - B Program of the Division of Chemistry, Prof. Susan A. Odom from the University of Kentucky will seek to improve the stability of radical cation forms of aromatic molecules used as redox shuttle electrolyte additives for overcharge protection in lithium-ion batteries. The lifetimes of the radical cations in a variety of solvent environments, including carbonates used as battery electrolytes will be characterized to determine decomposition products upon oxidation. Analysis of these products will determine (i) how solvent environment affects the reaction outcome, (ii) what features results in more stable radical cations, and (iii) if there is a correlation in radical cation persistence vs. the number of cycles overcharge protection in a lithium-ion battery before redox shuttle decomposition. Higher oxidation potential shuttles for new cathode materials will be synthesized and methods to stabilize the resulting radical cations, by surrounding them in protective cages and extending electronic delocalization, will be explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research project have potential to provide benefits to the scientific community and our society in the development of new materials for the improved performance and safety of energy storage materials, specifically lithium-ion batteries.  As the number of hybrid electric vehicles and the need for storage of renewable energy sources continue to grow, it becomes more important to have reliable energy storage.  Electrolyte additives that improve the safety and lifetimes of lithium-ion batteries are needed to expedite the growth of this technology for use in multiple applications. This project will expose students at different levels (high school, undergraduate, and graduate students) to scientific research, in a growing area of social and practical importance.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project supported the design and synthesis of new organic materials as additives for lithium-ion batteries. The additives type studied here, called redox shuttles, protect batteries during overcharge by limiting cell voltage. Through the structure/property relationships of various additive molecules, information was gained about their stability and reactivity. Further structural modification enabled the design of improved derivatives with more robust characteristics, resulting in overcharge protection that is among the most extensive reported to date.
