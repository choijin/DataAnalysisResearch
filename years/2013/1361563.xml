<AbstractNarration>Nanotechnology has tremendous promise in improving the human health through better imaging, diagnostics or drug delivery.  AME2014 International Congress on NanoEngineering for Medicine and Biology (NEMB 2013) will help catalyze and spur on this field by bringing together leading academics with interests in experimental and theoretical aspects of nanotechnology.  These experts will discuss topics related to improved prediction of nanoparticle delivery in the body, to novel strategies for using nanomaterials for disease detection and for construction of diagnostic platforms.  The exchange of ideas and interactions afforded by this conference will help identify problems and possibilities and will lead to new collaborations and new concepts in the field of nanotechnology and nanomedicine.</AbstractNarration>
