<AbstractNarration>There are three main topics in the proposal. The first is the study of the cohomology of abelian higher-rank parabolic actions; in particular we study the cohomological equation and cocycle rigidity for actions completely absent of hyperbolicity. The second considers the smooth action rigidity for the Cartan action on homogeneous space generated by quaternion groups by geometric method; this  complements the project of  studying smooth rigidity for higher-rank algebraic actions.  Finally, we study the general smooth action rigidity for Cartan action and parabolic action; here we apply the famous Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) method to homogenous function space. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Dynamical systems appeared first because of Newton's discovery that the motions of mechanical objects can be described by the solutions of ordinary differential equations. More generally, many other natural and social phenomena,such as radioactive decay, chemical reaction, population growth, or dynamics of prices on the market, maybe be modeled with various dynamical systems. So the subject of dynamical systems hasfound numerous applications not only in other branches of mathematics, such asnumber theory, geometry and representation theory, but also in physics, biology, economics and other sciences.The proposed research focuses on smooth rigidity results of algebraic actions, that is, the stabilityproperties related to change of parameters. The PI proposes to develop new methods and techniques from representation theory andharmonic analysis in the study of dynamical systems. The PI believes that the new tool is powerful in solving problems and inspiring new directions in dynamical systems. The PI intends to work with some graduate students and teach graduate-level course during the period of this award.</AbstractNarration>

There is an abundance of higher rank algebraic actions which do not arise from products and other obvious constructions.These actions don?t have a finite cover with a smooth factor on which the action is not faithful, not transitive and is generated by a rank one subgroup.

We study such actions and explore new ways to obtain various rigidity properties using techniques from K-theory, harmonicanalysis and representation theory.   Intellectual merit of the present proposal should be assessed on (at least) three levels. On the "lowest" level this research contributes to dynamical systems, an important field ofmathematics with many applications to almost every branch of mathematics. The projectranges from basic research in dynamical systems to interdisciplinary work on applicationsof representation theory and harmonic analysis. It improves our understanding of cocyclerigidity and locally differential rigidity of various models of homogeneous parabolic actions.  On the "middle level", by trying to develop a new frame of KAM method requiring lessspecific information,  this research project promotes the application of KAM scheme in a greater variety of settings and to a broader class of algebraic actions.  On the "highest level",  this research project brings a new view in study of dynamical systems. Differentiable rigidity results of algebraic actions, until now, werefrom examples of traditional hyperbolic or partially hyperbolic actions. However, for homogeneousparabolic actions, whose asymptotic behavior is quite different from those that exhibit hyperbolicity, only a weaker version of rigidity result was obtained for some special models.

A broader impact of the proposed research: The principal investigator gave instructions to one or two graduate students in participation in relevant research and preparationof research papers in dynamical systems (especially about application of K-theoryand representation theory).
