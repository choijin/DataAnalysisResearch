<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;Two metal-containing, multi-heme respiratory enzymes involved in the interconversion of ammonia and nitrite, an important stage in the biological nitrogen cycle, are being investigated. Cytochrome c nitrite reductase from Shewanella oneidensis catalyzes the six-electron reduction of nitrite to ammonia during anaerobic respiration. Hydroxylamine oxidoreductase from nitrosomonas europaea catalyzes the four-electron oxidation of hydroxylamine to nitrite, as part of a larger process in which ammonia is oxidized to nitrite during aerobic respiration. Under non-physiological conditions, hydroxylamine oxidoreductase can also reduce nitrite to ammonia similar to cytochrome c nitrite reductase, while cytochrome c nitrite reductase can oxidize hydroxylamine to nitrite.  The primary aim of the project is to determine how the proteins, which have broadly similar architectures, are tailored to shepherd the ammonia-nitrite interconversion preferentially in one direction or the other.  The immediate focus is on the mechanism of the multi-electron reduction of nitrite to ammonia by ccNiR. Intermediate states that form and decay during the reactions catalyzed by cytochrome c nitrite reductase are being investigated with the use of a variety of spectroscopic, electrochemical and structural techniques, most notably Laue X-ray crystallography and Laue-based time-resolved crystallography.  These relatively new techniques have enormous untapped potential. The development of these techniques is an important complementary part of the project.  The research outcome will provide a better understanding of the notoriously complicated redox chemistry of nitrogen at enzymatic metal centers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The project's highly interdisciplinary nature provides the students in research training with a wide breadth of skills that would make them very competitive when they go on to independent careers after graduation.  The project will involve an average of three undergraduate researchers per year, in addition to two high school students and two high school teachers who will perform summer research.  The graduate students funded to work on this project will also provide direct supervision for many of the undergraduates and one high school student and teacher.  The project also provides insight into the growing environmental problem of nitrogen cycle imbalance.  Ammonia (a major component of fertilizer) and nitrite  are two examples of "reactive nitrogen;" that is, nitrogen usable by many living organisms, as opposed to "elemental nitrogen" which makes up 78% of the air we breathe, but is directly usable by only a few bacteria.  Over the last 50 years the balance between reactive and elemental nitrogen has shifted significantly towards the former, as more fertilizer was generated to produce food and (recently) biofuels.  This shift is having many unintended negative consequences, which will soon have to be mitigated.  A better understanding of ammonia-nitrite interconversion would lead to the more efficient use of ammonia fertilizer, and thus help redress the imbalance.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Overview  The Pacheco-Schmidt research groups are studying two metal-containing proteins, cytochrome-c nitrite reductase (ccNIR) and hydroxylamine oxidase (HAO), that allow certain bacteria to interconvert ammonia and nitrite (Fig. 1).  The bacteria can extract energy from this interconversion, but without the proteins the process would be too slow for bacterial survival.  The primary aim of the project is to determine how ccNiR and HAO, which have broadly similar architectures, are tailored to shepherd the ammonia-nitrite interconversion preferentially in one direction or the other.   Ammonia-nitrite interconversion is a surprisingly complicated process.  Therefore, an important strategy in the project is to devise methods that allow the complete interconversion to be broken down into more elementary steps, which are then individually investigated using a variety of techniques.  Some of these techniques are well-established, while others are novel and experimental in themselves.  Most notable in the latter category are a series of techniques for time-resolved X-ray crystallography.  X-ray crystallography is one of the few methods available for determining the 3-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a biological macromolecule, by in effect providing a "3-d snapshot" of the molecule.  Time-resolved methods additionally provide an opportunity to follow the structural course of reactions by providing more than 1 billion snapshots per second.  By piecing together the snapshots taken at varying times after a reaction is initiated, "movies" of molecular changes are obtained. These relatively new crystallographic techniques have enormous untapped potential, the development of which is an important complementary aim of the project.   Exposing a protein to X-rays may cause changes in the protein structure (radiation damage). This is especially true for metal-containing proteins such as ccNIR and HAO.  In conventional crystallography the changes to the protein occur as the data is collected, providing a blurred image rather than the structure of the original molecule.  By contrast, time-resolved snapshots are obtained in such short times that there is no time for radiation damage to appear.  Consequently, these methods are ideally suited for investigating sensitive enzymes such as ccNiR or HAO, even when the proteins are not involved in any reaction.               Broader impacts   During the period from Sept 1st 2013 to August 31st 2017 this grant at least partially supported, directly or indirectly, seven graduate students, twenty two undergraduates and three high school students.  The junior researchers were often financed from alternative funding sources, such as the UW-Milwaukee?s Office of Undergraduate Research, or in the case of high school students the American Chemical Society?s "Project SEED" program; however, in all cases they were directly supervised by the graduate students funded by NSF to work on this project.  The project?s highly interdisciplinary nature provided all students with a wide breadth of skills that make them very competitive when they go on to independent careers after graduation.   The project also provided insight into the growing environmental problem of nitrogen cycle imbalance.  Ammonia (a major component of fertilizer) and nitrite  are two examples of "reactive nitrogen"; that is, nitrogen that living organisms can incorporate into biomolecules such as proteins or DNA, as opposed to "elemental nitrogen" which makes up 78% of the air we breathe, but is directly usable by only a few bacteria (Fig. 1).  Over the last 50 years the balance between reactive and elemental nitrogen has shifted significantly towards the former, as more fertilizer was generated to produce food and (recently) biofuels.  This shift is having many unintended negative consequences, such as aquifer contamination and greenhouse gas production (Fig. 1), which will soon have to be mitigated.  Results generated from this project are of interest to microbiologists that study the ecology and physiology of the microorganisms that interconvert the various forms of reactive nitrogen.  In turn, a better understanding of these microorganisms may lead to the more efficient use of ammonia fertilizer, and thus help redress the imbalance between reactive and elemental nitrogen.  Update of significant project results  The biggest breakthrough during the past funding period was the identification of reaction conditions under which complete ccNiR-catalyzed reduction of nitrite to ammonia couldn?t take place.  Using these conditions the first step in the reduction was fully investigated in isolation from subsequent steps.  In future the same conditions will allow other steps to be investigated in isolation.  Unexpectedly, discovering how complete reduction to ammonia could be blocked also revealed how the direction of nitrite reduction might be controlled.  One can see from Fig. 1 that nitrite can be reduced either to ammonia or to elemental nitrogen by way of nitrous oxide; the new results suggest that conditions that block ammonia production may also favor nitrous oxide and elemental nitrogen formation.  This finding could prove important for optimizing ammonia fertilizer use, which as mentioned above is a conceivable and attractive broader impact.
