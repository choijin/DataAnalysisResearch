<AbstractNarration>Ecologists have long sought to understand how species reshuffle into novel ecological communities during periods of major environmental change, and the consequences of this reshuffling for the services that those ecological communities provide for human society. This project capitalizes on a major historical event - massive changes in plant communities roughly 17,000 years ago - to determine the relative roles that climate change, species interactions, and fire played in the creation of novel communities. Results from this research will inform contemporary debates about the potential for climate change to create 'no analog' communities that differ fundamentally in their structure, function, and the services they provide to society.  They will also guide management practices intended to restore communities to prior states and improve our understanding of the consequences of widespread extinctions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project builds on prior evidence that plant communities changed dramatically during the last deglaciation because the extinction of large grazers released plants from herbivore suppression. New research will test the novel Megafaunal Release Hypothesis by assessing the relative importance of climate and species interactions on vegetation and fire dynamics. The investigators will collect and analyze a series of lake-sediment cores in the eastern US, and quantify relationships among independent climatic and ecological proxies within and across sites in order to test the Megafaunal Release Hypothesis. Eight new lake sites will be analyzed for indicators of past vegetation composition (fossil pollen), fire regime (sedimentary charcoal), megafaunal abundance (spores from fungi found in dung), and temperature (organic geochemistry). Broader impacts include the mentoring and training of a postdoctoral research scientist, a graduate student, and several undergraduates, and the expansion of collaborations among paleontologists, geographers, and ecologists to understand future environmental change.  All data will be made publicly available through standard community data repositories.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ About 18,000 years ago, the large glaciers that covered broad swaths of North America at the height of the last ice age began to retreat.  As they did so, forests and other vegetation types began to shift northward as climate warmed.  Fossil pollen data tell us that many of the plant communities that developed during this time contained mixtures of species not found anywhere today.  The processes that gave rise to these so-called "no-analog" communities are debated.  One set of hypotheses invokes climatic, such as a sharp rise in temperatures and enhanced temperature seasonality.  A second set of hypotheses, known as the Megafaunal Release Hypothesis, posits that these vegetation changes were caused by a wave of extinctions of large vertebrates (megafauna) that roamed North America during the ice age.  This project sought to test these ideas by developing new high-resolution records of vegetation change, temperature, and large vertebrate populations by analyzing fossil pollen, organic geochemical indicators, and fungi from animal dung preserved in lake sediment cores from the Midwestern and Southeastern United States.  By comparing multiple time series of these data, the project seeks to test the triggers for and conditions during the development of no-analog plant communities.  Work conducted at Brown focused on generating geochemical records of temperature from lake sediment cores.  In the Midwestern USA, we found patterns of temperature change consistent with the "average" changes observed in the northern hemisphere. This includes rapid warming during ice sheet retreat, followed by strong cooling during the Younger Dryas &ndash; a well-known interval of abrupt change when ocean circulation changes caused cooling in the northern high latitudes.  Temperature changes inferred from organic geochemical data are generally consistent with temperature changes inferred from fossil pollen data, and suggest overall ice age to Holocene warming of nearly 10 degrees centigrade.  In contrast, our southern sites show much lower amplitudes of temperature change, and show no evidence of cooling during the Younger Dryas.  This suggests steep temperature gradients in eastern North America developed during the last deglaciation, as well as significant spatial heterogeneity during intervals of abrupt climate change.  This, in turn, suggests that the southeastern US may have been a natural refugium for biodiversity during the last deglaciation.  Work by our collaborators is ongoing to develop records of vegetation and megafaunal populations to examine the impacts of these temperature changes on vegetation.  This project supported research training opportunities for two postdoctoral scholars, two graduate students, and multiple undergraduate students.
