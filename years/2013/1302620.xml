<AbstractNarration>This project aims at addressing the fundamental problem of how to maximize the efficiency of access to the wireless medium.  In recent years, new information-theoretic solutions have emerged, some of which can now be implemented due to technological advances.  Also, long engrained notions, such as half duplex, are being challenged.  It has been shown that through a combination of strategies at the physical layer and signal processing, full duplex systems are indeed feasible. These developments have radically altered the very notion of what a spatio-temporal resource is.  These developments have necessitated a thorough redefinition and appraisal of the problem of efficient access as addressed in this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the years, developments have taken place in parallel and somewhat in isolation in the physical layer community and in the protocol community. By bringing together a broad-spectrum of expertise from both areas, this project envisages fundamental advances in wireless networking at the access layer.  The core challenge is how to use the scarce resources of 'space' and 'time' as efficiently as possible.  In addition, distributed operation, channel fading, time-varying channel conditions, and fast time-scales of transmission opportunities and decisions, exacerbate the problem.  This project has the potential of making a transformative advancement in the science of medium access.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   In this four-year project, the PIs and the students have developed multiple clean-slate techniques for accessing the wireless medium. The techniques  combine ideas from the physical and MAC layers in intricate ways. One of the major research thrust of this project was uplink communication,  which is particularly tricky to design for owing to the lack of coordination among the clients. In this problem space, we put forth a class of solutions that minimizes the amount of overhead in the wired backbone for decoding the signals from the clients. In MobiCom 2014, we put forth a  new MAC layer design titled BBN whose performance scales with the number of clients and is suited for dense deployments. In MobiCom 2016, a different design called BASIC was presented that eliminates the need for synchronization in our prior solution.  The students working on this project gained knowledge of the physical layer as well the MAC, network and application layers while working on this project.  As all our designs in this project were supported with real experimentation using software-defined radio platforms, the students learned many skills through hands-on development: Two students trained  through this project went on to join Google. The MobiCom 2014 paper on BBN was considered for the best paper award.           Last Modified: 02/09/2019       Submitted by: Prasun Sinha]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
