<AbstractNarration>The Caribbean region is a well-known hotspot of biological diversity, yet the detailed processes that generated this rich species diversity on the islands are complex and poorly understood. This project unites a team of international experts to test hypotheses about how the age and dispersal ability of various species, and the geological history of islands, interplay to generate biodiversity hotspots. The research will also test the importance of islands as sources of continental colonization, and the role of dispersal versus geological land-bridges in island colonization. This will be accomplished by surveying 15 diverse arachnid lineages and their fossil relatives, and by using phylogenetic approaches to analyze patterns of evolutionary relationships, ages of divergence, and patterns of community composition across islands.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A mega-transect across one of the world's most biologically rich archipelagos will transform knowledge of the history of the Caribbean. Many new scientists will be trained -- the project will recruit and train young diversity specialists at multiple institutions, with the central focus at the minority-serving University of Puerto Rico. These biologists will be trained in the importance of educating the public about biodiversity. The work will generate rich resources for further biodiversity research by making species data, phylogenies, range maps, specimen photographs, databases, and DNA sample data publicly available through the internet and museum depositories.</AbstractNarration>

Modern distributions of species provide clues about the historical processes that have influenced the distribution and diversification of the lineages from which they originated. The study of these processes is <strong>biogeography</strong>.&nbsp; With this funding a collaborative team centered at University of Vermont and Lewis &amp; Clark College has been analyzing biogeographical patterns of multiple Caribbean arachnid lineages . Arachnids, including spiders, scorpions and their kin, are good models for studying biogeography because they are abundant, small, and diverse. They also have range in dispersal abilities. Some can effectively fly by ballooning, while may move only a few feet in their lifetime. The central goal of our project is to infer fundamental processes that have generated biodiversity in general, and specifically the Caribbean biodiversity hotspot. The Caribbean is home to extraordinarily high numbers of species only known from the region (endemic). It is also subject to high levels of threat to species because of habitat loss. Given increasing extinction rates in areas with little knowledge of species diversity, we are at risk of losing species before we know they exist.

Some we have already, or are in the process of describing. With these efforts and specimens we (1) unified world experts with regional arachnologist around systematic analyses of lineages; (2) expanded known ranges of orders, families, genera and species of multiple arachnid lineages, and calliphorid flies (blow flies); (3) estimated patterns of relationships (phylogenies), and inferred biogeographic histories for multiple lineages.

With fossil-dated molecular phylogenies we can infer that multiple lineages, colonized the Caribbean and North American from South America via a proto-Caribbean land bridge that is proposed between 32-35 MYA (GAARLandia) (Fig 2).
