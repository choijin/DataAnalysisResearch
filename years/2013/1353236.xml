<AbstractNarration>Many scientists study collective behavior in nature at a wide range of scales; from how cells cooperate to the interaction of many individuals in ant colonies, fish schools, and even human crowds. Low-cost robot swarm systems, such as the Kilobots, can allow life scientists to investigate fundamental biological design principles of interest in a controlled but still tangible synthetic context. This educational grant is developing a two-week hands-on workshop to teach life scientists how to program collective robotics systems and how to use them in their research and classroom teaching to gain insight in their study of collective behavior.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many scientists study collective behavior in nature at a wide range of scales; from how cells cooperate to form complex patterns and structures in embryos, to the interaction of many individuals in ant colonies, fish schools, and even human crowds. A central focus is understanding how individual strategies map to collective outcomes, and how such evolved strategies adapt to failures and new environments. Understanding such collective behavior is a grand challenge accross multiple disciplines today, including both life sciences and engineering disciplines like robotics.   The goal of this educational grant was to develop and run a week-long hands-on workshop to teach life scientists how to program collective robotics systems, using the Kilobot robot swarm, to gain insight in their own study of collective behavior. The objective of the workshop is to provide life sciences researchers a concrete physical and tangible platform for modelling collective behavior principle,  for the purposes of interdicisplinary research, education and outreach. In addition, the workshop produced a freely available set of curriculum materials including a web-based proggramming tool and a set of structured labs with solution codes.  Two workshops were run: The first was held at the UCSF Center of Synthetic and Systems Biology (Aug 2014, 25 participants) with biologists who mainly study experimental cell biology. The second was held at the NJIT Biological Sciences Department (May 2015, 11 participants) with biologists who study collective animal behavior. In both cases, the partners retain a permanent 100-Kilobot testbeds to use for their education and research. Both workshops were a tremendous success with highly engaged particpants, and both culminated with demonstrations of complex collective behavior from the specific science division's interests.
