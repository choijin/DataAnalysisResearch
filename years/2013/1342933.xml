<AbstractNarration>This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 13-country initiative on global change research through the Belmont Forum and the G8 countries Heads of Research Councils. The Belmont Forum is a high level group of the world's major and emerging funders of global environmental change research and international science councils.  It aims to accelerate delivery of the international environmental research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. The G8 Heads of Research Councils developed a funding framework to support multilateral research projects that address global challenges in ways that are beyond the capacity of national or bilateral activities. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders.  This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working together in an inaugural call of the International Opportunities Fund, the Belmont Forum and G8HORCs have provided support for research projects that seek to deliver knowledge needed for action to mitigate and adapt to detrimental environmental change and extreme hazardous events that relate to either Freshwater Security or Coastal Vulnerability.  This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries and that bring together natural scientists, social scientists and research users (e.g., policy makers, regulators, NGOs, communities and industry).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports research activities that will create a better understanding of the underlying socio-ecological adaptation processes in coastal regions that facilitate effective adaptation to coastal vulnerabilities. Adaptation practices can have long term and unintended consequences for the vulnerability of society, specific stakeholders, and/or ecosystems. Understanding how feedbacks occur between risk from biophysical changes, cognitive processes and adaptation practices can facilitate more effective adaptation strategies. This project will adopt a socio-ecological systems approach to model practices and feedbacks in response to climate change in three coastal regions in France, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. This will be done by assessing interactions among (1) actual risks posed by climate change; (2) cognitive factors such as perceived risk and adaptive capacity; (3) adaptations; and (4) situational learning where decision makers and stakeholders participate in modeling processes.  Multi-scale models, ranging in scale from individuals to regional planning bodies, will be developed to study cognitive shifts that contribute to adaptation practices. This project will contribute toward improving vulnerability and adaptation assessment and decisions by focusing on the way decisions are made and the long term implications consequences of decisions and practices.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Coastal settlements around the world are especially sensitive to multiple simultaneous stressors. Changing demographics and migration are bringing intense settlement pressure and demands for amenity services to coastal regions. At the same time, coastal regions are experiencing changing weather patterns that are bringing more intense storm events and flooding.  Addressing these challenges requires that we develop a better understanding of the economic, social, and ecological vulnerabilities faced by coastal communities so that we can develop effective management strategies and design built infrastructure to enable them to adapt to change.  This project contributes to improving this critical understanding through a comparative study of three coastal communities facing multiple challenges: Cornwall, England; Languedoc, France; and Eden District, South Africa.  The project team assessed vulnerabilities and adaptations across these three case studies at three scales: the focal scale of a local social group, individuals? cognitive frames, and regional coastal planning processes.  Through these comparative case study analyses, we were able to highlight key practical policy issues that must cope with 1) potentially high levels of economic inequality that can emerge in coastal systems, 2) highly variable perceptions and values across different stakeholder groups; i.e.,  newcomers to the region and second home owners focused on amenity values versus permanent residents concerned with their local livelihoods that can impede efforts for effective governance, and 3) events that occur on extremely disparate time scales such as the slow processes of coastal erosion or salt water intrusion and very fast processes such as storm surges and flooding.  The connection of distant and local populations links vastly different spatial scales while the connection of slow and fast processes links vastly different temporal scales. Our analysis documents how these connections increase interdependencies between multiple scales of social organization, blurring the frontiers between previously distinct policy processes of, for example, urban settlement, coastal defenses, and the management of high-value natural parks and refuges. This clash of policy processes then raises the issue of responsible devolution of governance authority and of coordination between multiple users, infrastructure providers, and management agencies.  Taken together, the analysis suggests that even though communities may be able to reach a common vision, the complexity of coastal systems that function at sharp ecological boundaries, socio-economic disparities between haves and have-nots, and the multiplicity of management agencies involved makes realizing that vision difficult.  The experience from the Garden Route District in South Africa suggests that rallying around a particular organizing principle, in this instance ecological infrastructure, may provide a means to move from theory to practice in the governance of complex coupled human-natural systems. Whether natural, cultural, ecological, or built infrastructure, managing complex coastal systems may require organizing around some unifying feature to link multi-scale processes in a coherent adaptation strategy.
