<AbstractNarration>This supports the 2013 Space Weather Workshop to be held in Boulder, Colorado on April 16-19, 2013. This annual workshop brings together representatives of industry, academia and government to present papers and discuss issues related to space weather. This is one of the few opportunities for the broad community interested in space weather to get together.  Emphasis at the workshop is on the impacts of space weather on technology including communications, navigation, spacecraft operations and electric power. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to bringing the three communities interested in space weather together this workshop invites both undergraduate and graduate students. This provides the students with information on research developments and on how that research is relevant to operations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ UCAR Visiting Scientist Program: Space Weather Workshop 2013 The Space Weather Workshop is an annual conference that addresses the remarkably diverse impacts of space weather on todayÃ†s technology, including communications, navigations, spacecraft operations, aviation, and electric power. The Space Weather Workshop also focuses on identifying the highest priority needs for operational services that can guide future research and identifying new high-value capabilities that can be transitioned into operations. The 2013 Space Weather Workshop was held in Boulder, Colorado, on April 16-19, 2013. It was attended by approximately 229 representatives from research centers, the commercial space weather services sector, international organizations, and several federal government agencies. The workshop promotes undergraduate and graduate exposure and participation in space weather related science by inviting a select number of students to attend the workshop each year.  The workshop highlighted recent progress in large-scale modeling efforts and new developments in Sun-to-Earth coupled modeling systems. Researchers had the opportunity to discuss relevant research in many areas of the space environment. The workshop included plenary sessions, poster sessions and a roundtable discussion about growing the space weather enterprise.  Attendees of the Space Weather Workshop shared information on the following key topics related to Space Weather:  The economic effects of geomagnetic storms on electric utilities, commercial aviation services and satellite navigation systems such as GPS. The international coordination of space weather activities from space weather service organizations around the globe. Advances in space weather modeling, and the emerging needs of the operational and forecasting community. The development and implementation of spacecraft and instruments of value for both research and operations. Recent research regarding solar cycles past and present and long term trends in space weather.   A roundtable discussion led by a panel represented by distinguished members of the public and private sector focused on improving community visibility. The discussion highlighted some of the important events and achievements across the space weather community, discussed their current status, and examined ways to collaborate for better understanding and funding.  Keynote speakers included Dr. Conrad C. Lautenbacher, Jr., GeoOptics, Inc., and former NOAA Administrator, and Mr. Josh Hopkins, Lockheed Martin Space Systems.  The complete 2013 Space Weather Workshop agenda, including all of the presentations given, can be found at: http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/sww/schedule_w_presentations13.html The workshop is important because it brings together the space weather community to share information among researchers, service-provider agencies, private-sector service providers, international organizations, space weather information users, and government agencies. The program contributes to improving knowledge about space weather impacts in several areas, including communications, navigations, spacecraft operations, aviation, and electric power.
