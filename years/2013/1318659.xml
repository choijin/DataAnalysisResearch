<AbstractNarration>It is generally recognized that protecting online privacy is important, with modern society manifesting this concern in many ways. Preliminary research indicates that third parties, with modest crawling and computational resources, and employing simple data mining heuristics, can potentially combine online services and publicly available information to create detailed profiles of the users living in any targeted geographical area.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research investigates measures that can significantly improve privacy protection of users, while not degrading their overall Internet experience. The focus is on less-trustworthy third parties (e.g., data brokers, advertisers, spammers, malware distributors, and pedophiles), who can scrape, aggregate and infer information from many different online and offline sources. This research has two interrelated research thrusts. First, it explores to what extent third parties can collect, aggregate, and statistically process information from OSNs and other online and offline sources to create profiles. This thrust is developing rigorous statistical methodologies and probabilistic models for estimating the degree of potential privacy leakage. Second, this research investigates a variety of privacy policies that governments can establish, and a wide range of measures OSNs can take, to reduce the privacy risk. For promising combinations of policies and measures, this research quantifies the trade-off between privacy protection and usability.</AbstractNarration>

We showed how parents who post photos of their babies and children can inadvertently leak - through inference techniques - private informaiotn of their children. We showed that anonymous usesrs on Twitter exhibit significantly different behavior than non-anonymous users. We showed that location-based social networks can often be exploited by 3rd parties to determine the exact location of users, and to de-anonymize users in anonymous services like Yik Yak. The research led to 13 research papers on privacy and anonymity, covering a variety of different Internet applications, including Facebook, Google, Twitter, eBay, mobile dating services such as Tinder, and anonymous mobile apps such as Yik Yak.
