<AbstractNarration>CBET - 1335884&lt;br/&gt;Cesar I. Torres&lt;br/&gt;Arizona State University&lt;br/&gt;                           &lt;br/&gt;This project will address our need to better understand solids hydrolysis by anaerobic microorganisms, focusing on municipal wastewater sludge.  Solids hydrolysis is a crucial, rate-limiting step in wastewater sludge treatment; while it is also important for many bioenergy processes, such the production of biofuels from cellulose.  Given the complexity of wastewater sludge, solids hydrolysis encompasses many individual processes that are difficult to resolve.  The lack of comprehensive and highly resolved data from biological experiments has led to insufficient validation of existing models for sludge hydrolysis.  The use of a microbial electrochemical cell (MXC) anode, powered by anode respiring bacteria (ARB), provides a new alternative to probe microbial hydrolysis kinetics events with a much greater precision and higher temporal resolution than current methods based on methane production.  An MXC allows us to measure respiration rates of the ARB at a very high temporal resolution (&lt; 1 minute) by measuring their electric current. Simultaneous monitoring of solids and soluble microbial hydrolysis components along with current production will enable the accurate measurement of transient hydrolysis rates with a deeper elucidation of the underlying mechanisms.  High resolution MXC data, along with analytical measurements, will provide a strong basis for describing lag times for hydrolysis of the three main components of solid organic matter: carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids.  Through the data collected, this project aims to develop an updated, comprehensive solids hydrolysis model for municipal sludge and other solid wastes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The knowledge obtained through this project is crucial to improve the optimization of current technologies in which solids hydrolysis is a rate-limiting step.  The project focuses on wastewater sludge, a complex waste that requires solid hydrolysis for its treatment and disposal.    However, the solids-hydrolysis models developed can also be used in other applications, such as bioenergy technologies that utilize a solid substrate (e.g., cellulose).  A comprehensive solids hydrolysis model can allow environmental engineers to better predict the performance of anaerobic digesters and will be essential to understand how new technologies will perform in the wastewater treatment field.  For example, sludge pre-treatment technologies are emerging in the wastewater field as a means to improve the rate of solids hydrolysis.  Thus, this project will use MXCs as rapid high throughput tools to identify the best pre-treatment technology for a given solid waste. While we use MXCs to learn new insights on microbial kinetics, they also become a teaching and learning tool, thus broadening the impacts of our research.  Microbial electrochemistry can be epitomized as a tool to study microbial kinetics in complex systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The studies in this project allowed us to understand the mechanistic bases of microbial hydrolysis kinetics that are of great importance to the environmental engineerign field.  Based on comprehensive data collection through biochemical methane potential (BMP) assays and microbial electrochemical cells (MXCs), we refined wastewater sludge hydrolysis models for existing and emerging technologies in wastewater treatment.  Current methods and models were based on discrete data collection and lower hydraulic retention time (&lt;3 days) despite the operation of anaerobic digestion at longer retention time (&gt; 20 days).  We also proposed MXCs as high-throughput resolution tools to rapidly select pre-treatment technique(s) that positively impact microbial hydrolysis steps for a given waste type.  Our research also unveiled a potentially transformative method to carry out BMP assays without an anaerobic inoculum to understand the upstream hydrolysis and fermentation processes in response to a pretreatment technique.  Through these experiments, we demonstrated the benefits of measuring microbial metabolic rates of upstream anaerobic microbial processes through MXCs, which minimize accumulation of intermediates like volatile fatty acids and thus help characterization of the initial hydrolysis steps.  We also demonstrated the integrated use of tools and methods such as High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), particle size analysis, and Gas chromatography in tandem to augment the current and electron capture data from the MXCs. Many technologies for treating high-strength wastewater at high-rate (or lower retention time) have been recently developed, such as upflow anaerobic sludge blanket, anaerobic membrane bioreactor other than MXCs. Our significant research outcomes will spark interest and imagination in researchers from these other technologies to make impactful contributions to the field.  As we proposed to use MXCs to learn new insights on microbial kinetics, they also became a teaching and learning tool, thus broadening the impacts of our proposed research.  We built a demonstration MXC which was used as a vital learning instrument in a graduate/undergraduate course in chemical and environmental engineering at Arizona State University titled, Fuel Cells and Biofuel Cells.  We also reached the specialized MXC research community by updating my laboratory website to include protocols, procedures, and designs that are relevant to MXC research.  The MXC community can benefit from these postings and a comment section allows visitors to discuss or suggest modifications to the posted methods.  Through this proposal, we put current efforts to integrate undergraduate and high school research in our laboratory.  Undergraduate students were assigned specific tasks under the mentorship of graduate students.  Undergraduate students were recruited through the Fulton Undergraduate Research Initiative (FURI) program at ASU and the Swette Undergraduate Sustainability Internship at the Biodesign Swette Center for Environmental Biotechnology.
