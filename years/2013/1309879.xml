<AbstractNarration>This action funds Andres Felipe Osorio of University of California, Berkeley to conduct a research project in ENG during the summer of 2013 at Hokkaido University in Sapporo, Japan.  The project title is "Material Flammability in Microgravity Environments." The host scientist is Professor Osamu Fujita.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fires in spacecrafts are dangerous scenarios given the confined space and the risk for astronauts onboard. Understanding the effect of microgravity in fires is an important step towards developing a better knowledge of fire prevention and mitigation in space. This project develops a better understanding of how microgravity conditions affect the flammability of materials when compared to normal gravity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, this project will help developing content in the form of pictures, videos, presentations, etc. that can be used to showcase that space-funded research is not only relevant to space agencies but something the general public can relate to.</AbstractNarration>
