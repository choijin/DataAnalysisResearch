<AbstractNarration>This project will develop and test a non-traditional method to measure the time-varying heat content and vertical temperature profile in high-latitude seas, shelves, and fjords using pressure-sensor-equipped inverted echo sounders (PIES). PIES, which are installed on the seafloor below the reach of destructive iceberg keels, present a promising and inexpensive way to improve understanding of fjord dynamics and shelf-fjord interactions and will increase long-term monitoring capabilities in high latitudes where remoteness and harsh conditions hamper traditional in situ observation techniques. The use of PIES to characterize variability at high latitudes is a novel repurposing of an existing technology, but rests on the same principle as the traditional blue-water uses for PIES: due to the dependence of sound speed on temperature, the surface-to-bottom round-trip acoustic-travel-time associated with reflections between the PIES and the air-sea interface is an excellent proxy for heat content in the intervening water column. Furthermore, since reflections from seawater-ice interfaces are also detected when ice is present, PIES also provide a means to characterize the ice component in high-latitude systems. The PIs propose to develop these methods with existing PIES data collected in a 1-year test deployment in Sermilik Fjord in eastern Greenland and with observations to be collected in a 2-year deployment of three PIES in the fjord and on the nearby shelf.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Icebergs form when the face of a marine terminating glacier calves sending huge chunks of ice into the sea (Figure 1). Icebergs flux freshwater from ice sheets to the sea, they track and influence ocean circulation in the fjords, and sometimes they destroy instruments along the way.  At the head of Sermilik Fjord in southeastern Greenland is Helheim Glacier, a prolific iceberg producer.  Helheim?s icebergs are advected through the fjord to the East Greenland Shelf. Some of Helheim?s glaciers have deep reaching keels and those keels can wreak havoc on oceanographic instrumentation in the fjord. With funding from the National Science Foundation (PLR-1332911), we have been working on ways to study the fjord environment with instruments that can be deployed on the seafloor, safely out of reach of the iceberg keels.     Our team has been using pressure-sensor equipped inverted echo sounders (PIESs) to study the heat content and iceberg dynamics in Sermilik Fjord (Figure 2). A PIES rests in a rigid anchor stand on the seafloor (well out of reach of iceberg keels) and emits 12 kHz pings, typically at a rate of 24 per hour (in bursts of 4 at ten-minute intervals). The PIES listens for each ping?s first echo and records the round-trip acoustic travel time. In addition PIESs measure bottom pressure and bottom temperature.     In ice-free environments this first echo usually comes from the air-sea interface directly above the instrument. In this case, the bottom-to-surface round-trip acoustic-travel-time serves as an excellent proxy for the heat content (vertically-integrated temperature) of the overlying water column. This is due to the temperature dependence (and to a lesser extent salinity dependence) of sound speed in seawater. If ice is present, the first echo may reflect from the seawater-ice interface rather than the air-sea interface. In this case, the PIES is often able to track the iceberg keel as it transits through the PIES?s field of view.  When land-fast sea ice is present over the PIES, the standard deviation of the 4 pings in a burst is typically very low since the ice suppresses surface gravity waves. Sermilik Fjord is typically open (not covered by land-fast sea ice), but our mid-fjord PIES detected a 2-week period of sea ice cover in March 2012. This link provides access to the project website which includes links to data and to numerical codes: http://heatandice.whoi.edu.     Analysis of the data shows that:  1) Icebergs in Sermilik Fjord are frequently subject to strongly sheared flows over the range of their draft.  2)  Icebergs move predominantly with the integrated ocean currents, and are able to move fastest when their drafts are around the depth of the interface between the upper and lower fjord layers.  3) The shear felt by icebergs has a leading order impact on their velocity and melt rate, suggesting that this should be taken into account when modeling the motion and melt of icebergs.     The data records from Sermilik Fjord inspired a set of laboratory experiments. Key results from the lab experiments and comparison with the field data are that:  1) Novel laboratory measurements of ice block melt rates reveal a nonlinear dependence on flow speed, associated with attachment of side melt plumes.  2) In a homogeneous ocean, meltwater spreads at the surface for attached melt plumes and mixes as deep as the ice draft for detached plumes.  3) Including this regime transition in a parameterization of iceberg side melt improves agreement with melt observations in a Greenland fjord.     Comparison of the PIES records with contemporaneous temperature and salinity data from a nearby mooring shows that acoustic travel time (measured by the PIES) serves as an excellent proxy for heat content in the fjord (as calculated from the mooring data).
