<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program that is co-funded by the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program, Professor Christopher Abelt from College of William &amp; Mary and colleagues Deborah Bebout, Elizabeth Harbron, Robert Hinkle and Jonathan Scheerer will upgrade a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer with a new console, probe and autosampler. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) stereochemical analyses of oxacyclic products obtained during synthetic and mechanistic studies of oxocarbenium ions; (b) synthetic, and biosynthetic studies of biologically active, polycyclic natural products; (c) examination of host-guest complexes between fluorophores and cyclodextrins; (d) studies of solution dynamics related to metal toxicities; (e) fluorescence modulation in photochromic polymer systems; (f) search for therapeutic tools with an expanded genetic code; and (g) examination of new catalysts for solar hydrogen generation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research involving undergraduate and master students. Such training with state-of-the-art NMR instrumentation will enhance the professional readiness of graduates entering competitive doctoral programs and those seeking employment in the chemical industry.</AbstractNarration>

The results from such NMR studies were incorporated into publications, and they had impacts in synthetic organic, synthetic and inorganic chemistry, as well as biochemistry.  The instrument was used by five principal investigators and three senior personnel and their respective research groups.  Over the grant period, the NSF award was directly acknowledged in seven publications in chemistry journals involving twenty student coauthors.  The instrument was also mentioned in the experimental or supplementary information sections of an additional seven publications with twenty-seven student coauthors.  The instrument was used by all chemistry majors in a physical chemistry experiment.        Last Modified: 08/12/2016       Submitted by: Christopher J Abelt]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
