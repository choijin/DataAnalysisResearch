<AbstractNarration>The National Science Foundation grant to the Rutgers University Intermediate Energy Nuclear Physics group will enable studies of the structure of the nucleon.  We will study neutrino scattering from nuclei at the Fermilab National Accelerator Facility (FNAL).  We will also investigate quark distributions within the nucleon with the SEAQUEST experiment at FNAL.  We will participate in several upcoming experiments at Jefferson Lab with the upgraded 12 GeV electron beam.  Finally we are preparing for an experiment to scatter muons and electrons from the proton (MUSE experiment at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland) in order to investigate the proton radius, which has puzzled scientists in recent years because of inconsistent results with different techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the scientific impact, this work will serve to train both undergraduate and graduate students, as well as post-doctoral researchers, in the methods of scientific research. This training in fundamental research provides a strong basis for careers in and outside of physics. Our students and post-docs have successfully moved to varied careers in medical physics, homeland security, and finance, as well as continuing in fundamental research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Our efforts are focused on understanding the structure of protons and neutrons, and how the description of them and their interactions changes from using quarks and gluons to using nucleons and mesons. We also work to better understand the interaction of neutrinos with nuclei.  The project made significant progress in improving the understanding of the neutrino-nucleus interaction, using the MINERvA detector at Fermilab.  Most notably, measurements of quasi-elastic scattering, in which the interaction knocks a single nucleon out of the nucleus, of neutrinos and antineutrinos from carbon show significant deviations from current models, which are based on the quasi-elastic scattering from single nucleons.  In addition, measurements of deep inelastic scattering, where one or more mesons are produced, on nuclei ranging from carbon to lead showed an unexpected nuclear dependence.  In addition to providing information to better understand the interaction, these data will also help improve the empirical models used to help understand neutrino oscillation experiments.  The project successfully obtained data in the SeaQuest/E906 experiment at Fermilab. When analyzed, these data will significantly improve our understanding of how quarks are distributed in nucleons, and how the distributions are changed in nuclei. The primary broader impact has been the training of students and post-docs.  There was one completed PhD and one to be completed soon as a result of this project.  In addition, four post-doctoral fellows, and several undergraduates were trained during the grant period.        Last Modified: 09/28/2017       Submitted by: Ronald D Ransome]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
