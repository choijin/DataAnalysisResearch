<AbstractNarration>Research will be carried out on various aspects of stochastic spatial models taking place on regular lattices and on complex networks. (i) With Ted Cox and Ed Perkins, the author has studied voter model perturbations. This work will be the starting point for studying evolutionary games with weak selection in order to try to resolve some recent conjectures of Martin Nowak. (ii) The proposer has studied various processes on random regular graphs in joint work with Shirhsendu Chatterjee. The main thrust of the new work will consider process on graphs with more general degree distributions, but we will also consider models in which a threshold of more than one neighbor with a different opinion is needed for an individual to change. (iii) A third theme is to study networks in which the state of the system and the connections in the network coevolve. This work leads to difficult questions about stochastic evolutions on the space of all labeled graphs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The world around us is spatially structured. In biological systems, organisms and infections only spread over short distances. Social systems have a network structure that is described by a graph with vertices being individuals and edges between those that interact. Connections between individuals may extend over large physical distances, but diseases, opinions, and new technologies spreading due to the interactions between an individual and their neighbors in the graph. Most mathematical analyses ignore spatial or network structure because its inclusion greatly complicates the analysis. However, as our past work with Simon Levin and others has shown, incorporating spatial structure changes the outcome of ecological competition. Our new work will focus on how spatial structure changes the impact of frequency dependent selection, and how the network structure of a social system changes the behavior of processes that occur in it. The models are idealized but the results give valuable insights about real systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The intellectual merit of the research lies in the dozen research papers were written in the two year period funded by the grant. We focus on two areas where the impact has been the most significant: the use of spatial Moran models in studying cancer and beginning to develop some theory for so called Hybrid Discrete systems which are a lattice based stochastic model coupled to PDE.  1. Spatial Moran model. Our goal is to understand the accumulation and spread of advantageous mutations in a spatial stochastic model of cancer initiation on a lattice. The parameters of this general model can be tuned to study a variety of cancer types and genetic progression pathways. This investigation contributes to an understanding of how the selective advantage of cancer cells together with the rates of mutations driving cancer, impact the process and timing of carcinogenesis. These results can be used to give insights into tumor heterogeneity and the ``cancer field effect,'' the observation that a malignancy is often surrounded by cells that have undergone premalignant transformation.  In follow up work Foo., Leder,  and Ryser used this theory to make quantitative predictions about the cancer field effect in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC). This in turn leads to recommendations about the size of excision margins needed to prevent recurrence and predictions about the probability of a distant recurrence unrelated to the original tumor. Ryser is continuing work in this direction in collaboration with surgeons at Duke.  2. Hybrid discrete models.  In  a paper called Fingering in stochastic growth models we considered a version of RichardsonÆs growth model in which there is one nutrient, oxygen. Only cells with enough oxygen can give birth. Hypoxic cells die. There is a threshold &theta;, which gives the amount of oxygen needed (as a fraction of the maximum possible) in order to survive. We show that when &theta; is too large, fingering, as seen in diffusion limited aggregation, occurs. This threshold is &frac12; for the version in which the oxygen levels are computed from the geometry of the cluster, and 0 for the hybrid discrete model. We cannot establish this rigorously, but we have extensive simulations and some heuristics to back up this conclusion.  In a second paper called chemical mediated coexistence., we introduce a generalization of evolutionary games in which cells produce and absorb chemicals, and the chemical concentrations dictate the death rates of cells and their fitnesses. Our long term aim is to understand how the details of the interactions in a system with n species and m chemicals translate into the qualitative behavior of the system.  We studied two simple 2 by 2 games with two chemicals and revisited the two and three species versions of the one chemical colicin system studied earlier by Durrett and Levin (1997). We found that the behavior of our new spatial model can be predicted from that of the mean field differential equation, but it can have different behavior from lattices models in which sites interact with only their nearest neighbors. The results for the analogue of the three species colicin game were surprising: when diffusion is added the three equilibrium ceases to exist.  The main broad impacts of this research are the insights it provides into cancer. However during this period, Durrett mentored two postdocs, saw a Ph.D. student graduate, began working with two new Ph.D. students, and mentored an undergraduate who wrote a paper on "Estimating cancer growth rates in vivo."
