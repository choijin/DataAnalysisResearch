<AbstractNarration>This project explores the potential for enhancing students' interest and ability in STEM disciplines by broadening fourth grade students' understanding and interest in the spatial perspectives inherent in geography and other science disciplines.  The study incorporates the latest developments in the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) within the classroom. The project tests a set of hypotheses that posit that the use of GIS in the classroom results in a measureable improvement in students' spatial reasoning and motivation. Geography teachers in elementary schools are trained to use GIS software to create digital maps specific to the subject matter and projects on which their students work. Students then work in small collaborative groups and engage in open discussions designed to enhance the development and use of their spatial and multi-step causal reasoning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;GIS has been used in middle and high school settings. This project introduces GIS to upper elementary grades particularly to allow students an early opportunity to be involved in meaningful data and map-driven activities to promote their spatial skills.  The proposal team predicts that the traditional gap between girls and boys in spatial skills will shrink with training thus will be strongly pronounced in the experimental relative to control groups. The project documents the effectiveness of instructional practices that are likely to enhance multistep reasoning, systems thinking, conceptual and spatial understanding, and motivation for learning while learning to work with maps to solve problems involving geography and ecological awareness. The project develops instructional methods that incorporate innovative tools for promoting problem solving to address real-life issues in this increasingly technology-driven era. The innovative tool is open-source and designed for professionals, but it can be modified to be child-friendly. Classroom activities are integrated with science and social studies curricula and content standards. Teachers are expected to find the curriculum attractive and easy to implement.</AbstractNarration>

The curriculum engaged students in collaborative problem solving while concurrently developing their technology skills, independence, and confidence. We also developed training materials for participating teachers including video tutorials, lesson plans, answer keys, and more. All materials were available <a href="http://qgisteacher.weebly.com/">online</a> for teachers to use at any time.</p> <p class="Standard">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eleven teachers worked with us during the past three years (2013-2016). Eight of those teachers engaged in an in-depth training program to bring our curriculum to eleven classrooms in four urban schools. In addition, three teachers in a rural school district worked with us to pilot our curriculum and training program. Half of the classrooms were trained to use GIS during the fall semester while the other half served as controls, waiting to implement the GIS curriculum during the spring semester. Participating teachers, students, and administrators have responded extremely positively. Students reported that they liked the activities, learned a lot from them, and felt more comfortable with computers after completing the curriculum. Teachers reported that the curriculum excites and engages students, provides students opportunities for success, and allows them to engage students in high level reasoning.</p> <p class="Standard">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another way of <strong>broadening the impact</strong> of our project came from the teachers themselves. Teachers in two schools independently organized Open House events to which they invited parents, school board members, and district personnel to showcase what the students learned through the GIS curriculum. A local TV channel covered one of these events. Our project was also featured by a regional radio station and two local news outlets at Illinois State University. Moreover, we forged lasting partnerships with teachers &ndash; three teachers at one of the schools we worked with are working to adopt a STEM approach in their 5<sup>th</sup> grade classrooms, integrating our curriculum with other innovative approaches. We look forward to working with this school as a model for adapting science instruction to the <em>Next Generation Science Standards</em> while engaging students in innovative activities.</p> <p class="Standard">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our project also met the NSF criteria for <strong>intellectual merits</strong> by the results it achieved. We used a number of assessments to measure the impact of our curriculum on students&rsquo; thinking. Our results indicated that the students who completed our GIS program outperformed the students in the control classrooms on two assessments: map-focused questions from the National Assessment for Educational Progress items and a standardized cognitive ability test. On a transfer activity, the GIS-trained students were able to mentally overlap four maps simultaneously to find precise solutions to a problem while the control students seem to have interacted with each map independently without a clear articulation of a solution. Moreover, the GIS-trained students outperformed the control students in the ability to connect and compare maps and locations, overlap maps, and realize spatial patterns. In one pilot study, the GIS-trained students reflected significant improvements in their thinking by integrating different factors that might impact a problem. In another, the GIS-trained students discussed spatial information that was both local and global and provided more explanations than the control students. All together, these results indicate that introducing advanced mapping technology in upper elementary grades has clear cognitive and affective benefits for students.</p> <p class="Standard">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of our in-depth assessment of participating students and teachers, we have an extensive data set with which to evaluate the impact of our curriculum, our professional development models, teacher support structures, and how to improve innovative curriculum and assessment of similar curriculum going forward. As we continue to explore our dataset, we look forward to further analyzing student interest and confidence in the use of technology and students&rsquo; ability to transfer what they learned into new fields. We also plan to analyze hours of video recordings of student interactions to learn more about how students collaborate to solve problems when using technology and how teachers use the technology to help students understand aspects of the nature of science.</p> <p class="Standard">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With 14 presentations at local and national conferences since August 2014, we have been heavily engaged with the <strong>broader research community</strong> in STEM education, spatial thinking, geography, and science teaching. We look forward to contributing further to that community with a number of publications in the coming year as we continue to analyze our data. Through conferences and events like the NSF 2016 Video Showcase &ldquo;Advancing Stem Learning For All&rdquo;, we have initiated a dialog with other research teams that we believe will yield deeper and richer understanding of how the broader community can better support teachers and create better, rigorously tested activities designed with students in mind.
