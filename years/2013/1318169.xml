<AbstractNarration>This Rapid Research Grant (RAPID) project will collect perishable storm surge and structural damage data in three communities caused by Hurricane Sandy that made landfall on October 29, 2012. Hurricane Sandy affected large areas of coastlines of New York and New Jersey. The storm was judged to be Category 1 based on its wind speed. However, the hurricane affected millions of people living along the east coast of the United States. The research will document storm surge and structural damages in three communities in the New Jersey coastal area that are located within 12 km along the coast. The three communities are selected on the basis of different levels of damage experienced by each of the communities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The novelty of this research is in its focus on three coastal communities. The communities are located within 12 km along the coast; however they experienced different levels of damage. The collected data will improve our fundamental understanding of surge propagation over a developed coast and can produce effective coastal hazard mitigation strategies. High-resolution GPS-based surveying methods will be employed to capture the location and elevation of high water marks and any scour or sedimentation adjacent to structures. Elevation and location data will be supplemented with digital images of measurement location, local topographic changes, and a description of structural failure mode. The collected data will provide modelers an opportunity to investigate the development of overland wave and surge propagation through the built environment. In addition, this will provide engineers fundamental insights into the hydrodynamic loads on coastal structures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In October of 2012, Hurricane Sandy made landfall along the Atlantic coast of New Jersey.  Some areas of the coast, such as Atlantic City escaped with only minor damage, while others, such as Ortley Beach, were almost completely destroyed.   This study examined the damages caused by Hurricane Sandy in three of New JerseyÃ†s coastal communities: Sea Girt, Bay Head and Mantoloking.  These locations were specifically chosen due to their close proximity to one another and the vast difference in damage each community endured. Sea Girt and Mantoloking form the northern and southern boundaries of the study and are located less than 12 km apart from one another.  In between lie several communities including Bay Head which was also included in the study.  In terms of relative damage, Sea Girt fared the best and experienced only a minimal amount of damage throughout the community.  Both Bay Head and Mantoloking experienced significantly more damage, with Mantoloking experiencing the most significant damage.  With a RAPID grant from the National Science Foundation, the Coastal Engineering Group within the Davidson Laboratory of Stevens Institute of Technology conducted field surveys in each of the three towns during the winter of 2013. The purpose of this RAPID grant was to collect as much relevant data as possible to improve our understanding of the response of the built environment to extreme storm surge and flooding. Data that can be used to quantify surge heights, individual structure damage, scour dimensions, and locations are quickly lost during post-storm recovery and restoration. As such, data collected during each survey included watermark elevations, structure damage assessments, and scour dimensions and locations.  These detailed measurements were then assessed to determine the failure mode of individual structures and to gain insight into the effectiveness of natural and manmade protective elements in the environment in reducing surge damage.   Preliminary results from the data analysis indicate that the most significant structural damage to buildings resulted from heavy wave impact, strong surge, or severe scour.   SandyÃ†s storm surge created two breaches in Mantoloking resulting in the greatest number of significantly damaged structures. A large portion of the community of Bay Head was protected by a coastal seawall that prevented the breaching of the barrier spit, resulting in a lower number of significantly damaged structures in that community. Less significant damage due to inundation from the Barnegat Bay was found to be wide spread throughout the communities of Bay Head and Mantoloking. Sea Girt experienced the least damage due to its location on a coastal headland and the protection afforded to the community by a wide beach and high dune system.   In addition to addressing the questions posed in this study, these data will also be used by the Principle Investigators in several storm models that will further investigate the damaging effects of Sandy along the coasts of New York and New Jersey.  The data collected under this RAPID grant will be provided to the National Science Foundation for use by future researchers. It is hoped that, in the future, as coastal communities recover and rebuild from similar natural disasters, designers and planners will be able to use the data, and modeling and assessment techniques derived from these measurements, to create communities with safer and more resilient structures and infrastructure.
