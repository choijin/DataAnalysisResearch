<AbstractNarration>It is often assumed that stress is bad, but is this really true?  Addressing this question is critical to understanding how humans and other animals respond to prolong periods of disturbance and retain the capacity to navigate the challenges of life. In this context, stress is not bad, merely an experience to navigate. This project promises to reveal the unknown processes by which animals respond to and cope with acute stress - processes that occur on the rapid timescale from seconds to minutes. The project explores the mechanisms using a combination of neurophysiology, confocal microscopy, and behavior. This approach to understanding how hormones and physiological state affects behavior provides an integrated approach to identify important research questions and design undergraduate courses. Student training is integrated with teaching at all levels and is developed through a combination of research-based courses and collaborative student-faculty research. Undergraduate researchers are involved in all stages of the project from experimental design, data collection, and analysis to dissemination through publications and conference presentations. Through involvement in the project undergraduates will be exposed to state-of-the-art research and receive close faculty mentoring. Students are actively encouraged to pursue careers in science through workshops that develop science self-efficacy, and recruits underrepresented students to research through collaboration with the Pacific Northwest Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will test the hypothesis that CORT employs disparate cellular mechanisms in a cascade that functions within a rapid time frame of ms to min. This cascade is critical for context-appropriate behavioral responses to occur because neurons respond differently to specific temporal input patterns. We know very little about the cellular mechanisms that enable rapid actions of CORT, or about the ability of CORT to affect context-dependent effects. A long-term goal of the research is to identify and characterize the multiple rapid effects of CORT on those neurons that have clear behavioral relevance. The proposed research will use in vivo single-unit and slice whole cell electrophysiology, behavior, and imaging to investigate the following questions: (1) How do hormones impact neurons on different timescales to affect the selection of context-appropriate behaviors? and (2) How do small ephemeral signaling molecules, endocannabinoids, behave as the switch upon which hormones act? Findings from these studies promise to elucidate two novel mechanisms in which CORT modulates intrinsic electrical properties of behavior-associated neurons and receptor-mediated endocytosis of behavior-regulating hormones. Furthermore, this research offers four significant broader impacts: (1) Advancing discovery and understanding while promoting authentic teaching, training, and learning, because student-training is integrated with teaching at all levels and is developed through a combination of research-based courses and collaborative student-faculty research; (2) Participation of underrepresented groups is actively encouraged through a highly impactful workshop to develop science self-efficacy, and by attracting underrepresented students through collaboration with PNW-LSAMP. (3) Enhancement of infrastructure for research and education through collaboration with an assessment expert to develop tools and methods to evaluate learning outcomes, and development of an imaging workshop for novice faculty and students in the region; (4) Broad dissemination of the findings of this work through public lectures, conference presentations, and peer-reviewed publications.</AbstractNarration>
