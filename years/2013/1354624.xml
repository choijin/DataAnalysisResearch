<AbstractNarration>A lot of scientific effort is now being focused on how plants and animals will respond to a warming climate. This is critically important, but very difficult because there are many other global changes occurring at the same time. For example, humans have widely spread large amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus, which are important fertilizers.  But what effects excess nutrients that are deposited mainly on land but then wash into aquatic ecosystems will have as the world warms is not clear.  So studies are needed that examine how multiple global changes like these interact at the same time.  The goal of this research project is to explore how freshwater ecosystems respond to warming and nutrient enrichment simultaneously.  The research is important because nutrient enrichment may drastically alter the effects of warming on streams and rivers and so the results should be useful as society tries to adapt to warmer conditions.  Results will also inform ecological theory that attempts to use basic principles for understanding how species and ecosystems may respond to global change.  An education program will be an integral part of  this project and will include the development of  film documentaries, student podcasts, and the more traditional training of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as research technicians. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will be conducted in a geothermally active region of southwestern Iceland, where streams exhibit a wide range in ambient temperature without significant differences in background chemistry that would otherwise influence results. The research team will use the differences in natural temperature between streams to examine how nutrient supply and temperature together influence the ecology of streams and rivers. The first objective is to quantify effects of warming and nutrients on the origin and fate of carbon and nitrogen (e.g., ecosystem productivity, nutrient uptake, and nitrogen-fixation). The team will then combine ecosystem-scale nitrogen and phosphorus additions with controlled streamside channel experiments to examine how the influence of warming on the ecology of streams and rivers is affected by nutrient supply, and whether short-term responses to warming differ from those observed in natural ecosystems over longer periods.  Responses of these ecosystem-level processes should also shape how energy and materials flow through food webs from algae to trout. The second objective is to quantify the interactive effects of temperature and nutrients on the routes of energy and materials through river and stream food webs. Food web responses to nutrients between streams of varying temperatures will be tracked using a combination of stable (i.e., non-radioactive) isotope tracer additions, secondary production measurements, and flow food web analyses. This research will provide much needed information about how two dominant global change drivers, warming and nutrient enrichment, interact to influence biodiversity and ecosystem function in an important freshwater habitat.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The overarching goal of our research project was to investigate the individual and combined effects of two important agents of global change - climate warming and nutrient pollution - on the structure and function of aquatic communities. Our project took advantage of well-studied natural variation in water temperature in four streams that flow through a volcanic valley in western Iceland. The four streams differ in mean summertime temperature, two being naturally cold (8.1-9.2 degrees C) while two are warmed by local geothermal activity (11.0-15.0 degrees C). The four streams are very similar with respect to other important characteristics, such as light availability and concentrations of important limiting nutrients (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus), making them ideal for independently testing the effects of temperature on stream community structure and ecosystem processes. Onto this natural temperature gradient, we overlaid a series of experimental manipulations of dissolved nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, which allowed us to examine the separate and combined effects of nutrient enrichment and higher temperatures on stream ecological processes. During the first summer of fieldwork (2015), we studied the four streams under natural nutrient concentrations (i.e., no nutrient addition). In the second summer (2016) we added phosphorus at a fixed concentration using nutrient drippers, while during the last summer (2017) we added nitrogen (the dominant limiting nutrient). The four streams were subject to a suite of concurrent measurements in each year, including description of benthic algae and invertebrate community structure, and monitoring of ecosystem processes such as primary production, ecosystem respiration and nitrogen fixation. The University of Alabama laboratories' component of the project largely involved the planning and execution of simultaneous additions of enriched nitrogen isotope (the stable isotope 15N) to the streams, which allowed us to trace the uptake and fate of dissolved nitrogen in each stream's food web. We added 15N to all four streams in a 5-day pulse in early June each year. We then followed the uptake and loss of the isotope by collecting samples at seven fixed transects in each stream prior to isotope addition and on eight dates through to mid-August. This extensive sampling effort resulted in a large number of samples, which were sorted, dried to constant mass, and then weighed and packaged into tin capsules for isotope-ratio mass spectrometry analysis at the University of Georgia's Center for Applied Isotope Studies. This work is now complete, resulting in a rich dataset of &gt;8000 measurements across the three years and four streams. We are currently analyzing these data using a new (beta version) statistical package called&nbsp;<em>isotracer</em>, which has been developed for the R computing environment. This new package promises to be a significant improvement on current approaches to analyzing data from isotope additions, as it allows the calculation of error around estimates of uptake and loss, as well as providing a means for making statistically rigorous comparisons between different experimental treatments and food web structures. As such, it represents an ideal framework for analyzing our large isotope dataset.</p> <p>Our two University of Alabama laboratories' were also involved in the second component of the project, in which we built and deployed a system of geothermal heat exchangers at the field site designed to warm a set of 30 small, artificial stream channels in which we could conduct highly controlled experiments. These experiments tested the individual and combined effects of nutrients and temperature on benthic algae by crossing a steep temperature gradient (~6 to ~24 degrees C) with different concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus. Three separate experiments were conducted (one in each year) and the complex results have formed the basis of Ms. Lyndsie Collis' MS thesis (at The Ohio State University) and a manuscript in progress. Overall, these experiments have revealed how temperature and nitrogen concentration interact to control rates of nitrogen fixation in stream biofilms. During the project, our laboratories also trained three technicians and several undergraduates (including one REU student), who were involved in laboratory tasks and fieldwork. The information gained from the project is now being disseminated via both traditional channels (conference presentations and primary research articles) and a popular project blog, which has now garnered more than 50,000 page-views.</p> <p>In summary, this project has allowed us to study the interactive effects of temperature and nutrients on stream communities at multiple scales and without the confounding effects of other factors. We anticipate that our data will also allow unique comparisons between our highly controlled channel experiments and those observed in natural, thermally acclimated ecosystems (i.e., across the four streams in the valley).</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/26/2019<br>      Modified by: Jonathan&nbsp;P&nbsp;Benstead</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1354624/1354624_10325927_1574799502054_IMG_4460--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1354624/1354624_10325927_1574799502054_IMG_4460--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Plate 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1354624/1354624_10325927_1574799502054_IMG_4460--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Plate 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Our research team collecting samples for isotopic analysis from one of the cold study streams during the 2017 summer field season.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jon Benstead</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jonathan&nbsp;P&nbsp;Benstead</div> <div class="imageTitle">Plate 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1354624/1354624_10325927_1574799615337_IMG_3721(1)--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1354624/1354624_10325927_1574799615337_IMG_3721(1)--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Plate 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1354624/1354624_10325927_1574799615337_IMG_3721(1)--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Plate 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Jon Benstead checks the drip rate from the pump delivering enriched nitrogen isotope to one of the cold stream sites used in our research project.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jon Benstead</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jonathan&nbsp;P&nbsp;Benstead</div> <div class="imageTitle">Plate 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1354624/1354624_10325927_1574799988415_IMG_4490--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1354624/1354624_10325927_1574799988415_IMG_4490--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Plate 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1354624/1354624_10325927_1574799988415_IMG_4490--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Plate 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Masters student Lyndsie Collis and REU student Heath Goertzen process algae samples collected from the streamside channel array during the 2017 summer field season.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jon Benstead</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jonathan&nbsp;P&nbsp;Benstead</div> <div class="imageTitle">Plate 3</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
