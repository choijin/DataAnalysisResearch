<AbstractNarration>The Epi-Classic is one of the most turbulent periods in Mesoamerican prehistory. Primarily due to imprecise chronological control, it is also one of the least understood. With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Paula Turkon (Ithaca College) and Dr. Sturt Manning (Cornell University) will use the "dendrochronology-14C wiggle-match" method to develop a much higher-resolution chronology than previously possible.  Though narrowly focused on the northwestern frontier of Mesoamerica, the strong connections between this and other regions will allow this project to advance the dating of prehispanic cultural changes throughout Mesoamerica&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most significant northward expansion of the Mesoamerican culture area occurred during the Late Classic to Epi-Classic Period. Theories to explain this mass movement of Mesoamerican peoples and their lifestyles into the north include political disintegration in the Mesoamerican core, climate change in this arid region, and the development of exploitive activities and trade networks. Though our understanding of this region has greatly advanced in recent years, indications of the timing and directionality of cultural influences rely on 14C dates with errors of Â± 50-90 years. This project will simultaneously address the chronology issue, and set the stage to examine the climate change theory, by employing the "dendrochronology-14C wiggle-matching" method on existing collections of archaeological wood from Epi-Classic archaeological sites in the Malpaso Valley, one of the northernmost regions on the frontier. The wiggle-match method fits 14C dates from tree-ring segments with a known number of rings onto the 14C calibration curve, producing substantially more precise dates than radiocarbon dating alone. Preliminary work on archaeological wood from the Malpaso Valley demonstrates that even short, less-than-ideal samples, can refine dating precision from a 100 calendar year range to as low as a 16 year range.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project represents the only current attempt to apply dendrochronological work on archaeological wood in Mesoamerica. The development of precisely-dated, tree-ring chronologies for the period that corresponds to the prehispanic occupation of the northwestern frontier will also allow extrapolation of variation in water availability that can, in a future project, set the stage to address the climate change theory as an explanation for the frontier's short-lived occupation relative to other regions of Mesoamerica. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide a forum for Mexican and U.S. archaeologists and dendrochronologists, a venue to train undergraduate students at Ithaca College and Cornell University, as well as provide training opportunities for Mexican students and researchers to explore the application of archaeological dendrochronology in Mesoamerica. Formal presentations by the researchers to discuss the merits of tree-ring dating and project results at workshops and universities in Mexico will both extend the call for suitable materials from existing projects and collections, and encourage the collection of wood/charcoal for tree-ring analysis. The data will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations, public lectures, and be made available in open-access databases.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>There was an important period of Mesoamerican expansion and occupation into northern Mexico - the northern frontier region - in the first millennium CE (or AD) during what is referred to as the Epi-Classic to Classic Period (ca. 200-900 CE). This area today is a relatively arid region. Why and how agricultural villages and regional centers (such as La Quemada in Zacatecas state, Mexico) appeared in a period from around 500 CE in a major expansion of Mesoamerican civilization, and then why these same sites were abandoned a few hundred years later, has been much debated for decades. Understanding this occupation history and&nbsp;the factors&nbsp;behind it is highly relevant to our own times as the southwest of the USA and the northwest of&nbsp;Mexico experience increased average aridity. A number of scholars have suggested that climate change must be behind this record of expansion/contraction - among a number of theories. What has been seriously lacking until now is a secure and high-resolution chronology for this northern expansion, so that the archaeology and key change episodes&nbsp;can be robustly placed in time and against paleoclimate and other records. Such chronological control would permit possible explanations to be investigated and tested in detail.</p> <p>Our project, aiming to be a first and preliminary attempt to demonstrate how we could obtain a high-resolution chronology for these sites, obtained samples of wood and charcoal from structural elements from several archaeological structures of the Classic period in northern Mexico and especially from two of the key sites: La Quemada and Los Pilarillos (Zacatecas state, Mexico). Although fragmentary and needing considerable time and care, we employed dendrochronological (tree-ring) approaches to record annual tree-ring sequences from several of these samples and we are able to crossdate (match sufficiently similar tree-ring growth patterns) some of these records to build site sequences and tentatively to build a larger tree-ring sequence linking La Quemada and Los Pilarillos. In the absence of a local tree-ring record from the present backwards to the Classic speriod, we then employed a technique which combines the tree-ring sequences with radiocarbon dating of specific tree-rings in this sequence (with known tree-ring = calendar years spacing between the samples) to obtain a radiocarbon (14C)&nbsp;time series that we could then best fit (or 'wiggle-match') against the known northern hemisphere radiocarbon record (built up from known-age tree-rings from other areas). Figure&nbsp;1 shows an example of this wiggle-match dating for a tree-ring sample and sequence&nbsp;(LAQ-31) from La Quemada. In this case the last preserved tree-ring of the sample can be dated 636-655 CE(68.2% highest posterior density range or hpd = most likely 68.2% probability) or 615-660 CE (95.4% hpd = most likely 95.4% probability).
