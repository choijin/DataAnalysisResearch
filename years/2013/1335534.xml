<AbstractNarration>1335534 &lt;br/&gt;PI: Codd&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magnetic Resonance (MR) techniques will be used to study flows and diffusion characteristics of both pure supercritical fluids (C2F6 and CO2) and a two-phase mixture of brine and supercritical CO2 in capillaries and in porous media. The study will proceed from relatively simple flows in capillaries to more complex ones, involving fingering instability and buoyancy-driven flows of brine-supercritical CO2 mixtures in porous media. Results will be used to determine behavior near critical points in these systems and to establish the validity of a theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Storage of CO2 in a supercritical state in earth formations (porous media) is currently being proposed as means to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere. Carbon sequestration requires the storage of CO2 in its supercritical state in contact with subsurface brines. Supercritical fluids are also used as green solvents in industrial processes such as decaffeination and enhanced oil recovery. The results of the present study will be useful in assessing the risks and in designing safer carbon sequestration and industrial processes that use supercritical fluids.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Magnetic resonance (MR) techniques allow characterization of porous materials on the ~10 &mu;m imaging scale.  However, more importantly, within this spatial resolution molecular level properties such as nuclear magnetic relaxation and translational molecular diffusion can provide nanometer scale molecular dynamic information. This allows measurements in porous media over a hierarchy of length and times scales from the pore to the system scales.  The work funded under this grant has allowed the PI to continue to advance and extend applications of MR techinques to complex fluids in porous media.   MR imaging data monitored total hydrate formation rate as a function of cyclopentane saturation and temperature, as well as allowing monitoring of the spatial heterogeneity within the system. The combination of these MR techniques allowed for exploration of the complex molecular dynamics involved in hydrate formation processes.    An ability to predict fluid dynamics and transport in supercritical fluids is essential for optimization of applications such as carbon sequestration, enhanced oil recovery, ??green?? solvents, and supercritical coolant systems. MR techniques, detect signal noninvasively from the fluid molecules. MR velocity maps and propagators (i.e., probability density functions of displacement) were acquired of a flowing fluid in several regimes about the critical point, providing quantitative data on the transport and fluid dynamics in the system.    MR techniques were used to study the capillary trapping mechanism, which is relevant to carbon sequestration. Capillary trapping is an important mechanism for initially trapping CO2 in the pore structures of deep underground rock formations during the sequestration process.  NMR techniques were used to noninvasively monitor the drainage and imbibition of air, CO2, and supercritical CO2 with DI H2O at low capillary numbers in a Berea sandstone rock core under conditions representative of a deep underground saline aquifer.  The measurement of the interplay between scale dependent hydrodynamic dispersion and structure in model porous media - relevant to subsurface processes - has been further extended.  Advances in low field MR tools have allowed the development of down-the-borehole tools for field studies.  Use of the low field Rock Core Analyzer will indicate how these low field MR tools can monitor complex fluid processes in the subsurface in future work.
