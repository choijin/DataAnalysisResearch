<AbstractNarration>Presently, there are two major methods for estimating phylogenetic trees from morphological data.  In this study, researchers will simulate morphological data and use these data to to test the effectiveness of these methods. A strength of using simulated data is the ability to manipulate relevant parameters to create data sets that are relevant to many different types of researchers and scientific questions. The goals of this project are twofold: to provide practical recommendations and guidelines for best practices in estimating phylogenetic trees from morphological data and to understand the strengths and weaknesses of various methods for estimating phylogenetic trees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Estimating a phylogenetic tree is a common way to understand the relationships among different groups of organisms. These trees can be used to understand the evolution of a trait, to test hypotheses of biogeography, or to infer other aspects of the evolution and ecology of organisms. Fossils are the only way that scientists can directly observe long-extinct organisms, making the study of fossil data a relevant practice, even as the price of DNA sequencing falls. The results from this project can be used to inform scientists about appropriate methods for inferring phylogenetic relationships from fossilized remains.</AbstractNarration>

The materials from this course are freely available on the Internet.   Summary of Work   The project examined the effects of missing data and choice of analytical method on the ability of researchers to estimate phylogenetic trees from morphological data. We accomplished this by simulating morphological data on a known (model) phylogenetic tree. Simulated characters were varied in their rate of evolution, which affects how variable a character is among the taxa in the tree. Fast-evolving characters are more likely to show parallel evolution among branches, a condition known to be difficult for phylogenetic estimation. From the initial simulated data sets, we introduced distributions of missing data that approximated the patterns of missing data present in paleontological data sets. We then used these data sets to estimate phylogenetic trees, using two different analytical methods. One method, parsimony, is the most commonly-used analytical method used for analyses of paleontological data. The other is a Bayesian method that incorporates a simple model of evolution, known as the Mk model. We assessed performance by measuring the percentage of branches in the estimated trees that were estimated correctly (i.e., matched the tree that was used to generate the simulated data).   Results   As can be seen in image one, the Bayesian method based on the Mk model produced more accurate estimates of phylogeny compared to parsimony methods when there was no missing data. In the presence of missing character data, the Bayesian method continued to outperform parsimony, as shown in image two. Since it is very common for paleontological data sets to have large amounts of missing data (sometimes in excess of 80% of characters examined), this result suggests that paleontologists should consider wider use of Bayesian estimation under the Mk model of evolution.   We also investigated the effect of data set size. Increasing data set size increases phylogenetic accuracy, as seen in image three. However, for each data set size, the use of Bayesian model-based methods was associated with lower error in phylogenetic reconstruction compared to parsimony methods.   These results are also relevant to researchers who use molecular data for phylogenetic analysis. The benefits of adding fossil taxa to a phylogenetic data set are numerous. Earlier research showed that fossils with up to 75% missing data can help improve resolution in parsimony analysis  and result in vastly improved phylogeny estimates compared to molecular-only analyses. Our results indicate that model-based analyses are likely to provide increased accuracy of these combined analyses compared to parsimony-based methods.   The results discussed here are currently in press at PLOS ONE, manuscript number PONE-D-14-32989:   Wright, A. M., and D. M. Hillis. In press.
