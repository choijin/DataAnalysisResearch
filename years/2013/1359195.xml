<AbstractNarration>The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Lehigh University provides fourteen undergraduate students each summer the opportunity to participate in research on topics in astrophysics, atomic and molecular physics, biophysics, condensed matter physics, optics, nanotechnology, plasma physics, and statistical physics.  In addition to participating in research with an experienced mentor, the REU students will engage in weekly activities to ensure not only that their research stays on track but that they have an engaging collegial and scholarly experience. By the end of the program, every student will have prepared a written report or a poster about the summer research and presented the results of the work in a 15 minute talk.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site will have a number of broader impacts with its focus on providing research opportunities to undergraduates to help prepare them for future science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers. The site has a strong plan to recruit undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in physics. The project is informed by an on-going evaluation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong>: The Physics department at Lehigh University has hosted successful summer research programs for the past 30 years. This five-year grant fully supported&nbsp;an&nbsp;average of 14 students during the years from 2014-2018 and partially supported five in 2019. The program offers a deep exposure to research for the students by immersing them in research groups that perform state-of-the-art research on a diverse set of fields of physics ranging from very fundamental areas (such as String Theory, Nuclear Physics, Astrophysics) to classical areas (such as Atomic and Molecular Physics, Statistical Physics) to areas that find applications in technology, energy and health (Condensed Matter Physics, Optics, Biophysics, Fluids, and Plasma Physics).&nbsp;More than 20 Lehigh faculty members have been involved as advisors for the program. In addition to working with their specific research advisor and group, students are also given exposure to other research programs in the Lehigh Physics department through faculty seminars, lab tours, and visits to campus facilities;&nbsp;some students&nbsp;were&nbsp;given the opportunity to work in research labs abroad at the Universities of Bordeaux, France, and Kyoto, Japan.&nbsp; This&nbsp;sought after&nbsp;program receives&nbsp;an&nbsp;average of 550 excellent applicants every year<em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>The quality of the students is very high as indicated by a high average GRE (&gt;3.6) and the productivity of the students during the program&nbsp;resulted&nbsp;in contributions to fourteen journal publications and sixty presentations&nbsp;at professional conferences.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impact</strong>: Special attention was given to the participation of ethnic minorities that are underrepresented in Physics. Through targeted recruitment strategies significant advances have been achieved both in terms of the application pool (15%) and&nbsp;the participant pool (25%). Both numbers exceed the national average of these students among physics majors (11%). In addition, 50% of participants are female, another underrepresented group. The program offered a group housing arrangement which has&nbsp;been&nbsp;one of the most successful aspects of the program. The students occupied an entire residential building&nbsp;on campus&nbsp;with a Computer Science REU group&nbsp;and&nbsp;were&nbsp;given great independence in organizing and running their living group. This&nbsp;helped&nbsp;develop a very strong group identity for the cohort, resulting in peer networks, for instance on LinkedIn, that&nbsp;have lasted&nbsp;beyond the duration of the REU program. In surveys taken by the students, the program receives very high marks.&nbsp; In particular, a significant number of students stated that they were more likely to pursue&nbsp;a research career after they&nbsp;finish college.&nbsp;These&nbsp;findings are&nbsp;reflected in the extensive statistics that the program has collected since 1989. It&nbsp;was&nbsp;found that the students who take part in the Lehigh program are very likely to pursue advanced degrees or careers in science and technology. The majority (72%) entered advanced degree programs in STEM fields as defined by the NSF.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/20/2020<br>      Modified by: Volkmar&nbsp;Dierolf</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1359195/1359195_10290071_1589985715225_REU_2019--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1359195/1359195_10290071_1589985715225_REU_2019--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Lehigh Physics REU group in 2019"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1359195/1359195_10290071_1589985715225_REU_2019--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Lehigh Physics REU group in 2019"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The group during the final research symposium</div> <div class="imageCredit">Lehigh University</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Volkmar&nbsp;Dierolf</div> <div class="imageTitle">Lehigh Physics REU group in 2019</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1359195/1359195_10290071_1589985804608_REU2018--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1359195/1359195_10290071_1589985804608_REU2018--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Lehigh Physics REU group in 2018"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1359195/1359195_10290071_1589985804608_REU2018--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Lehigh Physics REU group in 2018"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The group during the final research symposium.
