<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;#1321222&lt;br/&gt;Law&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Princeton-CEFRC Summer School on Combustion is part of the outreach program of the Combustion Energy Frontier Research Center (CEFRC), established by DOE in 2009. The week-long school, scheduled for June 23-28, 2013 on Princeton University Campus, offers courses on Combustion Theory, Combustion Chemistry, Quantitative Diagnostics for Combustion Chemistry and Propulsion, and Computational Turbulent Combustion.  After-class sessions are also scheduled to enhance the experience of the students.  The proposed funding is to provide partial support to students who will be participating in the Summer School.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Summary &ndash; NSF Award # 1321222 (Reporting Period: June 2013 &ndash; November 2013) Princeton-CEFRC Summer School on Combustion Summer Workshop Chung K. Law Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544    Objective  The Princeton-CEFRC Summer School on Combustion is part of the outreach program of the Combustion Energy Frontier Research Center (CEFRC), which is one of the 46 Energy Frontier Research Centers (EFRCs) established by DOE in 2009. The goal of the Center is to develop a validated, predictive, multi-scale, combustion modeling capability to optimize the design and operation of evolving fuels, especially biofuels, in advanced engines for transportation applications.  The Summer School program was conceived by recognizing that while combustion is an interdisciplinary subject, due to limitations at individual institutions the training received by most combustion researchers has not been sufficiently comprehensive to equip them to make breakthrough discoveries. The Summer School therefore aims to offer advanced graduate level courses to remedy this deficiency. Approach  The 2013 session was held from June 23 through June 28. Participants comprised of senior graduate students and professionals from academia, industries and government labs. World-renowned researchers were commissioned to deliver the lectures. Four 15-hour lectures were offered over 5 days, with 3 hours in the morning and 3 hours in the afternoon. The four courses and their respective lecturers were:   Combustion Theory: Moshe Matalon of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign   Combustion Chemistry: Michael J. Pilling of the University of Leeds   Quantitative Laser Diagnostics for Combustion Chemistry and Propulsion: Ronald K. Hanson of Stanford University   Computational Turbulent Combustion: Thierry Poinsot of the Institut de M&eacute;canique des Fluides de Toulouse, CNRS   Detailed lecture notes were prepared and distributed to the participants beforehand. Participants lived in comfortable dormitory setting, and had meals together in the student cafeteria, hence facilitating networking. Room and board for all US students were covered by the Center.   Relevance to NSF  Many participants were involved in research projects supported by the NSF. The enrichment of their knowledge in combustion will benefit the progress of these research projects. Furthermore, it is anticipated that many of the graduate students will become active researchers in combustion and propulsion in the future, some assuming leadership positions. This Summer School experience will undoubtedly prove useful as they carry out their responsibilities. Accomplishments for Reporting Period  180 participants from 23 states, 68 universities and 4 U.S. government labs. Of the 180 participants, about 140 were graduate students with the rest being professionals.  Participants were highly satisfied with the experience, with many laudatory feedback comments. All lectures were professional taped and are freely available to the general public through the Princeton University web-site and YouTube at http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG0Jl8zn3t4L8CnPp6DrCVw. Detailed lecture notes are freely available to the general public through Princeton UniversityÆs web-site at http://www.princeton.edu/cefrc/combustion-summer-school/archived-programs/2013-session/lecture-notes/#comp000051b309e00000019c56149d.
