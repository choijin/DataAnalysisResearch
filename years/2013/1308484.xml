<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Measurements and Imaging Program in the Chemistry Division and Chemical and Biological Separations Program in the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems Division support Profs. Stephen Jacobson and Adam Zlotnick at Indiana University to develop nanofluidic devices to study transport and assembly of virus capsids. To improve measurement precision and accurately characterize particle properties, their approach is to measure single particles multiple times and with pores having different dimensions. In this project, simian virus 40 (SV40) is used as the model system. The T=1 SV40 capsid is composed of 12 pentamers and assembles with and without nucleic acid (RNA and DNA) present. Profs. Jacobson and Zlotnick and their students use resistive-pulse sensing, which provides single particle sensitivity in real time and at biologically relevant concentrations. Resistive-pulse sensing combined with rapid on-device mixing permits observation of early time points in the assembly process and the ability to probe pentamers, intermediates, and fully formed capsids without the use of chemical labels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides a fundamental understanding of how virus-like particles assemble, which is critical in a number of fields, e.g., medicine, biotechnology, nanotechnology, and materials. The measurement techniques developed in this project can be applied to understanding a range of naturally occurring and synthetic assembly systems. Undergraduate and graduate students have the opportunity to develop state-of-the-art nanoscale fabrication, imaging, and measurement techniques. The project also teaches elementary students about millimeter, micrometer, and nanometer length scales and high school students the concepts of separation and diffusion at the micro- and nanoscale.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   In this project, we characterized assembly of simian virus 40 (SV40). SV40 capsid protein is a unique system for studying substrate-dependent assembly of a nanoparticle. We investigated the simplest case of this system where twelve pentamers and a single polyanion, e.g. RNA, form a T=1 particle.  We monitored assembly of SV40 in solution, with single particle resolution, and in real time, conducted experiments at biologically relevant pentamer concentrations, probed capsids without the use of chemical labels, and compared assembly experiments between nanofluidic devices and conventional methods.    Nanofluidic channels integrated into microfluidic devices offer a unique platform for conducting a variety of analytical and bioanalytical experiments.  We used resistive-pulse sensing, which provides single particle sensitivity in real time and at biologically relevant concentrations.  To improve measurement precision and determine various physical properties of particles, we fabricated in-plane nanochannels with two or more pores in series, optimized the geometries of the nanochannels and pores, and developed surface modification protocols to minimize particle adsorption and electroosmotic flow.     To test the roles of polyanion substrate length and structure during assembly of SV40, we characterized the assembly products with size exclusion chromatography, transmission electron microscopy, and resistive-pulse sensing. We found that a 500 nucleotide (nt) RNA had the optimal length and structure for assembly of uniform T=1 particles. Longer 800 nt RNA, shorter 300 nt RNA, and a linear 600 unit polysulfostyrene (PSS) polyelectrolyte produced heterogeneous populations of products. These data indicate that even for flexible substrates, shape as well as size affect assembly and are consistent with the hypothesis that work, derived from protein-protein and protein-substrate interactions, is used to compact the substrate.    A fundamental understanding of how virus-like particles assemble is critical in a number of fields, e.g., medicine, biotechnology, nanotechnology, and materials, and the measurement techniques developed in this project can be applied to understanding a range of assembly systems. The educational component of this project impacted students at the elementary and college levels.
