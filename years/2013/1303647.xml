<AbstractNarration>This project considers the generation of North African and Mediterranean climate anomalies by El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and Eurasian snow cover fluctuations. Two causal mechanisms are examined, one involving tropospheric teleconnections produced by Rossby wave generation and propagation (a "horizontal" mechanism), and the other involving stratosphere-troposphere interactions (a "vertical" mechanism).  The horizontal mechanism is hypothesized to consist of 1) a canonical northeastward propagating wave train that emanates from the eastern equatorial Pacific, and 2) an ultra-low frequency Rossby wave that is excited over the Pacific, trapped within the North African-Asian (NAA) jet and propagates upstream to the Mediterranean region. The vertical mechanism begins with an expansion of Eurasian snow cover, which leads to colder surface conditions and lowering of mid-tropospheric geopotential height. This in turn amplifies the wave-1 stationary wave pattern, which propagates into the stratosphere and reduces the strength of the polar vortex, resulting in a negative anomaly of the Arctic or North Atlantic Oscillation, which shifts the jet stream and storm track southward. The southward shift of the jet and storm track allows colder temperatures to invade the middle latitudes, including the Mediterranean region.  These influences will be examined through statistical analysis combined with a suite of models including a Rossby wave ray tracing calculation, a linearized barotropic model, a state-of-the-art global atmospheric model (CAM), and an atmospheric model with a well-resolved stratosphere (WACCM).  In addition, an empirical prediction scheme will be developed and tested using Eurasian snow cover and ENSO as predictors for seasonal Mediterranean precipitation and surface temperature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work has societal broader impacts due to the agricultural and other consequences of climate variability in the Mediterranean region.  More specifically, the empirical prediction scheme will be provided to operational centers including the International Research Institute at Columbia University.  In addition, a website will be developed to provide public information regarding the role of atmospheric teleconnections in producing climate anomalies.  The project will also support and train a graduate student, thereby providing for the future scientific workforce in this research area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Mediterranean Sea lies between the European, African and Asian continents.  Along its shores and within the broader Mediterranean basin civilization has flourished for over 10,000 years.  At present 21 countries with a combined population of around five hundred million people border this body of water.  Populations in some of these coastal countries have increased substantially over the last 50 years (e.g., Egypt), and this demographic growth has greatly intensified pressures on available arable lands and fisheries in the region.  And has the past several years have demonstrated, strains in this region can influence and even destabilize countries outside of this region as refugees leave the region looking for new homes.  These strains are often compounded by climate variability on interannual and longer time scales.  The Mediterranean climate is hot and arid; anomalously high seasonal temperatures or low precipitation can decimate agricultural yields and increase the burden on surface water resources.  The collective management of water resources, agriculture, and fisheries around the Mediterranean basin, as well as industry, tourism, and even human health, could be better effected if the interannual variability of the climate in this region were better constrained and could be predicted.  Such constraint requires a further understanding of the mechanisms that produce interannual climate variability in the Mediterranean region. This variability and its impact on crops and other resources underscore the need for skillful seasonal prediction of temperature and precipitation. Improved predictions can help Western countries including the United States anticipate strains on the local population around the Mediterranean basin that impact the national security of many countries.  The overall goal of the project was to explore how Mediterranean climate is affected by remote influences including El-Nino, Eurasian snow cover, Arctic sea ice and North-Atlantic climate variability. These remote influences suggest the potential for skillful seasonal forecast exists in the Mediterranean and Middle East regions.  The project used both observations and a hierarchy of models of varying complexity, to contribute to an improved understanding of these connections and to an enhanced seasonal forecast skill.  We explored the initiation of the wintertime dominant climate mode known as the Arctic Oscillation (AO), which strongly affects the climate of the Mediterranean and the Middle East.

Previous forecast methodologies have not shown any skill or accuracy greater than climatology across the Mediterranean and Middle East regions.  Atmospheric waves propagate climate and weather influences between forcing factors such as El Nino?s warming of sea surface temperature, high latitude snow cover, or Arctic sea ice on the one hand, and remote responses such as the Mediterranean climate on the other.
