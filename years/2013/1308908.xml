<AbstractNarration>This Postdoctoral Research Fellowship award to Dr. Nareg Djabrayan is supported by both the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Office of International Science and Engineering at the National Science Foundation. During the 24-month fellowship, Dr. Djabrayan will work on a project titled, "Repopulation and remodeling of larval Drosophila trachea by imaginal tracheal cells" under the sponsorship of Dr. Jordi Casanova at the Institute for Research in Biomedicine in Barcelona, Spain.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main objective of the proposed research is to understand the way cells integrate information about their identity with information received from their environment in order to coordinate their behavior in the context of an organ and the entire organism.  The project will use, as a model, the behavior of stem cells that remodel the breathing organs, or trachea, of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster during the transition from the larval to adult form.  By understanding the mechanisms that determine the identity of these stem cells as well as the timing of their transition from a quiescent state to one of active growth, this project will gain insight into the logic by which cells determine their behavior based on their identity and their environmental conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will lead to a better understanding of the controls of cell growth. Because the cells to be studied behave as stem cells that remodel and replace the larval organ with an adult organ, any information gained from the study will be useful for understanding how cells, tissues or organs are restored to normal function. As part of this project, Dr. Djabrayan will participate in workshops organized by the host institute that engages teachers from local high schools. He will also work with the Department of Communications and External Relations at the host institute to disseminate the results of the research to a broader audience via press kits and other non-technical publications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides a unique opportunity for a US scientist to collaborate with foreign scientists, and utilize the unique facilities, expertise and experimental conditions available abroad.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit:  The overall goal of the project was to understand how certain cells within a tissue retain the ability to grow under circumstances such as injury and replace lost cells.  This has implications in the understanding of stem cell biology as well as regenerative medicine.  Over the course of the project, the fellow studied how cells that make up the breathing apparatus of the larva of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster are set aside and later activated to build adult structures during metamorphosis.  This process of self destruction and regeneration mimics the situation of tissue replacement upon injury.  Through their studies, the fellow was able to understand how these cells are given their identity during embryonic development.  The fellow then understood how these cells remain quescent until the time they would be needed.  Finally, the fellow identified the hormonal signals that triggered the activation of their growth.  Furthermore, the fellow also characterized the genes responsible for the stem cell like behaviour of these cells.  These results have given insight into how cells, which are part of a functioning tissue can be made to behave differently.  They reveal the mechasim by which cellular potential is regulated and how that potential is realized for the sake of regenerative growth.  These findings will allow future researchers to develop methods to genetically activate the growth of cells within a tissue and perhaps allow for the regeneration of lost tissues.     Broader Impacts:  Over the course of the project, the fellow participated in several educational outreach programs.  The fellow acted as a teacher in the "Crazy About Biomedicine" program, which brings high school aged students into the institute to learn about and experience cell and developmental biology first hand.  The fellow developed and delivered a theoretical lecture, which introduced the students to the concepts and methods of the research.  This was followed by practical sessions in the laboratory, where students were given hands on experience in an experimental setting.  The fellow went on to mentor two students from this program in their "Treball de Recerca" projects.  The fellow developed a small project with the students, which included carrying out experiments, analyzing prepared samples, processing data and finally, preparation of a written report in the format of a scientific publication.  The fellow also participated in the host institute's "Open day" when people of all ages from the surrounding community were invited to visit the laboratory and learn about the research being done.  The fellow gave general presentations about the workd being carried out under the fellowship in both English and Spanish.  Finally, the fellow dissemenated the significant findings of the project to non-technical publications such as local newspapers as well as online news sources.
