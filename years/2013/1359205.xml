<AbstractNarration>This award will establish a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Boston University (BU). The REU program will be offered annually to six qualified applicants, who will perform cutting-edge research with dedicated faculty members. The Site will leverage BU?s expertise in studying magnetic fields at all cosmic scales, in order to impart a deep understanding of the basics of electromagnetism to the REU students. Student projects will be selected from topics that will expose undergraduate researchers to magnetic-field phenomena in the universe and cover topics including solar physics, auroral and ionospheric physics, and heliospheric science, as well as magnetic fields on stars, exoplanets, blazars, and clusters of galaxies. Potential projects will involve both theory and data analysis from space physics missions and astronomical facilities such as the Discovery Channel Telescope.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By offering high-quality research experiences to students at a critical stage of undergraduate education, the REU Site will contribute to increasing the nationwide pool of scientists and engineers. Participants must come to grips with a large corpus of existing knowledge about the makeup, origins, and interactions of many types of physical and astronomical objects. They will also develop the analytical skills (mathematical, computational, and logical) necessary to process data, understand primary research, and to remain current with new developments in the field. The REU Site also has an active and highly developed strategy to recruit women and underrepresented minorities into its program, which will expand STEM training opportunities to these groups.</AbstractNarration>

The Department of Astronomy at Boston University (BU) is unique in that it has a broad mix of expertise that spans many topics in both space physics and astrophysics and covers scales from the Earth?s magnetosphere to supermassive black holes.  At most universities, this range of topics can only be found by combining multiple departments, where administrative, geographic and political barriers can often discourage active interaction.  In the BU Astronomy program, the graduate and undergraduate students are trained in both space physics and astrophysics and leave the program with a rich perspective on the full range of the physics that occurs beyond the Earth.  The REU site built on this synergy with the goal of extending the same experience to undergraduate researchers from other institutions.
