<AbstractNarration>The trajectory of incoming storms from the Pacific Ocean influences precipitation patterns in the western United States, shaping drought and flood events. Long-term changes in these trajectories may have resulted in North American "megadroughts" and other extreme climate events, but little is known about the range of variability in storm-track patterns, particularly at a seasonal timescale.   The isotopic composition of precipitation, which reflects atmospheric circulation patterns, is recorded in tree rings.  In this collaborative study, researchers from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the University of Arizona, and the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, will use seasonally resolved tree-ring data (based on earlywood and latewood widths, &amp;#948;18O, and &amp;#948;13C) and weekly precipitation isotope sampling at nearby sites to reconstruct storm-track position and moisture delivery pathways to the U.S. Pacific Northwest. Four major objectives of this project are to: (1) develop a long-term record of storm track using stable isotopes in tree rings; (2) determine the seasonal signal embedded within the tree rings; (3) examine controls on spatial drought patterns through time in the Pacific Northwest; and (4) evaluate implications for future climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will help characterize the stability of the moisture-delivery system to the Columbia River Basin, with implications for water resources.  Given the projected changes in storm track and seasonality in future climate scenarios, understanding past limits in these systems will be important for evaluating the potential impacts of future trends. Data generated through this project will extend spatial coverage of tree-ring isotope records across North America. In addition to providing research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, the researchers will collaborate with teachers in the Pacific Northwest through citizen-science partnerships that will involve middle- and high-school students in data collection and enhance science education in public schools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ INTELLECTUAL MERIT  The path of incoming storms from the Pacific Ocean influences rain and snow patterns in western North America, and long-term changes in these storm paths likely shaped past wet and dry periods in North America.  However, the instrumental record on incoming storms is very short (~50yrs), and decadal variability is very high, making it difficult to assess past changes and trends.  In this project, we used stable isotope data in tree rings, soil moisture, and rain and snow to study how moisture delivery has changed over hundreds of years. We focused on the U.S. Pacific Northwest, with implications for water resources in the Columbia River Basin.   Major findings from this study include:  There is strong potential for combining multiple tree ring metrics (total ring width, earlywood width, adjusted latewood width, and blue intensity) from our network of tree-ring sites in the upper Columbia River Basin in reconstructions of past cool- and warm-season precipitation. West Coast-wide drought has occurred periodically since 1500 A.D. and has consistently been associated with high pressure centered along the Pacific Northwest coast, while south-dry and wider Western droughts indicate La Ni&ntilde;a-type patterns.  There is a distinct seasonality in Pacific Northwest climate response to the El Ni&ntilde;o system, with stronger correlations in the late winter than in the autumn or mid-winter, and there has been a trend towards greater spring influence of El Ni&ntilde;o on climate in recent decades. Ecosystems of the western U.S. were greener and more productive following winters with south-shifted storm tracks, and larger areas of the northwestern United States were burned by wildfires when storm tracks were displaced north.  Our 300-year reconstruction of cool-season, midlatitude Pacific storm-track position and intensity showed high interannual-to-multidecadal variability and demonstrated the long-term influence of El Ni&ntilde;o.  There is a strong relationship between &delta;18O in our ponderosa pine tree-ring sites and winter precipitation, while &delta;13C isotopes from the same trees showed a relationship to prior fall/winter precipitation. Tree ring years with the most enriched &delta;18O are generally associated with meridional (wavy) flow.  Back-trajectory analysis using weekly precipitation stable isotope data confirmed that enriched isotopes were related to meridional and southerly storm tracks. Overall, our results help place recent changes in moisture delivery to the Pacific Northwest into a longer-term context so that we can separate out warming-related changes from natural variability.    BROADER IMPACTS  We established citizen-science partnerships with four public schools and non-profit organizations in the U.S. Pacific Northwest.  Those partners, identified through the Community Collaborative Rain, Hail &amp; Snow (CoCoRaHS) network, collected weekly rain and snow measurements for isotope analysis.  We made eight in-person visits to teach classes (high school and elementary school levels) and to give talks at local non-profit organizations, and we sent our volunteers informational fliers on how their data were being used. Five graduate and four undergraduate students conducted research for this project, gaining skills in field, lab, and analysis techniques.  Fourteen presentations on the results of this research were made at national and international conferences, and the research has resulted in five published research articles, one article in review, and four manuscripts in preparation. Tree-ring chronologies and reconstruction data generated from this study have been made publically available through the NOAA Paleoclimatology repository for use by other researchers. The results of this research will be relevant to climate modelers, energy and water managers, ecologists, and others who require long-term records of moisture delivery changes and the response of western North America?s hydroclimate and ecosystems.
