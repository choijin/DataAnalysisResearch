<AbstractNarration>This project examines the natural patterns of hydroclimate variability in the Mediterranean Basin using tree-rings, historical and paleo climate data, and modeling.  The researchers will use a spatially intense multi-century to millennial-length gridded reconstruction of hydroclimate variability from North Africa to create a Mediterranean Basin Drought Atlas (MBDA) which would be compatible with similar atlases for other areas of the Northern Hemisphere.  The analysis of climatic and paleoclimatic data will help identify potential linkages of Mediterranean climate variability with large-scale patterns of atmospheric and oceanic variability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include international collaboration and outreach, the creation of the MBDA for the wider science community, and research of relevance to water supply issues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary goal of this project was to evaluate and understand the long-term history of drought in the Mediterranean, especially in North Africa and the eastern Mediterranean.  Specifically, this project sought to answer the following questions: Have past droughts during the last 1000 years in the Mediterranean been worse than those observed over just the last century? How do droughts in the Mediterranean vary over space and time? What are the large-scale features of the climate system that control droughts in the region? And finally, are current drought trends outside the range of natural variability?    Tree rings provide a long-term perspective on drought variability -- they are formed annually and their width reflects variations in the amount of past rainfall and soil moisture.  Tree-ring data from across the Mediterranean -- and in particular from North Africa -- provide information about the past millennium unavailable from limited instrumental observations.  Understanding drought variability in time and space and identifying what controls this variability and contributes to long-term trends in precipitation and moisture is critical for anticipating and planning for the ecological, socioeconomic, policy, and natural resource management challenges posed by water deficits and changes in the water cycle in the Mediterranean region.  A much better knowledge of the full range of possible drought variability over North Africa and other parts of the Mediterranean Basin is critical for ensuring a complete understanding of the climate factors driving water deficits across the region. Past climate changes also provide challenging tests and opportunities for validation for the climate models used to predict the future.   The first major finding of our research was that severe and persistent droughts occur across the entire Mediterranean Basin episodically during the last 1000 years.  During those times in the past where North Africa has been abnormally and persistently dry, drought conditions also exist in the eastern Mediterranean and the Iberian Peninsula.  Our analysis of both climate observations and tree-ring reconstructions suggests that these uniform conditions are linked to variations in atmospheric circulation over the North Atlantic Ocean.  One of the driest periods across the entire Mediterranean occurred between the years 1351 through 1366 CE, with especially severe and sustained soil moisture deficits over this ~15 year period in Morocco, Tunisia, Greece, western Turkey, and the Levant.  We have therefore identified using multiple lines of evidence a mode of Mediterranean basin-wide drying that is consistent with regional features from climate model simulations.  We confirmed this using spectral, wavelet, and coherence analysis between reconstructed drought time series from North Africa and the eastern Mediterranean: severe droughts in one location are associated with severe droughts in the other.  In terms of present and future drought vulnerability and food security in the region, this large-scale coherence limits resilience strategies that might rely on varying rainfall across different countries or subregions.   A second major finding of our research is that, while broad-scale and occasionally persistent drought is a general characteristic of the long-term climate history of the Mediterranean, recent trends in some parts of the region appear to be beyond the range of previous natural variability.  Although recent drought in much of the eastern Mediterranean is still within the envelope of the previous millennium, in the Levant it appears very likely that current conditions are now more severe than any similar epoch of the previous 1000 years.     Our findings indicate the potential for large-scale coherent droughts with implications for the political and social stability of the region, as well as its agricultural and economic vulnerability.  Although the majority of the study region currently experiences drought ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
