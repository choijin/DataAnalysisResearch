<AbstractNarration>Humanity is challenged to integrate the critical and malleable role of human organizational behavior with our efforts toward sustainability. Environmental conservation frequently comes at a cost to individuals, and sustaining resources often requires cooperation between users.  But cooperative, durable organizations that manage resources sustainably do sometimes arise. Therefore, an examination of the processes that influence the emergence and persistence of cooperative organizations that maintain conservation practices should be of value for advancing sustainability science and organizational theory alike. Linking theory on the evolution of organizations, institutions, cooperation and culture, this career development plan assembles a conceptual framework for the emergence and persistence of organizations that support costly conservation practices. The plan then applies this framework to a case study of cooperative local food organizations in Maine, employing formal and informal education to transform the capacity of citizens, students and stakeholders to conceptualize and engage in organizational change necessary to shape sustainable solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned research uses an evolutionary framework to explore the patterns of institutional emergence associated with costly conservation. The integration of three research elements will supply convergent validity to a contextual study of the evolution of sustainable institutions: (1) Theoretical models will develop insights about which combinations and sequences of institutional features tend to emerge in stable, conservative groups. Model development will be interleaved with (2) a case study of cooperative, self-organized local food organizations using interviews, surveys, economic games and a randomized controlled trail to characterize institutional variation and change. (3) Local food organizations will be treated as stakeholders in a collaborative facilitation process designed to empower groups to set and meet self-identified goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned educational effort engages students, stakeholders, and citizens in learning, measuring and improving the ability of organizations to achieve cooperative goals. Five cohorts of ~30 students each will be directly engaged in the research through a student-driven statewide survey. New cross-listed courses will bridge economics, psychology and anthropology by focusing on endogenous organizational dynamics and methods for measuring them quantitatively. Constituents in local food organizations will be provided educational materials designed to improve their institutional efficacy. Finally, theory, methods and findings will be shared through web-based educational simulations with high school to graduate students, and an ongoing collaboration with a local children's museum.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;This plan supplies an evolutionary theory of the emergence and persistence of conservation behaviors and seeks to identify the institutional features that stabilize them. Methodologically, the research bridges social-science boundaries, by synthesizing evidence from experiments, models, surveys, interviews and a randomized controlled trial. This multi-disciplinary approach aims to provide a dynamic model that contributes to evolutionary organizational science and promises to make nascent sustainability theory more predictive and generalizable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The plan includes two major investments in stakeholder driven-research. First, a collaborative stakeholder facilitation process will empower local food groups to self-identify goals and benchmarks to improve group efficacy. The facilitation will be rigorously evaluated via randomized controlled trial, and supply information on how recent research may help groups achieve their goals. Second, an iterative, multi-year collaboration with state-level food industry and food policy organizations such as the Maine Food Strategy will enable these stakeholders to co-direct the research efforts, shaping the research questions addressed in a summative local foods analysis conducted in year five. This collaboration increases the likelihood that the research described here will be of direct value for the development of food policy in Maine, New England and beyond.</AbstractNarration>

The theory suggests that human groups are more likely to achieve sustainable resource use when group-level management traits evolve faster than individual behaviors to over-exploit (<a href="http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol20/iss2/art34/">2015 theory paper</a>). Simulation models confirm that this ?group-level cultural evolution? mechanism can generate sustainable use of environmental resources, by building within-group cooperation for low impact resource use (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2016.09.022">2017 model paper</a>). For sustainability to evolve within a population of human groups, those groups should be dependent on the resource, be able to manage their resources locally, and learn from the successes and failures of other groups, while not competing directly for the resources themselves. Evidence from case studies from Tanzania, California, Dominica, Maine and Bali support this theory (<a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/11625/topicalCollection/AC_698c9a4f471051c80be5f8c036319f2e">2018 case study papers</a>). The theory has been cited over 100 times since 2015, and the Cultural Evolution Society has established a standing working group on sustainability (<a href="https://culturalevolutionsociety.org/story/sustainability">CES working group</a>) with an international network of 82 researchers and practitioners. Additional research activity includes a new working group on the topic at the Konrad Lorenz Institute in Austria (<a href="https://www.kli.ac.at/en/events/focus-groups/view/582">KLI group</a>).</p> <p>We also theorized that the persistence of human organizations is similarly determined by the organizational level on which cultural evolution is most active. To test this theory, we studied the evolution of co-operative organizations. The theory suggests that because co-operatives rely on cooperation, successful co-ops should exhibit high levels of cooperation. To test this, we measured economic cooperation in a grocery and a comparable food co-op with using standard economic experiment. Cooperation at the co-op was significantly higher than the traditional grocery store (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcom.2019.100092">2019 paper</a>).</p> <p>The theory also suggests that co-operatives tend to evolve group-level traits to manage and mitigate free-riding. Evidence from informal co-operative food clubs supports this theory. Not only are food clubs highly cooperative when measured with standard economic games, they also face a perpetual free-riding problem. However, rule adoption is correlated with club success and longevity, suggesting that rules may help solve the free-riding problem (<a href="https://digitalcommons.library.umaine.edu/etd/3070" target="_blank">2019 thesis</a>). Moreover, 170 years of historical evidence suggests that a set of institutional traits evolved and spread because of the beneficial effects on the co-operatives which adopted them. These ?co-operative principles? are therefore a group-level cultural adaptation, further supporting our hypothesis that successful cooperatives have institutional adaptations some of which reduce the free-rider problem (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3322978">2019 paper</a>). These results have excited the co-operative business community, leading to an invited <a href="https://usaskstudies.coop/public-talks/archived-talks/video-the-macpherson-talks-the-role-of-cooperation-in-the-evolution-of-co-operatives.php">Annual MacPherson Lecture</a> at the Canadian Centre for the Study of Cooperatives at the University of Saskatchewan, and new research collaborations with the co-operative industry.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Societal Impacts</strong></p> <p>This CAREER grant has had multiple positive societal impacts beyond the 5 graduate students and 7 undergraduates it helped to train. First, collaborations with industry stakeholders produced results that suggest how to maintain cooperation within food clubs, proving useful for stakeholders, club coordinators and club members. As a result, there is a high likelihood of further collaborative research, such as an NSF SBIR grant application to develop of the technology to detect and facilitate cooperative momentum. This grant also brought evolutionary social science to the University of Maine. PI Waring developed a new interdisciplinary Evolutionary Economics course, which he taught to graduates and undergraduates for 3 years, and will continue to teach. Finally, the project also generated engagement on policy relevant to the food system in Maine and the role of cooperatives in Maine?s economy. These included participation with the Maine Food Strategy NGO, and two policy papers in the Maine Policy Review, and one industry publication in the Cooperative Business Journal.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/03/2020<br>      Modified by: Timothy&nbsp;M&nbsp;Waring</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1352361/1352361_10293117_1599160161134_Picture6--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1352361/1352361_10293117_1599160161134_Picture6--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Cooperative momentum predicts club membership"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1352361/1352361_10293117_1599160161134_Picture6--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Cooperative momentum predicts club membership"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">An agent simulation of food club behavior based on group-level cooperative momentum predicts club membership over time.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Antonio Jurlina</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Timothy&nbsp;M&nbsp;Waring</div> <div class="imageTitle">Cooperative momentum predicts club membership</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1352361/1352361_10293117_1599159627177_Picture2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1352361/1352361_10293117_1599159627177_Picture2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Group selection for conservation drives the evolution of sustainability"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1352361/1352361_10293117_1599159627177_Picture2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Group selection for conservation drives the evolution of sustainability"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Cumulative rate of population persistence as a function of the strength of group selection on conservation preferences.
