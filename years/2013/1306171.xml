<AbstractNarration>This project has as its main objective to develop new methods that strengthen the quantum interface between atoms and light, and to use this as a tool for enhanced control of the quantum mechanical spin associated with a collection of atoms.  The central idea is that by preparing certain non-trivial states of the internal atomic spins, one can greatly increase the sensitivity of a laser probe to quantum uncertainty in the collective spin.  In that situation, using the laser probe to perform an accurate measurement of the spin will reduce, or squeeze, quantum noise on the spin below currently achievable levels.  Further control of the internal spins can convert such spin squeezing into forms that improve the performance of atomic clocks, magnetometers, or matter-wave based inertial sensors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research contributes to the knowledge basis of quantum metrology and quantum information science.  Short-term applications include future generations of quantum-limited clocks and sensors, while long-term applications are possible in quantum memories and other hardware required for the nodes in quantum communication networks.  Graduate students are involved in all aspects of the project, including training, research, and the dissemination of results.  The project is a cornerstone of the NSF-supported Center for Quantum Information and Control (CQuIC), co-located at the University of Arizona and the University of New Mexico.  As such, it contributes to the training of a wider group of future scientists and engineers in the highly interdisciplinary field of quantum information science.</AbstractNarration>

Demonstration of conditional spin squeezing in the laboratory.

As much as 8dB of conditional squeezing was observed, a roughly 5dB improvement over the standard approach.   These accomplishments required a number of advances in theoretical and experimental quantum optics and atomic physics.  Notable examples include a complete theory of diffraction in 3-dimensional atom-light interfaces and its use to maximize atom-light coupling in the laboratory, the use of two-color light fields to eliminate spin dependent light shifts that otherwise destroy squeezing in complex multilevel atoms, and the development of a suite of techniques for extremely accurate control of applied and ambient magnetic fields.
