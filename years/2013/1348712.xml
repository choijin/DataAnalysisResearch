<AbstractNarration>EHR Core Research&lt;br/&gt;Workforce Development&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a collaborative project involving Ohio State University (lead institution), Pennsylvania State University, American Institutes for Research, University of Illinois-Urbana, and the University of Iowa. The project examines the impact of different research funding structures on the training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows and the impact of their subsequent outcomes.  The rationale for the study is the recognition that research teams are organized differently in composition, size, and reliance of graduate students versus postdoctoral fellows. In addition, funding agencies change the structure of science training by creating programs that ?encourage? interdisciplinary groups, multi-university collaborations, or large research centers that focus on specific research questions. However, little research has been done about how these factors shape the career preparation of STEM professionals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will begin by examining the different contexts of research funding and training and then (1) relate measures of team structure to the structure of funding to determine the extent to which funding agency policies shape research teams and (2) capture the trajectories of the students and postdoctoral fellows during and after their contact with the teams to quantify how the structure of teams affects training.  They will use longitudinal administrative data that to capture information about sources of funding for the training and support of Ph.D.s and Postdocs from 13 major research institutions that participate in the Committee on Institutional Cooperation. They will then identify the nature of the research training through a text analysis of pertinent documents and use a quasi-experimental design to estimate the causal impact of the structure of research and length of training on trainee outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will have broad implications for the entire field of STEM education policy and research.  The underlying algorithms and tools will be made available to the academic research community and can be leveraged to link internal human resources data sets to external data sets. This new data infrastructure also will facilitate the assessment of the effects of research investments on research productivity as well as undergraduate and graduate curriculum development.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>An important part of any assessment of productivity, personal and medical history, scientific impact, data analysis, etc. is proper record linking. Proper record linking requires accurate entity or name conflation. The mention in a document of data set of "John Smith" at institution A should not be confused and grouped with "John Smith" from institution B if they are not the same person. The same is true for authors of scientific papers and in general other name entities. As such this project develops a novel machine learning based author name disambiguation algorithm for large-scale scholarly databases, and a record linkage algorithm to link disambiguated authors from one scholarly database to another.</p> <p>To solve these problems we created a scalable name disambiguation algorithm that can work on hundreds of millions of name entities. Our disambiguation algorithm uses a random forest machine learning for pairwise classification and the DBSCAN algorithm for clustering author mentions. We successfully disambiguated MEDLINE authors (80M author mentions conflated to 5M disambiguated authors), and ProQuest advisors (1M advisor mentions to 0.2M disambiguated advisors) using these methods. Our author disambiguation results for MEDLINE are publicly available through our author search engine PubMedSeer (image of web page attached) (<a href="http://pubmedseer.ist.psu.edu:5000/">http://pubmedseer.ist.psu.edu:5000/</a>).</p> <p>We also provided for PubMedSeer a RESTful API, an application programing interface for building software applications, at (<a href="http://heisenberg.ist.psu.edu:5000/">http://heisenberg.ist.psu.edu:5000/</a>) so that users could query authors. Both attribute-based and record-based queries are allowed. An image of the web page is attached.</p> <p>We applied our method to the USPTO inventor name disambiguation challenge and showed our algorithm at that time outperformed all other algorithms in the competition. We applied our record linkage algorithm to identify and link the same persons across scholarly databases. The algorithm was used to find linkage between disambiguated ProQuest advisors and MEDLINE authors. See the references below for related publications.</p> <p>To show how our methods generalize to other problems, we applied our algorithm to the first Financial Entity Identification and Information Integration (FEIII) challenge. The goal of this challenge was to automatically link financial entities among different financial data sources. Our results on two different record linkage tasks in the challenge showed the highest performance for the F1 score. This was published in SIGMOD DSMM; please see the references for more details.</p> <p>In summary we created a scalable name entity record linking and disambiguation algorithm and software that can be applied to disambiguation and conflation of entities in multiple data sets. Economists, Sociologists and Scientists could find this of use for attribution, contribution and related tasks.</p> <!--    @font-face  {font-family:"Cambria Math";  panose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4;  mso-font-charset:0;  mso-generic-font-family:roman;  mso-font-pitch:variable;  mso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;} @font-face  {font-family:Calibri;  panose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4;  mso-font-charset:0;  mso-generic-font-family:swiss;  mso-font-pitch:variable;  mso-font-signature:-536859905 -1073732485 9 0 511 0;} @font-face  {font-family:"Malgun Gothic";  panose-1:2 11 5 3 2 0 0 2 0 4;  mso-font-charset:129;  mso-generic-font-family:swiss;  mso-font-pitch:variable;  mso-font-signature:-1879048145 701988091 18 0 524289 0;} @font-face  {font-family:"\@Malgun Gothic";  mso-font-charset:129;  mso-generic-font-family:swiss;  mso-font-pitch:variable;  mso-font-signature:-1879048145 701988091 18 0 524289 0;}    p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal  {mso-style-unhide:no;  mso-style-qformat:yes;  mso-style-parent:";  margin-top:0in;  margin-right:0in;  margin-bottom:8.0pt;  margin-left:0in;  line-height:107%;  mso-pagination:widow-orphan;  font-size:11.0pt;  font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;  mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;  mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-fareast-font-family:"Malgun Gothic";  mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;  mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;  mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";  mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;  mso-fareast-language:KO;} p  {mso-style-noshow:yes;  mso-style-priority:99;  mso-margin-top-alt:auto;  margin-right:0in;  mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto;  margin-left:0in;  mso-pagination:widow-orphan;  font-size:12.0pt;  font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;  mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";} .MsoChpDefault  {mso-style-type:export-only;  mso-default-props:yes;  font-size:11.0pt;  mso-ansi-font-size:11.0pt;  mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;  font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;  mso-ascii-font-family:Calibri;  mso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-fareast-font-family:"Malgun Gothic";  mso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast;  mso-hansi-font-family:Calibri;  mso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin;  mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman";  mso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;  mso-fareast-language:KO;} .MsoPapDefault  {mso-style-type:export-only;  margin-bottom:8.0pt;  line-height:107%;} @page WordSection1  {size:8.5in 11.0in;  margin:1.0in 1.0in 1.0in 1.0in;  mso-header-margin:.5in;  mso-footer-margin:.5in;  mso-paper-source:0;} div.WordSection1  {page:WordSection1;} --> <p><strong>References:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Kunho Kim,      Madian Khabsa, C.
