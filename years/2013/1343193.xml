<AbstractNarration>PI: Weiland, James D.&lt;br/&gt;Proposal: 1343193&lt;br/&gt;Title: Bioelectronic Systems for Investigating Neural Plasticity&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This INSPIRE award brings together research areas traditionally supported by the Biophotonics and Nanobiosensing programs in the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems  Division (CBET) of the Engineering Directorate (ENG); the Neural Systems program in the Integrative Organismal Systems (IOS) Division of the Biological Sciences Directorate(BIO); the Cognitive Neuroscience program in the Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences Division (BCS) of the Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Directorate (SBE); the Physics of Living Systems program in the Physics Division of the Mathematical &amp; Physical Sciences Directorate (MPS).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significance&lt;br/&gt;The formation of connections in the human brain is driven by experience. Particularly in development, but also in adulthood, repeated activity leads to lasting changes at the synaptic level. Understanding the mechanisms behind synapses formation and modification remains a fundamental question in neuroscience. To enable novel experiments that will expand our basic understanding of plasticity, the PIs propose to create and test bioelectronics systems designed specifically for neuroscience experiments. This approach is transformative because it sheds the usual constraints applied to bioelectronics systems, which are almost uniformly designed for human use. By focusing from this beginning on the need for systems to enable novel, fundamental neuroscience experiments, this interdisciplinary team will create bioelectronics implants optimized for investigating basic questions underlying plasticity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;An ultraminiaturized bioelectronics system capable of both stimulation of and recording from nerve cells will be utilized. The system will feature novel approaches to integrated circuit design, wireless operation information transfer, microelectromechanical systems for integration of the circuit with tissue, and materials for improved neural interfaces. System power will be provided by a rechargeable microbattery, allowing the system to be completely implanted and the animal to be untethered and freely roaming across several meters of experimental space. These systems will allow extended periods of bioelectronic stimulation as well as multi-animal experiments. Visual cortex plasticity in response to bioelectronic retinal input will be investigated in long-term studies with frequent monitoring of visual cortex anatomy using two-photon microscopy. Different mouse knockout models that either increase plasticity or decrease plasticity will be utilized to thoroughly investigate anatomical changes driven by bioelectronic input. Experiments related to hippocampal neurophysiology will be conducted to precisely measure activity at the neural level and compare this activity to recorded behavior. From this, sophisticated multi-input, multi-output models can be created that explain the behavior.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of this project is to develop a miniaturized wireless bioelectronics system that is capable of chronically interfacing with neural systems in a bi-directional manner.  Our team (PI: Song, Co-PIs: Meng, Hashemi, Weiland) has made the following major accomplishments during the duration of the grant: First, we have designed, fabricated and tested a 3D polymer-based high-density conformal multiple electrode array (MEA) for chronically (1 year) recording spikes and local field potentials (LFPs) in multiple regions of the hippocampus in rodents.  Second, we have developed bi-directional neural interfaces with microcontrollers and system-on-a-chip to deliver neural code-based asynchronized stimulation patterns with stimulation artifact suppression and adaptive cancellation.  Combining them with PtIr coated MEAs, we were able to record evoked and spontaneous neural responses during and immediately after electrical stimulations.  Third, we have designed a polymer-based retinal stimulation array and verified visual and bioelectronic retinal stimulations at rodent visual cortex.  With the retinal device, we have established a reproducible animal model to characterize neural plasticity resulting from chronic electrical stimulation.  Finally, we have designed the prototype of a fully integrated system with multi-channel stimulation/recording capability, power supply, and wireless data transmission.  These systems will enable investigation of various forms of neural plasticity using ensemble neural activities recorded from untethered animals performing naturalistic behaviors and provide a prototype of wearable neural prostheses for restoring sensory and cognitive functions.  This project has resulted in an interdisciplinary research team between University of Southern California and University of Michigan.  Three postdocs, 19 graduate students, 21 undergraduate students, and 12 high school students were trained under this project.  Nineteen peer-reviewed journal articles and 30 peer-reviewed conference papers were published.          Last Modified: 12/22/2020       Submitted by: Dong Song]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
