<AbstractNarration>Funds are provided for a two-year study, initially involving a 42-day cruise to collect two high-resolution seismic profiles and near-bottom magnetic field data from the Hawaiian Lineation Jurassic Magnetic Quiet Zone (JMQZ) using an AUV. The PIs plan to obtain 800 km long magnetic profiles as well as local seismic reflection and refraction data using a portable multichannel seismic system and sonobuoys. Seismic data will allow them to evaluate whether the Jurassic crust has been affected by later intra-plate Cretaceous volcanism. This magnetic data will be compared to the previously studied JMQZ data from the Japanese Lineation. The latter reveals rapid reversal and decreasing field intensity as well as a period of apparently incoherent anomalies with short wave lengths and low amplitudes. If real and global (as opposed to a local bad signal) this low amplitude zone represents an very unusual field behavior in Earth?s magnetic field history. The new data from Hawaii and its comparison with Japanese results will allow testing the hypothesis that this unusual field behavior was indeed global, which has important implications for dynamics of the deep Earth and for the construction of a robust geomagnetic polarity time scale for the Mid-Jurassic period.&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include discovery while promoting teaching and training at sea for graduate and undergraduate students. Public outreach is also planned through internet and WHOI exhibits. The scientific results could have far reaching implications for Earth dynamics, magnetic field behavior and geomagnetic polarity time scale and useful to other workers in the field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of this study was to examine the nature of small magnetic anomalies over Pacific Ocean crust of Jurassic age.  Globally, oceanic magnetic anomalies are important in defining the geomagnetic polarity time-scale, which goes back to late Jurassic time.  As the anomalies go further back into the Jurassic, the amplitudes decline to the point of nearly disappearing.  In this project, we collected deep (near-source), mid-water, and sea surface magnetic field data over these magnetic anomalies created at the Pacific-Farallon spreading center with the goal of comparing the signal with similar data from the Pacific-Izanagi spreading center.  Deep magnetic data were required because of the deep depth of the magnetic source layer and diminution of the magnetic signal with distance from the source (i.e, from the deep seafloor to sea surface).  The deep data greatly amplify the magnetic signal.  Unfortunately, deep data are quite difficult to obtain, so our data collection amounted to one long line through most of the early M-series magnetic anomalies.  The new data were compared with data from the same anomaly set, collected ~1000 km further west in Pigafetta Basin during NSF funded studies in 1992 and 2003.  A key question for this research was what aspects of the magnetic anomaly signal recorded previously in Pigafetta Basin are local and what are global?  The new magnetic data show the same overall envelope in anomaly behavior as the Pigafetta data, indicating that the profiles are displaying global magnetic field characteristics.  These data support the idea that the Jurrasic Quiet Zone was a period of low magnetic field amplitude.  The data also imply that the same series of magnetic anomalies is observed back to M-42 (~168 Ma)  (previously the oldest globally-recognized anomaly was M29 at ~159 Ma).  Furthermore, comparison with land records imply that many, if not most, of these magnetic anomalies result from geomagnetic reversals.  These results will be used by others to improve the geomagnetic polarity time scale, better understand Pacific plate tectonics, and to understand the long term variation of the geomagnetic field.  During the cruises collecting magnetic data for this study, seismic reflection and refraction data were also collected along the survey line for constraints on the source layer depth and structure.  In addition, the western Pacific is full of seamounts, sills, and lava flows emplaced during the Mid-Cretaceous (~100-70 Ma), long after (50-80 Ma) the crust was created.  We collected a composite low-fold multichannel seismic profile and several dozen sonobouy seismic refraction profiles.  These data are currently being studied by graduate students at Texas A&amp;M University, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and University of Houston.  Broader Impacts: The cutting edge science done in this study was published in 6 abstracts for Fall AGU meetings and an article was published in a high-visibility journal. In addition to the scientific advances made during this study, which help geoscientists to understand geomagnetic field behavior, the study promoted access and auxiilary studies by a scientist and student from outside the PI group (Kutztown University, Kutztown, PA) as well as numerous graduate students from the PI group.  Many of these students went on the research cruises and some presented their research at a national meeting, gaining invaluable experience.  The main PI is a young woman researcher and many of the graduate students are also women, advancing the careers of under-represented groups.  The seismic data from this project are currently being studied by a UH student for a thesis.               Last Modified: 12/05/2016       Submitted by: William W Sager]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
