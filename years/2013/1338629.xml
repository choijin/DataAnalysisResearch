<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;New Zealand has recently established the NZ Antarctic Research Institute (NZARI). The travel support requested here will allow U.S. researchers to attend an "Antarctic Futures Workshop" to help identify set of scientific challenges where NZARI could collaborate with the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) in the future. Some initial possible areas of collaboration include: predicting non-linear behavior and tipping points in Antarctica?s natural systems, tracking the impacts of change in Antarctica and predicting far field responses, and assessing the resilience of Antarctic and Southern Ocean ecosystems. The Ross Embayment remains a high-priority target area to address these research topics. The workshop will be held March 13-15, 2013 in Auckland New Zealand. More than 50 New Zealand Scientists are expected to attend. Most of the workshop agenda will be devoted to working group discussions in order to focus areas of common interest. Eight US scientists representing a wide range of disciplines have been invited to participate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The "Antarctic Futures Workshop" will develop and refine key research questions that will inform future NZARI research priorities in the Ross Sea region. U.S. participation in the workshop will help define common opportunities and interests between New Zealand and U.S. Antarctic research programs, with the goal of facilitating the development of collaborative research proposals where there is common interest and creating the ability to pool logistical resources to ensure cost effective and transformative science.</AbstractNarration>

Following the Auckland meeting, a NSF-sponsored workshop on "Antarctic Geologic Drilling" (http://agdw.uh.edu) was held at the University of Houston on November 7th and 8th, 2013. This award provided partial participant support costs for the Houston meeting, and allowed some overlapping participation with the NZARI meeting so that the results of both workshops could ultimately be integrated. The resulting report: A Way Forward to Discover AntarcticÆs Past (http://agdw.uh.edu/sites/agdw/files/docs/AGDW_report.pdf) provides an important step in documenting international, community-defined research priorities for Antarctic environmental and paleoenvironmental research. The report has already played an important role in the development of major international, collaborative research proposals, including the new ANDRILL Coulman High Project (www.andrill.org), among others.     Broader Impacts  The integrated NZARI (New Zealand) and Antarctic Geologic Drilling (U.S.) workshops supported by this award have identified and documented community-defined research priorities, with a particular focus on the Antarctic paleonvironment and the potential for international collaboration to facilitate ambitious science programs with the greatest potential for major discovery. The legacy and reports from these workshops have already contributed to the development of major collaborative Antarctic research proposals. The resulting reports are likely to influence Antarctic research for the next 5-10 years, both in the U.S. and abroad.
