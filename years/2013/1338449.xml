<AbstractNarration>EESE 13-38449&lt;br/&gt;Dena Plemmons    &lt;br/&gt;Sigma XI Scientific Research Society&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses the issue of authorship conflicts in scientific papers. Authorship conflicts may arise in any collaboration, domestic or international, but international collaborations pose unique challenges.  It is unclear whether authorship conflicts in international collaborations arise due to normative differences, or due to individual transgressions that collaborators mistakenly interpret as cultural differences.  Work done in the US suggests that differing perspectives on individualism, ownership or group responsibilities affect collaborations, but this variation has not been systematically documented. For authorship in particular, societal hierarchies and gifting practices have been indicated as potential sources of cultural differences.  This information gap has implications for how scientists are trained in the responsible conduct of research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research team, led by Dena Plemmons of San Diego State University, will deploy consistent discussion group methods across nationalities and disciplines.   Twenty four small peer discussion groups will be formed.  Four countries, the US, China, Brazil, and Germany, and two disciplines, neuropsychology and engineering will be represented. The small discussion groups and follow-up interviews will provide foundational data to develop a survey for wide distribution, with the ultimate goal of creating a curriculum for international authorship ethics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will fill an important gap in the literature on the ethics of global scientific authorship.  The inclusive design of the project will provide a novel dataset of both theoretical and practical value for the survey development.  It will also facilitate transparency and foster professionalism among scientific authors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The first phase of this planned two-phase project [and the Phase funded by this award] documented authorship norms and practices in two disparate disciplines (engineering and neuroscience/psychology) in four countries (Brazil, China, Germany and the United States).  While selection of any subset of disciplines is somewhat arbitrary, we chose these two disciplines because we expected them to provide a broad view of existing variations in authorship norms and experiences.  Engineering and neuroscience/psychology, broadly defined, represent very different branches of science; each discipline is itself very diverse and cross-disciplinary collaboration is common.  Engineering ranges from research in the physical sciences (including chemistry and physics) to biomedicine and environmental science.  Neuroscience including psychology spans the life sciences from biomedical engineering and molecular genetics through clinical research and the social sciences. The project goals depended upon capturing a broad spectrum of variation within the sciences, and we expected that the inclusion of  neuroscientists/psychologists and engineers would satisfy that criterion.  These four countries were selected because of their established (US, Germany) and growing (Brazil, China) roles as global research leaders and participants in international collaborations, and because of the cultural and geographic diversity that they represent. Furthermore, the selected countries have numerous Sigma Xi members and/or chapters [Sigma Xi is the sponsor of this research], an important logistical resource for the execution of the study.  This first phase of the project consisted of a series of peer discussion groups and follow-up one-on-one interviews using discussion-group methodology to gather qualitative data about authorship norms and researcher experiences with meeting participants in each of the four countries. More specifically, we conducted 25 peer-discussion groups and interviews with postdocs and senior researchers in the US, China, Brazil and Germany (approximately six groups in each country).  We explored: 1) authorship norms; 2) perceived sources of conflict in international collaborations; and 3) the extent to which the larger societies influence accepted authorship practices. The total number of discussion group participants from a total of 17 different institutions was 125 with slightly fewer follow-up interviews.  Of these participants, 72 were in neuroscience/psychology (33 postdocs and 39 faculty; approx. 50% female) and 53 in engineering and the physical sciences (approx. one-third female).  Diversity of perspective was a primary goal in the composition of each peer discussion group. All invited participants had experience in international collaboration, and each participant was required to have  co-authored at least  one manuscript involving one  or more authors educated and/or trained in a different country. In addition to experience in international collaboration and  co-authorship, participants were invited as much as was practical based on diversity of other characteristics: gender, ethnicity, institutional affiliation and  subfield(s) of training and  specialization.  All of the material from Phase 1 underwent a basic thematic analysis, with the PI and co-PIs reading through each transcript several times, and identifying those themes and topics that were common among the discussions, as well as those which seemed particular to practice and place; the co-investigators then spent hours in discussion talking through the themes and coming to agreement about those which were most frequent and salient. From those themes and topics, the co-investigators drafted a first round of survey items, which were then sent on to our expert panelists for review, as well as sent back to the peer discussion groups leaders and participants for review to ensure that the draft items accurately capture the practices and concerns noted in the focus groups.  The draft items currently attempt to assess both actual practice ["in your experience" questions] and what the respondents might say is ideal practice ["in your opinion" questions], and there are also several statements which ask for level of agreement. There are questions on: i)  contributions worthy of authorship attribution [i.e., In my experience, it is common practice to allocate authorship credit to cement research relationships with more senior researchers; it is common practice to give authorship credit to a graduate student to help them progress/grow, even if their contribution was negligible]; ii) authorship order [i.e., In my experience, the last author indicates the research group; In my experience, it is common to have several co-corresponding authors]; iii) understanding and communicating about authorship [i.e., The meaning of "significant" or "substantial" contribution is commonly agreed upon; In my opinion, conversations about the allocation of authorship should usually include only the first and senior authors]; iv) questions specific to "culture" [i.e., In my experience, in my country, gift or honorary authorship is a common practice to acknowledge and reward long-term collaborators; In my experience, in my country, maintaining personal relationships is an important aspect of authorship decision-making].  In Phase 2 of the "Authors without Borders" project, we plan to finalize the survey instrument of the prototype survey drafted in Phase 1, disseminate the survey internationally, and analyze and publish findings.
