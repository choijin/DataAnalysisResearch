<AbstractNarration>Network densification - where a multitude of base-stations and access points with overlapping wireless footprints and disparate capabilities pervade the physical domain - is the way forward towards meeting the tremendous demand for mobile data. The main objective of this project is to reevaluate the manner in which wireless networks are engineered and spectrum usage is managed so as to exploit dense access infrastructure. The project is expected to make contributions in three areas: 1) Design, analysis and prototyping of communications and network protocols to enable unprecedented fine grain control over transmissions over shared spectrum without requiring high coordination overheads, by leveraging emerging agile access techniques; 2) Design and analysis of novel, simple and sparse-state algorithms that leverage the large flexibility in such systems to achieve near-optimal resource allocations; 3) Modeling and analysis of extreme dense wireless networks to both evaluate the performance of resource sharing between providers in this regime, as well as evaluate economic and policy incentives to deploy a range of contractual structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research activity relies heavily on the development of sound theory and analysis of extremely dense networks, algorithmic development, simulation for large-scale systems and finally prototyping small-scale regimes. The research will serve as a catalyst towards changing traditional wireless networking paradigm, from one where infrastructure points connect to many mobiles, to one where a mobile connects to a large number of infrastructure nodes. The research will be disseminated broadly to researchers, practitioners and policy makers, leveraging in particular, a strong industry focused research center, as well as in efforts reaching out to public high school students, parents and teachers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In order to meet future concentrated traffic demands wireless networks are likely to be deployed in extremely dense configurations. Such deployments provide an unprecedented number of Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF), i.e., resource allocation knobs that the network algorithms that will need to be tuned to deliver the best possible tradeoffs amongst multiple competing objectives including user perceived performance, energy consumption, along with challenges with managing user mobility. This proposal explored the design, architecture and policy implications for dense network deployments.   The project outcomes include a comprehensive examination of several of the key functions in wireless networks and complex tradeoffs. Highlights of the research outcomes include:  (1)         Development of a new class of stochastic geometric models and associated analysis to provide a fundamental characterization of the user perceived performance (mean and variability) mobile users would see as they traverse dense infrastructure based wireless deployments.  (2)         Development of a truthful spectrum double auction which enables different providers to dynamically buy and sell spectrum from one another.    (3)         Enabling MIMO across WiFi and LTE by developing a novel decoding algorithm that allows LTE and WiFi transmitters to send concurrently together and the receivers decode the overlapping transmissions.  (4)         Optimization and development of effective of rate adaptation based on  a new fundamental insights on how channel state information relates to link performance.  (5)         Analysis and protocol design for dense mmwave ad hoc networks, showing how performance scales with as the density of users grows along with the density of obstructions.   (6)         Study of scheduling in densified networks. Understanding the role of online learning in optimizing the performance of schedulers, and the development of a new class of joint schedulers for systems supporting superpositions and/or puncturing to enable real-time traffic to be co-scheduled on top of mobile broadband data.  Broader impacts of this project include substantial interactions with industry centered on the impact and insights from our research.  We engaged the community through participation in various forms, conference panels, tutorials and organization of a workshop cutting edge wireless technology bringing together government, industry and academia. During the duration project has partially supported and engaged roughly 10 graduate students, several of which completed their Ph.Ds and have gone on to work in both industry and academia.
