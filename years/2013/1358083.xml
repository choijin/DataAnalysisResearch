<AbstractNarration>The proposed research will use a comparative macro-structural framework, a geographic mapping&lt;br/&gt;approach, and country level data to examine gender inequity in STEM opportunities in a global&lt;br/&gt;context. The proposal will request support for an international collaboration with Luis Berneth Pena, a Columbian geographer at the Georg Simmel Center for Metropolitan Studies at Humboldt University&lt;br/&gt;in Berlin, Germany. The intellectual merit of the proposed research derives from an interdisciplinary, international collaboration between an American sociologist and a Columbian geographer. The collaboration&lt;br/&gt;will allow the integration of a comparative macro-structural framework of gender inequity&lt;br/&gt;in STEM and a geographic mapping approach. The influence of geographically distributed economic&lt;br/&gt;and socio-political structures on STEM equity outcomes has not been carefully examined and&lt;br/&gt;has the potential for revealing critical gender patterns in STEM opportunity systems. The&lt;br/&gt;merit of the research is based in part on an integration of sociological and geographic perspectives&lt;br/&gt;in understanding gender inequity in STEM inequity that is spatially distributed and correlates&lt;br/&gt;with larger macro structures.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed research is substantial given growing international focus&lt;br/&gt;on gender inequality. As a result of this focus, organizations such as the United Nations&lt;br/&gt;have promoted measurement of gender inequalities across countries. Measurement is often limited&lt;br/&gt;to general health, education, and labor market issues. Gender inequity in STEM is a major&lt;br/&gt;component in creating and maintaining gender inequity worldwide. An examination of gender equity in STEM education and occupations across countries with diverse economic and socio-political characteristics will lend insights and solutions for resolving inequities in STEM.</AbstractNarration>
