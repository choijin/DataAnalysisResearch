<AbstractNarration>The primary goal of this project is to evaluate the structure and mechanism of atmospheric rivers (ARs) in the northeast Pacific and their impacts on U.S. weather simulated by global climate models, and understand the physical processes responsible for the systematic errors in the simulations. An analysis of satellite observations and reanalysis products including computation of composite sea surface temperature, air-sea fluxes and moisture budget associated with ARs will be undertaken. An examination of the impact of low frequency variability such as El Nino Southern Oscillation and Madden Julian Oscillation on ARs will also be investigated. An intercomparison of global climate model simulation, including the evaluation of AR simulations and the impact of the double Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) problem on precipitation along the U.S. West Coast through AR activity will be performed. The research will include conducting atmospheric coupled model experiments with prescribed sea surface temperatures (SST), which include the erroneous SST field associated with the double (ITCZ) problem. Finally upper ocean processes associated with ARs that could influence SST and air-sea fluxes of moisture using ocean coupled modeling experiments will be examined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will shed insights into ARs that are an important mode of providing precipitation to the western US.  Enhanced understanding of ARs thus has important societal impacts and benefits.</AbstractNarration>

America) when they make landfall. The primary goal of this project is to&nbsp;understand the role of air-sea interaction and extra-tropical cyclones in the formation and maintenance of ARs.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have analyzed atmospheric and ocean reanalysis products as well as other available data including those collected during the recent field campaign, CalWater 2015, to achieve the goal described above.&nbsp;The major outcomes from the analyses are briefly descried in the following:</p> <p><strong><em>Air-sea interaction associated with ARs</em></strong></p> <p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>Because of an important role of ARs in the global water cycle as well as societal impacts caused by extreme weather events in many coastal areas, atmospheric processes associated with ARs have been studied intensively in the last few decades. However, associated ocean variability and air-sea fluxes have received little attention because of the lack of high resolution ocean data until recently. In this study, we demonstrate that typical ARs can generate strong upper ocean response and substantial air-sea fluxes using the high-resolution (1/12&deg;) ocean reanalysis.&nbsp;</p> <p>AR events observed during the CalWater 2015 field campaign generate prominent sea level rise along the west coast of North America (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). In association with the sea level rise near the coast, a strong northward jet with the maximum velocity of about 1 m/s is generated. When the AR makes landfall, large-scale on-shore currents that hit the coast, generating strong narrow northward jets along the west coast of North America (Fig. 3). In the open ocean, the AR generates prominent changes of mixed layer depth especially south of 30&deg;N due to the strong surface winds and air-sea heat fluxes. The prominent cooling of SST is observed only in the vicinity of AR upstream areas primarily due to the large latent heat flux.

However, the relationship between ARs and ECs has not been well investigated. Using a newly available global AR dataset, we demonstrated that in addition to the cyclone, the presence of an anticyclone equatorward and eastward of the AR centroid plays an essential role in the formation of AR through generating narrow areas of strong pressure gradient and winds between the cyclone and anticyclone (Fig. 5).&nbsp;It is found that the strength of ARs is better correlated with the pressure gradient between the cyclone and anticyclone than with the cyclone intensity (Fig. 6).<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Intellectual merit</strong></p> <p>The outcomes of the project provided insights into key processes in the generation and development of ARs.
