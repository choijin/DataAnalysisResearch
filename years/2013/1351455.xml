<AbstractNarration>This research is focused on developing new methodologies for ultrafast imaging. In particular, it will contribute to a new development of ultrafast optical and X-ray cameras capable of providing molecular movies with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. This will greatly advance ultrafast optical science in single-molecule imaging, light-matter interaction, and inertial confinement fusion. The project also includes educational activities such as developing a summer/winter short course in optical science for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as training one graduate and two undergraduate and/or local high school students per year in the PI's laboratory. The research also includes extensive educational activities for students in individual and collaborative research settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conventional pump-probe methods can routinely provide ultrafast time-resolved imaging, but they mostly work for highly repeatable events. However, if event-to-event reproducibility is irregular or involves material damage, irreversible chemical reactions, and/or structural phase transition, single-shot detection is a necessity. The project here is to develop a single-shot camera capable of capturing ultrafast dynamic images, simultaneously recording spatial (2-dimensional) and temporal evolutions in a single-shot. Such a camera can capture images at a frame rate of ~50 trillion frames per second, recording 3 ~ 60 frames in a single-shot. Here, the enabling technologies include ultra-broadband spectrum generation, ultrafast optical pulse shaping, and single-shot hyperspectral imaging. This kind of camera can be potentially used in material characterization, biomedical imaging, bio-sensors, and optical and plasma diagnostics. In particular, its application in X-ray free electron lasers will lead to ultrashort electron beam imaging and characterization.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We have developed a single-shot camera system that can capture ultrafast laser-driven phenomena on the femtosecond and picosecond time scales. It has been successfully used to capture femtosecond ionization fronts and ablations on solid targets.

These interesting features are not easily observable with conventional multi-shot pump-probe schemes, especially when the laser and target conditions vary with large shot-to-shot fluctuations.
