<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF provided support to edit the proceedings of the 4th Fire Behavior and Fuels Conference.  This year, the conference innovated as in order to extend the international outreach of the conference and create more opportunities around fire behavior and fuel research, a second edition was held in St Petersburg, Russia on 1-4 July 2013, in addition to the US edition held in Raleigh on 18-22 February 2013.  The outcomes of the project can be summarized as follows:  The conference allowed wildland fire researchers to meet in two different locations around the main topic: "At the Crossroads, Looking Toward the Future in a Changing Environment". This topic arose from the feeling that the changing environment substantially modifies fire behavior and fire regimes in the forests as well as at the wildland/urban interface. Having two editions allowed to bridge the gap between the US, Europe and Russia as international travels were particularly difficult during the time of the conference, due to the global recession. In total, 500 attendees participated to the conference and 160 presentations happened in parallel sessions. On top of this, the most eminent specialists in the field gave over 14 keynote lectures. The International Association for Fire Safety Science delivered six awards for the two editions that included $500 prizes. The awards were for each edition: Best paper, best student paper and best applied paper. Two special issues are in preparation in the International Journal of Wildland Fire (leading journal in wildland fire science) and Fire Safety Journal (leading journal in fire safety science) that will present a selection of the best contributions presented during the two US and Russian editions (to be published in 2015). The support from NSF allowed editing the proceedings and providing them to all conference attendees. Having proceedings increased the interest in the conference and contributed to the success of the two editions. The proceedings are freely available on IAWF?s website ( http://www.iawfonline.org/2013FuelsConference/index.php).
