<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for the development of a novel dynamic window technology for energy efficient buildings. Dynamic windows can accomplish three essential functions.  First, they can efficiently harvest visible light to minimize electricity use during daylight.  Second, they block solar heat from entering buildings in the summertime and thus can lower energy use for cooling.  Third, in the wintertime, they let heat in to reduce heating costs. These innovative windows are inspired by the mature heat pipe and novel photonic crystal technologies.  Heat pipes have been widely used in managing the flow of heat in a wide range of products such as air conditioners and refrigerators.  Photonic crystal is a new class of optical materials designed for controlling the flow of light. A scalable doctor blade coating nanomanufacturing platform will also be developed for making large-area photonic crystal coatings on window glass.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will lead to significant breakthroughs in improving energy efficiency of windows for both residential and commercial buildings.  Windows are one of the main sources of energy loss in buildings.  On average, they account for 36 percent of overall building heating and cooling loads.  Consequently, this research will contribute to reduce the consumption of oil, natural gas, and electricity needed to power buildings. This could greatly enhance the energy security of the United States.  Buildings contribute about 40 percent of U.S. carbon emission. This novel dynamic window technology could significantly reduce their impact on the environment.  Moreover, the scalable doctor blade coating nanomanufacturing platform will advance many other areas ranging from high-speed optical computing to ultrasensitive bio-sensing, where the inexpensive fabrication of large-area periodic nanostructures is important.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This NSF Nanomanufacturing program provides funding for developing novel dynamic windows for energy-efficient commercial and residential buildings. This innovative green technology integrates the scientific principles drawn from two disparate fields that do not typically intersect &ndash; the mature heat pipe and photonic crystal techniques, which have been extensively used in controlling the flow of heat and light for various applications, such as air conditioners, refrigerators, heat exchangers, and next-generation all-optical integrated circuits. In sharp contrast to the state-of-the-art smart window technologies, like electrochromics and polymer dispersed liquid crystals, the new dynamics windows enable independent control of visible and near-infrared (NIR) light for greatly reducing cooling/heating costs and eliminates expensive transparent conductors in the final devices. In order to fabricate large-area NIR-active photonic crystal coatings on window glass, which are the critical components of the functional dynamic windows, two scalable nanomanufacturing platforms based on a roll-to-roll-compatible doctor blade coating (DBC) technique and a continuous electrostatics-assisted Langmuir-Blodgett coating approach have been developed in this program. In addition to the technological development, fundamental colloidal crystallization mechanisms involving in these bottom-up nanomanufacturing platforms have also been systematically investigated by both experiments (e.g., rheology measurements) and theoretical modeling. To achieve dynamic and independent control of visible and NIR light for the dynamic windows, a new light regulating mechanism has been demonstrated in this project. It is based on a series of newly discovered shape memory polymers (SMPs) that can regulate light between a highly transmissive state (temporary configuration) and a highly reflective state (permanent configuration). Strong capillary interactions including capillary pressures induced by the evaporation of liquids (e.g., water) entrapped in the macroporous photonic crystals and capillary condensation/evaporation of fluids in the interconnecting macropores are utilized in controlling the photonic crystal microstructures and the associate optical properties of the smart coatings. Once again, significant fundamental insights have been gained in these topics that have received little or no prior examination, but are technologically important in many applications, such as carbon dioxide sequestration in deep geological formations and advanced polymer reverse osmosis membranes for water purification, through both experiments and theoretical simulations. This grant has resulted in more than 20 peer-reviewed publications on high-profile journals, like <em>Nature Communications</em>, <em>Advanced Materials</em>, etc., and 5 pending U.S. patent applications. Two of these patented technologies on dynamic light regulating coatings have been licensed by an industrial partner &ndash; Innovative Space Technologies (IST). The closely integrated education component of this NSF program has provided a rich intellectual and multidisciplinary training ground to impact a large number (more than 15) of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students. They have won numerous prestigious awards, such as Materials Research Society (MRS) Graduate Student Award, AIChE Electronic and Photonic Material Graduate Student Award, 1<sup>st</sup>-place in the State of Florida Science and Engineering Fair, and Finalist of 2016 Intel Science Talent Search (the most prestigious science competition for high school students). In addition, a colorful demonstration module for growing iridescent artificial opals has been developed for K-8 students and more than 200 experimental kits have been distributed to students through a few summer camp programs. These outreach efforts have brought modern nanooptics and scalable nanomanufacturing to young students through a fun leaning experience and will benefit these students and their larger communities.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/22/2017<br>      Modified by: Peng&nbsp;Jiang</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
