<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) at the National Science Foundation supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site led by Professor Geraldine Richmond at the University of Oregon. This Research Experience for Undergraduates in Chemistry and Physics program combines a cutting edge interdisciplinary research experience with career building and mentoring activities that provide a robust research experience for the undergraduate participants. The experience will also involve professional skills training workshops to help the students in future career success in the next stage of their education, and/or their first full employment opportunity. This REU Program has been continually funded by the National Science Foundation since 1987 and has a 90% success rate of REU students going on to graduate school, over 60% have been women, URM groups comprise almost 40%. The 10 students per year selected for participation in this program over the summer months will be primarily from undergraduate institutions that do not have the resources to provide an undergraduate experience.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The faculty involved with this interdisciplinary REU program come from chemistry, physics and materials science fields, allowing students to cross the traditional academic boundaries and giving them an advantage that is not often found in other programs. The projects are carefully selected to match with the students' interests. Examples of the projects include using environmentally friendly organic and inorganic synthetic methods to develop "greener" materials through organic/inorganic synthetic methods, the preparation and characterization of solar energy materials, the study of the assembly of chemical dispersants at oil-water interfaces, the examination of toxic metal remediation through supramolecular chemistry and the basics of computer modeling methods. The broader impact of this project is that it will increase the numbers and potential career success of many science undergraduate students from underrepresented groups and those from predominately undergraduate institutions by giving them the opportunity to do hands-on research, to learn to use state-of-the-art instrumentation and exposure to research at a research university.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ For the 30thyear of continuous success, the University of Oregon  REU Site "Combining Career Preparation with Environmental Research in Chemistry, Physics and Materials Science" is designed for science students from predominately undergraduate institutions (PUI), providing students a research experience that allows them to explore the unknown and engage in discoveries that could make a difference in our world.  It affords them a unique opportunity to increase their problem solving capabilities beyond the textbook and teaches them how to develop a project plan, analyze the data and draw conclusions based on the findings.      The intellectual focus of this highly interdisciplinary REU program is to provide participants with the opportunity to use their knowledge and expertise in chemistry, physics and materials science to conduct research mainly in areas related to environmental sustainability.  This focus reflects the historical commitment of the University of Oregon and the state of Oregon to environmental and sustainability issues.  Our REU students can choose from projects in the laboratories of 18 faculty in chemistry and physics. All faculty mentors selected for this REU program have active research programs and have experience in mentoring undergraduate students in their laboratories.     Over the past 30 years there have been close to 330 student participants, 31 within the past 3 years funding period. Career building workshops and mentoring activities provide training and practice in transferable skills essential for success in the next stage of education and employment opportunities. 100% of the students agreed the program had an impact on the way they perceived their future in the sciences and over 90% said it solidified their decision to go to graduate school.
