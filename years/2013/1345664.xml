<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will explore the feasibility of fabricating and optimizing a thermoelectric (TE) device suitable for integration into a photovoltaic (PV) cell to increase the performance and lifetime of the PV cell. The TE device can be used to cool and heat the PV cell, effectively increasing the PV efficiency in real-world conditions. The power output of crystalline silicon PV cells decreases 0.4-0.5% for every degree Celsius of increased temperature. In most applications, this leads to a typical loss of about 20% in energy production. Furthermore, the single greatest contributor to the physical end-of-life for any cell is prolonged operation at high temperatures. Therefore, thermal management is an important consideration for any crystalline PV system. TE devices are reversible, have no moving parts, require essentially no maintenance, should last for the lifetime of the PV system and can run directly off the direct current (DC) power generated by the PV array. The ability to manufacture TE inks and optimize TE materials with near-state-of-the-art efficiencies will be demonstrated, and working TE devices will be fabricated to demonstrate their functionality. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is very significant to the rapidly growing market for PV modules and more important, to the increased efficiency (and decreased emissions) of worldwide energy production. The combination of custom capability, large size, and cost effectiveness will drive a sizeable market for bottom-up TE and TE/PV devices, which can be scaled in capabilities and costs to meet the needs of product developers, as well as volume manufacturers and utilities. Advantages of the controlled ink-jet printing method of manufacturing thermoelectric elements over conventional methods include: ability to control the physical properties of the materials during the fabrication, capability to achieve high compaction density of the 3-D structure using nanoparticles, reduced costs, and reduced fabrication times. The proposed effort will increase the body of knowledge and advance technology in the areas of solid-state physics and chemistry, ink chemistry, microfluidics, inkjet print deposition, and inkjet printer design. The results of this effort will also greatly increase knowledge of long-term cell degradation processes in PV systems, thereby improving reliability and economics of this very large component of future energy supply.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ HybridaSol, LLC is a University of Central Florida spin-off/start-up currently developing Printed Thermoelectric Sheets. This scalable form factor enables the deployment of thermoelectric (TE) devices in a multitude of areas that cannot be addressed with traditional TE devices, for Energy Harvesting, Cooling, and Heating applications, in the Automotive, Consumer Electronics, Military, and Industrial segments.   Conventional TE devices are assembled by pick-and-placing 1mm x 1mm x 1.5mm TE material "dice" into a square two-dimensional grid on rigid substrates, then series connecting them into a circuit in the form of a small, rigid, square device with two wired inputs/outputs.  HybridaSol, LLC is developing a thin sheet printing process and eventually a roll-to-roll printing process that simplifies the assembly of these devices, while offering conformability through a much thinner, flexible and larger sheet form factor.  Replacing the TE material "dice" assembly approach with a printable thin film approach involves three steps: 1) developing TE inks which can be processed through printing equipment, 2) annealing the applied inks into a thin films with TE properties, and 3) applying TE inks and processing them into TE thin films over contact pads on substrates which can be conductively joined into a TE sheet.  Step 1 was achieved by combining TE material powders with a combination of solvents and other additives to allow for the print application and drying of the TE material inks over multiple different printing processes.  Step 2 was achieved by verifying that printed TE material inks could be annealed into films with TE properties.  While HybridaSol, LLC utilized tube furnace heating to achieve the desired results, these TE films can be formed using many other common industrial heat treatment processes.  Step 3 is still in process, with selection of substrate, contact pad and conductive joining material-and-process selection and experimentation ongoing.  Current results are encouraging, with impending improvements expected to achieve the desired final results.          Last Modified: 02/02/2015       Submitted by: Jason M Hendler]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
