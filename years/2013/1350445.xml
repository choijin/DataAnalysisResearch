<AbstractNarration>This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program grant funds a study of the processing behavior and life cycle of renewably-sourced plastics, and works to inspire female students to proactively pursue engineering careers. High-speed extrusion coupled with interfacial reaction has the potential to intimately blend dissimilar polymers in order to access the entire range of combinatorial properties. The research will characterize the effects of this novel process on blend microstructure and correlate bulk properties to processing parameters. Creation of a predictive model of the processing rheology will enable expansion to other polymer blends, including recycled plastics. The research will also be used as a catalyst for broadening participation of women in engineering by bringing student-run demonstrations of career options to local vocational and traditional high school programs. A multimedia informational public service website and a module on climate change and sustainability for freshman courses will demystify environmental sustainability and the plastics industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will probe the intersection of renewable materials and cutting-edge processing strategies to discover new techniques for reinforcement of biobased plastics. As a result of this research the stability and properties of bio-based polymers will be modified to create robust plastics that can be used in place of conventional fossil-derived polymers in durable goods applications. The use of high shear also has the potential to reduce energy consumption in extrusion processes. Structure-properties-processing relationships will be determined for the polymer blends. A substantial experiential learning effort will be launched to broaden participation of women in engineering and to expand visibility of the engineering profession at the critical high school level, including student populations with less exposure to higher education options. These activities will establish mentoring relationships and early positive experiences on several levels of the educational pipeline, while improving science literacy and communication.</AbstractNarration>
