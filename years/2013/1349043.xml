<AbstractNarration>In everyday life, we often are asked to provide assessments or evaluations of others' abilities. Stereotypes can subtly shape these evaluations and judgments, even among those who view themselves as non-prejudiced. This can be very consequential in certain contexts; for example, hiring and admissions decisions can be based in part on the evaluative language used in letters of recommendation, and the language used may be influenced by gender and racial stereotypes. Further, audiences may also interpret this language with reference to those negative stereotypes about women and ethnic minorities. The proposed research addresses how evaluative language content varies depending on the gender and race of the person being described, and how in turn others interpret and use that content. This research has broad implications for understanding bias in real world, evaluative settings. Further, this research will increase our understanding of barriers that women and members of underrepresented groups face when considering educational and career opportunities in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields. Understanding how and when stereotyping can occur in evaluative contexts is a critical step towards reducing bias, prejudice, and discrimination. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research predicts that stereotypes activate different standards of judgments for members of different groups; therefore, evaluations (adjectives) mean different things depending on the person described. For example, in a masculine work domain where women are stereotyped as less competent, "good" for a woman may mean something objectively less good than "good" for a man. Dr. Monica Biernat, University of Kansas, will examine actual letters of recommendation written for male and female, racial majority and minority applicants to a variety of graduate programs at a public university. These letters will be coded for content including positivity, complexity, and use of ability versus effort terms, to examine differences based on gender and race across disciplines that vary in their gender/race representation. The research will address whether these content features predict admission decisions. The findings of this research could be applied to a broad array of real-life settings where evaluations occur.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This NSF award funded a project addressing how the content of letters of recommendation may vary depending on the gender and race of the person being described, and how, in turn, the recipients of these letters (i.e., admission committees) interpret and use that letter content in rendering decisions. The project involved use of archival graduate admissions data, and examined the content of letters of recommendation written about men and women of majority and minority racial status (as well as domestic versus international status) and tested whether any differences in content predicted admission outcomes. Merit factors mattered most for admission to all graduate programs, but we found differing roles of gender, race, and international status across academic disciplines. Letters of recommendation were generally longer for male than female applicants, but did not differ on some attributes reported in prior literature (e.g., use of &ldquo;superstar&rdquo; adjectives for men and high effort descriptions for women). Positive emotion content of letters was higher for international than domestic students, and the extent to which letters included high levels of positive emotion <em>negatively</em> predicted admission decisions. This research was based in a theoretical model positing the role of stereotypes in activating shifting standards of judgment for members of different social groups (e.g., men and women may be evaluated with reference to different standards, such that the same judgment&mdash;such as a description of an applicant as &ldquo;very good&rdquo;&mdash;is interpreted differently when applied to a man versus a woman). Little evidence of gender-based shifting standards was found in these data, but there was some evidence that admission committees may discount the positivity of recommendation letters, responding as though the applicant so described was judged relative to low standards. This research adds to the scientific literature on evaluative processes; its intellectual merit lies in the evidence provided about the applicability of judgment models to real-world decisions in naturalistic settings. The broader impacts of this work include advanced statistical training of graduate and undergraduate student assistants involved in the project, and the informational value of feedback provided to admission committees about their internal processes.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/26/2017<br>      Modified by: Monica&nbsp;Biernat</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
