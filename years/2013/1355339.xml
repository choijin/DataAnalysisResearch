<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project to investigate the origin of the observed co-variability in the extra-tropical North Atlantic ocean-atmosphere system on multi-decadal timescales, with particular emphasis on the interaction between changes in weather variability in the atmosphere and decadal variability in ocean circulation. The team will use state-of-the-art coupled atmosphere-ocean climate model simulations, as well as observational and reanalysis products. This project will improve our understanding of the nature of the multidecadal variability in North Atlantic atmospheric blocking, accompanying atmospheric circulation patterns, and their association with the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). By examining the variations on two very distinct timescales, i.e. synoptic to intra-seasonal in the atmosphere and decadal in the ocean, this research will clarify the origin of multi-decadal variability of atmospheric blocking, and the extent to which ocean-to-atmosphere feedbacks play a role. Thus this research will shed insights into the role of atmosphere-ocean coupleing in the variability of the AMO.</AbstractNarration>
