<AbstractNarration>The Advancing Scholarship Program Initiatives and Resources for Engineering and Science (ASPIRES) program at Cañada College, a California community college, is addressing challenges in the retention and success of undergraduate students in STEM disciplines by providing S-STEM scholars both financial assistance and academic enrichment activities.  Through the ASPIRES program, 137 scholarships are being awarded to students to facilitate their transfer to STEM programs in four-year institutions.  The ASPIRES program is also contributing to the national imperative to broaden participation in STEM, as underrepresented students comprise a significant proportion of the Cañada College student population.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical aspects of the ASPIRES project include providing the S-STEM scholars with peer instruction, mentoring from faculty members and industry professionals, summer research opportunities and field trips to transfer institutions and industry sites.  The project is contributing to the body of knowledge of how strategic academic interventions and enrichment opportunities promote the retention and success of STEM undergraduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups.  Insights gained from the ASPIRES project are shared with the broader community of scholars at venues such as national meetings and conferences of professional STEM societies, with no fewer than eight S-STEM scholars also participating in these events annually. Outcomes being measured include the impact of the project on student enrollment and retention in STEM majors, the level of student preparation for success after transferring to a four-year institution and the degree of student engagement with Cañada College faculty members, industry professionals and STEM scholars at other academic institutions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project awarded scholarship funds to 64 individual students over 6 years.  Fifty students completed their STEM academic plans and transferred to universities to complete their Bachelor degrees in STEM fields. Nearly half (44%) of the students majored in a field of engineering, 22% chose computer science, 20% majored in biology or biochemistry, and 14% majored in mathematics. Nearly half of the math majors expressed an interest in pursuing a teaching career.    NSF STEM Scholars represented diversity in higher proportions than typically found in our STEM classes.  Females constituted 42% of the completing Scholars compared to 23% typically found in engineering classes.  Although Hispanic students comprised 29% of students enrolled in Science/Technology Division courses, they were 48% of Scholars that transferred to universities.  Over half of the Scholars were first-generation in their families to attend college. These results demonstrate that this program had a positive effect on achievement of these underrepresented groups and contributed to a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce.  Based on the achievements of our NSF Scholars and the qualitative results of focus groups of Scholars, we demonstrated that academic and extracurricular activities can improve the success of STEM students, including first-generation and low-income students.  Faculty mentorship can have a positive impact, and this varies according to the individual faculty member and student. Peer mentorship is instrumental in persuading students to participate in activities that contribute to their success.  These results reinforce our idea that academic and social capital are essential to assisting students to complete STEM degrees.  Financial support allows them to participate in extracurricular activities, such as tutoring, that can boost their achievement. This conclusion is supported by a positive correlation between fewer off-campus work hours and higher Scholar GPAs and rates of participation in extracurricular activities.  One critical support is faculty mentoring and we have found some ways to improve the student-mentor relationship.  These strategies include designing specific activities for mentors and students to do together, training of faculty in mentorship, and allowing students some choices among mentor assignments.  We also learned that it is not enough to simply make these support services available. Too often, students are not aware of the programs, they do not understand how the programs can help them succeed, they are afraid of participating, and/or they are working so many hours that they do not have time to engage in these activities.  This conclusion led to a strategy of intensive coordinated guidance by one person, and we are now implementing this approach in another S-STEM grant. This project demonstrated the positive impact of financial and extracurricular support on achievement of students, including those from underrepresented groups in STEM majors.  Among the fifty Scholars who transferred in STEM majors, many have completed their bachelor degrees. In addition to their professional work, several are active as alumni in encouraging other students.                 Last Modified: 05/27/2020       Submitted by: Carol Rhodes]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
