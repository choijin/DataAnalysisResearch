<AbstractNarration>The term "Mean Field Games" was coined by P.L. Lions (Fields Medalist) and J.M. Lasry, a few years ago. It is a remarkable idea to transfer a well known approach of Physics to Social Sciences.  The concept of Mean Field in physics attempts to describe the effect of the media on the motion of a particle, this media being composed of an infinite number of particles, similar to the individual one.  Conversely in economics, models consider that agents interact through markets (real and financial) and equilibrium can be obtained through prices. It has been widely acknowledged that these types of models cannot realistically address all the phenomena that one can observe in real life, for instance the issue of systemic risk.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mean Field Games is a novel approach to understand what is missing in the models.  It has been a spectacular success.  Besides economics and finance, it has been very fruitful in many areas such as: traffic control, network analysis, as well as in understanding how technology can expand, and how environmental aspects impact growth.  It turns out that the theory can handle also many new considerations of risk management. Independently of the applications, these concepts have completely changed control theory, differential games and introduced new types of partial differential systems.  However, Mean Field Games is limited to agents who are identical, like particles.  This is a serious limitation, since in social sciences, unlike in physics, the reality is more a situation of coalitions or dominant players.  This is the major objective of this proposal: To study extensions to consider coalitions. One has to solve much more complex systems of partial differential equations. A second objective is to develop an Hamilton Jacobi Bellman equation approach to Mean Field Control Type problems, which has never been done before, because of a basic difficulty, called "Time inconsistency" inherent to Mean Field Control (different from Mean Field Games). A third objective is to develop ideas relevant to risk analysis, in which one cannot be satisfied in optimizing an average.  Since risk aspects have become predominant in engineering as well as in economics, this direction can have very broad implications, in many areas of strategic importance.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ MEAN FIELD GAMES AND MEAN FIELD TYPE CONTROL adapt  mean field theory, developed in the physical sciences, to many situations of social sciences, but also to problems of large networks in general, possibly telecommunication or computer networks, large energy grids or traffic on highways.  They are two theories, mean field games and mean field type control. It has been for long a source of confusion, since the theories are close but not identical, and correspond to a different background.  The interesting feature is that, mathematically, there are many similarities, which it is useful to recognize, and numerically, it is important to understand the differences.  A major outcome of our project has been to provide a unifying theory for both.   Transposing the idea of mean field to social sciences means, that one will consider individuals in a large community, as particles and try to identify some aggregation phenomenon.  However, in social sciences, individuals are decision makers. One meets immediately a phenomenon, which is completely new to physics. Can we aggregate decisions?    Mean field games theory tries to answer positively to this question, at least accepting restrictions.   The idea is to consider dynamic systems, like particles, this time influenced by a control variable, which captures the fact that there is a decision maker controlling the motion of the dynamic system. Influence comes from complex interactions, with neighboring influence as well as global influence. Eventually, these individuals, called agents, will take decisions, and there will be an aggregated effect, resulting in the global evolution.  In mean field game theory, it is natural to consider that all the agents will play a Nash game.  The decisions will come from solving this Nash game. This is the equivalent of finding individual motions of particles at the microscopic level.  If we assume that the agents are identical, one may speak of a representative agent. The dynamics of the representative agent is not just the individual dynamics without the influence of the community.  One has to introduce a term, coined the mean field term, which represents the influence of the community. The fact that one summarizes all interactions by a mean field term is of course key to the validity of the approach. It is a restriction, but not so much if the agents are identical. This mean field term is a functional of the percentage of agents having a common state, represented by a probability density.  This probability density is external to the representative agent, since he/she is too small to influence it.  It also modifies his/her cost functional, which the community impacts.  Therefore, the representative agent solves a control problem, which is his/her problem modified with mean field terms. These mean field terms depend on a probability density, which the representative agent takes as external.  After the representative agent has solved his/her problem, the state is a stochastic process, whose probability density depends on the external probability mentioned above.  Since the external probability represents the density of agents in a given state, it will satisfy a fixed point in a space of probabilities.  To sum up,  in mean field games one solves a control problem depending on a function of time, which is a probability, followed by a fixed-point problem, expressing that the external probability coincides with the probability of the optimal state.  We can clarify the difference with mean field type control. A mean field type control problem is a control problem, not a fixed-point problem, for a non-standard dynamics.  Instead of a dynamics described by a stochastic differential equation, one considers the so-called McKean-Vlasov dynamics. In this dynamics, the drift and volatility terms of the diffusion depend also on the probability distribution of the state. Therefore, there is a complex coupling between random terms and probability distributions. This is not standard.  The cost functional is the expectation of a random cost, in which terms may depend not only on the state of the system, but also on its probability distribution, like in the McKean-Vlasov dynamics. It is a control problem, but not standard. In particular, conversely to classical stochastic control theory, it is imperative to consider only feedback controls. The result that feedback controls are optimal against any control adapted to the information does not carry over from classical stochastic control theory to mean field type control.  The main assumption to legitimate mean field theory is that the individuals are identical. However, this assumption is more restrictive in social sciences than in physics.  Our contribution has been to clarify the similarities and differences between the two theories, to develop basic tools and methods, to consider extensions and applications    As an example of extension, we have studied  the situation of dominating players and coalitions. This type of situation has no analogue in the physical sciences and provides a source of very challenging mathematical problems.
