<AbstractNarration>Paying attention to the world around us, deciding what to attend to and what to ignore, is a fundamental human ability. It affects how we perceive ourselves and our place in the environment. Deciding what to pay attention to is a critical component of everyday functioning. Two people viewing the same scene, such as a busy intersection, may have different perceptions and impressions about what is taking place. One may attend to the traffic cop waving her arms and directing traffic, while another looking in the same direction may attend to the bicycle that narrowly misses a racing taxicab.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The present program of research will focus on the willful direction of attention (what one chooses to attend to). The research aims to establish the neural correlates of voluntary attention in humans, by using simple laboratory tests, advanced methods to record and analyze human brain activity, and novel signal processing of the brain's electrical signals. Such information will inform us not only about how the normal healthy attention system operates, but also how it breaks down in cases of overload, disease, and brain damage.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Our environment is complex to navigate, requiring us to often function in high information load situations, such as driving in heavy traffic on the highway, or piloting an aircraft full of travelers. Lapses in attention, distraction from our primary task by irrelevant events, and attending to the wrong information because of a lack of concentration, can have dire consequences. The brain has powerful neural mechanisms that direct the focus of our attention, permitting us to pay attention to highly relevant information (traffic entering the highway or changing lanes) and avoiding distraction (the bickering of passengers in the backseat, or the beeping of our mobile device). This project investigated a unique aspect of these attentional control mechanisms using electrophysiological recordings of human brain activity. Using a novel experimental method, we identified a brain signal that predicted where a human observer would direct their attention in the seconds after it was recorded from the brain. We referred to this process as "willed attention", because the focus of attention was determined by decisions made moment to moment by the human participant, and was not signaled externally by salient stimuli or instructions from others. This brain sign of willed attention opens a new door onto scientific understanding of how humans allocate their limited attentional capacity to events in the world around them, and may provide a means of monitoring brain activity of operators in high-load, high-risk environments, as well as for the development of human-machine interfaces for those suffering from neurological disorders. Further, disorders of attention, which exact a tremendous cost on individuals and society through lost productivity and suffering, will be better understood by learning how attentional control mechanisms such as this one for willed attention contribute to human behavior.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/22/2017<br>      Modified by: George&nbsp;R&nbsp;Mangun</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
