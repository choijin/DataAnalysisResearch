<AbstractNarration>This Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at Radford University is providing scholarships and support services to academically-talented students majoring in science, technology, and mathematics who demonstrate financial need. The project recruits students with a broad range of backgrounds from both high schools and community colleges, and effectively educates and supports them to succeed as future STEM researchers, teachers, and leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Radford University's Preparing the Next Generation of Leaders in Science, Technology and Mathematics' (RU-NextGen's) primary aims are to provide students with scholarships, focused activities, and strong support mechanisms to acquire skills that will help them succeed academically; procure science, technology, engineering, or mathematics-related internships or research opportunities during their college years; and ultimately transition into future careers in STEM. RU-NextGen's Emerging Leaders in Science, Technology and Mathematics [Elites] program serves as an umbrella of activities with focus areas of research, communication, and career development. Examples of Elites activities include participation in summer research, active engagement in classes undergirded by signing honors or leadership contracts, peer mentoring and participation in career development, and networking events. The Elites program also includes strong support mechanisms such as individual intrusive pro-active mentoring, peer mentoring, and cohort-building social and academic activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NextGen scholarship program helped recruitment and retention in STEM fields through (a) awarding merit-based scholarships to students with financial need, (b) helping build a support community, and (c) incentivizing scholarship recipients (and others) to engage in undergraduate research and professional development.  Over the five years of scholarships awarded through this program, 46 STEM students received scholarship support.  Of the 46 students, as of Spring 2019, 10 have now graduated, and 28 are current students in a STEM discipline.  Of the 8 other students who left the program, 4 changed to a non-STEM major, and 4 left the university.   A majority of students self-reported that without this scholarship they would have had to work a part-time or full-time job, which would have taken time from their academic obligations.  Moreover, several students reported that they would not have been able to attend university at all, without the scholarship.  Here are some representative comments from students:      This scholarship is extremely helpful as without it I would not even be able to attend school and has allowed me more time to study for my classes rather than spend all of my time working outside of classes.   It has allowed me to focus on my school work and not have to worry about financial needs. I couldn?t be more grateful to have received this scholarships and the opportunities it entails.   I am extremely grateful for this scholarship because without it, I would be forced to work at least one other job during each semester.   This scholarship was extremely helpful! I would not have been able to afford school without it!   Having the scholarship made me work harder to keep up the requirements for it. It gave me a push.   I would have to be constantly working for money and I wouldn?t be able to have any focus towards schoolwork.   A tremendous amount, without this scholarship I would not have attended a four year university. Now I have graduated with a degree in physics, and been accepted to the University of Florida to pursue my masters degree in aerospace engineering. --- Thank you all for the support over the past four years. You have truly changed a life for the better, and I am eternally grateful.   I honestly don?t think I would have been able to continue attending without this scholarship. It helped in many ways and I was upset when I saw it wouldn?t be granted again in future years to come. I was super thankful to have been lucky enough to be given this opportunity for this past school year.   This scholarship helped a lot. Since I didn?t apply to Radford until May my senior year (I?m on the soccer team), there wasn?t any academic scholarships left I may have gotten had I applied earlier. This scholarship helped substantially to replace some of this scholarship I may have earned.         Training STEM Leaders  The scholarship's leadership component was the creation of an "Emerging Leaders in Technology, Science and Mathematics" (Elites) program at Radford University's Artis College of Science and Technology.  Students who complete the program are recognized as Elites Scholars.  They do this by completing activities in several different areas:  1. Focus: Research skills to prepare future researchers.  Research assistant Attending a conference/ symposium/competition in STEM Present/publish paper/poster or develop a product (e.g., software) Independent study Honors contract on a course   2. Focus: Communication  Presentation at a University outreach event such as bridge camps for high school Take a RU-certified course with Leadership course outcomes.   3. Focus: Career Development  Acquiring an Internship/co-op during summer in STEM. Creating a resume and an effective professional online-profile. Participation in career events (e.g. career development forums &amp; job/internship fairs).   4.Focus: Management and Service  Officer in a STEM-related academic club. Organize or volunteer in a STEM- related event Work as a Student Peer-Mentor Organize or volunteer in a community event   While the Elites program was originally established as part of the NextGen program, it has attracted other non-NextGen-scholarship students from Radford University's Artis College of Science and Technology.  Even after the end of the NextGen program, the Elites program is continuing to help build leadership and professional skills in STEM students.
