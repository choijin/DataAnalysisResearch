<AbstractNarration>Proposal Title: Collaborative Research:  Seasonal Sea Ice Production in the Ross Sea, Antarctica  (working title changed from submitted title)&lt;br/&gt;Institutions: UT-San Antonio; Columbia University; Naval Postgraduate School; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute; UC@Boulder&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The one place on Earth consistently showing increases in sea ice area, duration, and concentration is the Ross Sea in Antarctica.  Satellite imagery shows about half of the Ross Sea increases are associated with changes in the austral fall, when the new sea ice is forming.  The most pronounced changes are also located near polynyas, which are areas of open ocean surrounded by sea ice. To understand the processes driving the sea ice increase, and to determine if the increase in sea ice area is also accompanied by a change in ice thickness, this project will conduct an oceanographic cruise to the polynyas of the Ross Sea in April and May, 2017, which is the austral fall.  The team will deploy state of the art research tools including unmanned airborne systems (UASs, commonly called drones), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs).  Using these tools and others, the team will study atmospheric, oceanic, and sea ice properties and processes concurrently. A change in sea ice production will necessarily change the ocean water below, which may have significant consequences for global ocean circulation patterns, a topic of international importance. All the involved institutions will be training students, and all share the goal of expanding climate literacy in the US, emphasizing the role high latitudes play in the Earth's dynamic climate.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the project is to improve estimates of sea ice production and water mass transformation in the Ross Sea. The team will fully capture the spatial and temporal changes in air-ice-ocean interactions when they are initiated in the austral fall, and then track the changes into the winter and spring using ice buoys, and airborne mapping with the newly commissioned IcePod instrument system, which is deployed on the US Antarctic Program's LC-130 fleet. The oceanographic cruise will include stations in and outside of both the Terra Nova Bay and Ross Ice Shelf polynyas. Measurements to be made include air-sea boundary layer fluxes of heat, freshwater, and trace gases, radiation, and meteorology in the air; ice formation processes, ice thickness, snow depth, mass balance, and ice drift within the sea ice zone; and temperature, salinity, and momentum in the ocean below. Following collection of the field data, the team will improve both model parameterizations of air-sea-ice interactions and remote sensing algorithms. Model parameterizations are needed to determine if sea-ice production has increased in crucial areas, and if so, why (e.g., stronger winds or fresher oceans).  The remote sensing validation will facilitate change detection over wider areas and verify model predictions over time.  Accordingly this project will contribute to the international Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS) goal of measuring essential climate variables continuously to monitor the state of the ocean and ice cover into the future.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Ross Sea is known for showing the greatest sea ice increases observed globally, particularly over 1979-2015. However, corresponding changes in sea ice thickness and production in the Ross Sea are not known, nor how these changes have impacted water masses, carbon fluxes, biogeochemical processes and availability of micronutrients. The PIPERS (<em>Polynyas and Ice Production and seasonal Evolution in the Ross Sea</em>) project sought to address these questions during an autumn ship campaign in 2017 and two spring airborne campaigns in 2016 and 2017.</p> <p>To achieved its goals, PIPERS used a multidisciplinary approach of manned and autonomous platforms to study the coupled air-ocean-ice-biogeochemical interactions during autumn, with continuous autonomous observations extending into spring. As summarized below, PIPERS accomplished many of its goals (some are still pending), with key findings paving the way for future studies of its kind.</p> <p>Unexpectedly, the PIPERS field campaign occurred during record low sea ice extent, which stood in stark contrast to its globally-significant sea ice increases. The record low sea ice extent also meant a delayed ice edge advance by up to 2 months. This delay contributed to (1) increased sea ice production and export in coastal polynyas, (2) thinner snow and ice cover in the central pack, (3) lower sea ice Chl-a burdens and differences in sympagic communities, (4) sustained ocean heat flux delaying ice thickening, and (5) a melting, stalled ice edge persisting into winter. Despite these impacts, airborne observations the following spring suggested that winter ice production over the continental shelf was likely not anomalous.</p> <p>During its field campaign, PIPERS was the first to ever acquire ship-based observations in a very active dynamic coastal polynya in autumn. Repeated, strong katabatic wind events (up to 67 miles/hour) in Terra Nova Bay (TNB), a small but very active coastal polynya in the southwest Ross Sea, drove extreme loss of heat and copious ice production, high amplitude waves, and sub-surface frazil ice formation at depths down to 10 m. Thin pancake ice in the active wave environment was quickly removed from the formation area and thickened downstream by rafting. This rapid removal of ice, facilitated by both the intense katabatic wind events and a mobile pack exterior to the polynya served to maintain a more active ?ice factory? than previously observed during a 1998 autumn-winter cruise to TNB (the only other autumn-winter cruise to TNB).</p> <p>Using data acquired in TNB, PIPERS used three different methodologies to estimate sea ice production (SIP) rates that ranged from: (1) 0.75 m/day (bulk/integrative calculation, based on hourly-to-daily timescales), (2) 0.26 m/day to 1.1 m/day to 3.78 m/day (instantaneous calculations, based on seconds-to-minutes timescales), and (3) 0.19 m/day to 0.07 m/day (from near the coast to 30 km downwind of the coast, based on seasonal averages over April to September). These different rates reflect differences in integrating time scales (instantaneous to multi-month average), assumptions and conditions, while also underscoring the challenges and complexities of measuring SIP in the field under very harsh windy conditions.</p> <p>The SIP results also acknowledge the complicating feedback that the heat fluxes, and therefore the SIP rates, are highly dependent on whether there is already an ice cover in place and the type of ice present. The highest SIP estimates (for thermodynamic growth) were in areas of open water that dropped off strongly as the ice cover formed downwind. In contrast, the highest ice thickening rates were downwind away from the coast, where new ice piled up and was dynamically thickened. Any future work on better resolving SIP rates will ideally involve multi-platforms and multi-methodologies under a range of forcing and surface conditions, if we are to improve our understanding of the complex drivers of SIP.</p> <p>Since 2016, record low sea ice extents continue to appear in the Ross Sea. Given this context in particular, future analysis of PIPERS data will be aimed towards understanding the drivers and consequences of anomalous autumn ice advance on the ice-ocean-biogeochemical system. Although we have quantified SIP in TNB, a coastal polynya, identifying the air-ocean-ice interactions driving SIP and sea ice thickening of the pack ice along its northward trajectory, from the coastal polynyas to northward of the continental shelf, is still under analysis.</p> <p>The late start of the autumn ice growth season also resulted in late starts to (1) winter mixed layer deepening and the release of sub-surface ocean heat, and (2) Shelf Water production and convective overturning. The delayed release of ocean heat in particular likely slowed sea ice thickening into winter-spring (as indicated by drifting ice mass balance buoys). Whether late winter SIP in the central/outer pack and/or continued high SIP and export in the coastal polynyas contributed to near-average sea ice thickness in spring (based on airborne campaigns) is still under investigation and remains to be resolved.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/31/2019<br>      Modified by: Sharon&nbsp;E&nbsp;Stammerjohn</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1341606/1341606_10402554_1577830842147_Fig1_trn_adv2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1341606/1341606_10402554_1577830842147_Fig1_trn_adv2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1341606/1341606_10402554_1577830842147_Fig1_trn_adv2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1.

The delayed release of ocean heat in particular likely slowed sea ice thickening into winter-spring (as indicated by drifting ice mass balance buoys). Whether late winter SIP in the central/outer pack and/or continued high SIP and export in the coastal polynyas contributed to near-average sea ice thickness in spring (based on airborne campaigns) is still under investigation and remains to be resolved.
