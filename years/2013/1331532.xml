<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks funding for the Center for Water Equipment and Policy (WEP) located at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee (UWM). Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 11-570. The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Limited information is available on the relationship between surface microstructure and wettability by water and oil. This research will develop relationships between micro/nanostructural features such as grain size, orientation, texture, phase composition and morphology, and the surface wettability in metallic materials, and prescribe optimum surface micro/nanostructure with highest contact angle, potentially reducing corrosion, fouling, and wear of components used in the water industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The understanding of surface microstructure and wettability generated by this project using aluminum, brasses, cast iron and stainless steels will be applicable to other alloys, composites, polymers and ceramics. The proposed work could lead to lower cost alloys with only their surface modified during conventional processing instead of using bulk expensive alloys like stainless steels. This project will make recommendations to industry for optimum surface micro and nanostructure to minimize corrosion. The result of this research work will be disseminated to the manufacturers of water equipment and industries for them to synthesize these microstructures and use the surfaces of these components for water transport, storage and treatment during conventional manufacturing. The results of this research will be incorporated in basic materials science courses dealing with structure property relationships and advanced courses including corrosion, composites, metal casting, heat treatment and fluid flow. The proposed project work will also train graduate and undergraduate students for careers in the water industry, an increasingly important area of social concern.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The water industry has been facing issues with corrosion of components such as valves, flanges, and faucets. The continuous flow of water over a period of time leads to corrosive wear of the metallic surfaces. Furthermore, as corrosion develops on the surface a new layer with increased roughness that becomes a substrate for scum deposition is created. One of the techniques being studied to mitigate this issue is the development of self-cleaning, corrosion resistant bulk surfaces. This would allow for the smooth laminar flow of water through the components which will further reduce the costs required for pumping. This will also develop into a water repellent surface which will help in reducing corrosion. This project will enable the design of surface microstructures for alloys used by water industry based on the relationships developed between micro/nanostructure of alloys and contact angle. Both theoretical and experimental work will be done in this project to develop relationships between surface wettability and micro/nanostructural features such as grain size, phase composition, distribution and morphology, grain orientation and texture.

The microstructures of these alloys were also found to have a significant effect on the pressure contact angle and wettability.
