<AbstractNarration>The immune system is exquisitely capable of distinguishing self-tissues from foreign invaders, often with the goals of protecting the former and destroying the latter.  This creates a problem for those animals that birth live young following a prolonged pregnancy.  How the immune system avoids attacking the embryo that is genetically half foreign has been a central question in immunology for almost 60 years.  Using state-of-the-art, high-throughput gene sequencing technology to investigate patterns of gene expression, this project will investigate regulation of the immune system in the pregnant uterus at different time-points during gestation.  The model species to be used is the gray short-tailed opossum, a marsupial mammal native to South America.  As a marsupial, they are a very distant relative to humans and mice, but still have live birth following a short gestation.  Genes identified from sequencing that are candidates for immune regulation will be further investigated by localizing their expression to specific cell types in pregnant tissues.  By comparing species such as humans and mice to distant relatives such as opossums, mechanisms that are ancient and conserved, and therefore likely important, will be uncovered.  This project will provide a greater understanding of how the immune system is regulated to deal with pregnancy and has potential broader impact on reproductive health.  This project also provides outreach to faculty and students at Central New Mexico (CNM) community college. A CNM faculty member and two students will spend each summer in the principal investigator's laboratory working on some aspects of the project.  Students for this research opportunity will be chosen with the advice from CNM faculty members.  Preference will be given to students who are in the process of transferring to the four-year university setting to give them the opportunity to engage in independent projects with research active faculty.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  The aims of this project were to investigate the role of the immune system in pregnancy in mammals. The project took a comparative approach by comparing what is known about regulating the immune system with new discoveries in the laboratory opossum.  Opossums are marsupials, a lineage of mammals that last shared a common ancestor with humans more than 150 million years ago.  They represent humans' most distant mammalian relatives that also give birth to live young, rather than lay eggs.  Using state of the art DNA sequencing technologies, students working on this project were able to determine which genes are regulated during pregnancy and evaluate them for their relationship to the immune system. The results challenge an existing paradigm that marsupials give birth to their young after short gestations and less development due to failure to regulate the immune system and prevent immune rejection of the embryo.  Rather, the opossum does regulate specific aspects of the immune system throughout pregnancy.   In particular they suppress an arm of the immune system call the Complement system, which is an ancient arm of the immune system.  These results support the hypothesis that regulating the Complement system is important in successful human pregnancy and is an ancient feature of mammalian reproduction.      An unexpected outcome of this project was the discovery of a burst of production of inflammatory molecules at the end of opossum pregnancy, immediately prior to birth.  These results support a role for mediators of inflammation in the immune system in the birth mechanism itself.  These results demonstrate that this response also found in humans is an early mammalian feature and may be fundamental to successful pregnancy.     Broader Impacts  This project contributed substantially to the training of the US science workforce.  During this project, seven young investigators participated.  One was a postdoctoral fellow who is currently employed at another major US university.  Three were graduate students who all successfully completed their Ph.D. Two are currently employed in US Government laboratories as postdoctoral fellows. The third is currently weighing employment opportunities.  Three undergraduate students also gained research experience.  All three have completed their B.S. degrees, two are currently in Medical School, the third has been accepted to graduate school and will begin working on her Ph.D. in Autumn 2019.  Of the seven participants 5 were women, contributing significantly to the gender diversity of the US workforce.   The results of this project contribute to the scientific community and society in general beyond the primary aims.  The data generated by the sequencing studies has been deposited in public data repositories and is available to other investigators to analyze.  In addition the results increase out understanding of fundamental aspects of the immune system and successful pregnancy.  This has relevance to human health and reproduction as well as reproduction of economically important livestock.
