<AbstractNarration>This grant will support a two-and-a-half-day long workshop on Computational Audition, bringing together top scientists from a broad range of disciplines. Computational audition, the study of how information can be derived from sound in both biological organisms and in machines, is an emerging field. The topic is broad, encompassing a diverse group of scientists including neuroscientists, psychologists, psychophysicists, speech scientists, computer scientists, and engineers. The field of computational audition has the potential to be a model of interdisciplinary research with a great deal of intrinsic intellectual interest. It is primed to become a hotbed of scientific growth, and this meeting will help the field evolve toward that goal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;Computational audition is important both for developing new technological applications as well as for finding new clinical treatments (because understanding the basis of normal hearing will help treat hearing impairment). And yet by comparison to many other related fields, its potential is underexplored. For instance, research on human and machine perception has been dominated to a large extent by vision, with hearing neglected by comparison. This workshop will nurture the development of interdisciplinary research in computational audition that will capitalize on this potential.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Two computational neuroscience workshops were held:   - one on computational audition  - one on mulitsensory computation.  The workshops were both very well received and gave birth to many new collaborations.  New projects grew out of these meetings.  A research team who participated in the Computational Audition workshop (Slaney, Mesgarni, Shinn-Cunningham, and Rajaram) then met at the Telluride Neuromorphic Cognition workshop in 2013 and assisted with a project extracting information about auditory attention and its modulatory effects on electroencephalography signals. This work recently resulted in a shared journal article that appeared as a "feature article" in Cerebral Cortex.  An interdisciplinary research team put together a Science of Learning Networking proposal that is being considered for funding imminently. This team included researchers involved in the Multisensory Summit (Shinn-Cunningham, Somers, Sekuler, Lee, and Holt).  Four participants from the multisensory workshop put together a proposal for a multisensory mini-symposium at the annual Society for Neuroscience conference (Romanski, Schroeder, Holt, Wallace).  One participant (Holt) from the multisensory workshop was inspired to apply for a sabbatical fellowship. She wrote "Soon after returning from the CELEST Multisensory Summit, I submitted an application to the James McKeen Cattell faculty sabbatical fellowship that was subsequently awarded."  An interdisciplinary research team is currently putting together a new proposal for an Army Research Laboratory Multi-University Research Initiative call, looking at Multisensory Brain Computer Interfaces.  Both workshops included a large number of student and post-doc participants, who presented posters that highlighted their work, and who met with the senior investigators throughout the meetings.
