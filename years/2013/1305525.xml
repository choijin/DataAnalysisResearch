<AbstractNarration>In this project the investigators will explore phenomena that span the tree of life: from metabolism in bacteria, through the determination of cell fate in embryonic development, to coding and computation of sensory information in the brain. They have identified broad theoretical problems which cut across the traditional biological divisions of organism and system: Do living organisms operate near the limits set by the laws of physics as they gather and process information? Can the detailed microscopic model of an organism, its wiring diagram be understood from the finite set of observations that can be made on how it behaves? How do organisms set the parameters that govern their function (i.e. how do they learn from experience)? These questions will be given a mathematical form, which will guide a search for answers in terms of general principles, in the tradition of physics, that will apply across disparate biological domains. The participants in the project will assemble into subgroups to attack instances of these problems. The individual projects will have unusual scope: as an example, the question whether the complex statistics of biological behavior can be captured in a learnable mathematical model will be asked in very similar terms both of spiking retinal neurons, and of the antibody sequence repertoire of individual zebrafish. These questions will be answered in the light of accurate data and the work will involve a close partnership with many experimental groups in fields ranging from bacteriology to human perceptual psychology. The product of these interactions will be the design of novel experiments and the creation of novel data analysis methods in order to address clearly formulated mathematical questions of broad significance. An important component of this project is the training of a new generation of physicists for whom the development of a theoretical understanding of biological systems is a central part of their discipline. The graduate students and postdoctoral scholars who pass through the group will learn by example how to pursue that goal in a way consistent with the intellectual rigor and traditions of physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported the work of three physicists who believe that "living matter" is a proper subject of study for theoretical physics.  They hope to show that mathematically expressed principles can be used to understand, organize, and predict real data on real biological systems, across the kingdoms of life (from bacteria to brains). They believe this endeavor is of critical importance for biology itself: technological advances (like high-throughput DNA sequencing) are deluging biology with data in such quantities that understanding what the data means is impossible without some formal, mathematical, framework to hang it on. This is what theoretical physics does, for example, for the vast quantities of data that are collected by survey telescopes that look out at the cosmos: an underlying theory turns millions of seemingly random data points into knowledge that the universe was created 13.7 billion years ago and will expand forever. The goal of this grant was to show that something similar could be done for biology. The enterprise is in its infancy, but promising first steps involving the use of concepts from statistical physics to come to grips with the randomness of biological phenomena have been taken. We briefly describe a few of them below.  Life is more than the sum of its parts. From the spectacular aerial displays by flocks of birds down to the coordinated movements of cells in a developing embryo, many of the most striking phenomena in the living world are the result of interactions among thousands of individual elements.   Is it possible that the phenomenon of birds in a flock agreeing to fly in the same direction is like the alignment of spins in a magnet?  Over the course of this grant we have shown that this is not just a metaphor, but the nucleus of a quantitative theory.  We have developed a simple mathematical description for the velocities of birds in a flock, showing how interactions between neighbors can propagate to generate order in the entire flock.  This description captures not just the qualitative alignment of all birds on average, but the details of how individual bird flight paths fluctuate around this average.  Strikingly, very similar mathematical ideas allow us to describe the electrical activity of large groups of neurons in the brain.  Even in areas of the brain where there is a well-developed, qualitative picture of what neurons are doing - as for the famous "place cells" in the rodent hippocampus, which respond when the animal arrives at a particular place in the world - we find that our approach captures details in the pattern of activity across the network that are completely missed by the classical view.   Our immune system consists of many millions of types of T and B cells, each one able to protect against a different set of potential pathogens. These cells, with their individual specificities, are created by a random genome editing process that acts each time a new immune cell is created.
