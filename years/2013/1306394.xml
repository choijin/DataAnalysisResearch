<AbstractNarration>The investigator has two-fold purpose in this project both relate to cost-effective methods of collecting high-efficiency data in Phase I, Phase II and Phase III pharmaceutical trials involving drug discovery/drug abuse, heart-related QT/QTc studies, evaluation of new drugs for unwanted effects and also in experiments dealing with processing of minerals involving chemical reactions. Akin to PK/PD models, one requires complex non-linear models in dealing with medical/chemical/environmental studies. In this context, dwelling on Klimpels floatation recovery model, chemical kinetic model and compartment model, the investigator develops analytically sound and innovative techniques for optimal/nearly optimal estimation of the underlying model parameters with constrained experimental conditions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this proposal is to provide research practitioners in fMRI studies, medicine, and pharmacy with ready-to-use statistical/computational software for carrying out cost-effective experiments. Research outcomes on compartment models will allow formal rigorous inference and analysis based on clinical or experimental data for complicated HIV dynamic models. Research practitioners in fMRI studies, medicine, and pharmacy can save time and money by using the new to-be-developed software-based crossover designs.</AbstractNarration>
