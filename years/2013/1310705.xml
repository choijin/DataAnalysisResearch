<AbstractNarration>This action funds Debra Perrone of Vanderbilt Institute for Energy and Environment at Vanderbilt University to conduct a research project in Geosciences during the summer of 2013 at the National University of Singapore in Singapore.  The project title is "Sri Lanka's Water-Food-Energy Nexus: An Economic Analysis of Water Allocation Schemes." The host scientist is Dennis Wichelns, Director of the Institute of Water Policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The water-energy-food nexus is a central focus in efforts to allocate scarce water resources. This work explores how Sri Lanka, a small island nation in South Asia, makes choices in allocating its water resources with respect to energy and food: water for energy and economic growth or water for agriculture, food security, and cultural preservation. A portfolio of scenarios is created to understand projected water supply and water demand within Sri Lanka over the next twenty years. Different water management scenarios are explored using opportunity cost theory, and tradeoffs are analyzed to prioritize water allocation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Dissemination of the anticipated results is a key aspect of the proposed work, as the results are intended to inform decision makers and support effective management of water resources. All results from this researchl will be published in peer-reviewed journals, presented at national and international conferences, and available on the Vanderbilt Institute for Energy and Environment webpage.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ My EAPSI project piggybacks off an ongoing project undertaken by Vanderbilt Institute for Energy and Environment where a diverse set of researchers from psychology, sociology, environmental science, and engineering are collaborating to investigate agricultural adaption to water scarcity in Sri Lanka. The opportunity to network with peers and colleagues who have similar interests fostered future partnerships and collaborations among the Vanderbilt Institute for Energy and Environment, International Water Management Institute in Sri Lanka, and Institute of Water Policy at National NUS.     Living in Singapore for the summer made traveling to Sri Lanka more efficient; during the summer I was able to make two field visits to Sri Lanka to meet with stakeholders and obtain data for my research. My field visits promoted my understanding of the water-energy-food nexus, as well as the water management hierarchy in Sri Lanka. Also, I was able to make connections with local government agencies in Sri Lanka (e.g., Mahaweli Authority, Ceylon Electricity Board, National Water Supply and Drainage Board). The baseline data I collected from my field visits has allowed me to develop my economic optimization model; work on this project is ongoing.      In addition to gaining a first-hand research experience in Asia, participating in the summer program at the National University of Singapore allowed me to gain additional perspective on global political, social, environmental, and economic issues. Resource security and decision-making are multifaceted and complex research areas; experience and training gained with respect to interdisciplinary and international collaboration strongly contributed to my career goals.
