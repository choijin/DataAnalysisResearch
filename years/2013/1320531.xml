<AbstractNarration>Modern computing systems require manipulation of persistent&lt;br/&gt;data. However, the mechanisms to access persistent data are separated&lt;br/&gt;from the mechanisms to manipulate such data in a traditional two-level&lt;br/&gt;storage model: persistent data is stored in non-volatile storage, such&lt;br/&gt;as hard disks or solid-state disks, whereas it is manipulated in&lt;br/&gt;volatile memory, such as DRAM.  Unfortunately, this decoupled model of&lt;br/&gt;system design leads to large amounts of inefficiency in terms of both&lt;br/&gt;performance and energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research undertakes a rethinking of the memory and storage&lt;br/&gt;systems in the presence of new and emerging non-volatile memory&lt;br/&gt;technologies such as phase-change memory , spin-transfer torque RAM,&lt;br/&gt;and memristors. These technologies promise large capacities at low&lt;br/&gt;latency, making them prime candidates for the design of a single-level&lt;br/&gt;coordinated memory and storage system where the manipulation and&lt;br/&gt;storage of all data are unified. Yet, there are significant&lt;br/&gt;application-level and system-level efficiency and correctness&lt;br/&gt;challenges in devising such a single-level store with emerging&lt;br/&gt;technologies. The central goal of this project is to develop&lt;br/&gt;hardware/software cooperative techniques to enable high-performance&lt;br/&gt;and energy-efficient single-level stores in computer systems targeting&lt;br/&gt;a wide range of applications in cloud computing, client systems, and&lt;br/&gt;mobile systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It is expected that research performed in this project will enable new&lt;br/&gt;applications and much more robust and efficient data storage systems,&lt;br/&gt;making our daily lives that increasingly depend on data processing&lt;br/&gt;better and more productive. Enabling unified memory and storage for&lt;br/&gt;modern computing systems can largely reduce wasted work and take&lt;br/&gt;advantage of emerging low-power technologies, thereby taking a large&lt;br/&gt;step in making computing more energy efficient.</AbstractNarration>
