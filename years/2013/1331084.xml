<AbstractNarration>To effectively mitigate volcanic eruption hazards and understand eruption dynamics it is necessary to 1) identify the different types of volcanic emissions and 2) quantify the relative proportions, amounts, and location of these volcanic emissions. However, the difficulty of obtaining accurate, real-time, and continuous volcanic emissions measurements is well known. Relating infrasound, or low frequency sound, to volcanic emissions shows particular promise towards quantifying and understanding volcanic emissions, suggesting that infrasound may provide a tool to indirectly quantify and characterize volcanic emissions. In this project we will perform a detailed, quantitative analysis of the diverse infrasound signals from Karymsky Volcano, Kamchatka, Russia with corresponding measurements of volcanic emissions. The primary objectives are to 1) identify and characterize the infrasound signals from the diverse activity at Karymsky, 2) collect detailed volcanic emissions data (both gas and tephra), 3) identify infrasound signals characteristic of certain types of emissions; and 4) quantitatively correlate temporal trends in infrasound signals with the mass flux of volcanic emissions. We aim to develop quantitative relationships between volcanic emissions and infrasound based both on theoretical and empirical analysis. An additional goal of this project is to validate a multi-spectral infrared camera technique for measuring volcanic emissions with established tephra sampling and ultraviolet remote sensing SO2 measurement techniques.&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses important questions in volcanology and geophysics regarding infrasound signals, volcanic emissions, and eruption dynamics. To address these questions an unprecedented multiparameter dataset will be collected and analyzed, which will lead to a better understanding of the release of volcanic emissions and their observable infrasound signals. This understanding will improve monitoring and detection of volcanic hazards and the viability of using infrasound as a remote, continuous tool to detect and characterize volcanic emissions will be evaluated. This project will also increase our understanding of eruption source mechanisms, which will benefit a wide variety of volcanologists and geoscientists. Collaboration amongst a highly qualified international team of scientists will occur. Education is emphasized heavily as students from the International Volcanological Field School will participate in the field experiment and will gain invaluable experience in active volcanism and international collaboration.</AbstractNarration>
