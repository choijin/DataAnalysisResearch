<AbstractNarration>The surface-albedo feedback (SAF) from mountain snow cover is one of the dominant influences on the regional-scale response to large-scale climate variability and change in the mid-latitudes. At global scales, detailed analyses have illuminated the controls on the SAF and sources of spread in SAF magnitude between global climate models (GCMs). While regional climate model (RCM) simulations over complex terrain suggest substantial regional effects of the SAF, no detailed quantitative analysis of the regional SAF has been undertaken. This project will quantify and diagnose the SAF in high-resolution RCM simulations over the Rocky Mountains (and later the continental United States) using the WRF model. They include 8-year reanalysis-forced control simulations and 8-year pseudo-global-warming (PGW) simulations, wherein reanalysis boundary conditions are perturbed by monthly mean changes predicted by a GCM under greenhouse&lt;br/&gt;forcing. This framework allows for clean diagnosis of thermodynamic and mesoscale mechanisms of climate change in isolation from changes in large-scale circulations and storminess. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Analysis will include:  (i) Quantification of the SAF and its contributions from various physical processes: The SAF will be separated from other forcings and feedbacks via linear feedback analysis and via RCM simulations with a suppressed SAF. The mechanisms controlling the strength of the SAF will be diagnosed including: the relative roles of snow cover and snow metamorphism changes, the atmosphere masking of surface albedo changes, and the role of atmospheric advection.  (ii) Evaluation of simulated snow cover and albedo: RCM output will be evaluated against high-resolution remote sensing provided by the MODIS instrument (including the new MODSCAG snow product) to critically test the realism of the simulated SAF and identify sources of bias.  (iii) Examination of the interactions between the SAF and regional-scale circulations:  This will include a determination of the role of advection in balancing radiative perturbations and the role of radiative perturbations in altering thermally driven mesoscale circulations.  (iv) Comparison with other mountain ranges, forcing scenarios, and model parameterizations:  Analysis of additional simulations with different model configurations will be used to understand how geographic setting modulates the SAF.  It will also be used to examine differences in the SAF between simulations with and without changes in large-scale circulations or dust-on-snow forcing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational impacts at the graduate level will include mentoring and training of a student.  At the undergraduate level, a course on the environmental science of mountainous regions will be enriched with RCM output from the project and field observations.  At the high school level, annual classroom visits and weeklong summer camps on weather and climate for local students will be developed.  These programs will serve urban districts with high populations of minorities underrepresented in the STEM fields.  The camps will engage students through lectures, demonstrations, hands-on laboratory experiences, and an interactive field trip to a local mountaintop observatory.  Students will be introduced to the university environment, career options, and a range of role models.  This will serve to enable, excite, and recruit students for future study and employment in the atmospheric sciences specifically and STEM in general.</AbstractNarration>
