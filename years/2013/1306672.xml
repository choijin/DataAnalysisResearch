<AbstractNarration>The current dominant paradigm in cosmic ray (CR) research says that the bulk of Galactic CRs with energies below a peta-electron volt are created in supernova remnants (SNRs) via diffusive shock acceleration.  This is now at a turning point: soon, the comparison between theoretical calculations and observations from the radio band to gamma rays to high energy neutrinos is expected to either confirm the paradigm or call for a paradigm shift.  This project will develop novel theoretical and observational techniques to test the SNR paradigm.  The theoretical studies are based around a common theme: how do cosmic rays modify the structure of the shock?  The work will investigate magnetic field amplification, injection and acceleration of CRs, and the role of dust sputtering and the large neutral component in the upstream plasma.  Analysis of neutral hydrogen in the so-called Balmer-dominated shocks should lead to a novel way to measure the shock acceleration efficiency.  The research will include consideration of how cosmic rays escape their acceleration sites and propagate towards the Earth and of the kinetic diffusion of CRs.  Modeling of time- and spatially-dependent particle dynamics will be compared with observed non-thermal filaments and tied to the results of high energy particle observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a multidisciplinary project involving data analysis and theoretical and computational work in astrophysics and plasma physics.  Work with students in the Purdue Computer Graphics Technology Department will lead to an interactive kiosk, in partnership with Purdue's Discovery Learning Center, to explain about CRs to all visiting groups, including K-12 students, teachers, and the general public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    This multidisciplinary proposal combined research in broad areas of high energy astrophysics, plasma physics and space physics. The results of the investigation  both advanced our understanding of basic plasma processes and were used to model astrophysical sources of high energy emission.             We have developed a model of neutral-mediated shocks generated by fast moving pulsars.     Turbulence in PWNe gives rise to high diffusive particle transport. Comparing the results from MHD simulations that contain an integrated test-particle component with the diffusion coefficient derived from a formalism based on correlations of the flow velocity field, we conclude that MHD turbulence gives rise to high diffusivities that are important for particle transport.     We demonstrated that the termination shock of the relativistic wind from the Crab pulsar is a reality and that this shock is a location of efficient particle acceleration. The shock model of the inner knot allows us to constrain the parameters of the wind from the Crab pulsar.     We develop a model of early GRB afterglows with the dominant X-ray contribution from the reverse shock (RS) propagating in highly relativistic magnetized wind of a long-lasting central engine.     We show that inclusion of the current sheet-free magnetic field in the AGN jet further enhances the stability. Both pinch and kink mode instabilities become progressively more stable with increasing magnetization.    We discovered  the reason for the failure of the self-similar analytical model of the jet reconfinement in relatively flat atmospheres and elucidated the nature of radial oscillations of steady-state jets.    We develop a model of particle acceleration in explosive reconnection events in relativistic magnetically-dominated plasmas and apply it to explain gamma-ray flares from the Crab Nebula.     We addressed the structure of pair- and radiation-loaded shock transitions. The first most important effect is the energy redistribution within the flow due to diffusive propagation of radiation. This generically leads to the formation of a special surface within the flow - the isothermal jump.           Last Modified: 12/02/2018       Submitted by: Maxim Y Lyutikov]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
