<AbstractNarration>IIA-1330691, University of Maine, Michael Eckardt &lt;br/&gt;Linked to: IIA-1330641, University of New Hampshire, Jane A. Nisbet &lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Collaborative Research: Strengthening the Scientific Basis for Decision-making: Advancing sustainability science and knowledge-action capacities in coupled coastal systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The states of Maine (ME) and New Hampshire (NH) propose the New England SusTainability Consortium (NEST) to capitalize on synergies between their research and development capacities that can advance the theory and practice of sustainability science to strengthen connections between science and decision making. Sustainability Science focuses on developing solutions to pressing societal problems involving the dual challenge of improving human well-being and protecting the planet?s life support systems. NEST?s initial focus is on scientific challenges related to the sustainable management of coastal systems. Specifically, ME and NH combine complementary research strengths to examine systems interactions between watershed processes and human activities that contribute to high populations of pathogenic bacteria in coastal waters, which in turn trigger decisions to close economically important beaches and shellfisheries. Closure decisions are currently made with inadequate scientific knowledge, and long-term trends suggest worsening coastal pollution that will require more frequent decisions of this nature.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The coastal closure problem provides a promising model system for growing NEST?s ability to investigate and strengthen the connection between science and decision-making. NEST unites diverse capabilities to advance sustainability science via several innovative mechanisms: 1) combining expertise drawn from over ten STEM disciplines representing natural science, social science, and engineering; 2) integrating insights gained from different research approaches (e.g. bacterial metatranscriptomics, behavioral economics, watershed sensor networks, institutional analysis, hydrologic modeling, environmental communication); 3) conducting research on spatial scales ranging from microbes to watersheds, and temporal scales spanning short-term bacterial growth to multi-decadal changes in land use and climate. NEST will use innovative systems thinking and state-of-the-art research tools while emphasizing how the coupled watershed-human systems under study influences, and responds to, decision-making by individuals and institutions. In addition, the research will include an examination of NEST?s organizational processes (e.g. collaboration, communication, integrative cross-jurisdictional education and research) to inform the global science and practice of interdisciplinary team science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts &lt;br/&gt;NEST pursues the goal of advancing the scientific basis of decision-making through a process that is broadly inclusive of many segments of society. University students and faculty researchers collaborate with diverse stakeholders (e.g. government, shellfish harvesters, citizen scientists). The project supports the construction of an expanded network of environmental sensors that will strengthen informal and formal science education. The proposed work creates innovative, solutions-driven networks that connect diverse universities and colleges, all levels of government, tribal communities, Non-Governmental Organizations, citizens, and the private sector.</AbstractNarration>

With the addition of a second project in 2015, The Future of Dams, NEST has expanded to include Rhode Island institutions. Research thrusts. This Safe Beaches and Shellfish Project addressed water quality and public health issues of importance to many coastal communities regionally and nationally.  Early, active, and iterative engagement with diverse stakeholders resulted in a broad suite of impacts from this work and advancements in the theory and practice of sustainability science discipline. For example, a decision support system (DSS) is under development based on an integrative conceptual model linking bacterial source, delivery, and residence time processes. The DSS uses a suite of water quality datasets and analytical tools developed in partnership with state agencies, nonprofits, and individuals. Coast-wide research focused on patterns and relationships among coupled natural and social systems that influence the resilience of beaches and shellfish. Coast-wide analysis of coupled social and natural processes, decision making, and use and production of science were combined to improve understanding of system interactions that contribute to high levels of microbial pathogens and indicator bacteria in coastal waters and influence system responses. Place-based research employed a multi-case study design to provide deep understanding of social and biophysical phenomena in places and at scales relevant to stakeholders and informative to coast-wide understanding.  Intellectual Merit A conceptual model brought together the social-ecological systems research focused on sources, delivery, and residence time with parallel consideration of factors that influence connections between scientific knowledge and decision-making. This conceptual model served as an important boundary object to coordinate across six different disciplines spanning the natural and social sciences: hydrogeomorphology, environmental communication and sustainability science, marine biology and oceanography, microbiology, spatial information sciences, and macro-ecology. Decision support systems (DSS) provided information to individuals, municipal officials, state and national coastal programs, aimed at management of both beach and shellfish resources. The portfolio included products (data, maps, tools, models); interactions to better understand information needs and design decision support processes; and knowledge-action systems or networks comprised of individuals, organizations, communication networks, and supporting institutional structures. To prevent human illness from pathogenic Vibrio species affecting shellfish methods were developed to detect the actual pathogenic strains of Vibrio species and a patent application was filed for a new assay to detect V. parahaemolyticus in oysters. Forecasting models of the incidence and concentrations of pathogenic vibrios in regional shellfish harvest areas were developed to inform harvest management practices to reduce risks of vibrio-borne illness associated with raw shellfish consumption. A model for prediction of watershed microbial contamination along the Maine coast, including a new high-resolution topographic map of the coastline delineating boundaries of watersheds and drainage networks, was developed. A hydrodynamic and particle tracking model was developed with stakeholders to enable investigation of estuarine parameter space with different combinations of environmental forcings. At the conclusion of the project in July 2016, 42 peer-reviewed publications had been published and 25 manuscripts are in review or development. Thirty-two competitive, peer-reviewed awards had been received, representing $30,235,968 in follow-on funding to extend research efforts initiated by the project. Broader Impacts Stakeholder engagement: The Safe Beaches and Shellfish Project supported research that is relevant to diverse coastal decision makers by providing analyses, information, data, and models and building shared research capacity. Researchers and stakeholders collaboratively refined the questions, methods, and the identification of potential solutions, such as the development of the DSS and the identification of management trigger levels for beach and shellfish bed closures. Research data is publicly available on the NH EPSCoR Data Discovery Center (https://ddc.unh.edu/).
