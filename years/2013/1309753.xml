<AbstractNarration>Genes provide the genetic code for proteins which are the building blocks of cells and organisms.  Most eukaryotic genes contain one or more non-coding regions, called introns.  Introns are typically removed (spliced out) during the cellular processes that decode genes to build proteins.  Some intron positions in genes have been retained in species as diverse as plants and animals, possibly because they are functionally important.  Other introns have been lost from genes independently in different evolutionary lineages, and it may be that the intron loss provided some selective advantage to the organism.  It is important to understand the mechanisms that lead to intron loss in plants.  The proposed research aims to investigate whether introns that are spliced out more efficiently during cellular processes have a higher chance of ultimately being lost from the genome.  Large-scale sequencing of RNA, which essentially provides a blue print of all genes that are expressed, during different stages of cellular processing, will yield information for each gene on the relative rate with which the introns are spliced out.  Statistical analyses will be carried out to determine whether splicing rates are correlated with patterns of genomic intron loss.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some introns, either by their content, their size or their location can regulate gene expression and hence are functionally important.  Genomic loss of introns may lead to altered expression, which may provide the plasticity needed for species to adapt to new environments.  Knowledge of the mechanisms that lead to intron loss will help to understand species evolution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit              A typical eukaryotic gene is comprised of protein-coding exons and non-coding introns.  The number of genes containing introns, number of introns per gene and size of the introns differ vastly between eukaryotic species.  However, between evolutionarily close species, such as species within the grass family, Poaceae, the gene structure with respect to the position and the number of introns is typically unchanged.  We identified a gene, ABCB1, which contains nine introns in most dicot and non-grass monocot species, but carries only one to four introns in different members of the grass family indicating a pattern of parallel evolutionary loss of introns.  This phenomenon of parallel loss of introns is rare (Wang et al. 2014).  Theoretically, an altered gene structure may lead to novel functions.  Through the dissertation improvement grant, we aimed to gain insights into the possible mechanisms of intron loss.  We hypothesized that introns that were processed faster by the cellular machinery were more likely to be lost in evolution.               To test our hypothesis, we analyzed gene transcripts during various stages of processing in two grass species, rice and sorghum.  The gene transcripts were sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq platform. Detailed data analysis is ongoing.  In a preliminary analysis, we compared transcript characteristics of a set of genes that were structurally conserved with those of a set of genes that underwent either single or parallel intron loss in at least one of five grass species, Brachypodium distachyon, rice, sorghum, maize and Setaria italica.  Preliminary results indicate that genes that underwent genomic intron loss (1) are more highly expressed than genes that are unchanged in structure and (2) have a different TG/CG ratio, which is a measure of historical methylation, than conserved genes. As expected, transcripts isolated from the nuclei, where gene processing occurs, have higher read coverage across introns than cytoplasmic transcripts.  A surprising finding, however, was that read coverage of introns that had been lost in one or more grass species was higher than that of introns that were conserved across the five grass species analyzed.  The effects of additional parameters such as location of the intron and intron size are currently being investigated.   Broader Impacts                 Although several studies focusing on gene processing have been conducted in animal model systems, to our knowledge, this is the first genome-wide study that analyzes processing of gene transcripts in the grasses.  This dataset will allow us to determine whether intron processing is correlated with genomic intron loss, and if and how gene processing is different between plants species, and between plants and animals. Furthermore, the nuclei isolation protocol developed in this project has shown promise in isolating high quality nuclei in non-grass species such as poplar and Arabidopsis and will be useful to the plant science research community.
