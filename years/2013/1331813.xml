<AbstractNarration>This project develops a novel computational Green Infrastructure (GI) design framework that integrates interactive, neighborhood-scale, collaborative design by multiple stakeholders ("crowd-sourced" design) with multi-scale models of ecosystem and human impacts. The following research questions are being addressed: (1) How well does coupling of site-scale ecohydrology with catchment-scale hydraulic routing improve predictions? (2) How well can stakeholder preferences be predicted using design image feature extraction and machine learning? (3) What interactive optimization and visualization techniques lead to the most rapid and complete consensus among diverse stakeholders? (4) Do stakeholders using interactive cyberinfrastructure tools consider more options and explore more of the GI design space?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A "crowd-sourced" design framework is developed to enable stakeholders to interactively create and evaluate potential GI designs that reflect consideration of the full breadth of social, economic, and environmental criteria. The research questions are evaluated in diverse neighborhoods within three urban catchments in the Baltimore Ecosystem Study, working closely with environmental non-governmental organizations to ensure that the results will provide significant benefits to community stakeholders. The models developed in this project are the first to integrate criteria for human and ecosystem wellbeing with site- and watershed-scale hydrologic processes, a key advance for improving understanding and implementation of GI design. Map and image visualization identifies which visualization approaches best support improving stakeholder engagement for achieving consensus using interactive collaborative design. This makes technical advances in interactive optimization and model parameterization accessible to the broad range of stakeholders, from regulators and planners to contractors and homeowners.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was a collaborative effort by researchers at the University of North Carolina (PI &ndash; L. Band) and the University of Illinois (PI-B. Minsker).  We developed and coupled detailed models for urban watershed hydrological and ecosystem processes to be used as part of new green infrastructure (GI) and increased urban tree canopy design and evaluation.  These products and important tools to aid in building watershed sustainability and resilience through evaluation and guidance of efficient design and implementation of new stormwater controls and watershed restoration approaches with participatory input from local residents and stakeholders. Components including an advanced watershed simulation model, workflows to organize and process detailed spatial data describing the topography, land cover, drainage infrastructure and vegetation of a watershed, and visualization and evaluation of the efficiency of different GI and tree canopy scenarios.  While these components include detailed ecohydrological models and associated software that typically require a high level of expertise to use, deployment on cloud resources with web interfaces facilitates their use by a wide range of people, from scientists through stormwater engineers, NGOs and residents.   The system was developed and applied to catchments in Baltimore, MD, Durham, NC and Portland, OR, with significant feedback from stormwater utility personnel.   The ecohydrological modeling framework developed was designed to operate at spatial and temporal scales amenable to management of urban watersheds, and human (residential) experiential activity and knowledge of potential hydrological and ecological restoration options.  Landscape management at these scales include vegetation management (e.g. lawns, shrubs, tree planting and maintenance), green infrastructure design and implementation (rain gardens, bioswales), and effects on street runoff, flooding, pollution loading as a result of these activities.  These models reveal that similar GI designs in similar watersheds can result in very different efficiencies of stormwater mitigation depending on hydrogeologic differences and prior urban tree canopy:  One size does not fit all.  The significance of this result is that most stormwater crediting methods are based on a uniform credit per Stormwater Control Method (SCM) for stormwater volumes, and pollutant loading reductions irrespective of placement within a watershed, or differences in watershed geomorphology and prior land cover.  Our research has demonstrated that more detailed representation of watershed form and process facilitates more optimal design of SCM networks based on local watershed conditions. Hence, the importance of providing and facilitating the use of detailed, process based tools.   The more detailed methods require interfaces and tools to facilitate their use.

Testing and demonstrations with groups of stormwater engineers from five cities in the US (Baltimore, Durham NC, Portland OR, Chicago and Phoenix) were carried out, with a more detailed demonstration and hands on session with personnel from stormwater utilities, a watershed NGO and landscape architects in Baltimore.  Each of these activities provided both training to students and management personnel, and feedback to project personnel.
