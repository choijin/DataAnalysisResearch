<AbstractNarration>(1) Technical description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deserts are a critical end-member in biome reconstructions used to help constrain our understanding of paleoclimatology. Yet given the lower fossilization potential for desert plants and animals, direct paleontological evidence of climate change is much less abundant from arid environments than from other terrestrial ecosystems. However, following the model of wind-blown pollen, potentially continuous sedimentary records can be derived from small eolian particles carrying molecular biomarkers. We posit that one such molecule is scytonemin, a pigment that is produced by cyanobacteria in desert microbiotic soil crusts to protect against UV exposure. We have recently published a mid-Holocene record of sedimentary scytonemin from the Black Sea, and stable isotope analysis supports a desert microbiotic soil source for these molecules. Furthermore, the Black Sea record coincided with 7-methylheptadecane, which is also enriched in desert microbiotic soil cyanobacteria. In a pilot study, we showed that scytonemin is preserved in Great Salt Lake sediments as old as 11,000 years, and its highest concentrations appear to be associated with other sedimentary signs of arid conditions, suggesting that scytonemin may be a representative tracer of cyanobacteria in desert microbiotic soil crusts. Thus, we hypothesize that scytonemin is a biomarker of aridity, with increased accumulation when deserts expanded and cyanobacteria-dominated microbiotic soil crusts became more prevalent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;We propose developing scytonemin and 7-methylheptadecane as molecular biomarkers to reconstruct records of past aridity in the late Quaternary and deeper into the Phanerozoic by addressing four overarching questions: (1) Does scytonemin degradation yield molecular fragments that are chemically recognizable and analytically tractable in ancient geological samples? (2) What is the physiological relationship between scytonemin and 7-methylheptadecane production in desert microbiotic soil cyanobacteria? (3) Do scytonemin and 7-methylheptadecane distributions in the Great Salt Lake and the Gulf of California reflect changes in aridity since the Last Glacial Maximum? (4) Were the Late Permian and Early Triassic characterized by increased aridity?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research incorporates biochemical, microbial physiological, organic geochemical, paleoclimatological, and geological components. We anticipate showing that two types of compounds, one a pigment associated with exposure to ultraviolet radiation and the other a lipid associated with desiccation, produced by photosynthetic cyanobacteria in desert soils can be used to trace the spread of arid conditions in the recent (Holocene; the last 12,000 years) and distant (Permian-Triassic; ca. 252 Ma). This work requires a combination of liquid and gas phase chromatography to separate the target compounds from other organic molecules that are also found in modern and ancient sediments. A variety of mass spectrometric techniques, including high resolution mass spectrometry and stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry, will help identify the target compounds and determine their ecological source, for example if they were derived from desert soils or other potential sources such as microbial mats. Ultimately, development of these biomarkers should help us decipher past climate change using a new organic geochemical approach that may modify or enhance our current understanding of aridity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) Broader significance and importance&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the past climate record (paleoclimate) is arguably of great utility in enabling us to predict future climate scenarios.  Often, we can look to the fossil record to find information about past climates.  However, this leaves a gap in our knowledge about arid environments, where it is less likely for a strong fossil record to exist.  The purpose of this project is to develop a method to inform us about past conditions in dry places.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cyanobacteria, which are microorganisms found in desert soil crusts, produce molecules in response to climactic conditions--one is a pigment, scytonemin, that acts as a "sunscreen" to protect the cyanobacteria from UV radiation, and the other is 7-methylheptadecane, a lipid associated with dessication.  In this study, the research team will examine the production of these molecules by cyanobacteria in response to environmental conditions, examine their breakdown products, and determine the utility of these molecules as markers of aridity in past environments.  This work has implications for enabling us to build a more complete understanding of the past behavior of dry environments, which could help us to better model future climate in the arid environments of today.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project focused on the study of environmental distributions of the compound scytonemin, aiming to develop new ways to use it as an indicator for environmental change. Cyanobacteria, a diverse group of photosynthetic bacteria that inhabit biomes on land and in the ocean, excrete scytonemin to the exterior of their cells. There it acts as a sunscreen to protect cyanobacterial colonies from exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Cyanobacteria are the only organisms that produce scytonemin, and only colonial cyanobacteria produce it, not cyanobacteria that live in the open ocean. In deserts, cyanobacteria on the soil surface are encapsulated in a sheath that includes the excreted scytonemin. Biological soil crusts consisting of bacteria, algae and fungi, in part because of this protection from UVR, can grow in extremely dry locations where plant growth is inhibited by lack of precipitation.</p> <p>In a previous study, the Principle Investigator found that scytonemin has persisted for thousands of years in deep-sea sediments of the Black Sea, and though it was found under 2000 m of water, it was originally from biological soil crusts on land. This led him to propose that scytonemin is eroded and transported by the wind from desert soils to the sea. It did not occur continuously in sediments of all ages; it was only in specific sedimentary intervals. Thus, we hypothesized that the increased accumulation of scytonemin in lake or ocean sediments could be used to infer time periods in the past that were more arid, when deserts became more expansive and more dust from soil crusts was blown into the atmosphere.</p> <p>In this study, we first examined the distribution of scytonemin and other pigments and lipids in biological soil crusts in the Great Salt Lake Desert. We found scytonemin was more abundant than photosynthetic pigments in all 56 biological soil crust samples we collected. This confirmed that biological soil crusts, which are dependent on photosynthesis for growth, nonetheless focus a significant proportion of their metabolism on protection from damage by UVR. We also found that the ratio of scytonemin to chlorophyll, the primary photosynthetic pigment in cyanobacteria, was highest in soil crusts that had nitrogen isotopic compositions consistent with the cyanobacterial fixation of atmospheric nitrogen. This suggested that cyanobacteria stressed by nitrogen-limited growth focused an even larger proportion of their metabolic activity on mitigating UVR stress.</p> <p>We conducted rehydration experiments on soil crusts that had nitrogen isotopic compositions suggesting their growth was not nitrogen limited. When they were moistened, their scytonemin:chlorophyll ratio doubled within six hours, suggesting cyanobacteria first increase protection from UVR stress rather than increasing their photosynthetic capacity; then as the crust dried out the scytonemin:chlorophyll ratio returned to the starting level. At the same time the scytonemin levels increased, there was an approximately ten-fold increase in specific free fatty acids, which may be the precursors to methyl-branched alkanes, which were shown previously to increase in desiccated biological soil crusts and were found in Black Sea sediments that had scytonemin. Thus, we suggest that both scytonemin and methyl-branched alkanes are connected in the wetting/drying processes in biological soil crusts.</p> <p>Scytonemin occurs with great abundance in specific sedimentary intervals in Great Salt Lake, Utah. We examined sediments up to approximately 280,000 years old and found that when the lake was shallow, as it is today, scytonemin accumulation was greatest. During deep water phases related to humid climate phases, such as during the Lake Bonneville phase around 20,000 years ago, scytonemin was not detected. During a shallow water phase around 150,000 years ago, however, the scytonemin concentration was approximately two orders of magnitude lower than in the last 11,000 years, even though lake conditions and regional climate conditions appear to have been similar for both intervals. This suggests that scytonemin may have degraded over time in the older sediments. This is consistent with our finding that scytonemin was not in older geological samples from similar depositional environments.</p> <p>Finally, we examined atmospheric dust from rural and urban locations in Arizona, where intense dust storms (haboobs) erode desert soils and cause dramatic increases in atmospheric dust levels. We found that scytonemin concentration as a proportion of organic carbon was greatest during haboobs, especially in fine particles with diameter less than 2.5 microns. These particles can travel great distances in the atmosphere, validating our hypothesis of wind erosion and transport of scytonemin from desert soils to lake and ocean basins. This also demonstrated that scytonemin in dust samples might also be used as a marker for native soil vs. agricultural soil inputs to atmospheric dust in semi-arid agricultural regions. Even though scytonemin appears to have limitations on its application in deep geological time studies, it has great potential as a marker for biological soil crust inputs to more recent sediments and atmospheric dust.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/07/2017<br>      Modified by: James&nbsp;Fulton</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1356421/1356421_10258732_1512701940797_IMG_1607--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1356421/1356421_10258732_1512701940797_IMG_1607--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Biological Soil Crust 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1356421/1356421_10258732_1512701940797_IMG_1607--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Biological Soil Crust 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This well-developed biological soil crust was found near the northern end of the Newfoundland Mountains, Utah.
