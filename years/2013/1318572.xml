<AbstractNarration>The project examines novel services built on top of public cloud&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure to enable cost-effective high-performance computing.&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will explore the on-demand, elastic, and configurable features of&lt;br/&gt;cloud computing to complement the traditional supercomputer/cluster&lt;br/&gt;platforms. More specifically, this research aims to assess the efficacy&lt;br/&gt;of building dynamic cloud-based clusters leveraging the configurability&lt;br/&gt;and tiered pricing model of cloud instances. The scientific value of this&lt;br/&gt;proposal lies in the novel use of untapped features of cloud computing&lt;br/&gt;for HPC and the strategic adoption of small, cloud-based clusters for&lt;br/&gt;the purpose of developing/tuning applications for large supercomputers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Through this research, the PIs expect to answer key research questions&lt;br/&gt;regarding: (1) automatic workload-specific cloud cluster configuration,&lt;br/&gt;(2) cost-aware and contention-aware data and task co-scheduling,&lt;br/&gt;and (3) adaptive, integrated cloud instance provisioning and job&lt;br/&gt;scheduling, plus workload aggregation for cloud instance rental cost&lt;br/&gt;reduction. If successful, this research will result in tools that&lt;br/&gt;adaptively aggregate, configure, and re-configure cloud resources for&lt;br/&gt;different HPC needs, with the purpose of offering low-cost R&amp;D&lt;br/&gt;environments for scalable parallel applications.</AbstractNarration>

It explored on-demand, elastic, and configurable features of cloud computing to complement the traditionalsupercomputer/cluster platforms.

We trained multiple students (including several female students) to become experts in this new field which combines traditional scheduling and cloud computing research.
