<AbstractNarration>This project conducted by the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study(BSCS) tests the efficacy of an intensive, three year professional development program, the BSCS National Academy for Curriculum Leadership (NACL) on student science achievement in the state of Washington. The goal of the NACL is to develop the capacity of district-based secondary science leadership teams to sustain the implementation of research-based science instructional materials that promote improvement in teaching and learning.  This study examines the influence of the program on student achievement after the schools and districts have had sufficient time for the effects to take hold. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project uses existing data gathered from two cohorts of Washington-based NACL teams and archived student achievement data from Washington State?s Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI). Additional data are collected NACL-participating districts and personnel through surveys and interviews. The project compares student achievement between the 27 districts that participated in the NACL, and a minimum of 27 carefully matched, non-NACL districts using propensity-scoring methodology. Districts have experienced different dosages of the NACL, and the project examines the differential effects of being involved in the NACL over time.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research study provides an opportunity for multiple stakeholders including NSF, other corporate foundations that have funded the development and implementation of the NACL, BSCS, and participating school districts to determine the extent to which professional development promotes the improvement student science achievement results. The broader impact of the research is testing the extent to which basic elements of teacher professional development models correlate with student achievement and to do so in a way that could be replicated by others in similar contexts. The proposed work would inform educators about the research-based approaches to professional development that has evidence of efficacy. Moreover, by determining the time-scales by which professional development programs might be shown to influence student achievement, the findings provide new information to policymakers and researchers regarding the amount of time that could be required to see a positive impact from new educational policies and programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Systemic change in education systems requires effective leadership, often includes a focus on teacher learning and practice, and may take many years to realize. Effective school leadership requires leaders with the requisite knowledge and abilities to affect change, who work over time to ensure improvement in teacher learning and practice, and ultimately in student learning. Yet, the duration of typical federal grants and availability of data for longitudinal studies typically span two to four years, a window that is often much too short to detect the eventual effects of systemic change on student achievement. Thus, there is little evidence to verify how long it takes for reform efforts to result in changes in student achievement (Blank &amp; de las Alas, 2009). In addition, research suggests that such reform efforts often include an implementation "dip"&mdash;meaning that teacher practice and student learning are likely to show an initial decline as teachers first implement an unfamiliar, but preferred, practice before student gains are realized (Fullan, 2001; Hall and Hord, 2010). Purpose  One solution to this problem is for researchers to use take a historical perspective on the effects of systemic change initiatives on student outcomes. Specifically, this retrospective, quasi-experimental study responded to this need by testing the effect of an intensive, 3-year leadership development intervention for district science education leaders in the state of Washington on students? science achievement. The following questions guided this study:  What is the effect of BSCS?s National Academy for Curriculum Leadership (NACL) on student achievement compared to that of business-as-usual (BaU) professional learning in matched districts?  To what extent does the treatment effect on student achievement change over time in NACL district participants compared to BaU comparison districts? To what extent do district-level demographic variables moderate NACL effects on student achievement? In treatment districts, what is the relationship between levels of implementation for key NACL-related factors and student achievement?   To address the research questions, the study included two basic components, an impact study and an implementation study. Impact Study Trends in district-level student state-science outcomes at 10th grade for both the propensity score-matched comparison group and the NACL districts showed overall improvement over time. However, the improvement trend in NACL treatment districts revealed that the increase in student achievement was preceded by an initial dip in student science scores (year 3), possibly related to "an implementation dip" associated with enactment of new curricular programs. By year 5, NACL districts rebounded and then performed above the comparison districts in subsequent years. Even the largest effect size of the NACL treatment is less than 0.20 standard deviations, however, some of these treatment effects are larger than the typical effect size of interventions (many of which are student level interventions) at the high school level. These results seem promising but indicate that additional study around the impact of the NACL leadership development program should be explored in the future. Implementation Study Qualitative results from the implementation study indicated that the level of organizational support is a contextual factor that ensured the continued buy-in and work of the leadership team within the district. However, further quantitative analysis of contextual factors within the NACL districts showed that organizational support was not linked to student achievement. Factors that showed statistically significant associations with student achievement (? &lt; .10) included:  Existence of professional learning communities (PLCs). Teams reporting the existence of PLCs at the conclusion of the program and 5 years after the conclusion of the program showed greater improvement in student learning as measured by the state 10th grade science assessment.  Persistence of the leadership teams. Teams reporting a higher percentage of members remaining in the district showed greater improvement in student learning as measured by the state assessment.  We observed mixed results on the implementation of research-based instructional materials supported by curriculum-based professional development. In year 3 there was a negative relationship to achievement and in year 7 a positive relationship although neither relationship was statistically significant. Further study is needed to make stronger links between the timing of these student achievement trends and the timing of potential phenomena related to the implementation of curriculum materials (i.e., an implementation dip and recovery). Summary  This project contributed knowledge about the long-term effects of a specific curriculum leadership intervention on student outcomes. However, beyond these intervention-specific findings, this study produced evidence of the influence of broader contextual factors that would likely affect the impact of any district-wide initiatives. Specifically, this demonstrated the importance of learning communities and leadership team retention as well as provided empirical evidence to support an implementation dip and recovery phenomenon that theory suggests could happen with the introduction of any new innovation that is unfamiliar to many of its users.
