<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is designed to address the emerging need for evaluation of mHealth applications (apps). The goal of our project is to ?break down the ivory tower wall of academic medical research? and design a Platform as a Service (PaaS) to allow app developers to conduct rigorous evaluation. Through market-driven design and application of fundamental research in behavioral and computer science, this platform will overcome cost, technological and intellectual barriers to rigorous evaluation, thereby accelerating translation of behavioral and medical discoveries into commercially-viable, online applications proven effective in improving health. The usercentered and agile designed platform will be ?programmed for evolvability? given the rapidly changing technological and regulatory landscape, while protecting human subjects (their safety, privacy and confidentiality). The focus will be on assisting non-research software engineers and distributors of digital health applications who do not have access to clinical, regulatory or research expertise to conduct rigorous health outcomes evaluation of their new technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to accelerate the availability of proven effective and useful digital applications that improve human health. With over 40,000 digital health applications currently available, most with little scientific foundation or evaluation of safety, efficacy or efficiency payers, providers and regulatory bodies are demanding evidence. It is estimated that a growth market of new apps will require rigorous evaluation through the FDA and a total Digital Health market estimated to reach $10.2 billion by 2018. Through accelerated commercialization of evaluated, commercially-viable online applications in health promotion and disease management that are broadly available through the Web, this software product can reduce disparities in access to high quality health resources. Economic development, jobs and profits will be created. This product and partnership will promote two national goals: (1) to strengthen the US innovation ecosystem (for technology to promote health and wellness) and (2) to create a society in which all people live long, healthy lives.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The need for rigorous, science-based evaluation technology is great and has arisen from the growing crisis in mHealth, which is fueled by: 1) the explosion of mobile health applications with a preponderance of them untested for their ability to improve health Integration into health care delivery; 2) the desire by both developers and purchasers of mHealth tools to integrate them into the mainstream of health care delivery; 3) the growing demand for evidence of their effectiveness to improve health, from both consumers and purchasers; and 4) the dearth of cost-effective, easy to use, comprehensive online systems to conduct all aspects of rigorous clinical evaluation, from study design to patient recruitment, data collection and analysis.     The size of the market is increasing exponentially the  numberof mHealth apps that are published on the two leading platforms, iOS and Android, reaching more than 100,000.  In addition, there are estimates that the mHealth app market will offer significant revenue potentials in the future of  up $26billon in 2017.   And as mHealth becomes integrated into the health care system ensuring that evidence-based and effective apps are delivered have the greatest potential to truly improve health.       Our ApprovalPathTM Software As a Service platform is a transformative technological solution, infusing sound research methods and approaches (based on extensive research knowhow) into a guided software platform. As the mHealth industry matures from "gee whiz" products into professional healthcare tools, rigorous and validated evidence of effectiveness is paramount for the integration of these tools into care delivery. Given the lightning speed of mHealth development, this canÆt be accomplished through traditional ways of timely and costly research consulting, but rather through innovative, automated, scientifically-based technology.     We have successfully met and often exceeded each of the three primary objectives. Not only were we successful in reaching these objectives, we had early customers which enabled us to obtain Phase 1B funding, we have developed two additional funded projects that will be using our technological approach (CHOP ChairÆs Initiative and Merck Pharmaceuticals), conducted consumer research through extramural funding, been invited to speak at regional and national mHealth summits (USA and Canada), expanded our network in the digital health ecosystem, and developed a strong partnership with CenterSpace, Inc, a successful analytic software development company.
