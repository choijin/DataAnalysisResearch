<AbstractNarration>Since the publication of the result that students from Shanghai, China, outperformed students from all other participating countries on the 2009 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) in mathematics, researchers have sought to understand why Chinese mathematics education appears to be both more successful at boosting student learning and more equitably distributed.  This RAPID project is a cross-national comparative study of U.S. and Chinese instructional support systems, building from earlier data about mathematics teaching and learning in large urban school districts of both the United States and the People's Republic of China.  The work is being conducted by researchers from Vanderbilt University, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University and Beijing Normal University.  The study uses quantitative methods to compare and contrast the effectiveness of supports (e.g., professional development, teacher networks, school leadership) in improving teachers' instructional practices and student achievement using comparable instrumentation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study contributes to research and policy in several ways.  First, it is helping to identify supports that have been particularly effective in improving mathematics teaching and learning in China. This should inform current theories about how to best support mathematics education in the United States.  Second, the cross-nationally validated instruments used to collect the data can be used by other researchers investigating curricular reform implementation cross-nationally.  The findings of this study are especially relevant to district leaders as they develop support and accountability systems to effectively implement the content and practice standards of the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is co-funded by NSF's International Science and Engineering Section, Office of International and Integrative Activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Results from international assessments suggest that students from China outperform students from the United States in mathematics. We collected data&mdash;including surveys, interviews, and videotapes of classroom instruction&mdash;from teachers in five urban districts in China and four urban districts to investigate differences between the two countries in (a) classroom instruction and (b) the quality of supports for teachers to improve their instruction, including professional development, teacher collaborative time, classroom observation and feedback, and school instructional leadership.  The research team&mdash;which included math education experts from both countries&mdash;identified common aspects of what is considered high-quality math instruction in each country, and native language speakers coded the classroom videos using rubrics that assessed these common aspects.  This research revealed that:  1)      On average, teachers in both countries selected mathematical tasks that had the potential for students to engage in complex thinking or in creating meaning for mathematical procedures.  2)      However, the Chinese teachers? implementation of tasks emphasized conceptual understanding more frequently whereas the U.S. teachers tended to emphasize procedural competence.  3)      Furthermore, the Chinese teachers led discussions of their students? solution methods more frequently, and the discussions lasted longer (both in overall time and by percent of class time) and asked students to explain their reasoning. These higher quality discussions occurred in larger classes with less time, two contexts often offered as barriers for reform in U.S. classrooms.  4)      Differences in the quality of instruction were greatest in lessons on Geometry/Measurement, and to a lesser extent Algebra. There were few or no significant differences in lessons over Data/Probabililty and Numbers/Operations.  We surveyed and interviewed the U.S. and Chinese teachers to understand the quality of the supports and differences for teachers to improve their instruction in each country.  This research revealed that:  1)      The various supports for instructional improvement were more coherent in the Chinese schools and provided greater learning opportunities to teachers.  In the Chinese schools, there was typically a strong link between district professional development, teacher collaborative time, and classroom observation and feedback. In the U.S. schools, the supports were often disjointed, not instructionally focused, or not connected to students learning.    2)      Chinese teachers described required district professional development (PD) that was usually weekly, math specific, and included opportunities to engage in analysis of instruction and its relationship to student thinking. U.S. teachers reported that district PD that was often not required and usually not ongoing or math specific.  3)      The majority of Chinese teachers reported engaging in a collaborative lesson planning routine that involved identifying the key mathematical concept of the lesson and specifying the parts of the lesson where students might struggle. For U.S. teachers, collaborative lesson planning typically focused on pacing, coverage, and sharing instructional materials.  4)      The Chinese teachers reported teaching a lesson while being observed by and then receiving feedback from other teachers and administrators between 5-20 times a semester, while almost 40% of U.S. teachers reported that they had not observed another teacher?s instruction in the past year.  The intellectual merit of this work is the contribution to the research on international comparisons of instruction. Although there is much interest in teaching practices in China, most prior comparisons of instruction in the U.S. and China are based on a relatively small number of classrooms, usually from one district. Additionally, the research base on school and district supports for instructional improvement in China is thin. This study advances our understanding of how teachers in China are supported to their improve instruction.  The broader impact of this work includes implications for U.S. instruction and school/district efforts to improve math instruction. We found that even when U.S. teachers selected rigorous tasks, they did not usually students? elicit thinking and reasoning during lessons. Our findings indicate the need to support teachers in (a) maintaining the cognitive rigor of tasks, (b) pacing lessons to include time for discussion, and (c) pressing students to explain their reasoning.
