<AbstractNarration>The award provides funding to help defray the expenses of U.S. participants in the "Conference in Analysis and Partial Differential Equations" that will be held July 7-12, 2013, on the campus of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program for this event will include presentations on a variety of topics in the theory and application of partial differential equations (e.g. optimal transport, calculus of variations, Liouville-type theorems for nonlinear elliptic systems). The participants include many of the recognized world leaders in the field. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>

Here is the website for the conference: http://www,pims.math.ca/scientific-event/ghoussoub  The conference brings together world reknown researches working in several interrelated areas of analysis and partial differential equations which are grounded in applications in various natural and social science. The conference surveyed current state-of-the-art research and identified a few key directions. Some open important questions were also raised and discussed during the meeting.  There are thirty two experts in the field of analysis and partial differential equation from all over the world (Australia, Canada, China, France, Italy, Isarel, Swiss, Taiwan) who delivered invited talks. The grant is used to support all  participant from USA, which include all speakers (Alice Chang and Gang Tian from Princeton,  Craig Evans from Berkeley,  Allesio Fagalli from Austin, Fanghua Lin and Nader Masmoudi from NYU, Yanyan Li from Rutgers,  Wilfrid Gangbo from Georgia Tech, Paul Rabinowitz from Wisconsin), two organiers from USA (Changfeng Gui from Connecticut, Meijun Zhu from Univisity of Oklahoma), and more than fifteen graduate students and junior researchers.  The conference covers the main research topics which include the theory of optimal transportation, Calculus of Variation, Liouville theorem for nonlinear equations, Covex analysis, functional and geometric inequalities and geometric analysis.
