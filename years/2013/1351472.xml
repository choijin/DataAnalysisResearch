<AbstractNarration>PI:  Burdick, Jason A.&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1351472&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to their complexity and diversity in structure and function, the development of tissue substitutes for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications is a challenging and highly interdisciplinary endeavor.  Thus, it is important to enhance the interaction of professionals trained as materials scientists, chemical, mechanical, and electrical engineers, stem cell and developmental biologists, bioimagers, physicians and surgeons, immunologists, and biochemists, towards advancing efforts in the field of regenerative medicine.  The proposed Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and trainee-driven Gordon-Kenan Graduate Research Seminar (GRS) will foster such interactions and promote a convergence of research in varied disciplines within the field of regenerative medicine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of the proposed support lies in recruiting a larger number of graduate students, post-doctoral researchers and young faculty to attend the conference and to aid in their career development on this important topic. This GRC will involve the invitation and attendance of leaders in this field, while trainees and young faculty will have ample opportunity to interact with these leaders throughout the conference. Indeed, the GRC is structured to enhance these interactions. The GRS is designed specifically for graduate students and postdocs to present their research and interact with each other to better poise them to participate in GRC activities. Support from NSF will be used to help young investigators attend the GRS and GRC by covering conference registration for students and trainees for GRS, and for young faculty that are selected to present their work at the GRC.</AbstractNarration>
