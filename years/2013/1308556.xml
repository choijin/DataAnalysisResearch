<AbstractNarration>An exciting approach to studying planets around other stars exploits recent technical advances in adaptive optics to directly image the exoplanets while the spatially concentrated but very bright light from the nearby star is suppressed by a coronagraph.  Outstanding technical and theoretical progress in recent years has allowed this approach to achieve extremely high contrast, and thus detect very faint companions to stars.  This approach to hunting for stellar companions is in some ways complementary to the well-established radial-velocity technique, and may be able to unearth different classes of exoplanets and determine different things about them.  The combination of multiple state-of-the-art technologies will make the instrument being built here capable of substantially better contrast than competing instruments, and make it the first capable of high contrast coronagraphy at visible wavelengths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coronagraphic capabilities are leveraged from the existing and well-proven PALM-3000 (P3K) extreme adaptive optics system operating at the Palomar Observatory.  The detector technology is very novel, making use of recent developments in superconducting Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors (MKIDs) that can spectrally resolve the wavelengths intrinsically (with no external dispersing optics) of the optical/near-infrared light that they see.  These detectors also provide microsecond time resolution, all with zero read noise and zero dark current photon counting that enable a mode of coronagraphy known as Dark Speckle, which originated in the mid-90?s and appears promising for suppressing focal-plane speckles as needed for companion detection.  The overall project combines multiple exciting and novel technologies to attack one of the most pressing scientific problems in modern astronomy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will have broad appeal to the public by the nature of the science, and will train undergraduate and graduate students as well as a post-doctoral fellow.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for this project is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its Advanced Technologies and Instrumentation program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The DARKNESS instrument is the first attempt to take a revolutionary new photons detection technology called Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors, or MKIDs, and use them to image planets around nearby stars.   Build primarily at UCSB, DARKNESS uses 10,000 MKID pixels that allow us to simultaneously take an image and get the spectrum of light falling on that pixel (an integral field spectrograph), without the noise sources usually present in conventional semiconducting instruments.  DARKNESS is a part of a system of three instrument that work together to detect exoplanets.  First, the Palm-3000 (P3K) adaptive optics system attempts to fix the distortion introduced by the atmosphere and make a sharp diffraction limited image.  Second, the Stellar Double Coronagraph (SDC) uses special optics to block the light of the star but pass the light of the nearby planet.  Finally, the DARKNESS instrument detects the light of planet and takes its spectra.  In the future, the fast imaging of DARKNESS will allow us to feed information back to the deformable mirror in the AO system at a high rate, enabling better suppression of the star?s light to allow us to more easily detect faint planets.  DARKNESS runs at 0.1 degrees C above absolute zero, making it the coldest camera ever attached to the historic Hale 200" telescope on Mt. Palomar.  The technology used in DARKNESS could one day enable us to use 30-m class telescopes to detect life through chemical changes in the atmosphere of planets around nearby low mass stars called M-dwarfs.  DARKNESS  was primarily built by our University team of graduate students and post-docs, training them to become the next generation of scientists to push the frontiers of knowledge.
