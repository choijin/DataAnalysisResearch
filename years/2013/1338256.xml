<AbstractNarration>COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH :Integrated Data-Model Analysis of CO2-Climate-Vegetation Feedbacks in a Dynamic Paleo-Icehouse&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;by&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Isabel Montanez, Univ. California, Davis EAR-1338281&lt;br/&gt;Christopher Poulsen, Univ. Michigan, EAR-1338200&lt;br/&gt;Joseph White, Baylor University, EAR-1338247&lt;br/&gt;Michael Hren, Univ. Conneticutt, EAR-1338256&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Overview: Vegetation-COÂ¬2-climate feedbacks have been shown to be an important component of the climate system, capable of perturbing atmospheric circulation, continental surface temperatures, and hydrological cycling on regional- to global-scales. Recent work indicates that vegetation-climate feedbacks likely had the potential to push the late Paleozoic climate system between glacial and interglacial states and to strongly modify the climate regime within these states. The details of the nature, time-scales, and potential impact of these feedbacks remain elusive. This multi-disciplinary project, driven by three interlinked hypotheses, addresses these shortcomings and analyzes the roles of CO2- and orbital-forcing and vegetation-climate feedbacks in promoting glacial-interglacial transitions on eccentricity- to multi-million year time-scales:  &lt;br/&gt;- The response of vegetation to primarily CO2-driven glacial-interglacial transitions depended on the timing, magnitude and duration of CO2 forcing and whether critical ecological thresholds were reached.&lt;br/&gt;- Tropical vegetation, by way of physiological forcing, impacted low-latitude climate and water &amp; C cycling&lt;br/&gt;- Vegetation-climate feedbacks - on a global-scale - amplified radiatively forced glacial-interglacial transitions through changes in direct surface forcing and terrestrial C &amp; N cycling.&lt;br/&gt;These hypotheses are being tested through integrated empirical, experimental and multi-scale modeling approaches across a spectrum of time- (10 to 1,000,000 yr) and spatial-scales (leaf-to-canopy-to-global climate system). Climate-CO2-vegetation feedbacks, including the role of plant physiological forcing of climate will be assessed through a two-stage modeling effort that will first reformulate a terrestrial biosphere model (BIOME-BGC) using the empirical and experimental results coupled with modeling sensitivity experiments to define plant functional traits for late Paleozoic PFTs. In the second stage, we will incorporate these PFT traits into NCAR's fully coupled Community Earth System Model and use this version to investigate glacial-interglacial dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This research will generate the first high-resolution, high-precision reconstruction of atmospheric CO2 during the LPIA, which when incorporated into the climate modeling will provide insight into the evolution of earth system processes, including the terrestrial biosphere, in an icehouse under changing CO2 levels relevant to our long-term future. This study will be the first modification of terrestrial biosphere models to account for paleo-PFT traits and investigation of paleovegetation-climate feedbacks thus providing an improved understanding of the potential of non-angiosperm plants to influence hydrologic and C cycling through physiological forcing.  &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Cross-disciplinary training and mentoring will occur through in-residence internships for the Ph.D. students.  Underrepresented students to Earth and environmental sciences will be integrated through a range of summer and academic year internships and programs at the collaborating institutions.  This study will contribute directly to a Carboniferous exhibit planned for the Paleontological Halls of the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution. All data generated by this study will be archived and shared via publications, and web-accessible tools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Geologists have long recognized that past changes in earth?s climate are directly linked to the evolution and radiation of plants and animals on earth.  Over the past several decades however, there has been growing interest in understanding what role biology plays in shaping global climate and earth systems. In particular, how do global ecosystems respond to changes in climate and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations?     Icehouses, such as our current glacial state, have been relatively uncommon in Earth history, yet are associated with major environmental, climatic and biological transitions. The last major icehouse (~340 to 270 Ma) witnessed the evolution and expansion of the oldest and most extensive paleotropical forests. The demise of the Late Paleozoic Ice Age (LPIA), recorded the only transition of a vegetated, metazoan world from a glacial state to an ice-free greenhouse.  Fossil and geochemical records of Late Paleozoic ecosystems archive information on how physical, chemical and biological processes in the Earth system functioned during an ancient icehouse period. One of the main challenges to understanding the role of plants in the ancient world however, is how to interpret the record of molecular fossils and geochemical signals that are preserved in sediments that are hundreds of millions of years old.     The goal of this project was to 1) examine the hydrogen and carbon isotope geochemistry of modern plants that are similar to 300 million year old vegetation from the Carboniferous Period to constrain the relationship between molecular geochemistry and plant process (e.g. evapotranspiration, stomatal conductance, etc.), 2) develop organic molecular records from individual plant fossils and sediments that span the time period of ~315 to 300 Ma, and 3) couple molecule-specific geochemistry data with paleoclimate models to develop integrated records of environmental and biologic feedbacks to changing CO2 and climate.     Our work produced several important scientific results that shape our view of the ancient world and how the Earth system functions. First, geochemical analyses of ancient plant-derived molecules show that plant biology more strongly controls the record of molecules preserved in ancient sediments than their physical response to external climate conditions. This means that sediment geochemistry captures changes in the types of vegetation in an ancient ecosystem, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and the isotope composition of ancient rainwater. Laboratory growth chamber experiments show that changes in atmospheric gas concentrations influence the record of carbon isotopes preserved in bulk leaves and leaf molecules, and must be taken into consideration when interpreting ancient geochemical records.

The magnitude of environmental change in these ancient ecosystems is similar to that observed in the tropics during the most recent glacial-interglacial transition 20,000 years ago. Finally, ancient organic molecules preserved in Late Paleozoic sediments show that changes in carbon dioxide, temperature and hydrology were linked to changes in the frequency or severity of fires in the Late Paleozoic world. These results point to a close coupling between climate, carbon dioxide, ecosystems and fire in the earth system.     Broader Impacts   (1) During the course of the research 4 graduate students, 5 undergraduate students, 1 post-graduate researcher, and a postdoctoral fellow were mentored and trained in various aspects of the research.    (2) Work on this project contributed to two M.S. and two Ph.D. theses.   (3) The PI, collaborators and students disseminated research results through nearly 20 professional presentations at universities, national and international conferences and/or peer reviewed journal publications.  In addition, the PI used the research findings in presentations on ancient climate change at community events (UConn-American Chemical Society Earth Day Celebration 2017; UConn Annual Geoscience Days Public Outreach Events; k-12 outreach materials used by the PI for elementary school outreach activities).
