<AbstractNarration>This award funds a series of conferences designed to foster research and discussion of major issues in macroeconomics and monetary economics that are important for public policy.  The conference series has three goals.  First, to stimulate new research that develops new models and analyzes economic data.  Second, to bring together researchers who approach the science questions in different ways.  Third, to develop greater understanding among academic researchers of the multiple factors that influence the formation of economic policy.  The conference brings together a diverse audience with the overall goal of encouraging academic researchers to focus on problems that are of importance for policy questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conferences will include research on monetary policy, financial market regulation, income inequality, the New Mercantilism, and demography.</AbstractNarration>
