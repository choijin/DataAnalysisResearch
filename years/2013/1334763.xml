<AbstractNarration>This award supports fundamental optics science research on laser matter interaction to establish a parallel laser micro-forming manufacturing technology. Specifically, the research will use adaptive optical technology to generate multiple laser beams with arbitrary laser beam profile and energy distribution to perform rapid three-dimensional laser shock micro-forming on multiple micro workpieces simultaneously. Using the adaptive laser beam shaping tool and multi-resolution molecular mechanic simulation approach, laser-induced shock wave interaction with micro- and nano-mechanical structures will be studied to gain better understanding on laser-induced defect initiation, propagation, and distribution to improve three-dimensional laser micro-forming manufacturing outcome.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new laser shock manufacturing scheme developed from this research has potential to completely overhaul the existing laser shock micro-forming manufacturing technique. It will dramatically improve manufacturing flexibility, precision, and throughput. The scientific investigation will advance scientific understanding on the interaction of laser-induced shock wave with mechanical structures at nanometer scale. The new laser shock manufacturing technology will enhance the competitiveness of the US manufacturing industry in micro-system manufacturing and assembly. This award also provides new training opportunities to US students in laser technology, manufacturing, and material engineering through new course development, extracurricular activities, and community outreach.</AbstractNarration>
