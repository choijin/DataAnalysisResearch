<AbstractNarration>The biosonar behavior of echolocating bats provides an example of how natural and artificial active sensing systems may be optimized to meet rapidly changing social and environmental conditions.  Bats and artificial sonar, radar and communication systems all face a similar suite of problems arising from mutual interference. Explaining how bats minimize interfering with one other's sonar while flying in dense swarms or within noisy crowded roosts may help improve a wide range of artificial sensing and wireless communications systems. Bats are highly social and their exceptional resilience to jamming by conspecifics far exceeds the strategies currently employed in artificial systems. This proposal will investigate how groups of bats manage this by applying recent advances in computer networking to sonar/radar theory. The experiments outlined will characterize the behavioral strategies used by bats to improve their signaling efficiency when echolocating in groups of different sizes and across tasks of varying navigational demands.  Computer simulations will be used to identify optimum algorithm parameters and explore how these behavioral strategies manifest across a wider range biosonar conditions.  By deciphering the behavioral algorithms by which bats can cooperatively share the same acoustic space this proposal may lead to better and more efficient strategies for optimizing artificial communications network usage to support an increasingly information-based economy. This proposal will also offer unique exposure, training and educational opportunities for STEM students interested in exploring biological systems as a source of inspiration for artificial systems. In partnership with local science teachers, this proposal creates an inquiry-based dual language (Spanish/English) teaching website that will offer access for 5th/6th grade science classes to remotely interact with live animals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Interference problems arise in artificial systems such as sonar and radar, wireless communications and computer network when many users attempt to transmit simultaneously over a single shared channel. Wireless communications networks partially mitigate this by employing protocols constraining user transmission rates during periods of high channel traffic to minimize interference rates between users. This proposal tests the hypothesis that echolocating bats adapt their sonar pulse emission rates to optimize sonar performance in social situations following protocols similar and applicable to international standards in wireless communications systems.  The proposal uses a combination of behavioral studies with bats in the lab and computer simulations to decode the bat's retransmission delay algorithm. First, trained bats are flown alone and in small groups of 2-5 through a sensor maze to quantify the bats' navigational performance and measure whether they systematically change pulse emission rates when performing the same task in a social context. Secondly, bats will be flown through the maze in the presence of artificial acoustic stimuli mimicking the sounds of other bats passing through the maze to test whether bats can realize a net improvement in sonar performance by decreasing their own pulse emission rates proportional to population density, counterintuitively reaping a net increase in information flow by emitting fewer pulses. Computational models of the behavioral algorithm will be developed to simulate the behavior, establish optimal parameters and precisely quantify its benefits to sonar performance in social contexts. The bat's sonar algorithms will be made available through scientific journals and Matlab-based biosonar simulation tools developed for the project will be made freely available via multiple sources on the Internet.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The major goal of this project was to investigate and quantify the behavioral strategies used by bats in social contexts to mitigate the degrading effects of mutual acoustic interference on their biosonar performance. Individual bats emit 10 to 50 sonar pulses per second and must be able to detect and discriminate their own echoes to effectively navigate and hunt for prey.  In the presence of other bats, echo returns may be severely obscured by the pulse emissions and echoes produced by other nearby bats, and yet many species of bats are highly social and appear to be able to use sonar effectively in dense, loud social conditions.  The derogatory effects of mutual interference are not limited to bats however; a wide variety of emerging technologies that rely upon wireless communications or active sensing systems to coordinate and guide remote devices or unmanned vehicles are constrained by this problem. Thus, the major goals of this study were to determine how bats mitigate this problem, and then characterize their behavioral strategies in such a way that the algorithms could be applied to artificial technologies such as self-driving cars, unmanned aerial and underwater vehicles, and wireless communications systems. The major activities of this project involved using trained Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) flying through a maze under controlled laboratory conditions while listening to artificial playback simulating the presence of other bats and quantifying the biosonar and navigational performance of the bats under a variety of different conditions.  Each condition tested a different aspect of how the bats adjusted their flight patterns and vocal output in the presence of other bats while performing challenging navigational tasks. In our first set of experiments we confirmed that bats suffer degraded navigational performance when hearing the pulses and echoes of other bats. Importantly, they were found to be significantly more sensitive to pulses and echo streams that sound similar to their own sonar than other more generic acoustic stimuli, such as continuous broadband noise or tonal sounds. Sonar-guided navigation performance was negatively correlated with the repetition rate of interfering acoustic stimuli.

This NSF project successfully produced a viable computational algorithm with potential military and commercial value and the research is continuing with support from the Office of Naval Research (ONR). The results are now being evaluated for their potential to improve the US Navy’s current SONAR systems.          Last Modified: 11/18/2019       Submitted by: Michael Smotherman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
