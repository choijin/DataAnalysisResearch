<AbstractNarration>Locomotion and feeding are essential behaviors for the survival and reproductive fitness of most animals. However, little is understood about why some individuals within a population outperform others and are better suited to their habitat. Populations of bluegill sunfish often diverge into two different body forms based on their habitat: a deeper-bodied shallow water form or a streamlined deep water form. This variation creates an ideal system for investigating the relationships between form, function and adaptation to habitat. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will integrate studies of behavior in the field, external and internal morphology and muscle physiology, energy metabolism, swimming performance, feeding mechanics and fitness measurements in order to quantify variation in swimming and feeding performance within a single population of bluegill from pelagic and littoral habitats. Results from this research will provide unprecedented insight into the complex interrelationships of body form, swimming and feeding performance and fitness in fish. Moreover, this research will provide an experimental and analytical framework that could be applied to any animal system. This proposal is a collaborative effort among three liberal arts institutions, therefore an important component of the project will be the mentoring of a postdoctoral researcher and the training of undergraduates, a high proportion of whom will continue their education in graduate or professional schools, increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in the sciences. The research will be implemented in an outreach program aimed to introduce basic concepts of biomechanics and physiology to underrepresented K-12 students at neighboring schools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Environmental pressures drive adaptations, and as a result, organisms tend to be well suited for the habitat in which they live. For mobile organisms,  fitness is in part dependent upon locomotion and means of prey capture that is appropriate for their habitat.  Variation in morphology based on habitat has been shown for the bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus).  Those living in the littoral zone often have deeper bodies, presumably for maneuvering, and those found in the pelagic have a more fusiform shape, presumably to aid in rapid swimming.  This project sought to determine if muscles associated with swimming and feeding also had physiological variation between habitats.  We examined aerobic and glycolytic metabolic capacity in muscles  associated with locomotion and feeding from both littoral and pelagic groups. We found that both aerobic and glycolytic capacity were similar in littoral and pelagic body forms. We are continuing our analysis of muscle physiology, behavior, and swimming to further understand the differences between the littoral and pelagic body forms.     This project involved a collaboration between three primarily undergraduate institutions.  It has resulted in eight publications, and data has been collected for seven additional manuscripts.  Twenty conference presentations, talks or posters, were given at regional, national, or international meetings, in addition to two invited university seminars.  Additionally, this project provided opportunities for undergraduate and high school students, many of whom were from underrepresented groups in STEM,  to participate in research and observe basic science.  Equipment from this project has been used to further other research projects as well as assist in teaching of undergraduate courses and outreach to the general public.
