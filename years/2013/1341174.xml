<AbstractNarration>Predation risk is assumed to be a critical factor influencing primate behavior; however, because predation events are rarely witnessed, the degree to which predation pressure affects primate sociality is poorly understood. Furthermore, the data that do exist on primate predator-prey interactions are focused on primates, with little co-consideration of predator behavior. The question remains: How do primates cope with the possibility of predation and do these coping mechanisms thwart hunting by predators? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study by doctoral student Dara Adams (Ohio State University), under the guidance of Dr. Dawn Kitchen, will incorporate experimental methods to investigate predator-prey dynamics between bald-faced saki monkeys (Pithecia irrorata) and their predators - including one of their main felid predators, ocelots (Leopardus pardalis) - at a field site in Amazonia Peru where both predators and prey live at high densities. The project will utilize 1) ecological and behavioral data to assess whether habitat structure, including tree height, understory and canopy coverage, affect perceived predation risk and anti-predator behaviors in these primates; 2) remote camera traps and GPS telemetry on radio-collared ocelots to determine whether sakis adjust behavior in relation to felid movement and activity; and 3) predator models (ocelot, snakes and eagles) and audio playback experiments to determine how sakis respond to alarm calls, what information may be conveyed in these calls, and whether these calls are salient to ambush-style predators and result in changes to their hunting behavior. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Incorporation of data on both primate and predator behavior will provide a more holistic picture that lends itself to comparisons across species and ecological contexts. Such an approach rarely has been applied to primate studies and will contribute much-needed empirical data to the debate regarding the degree to which predation pressures have impacted primate ecology and evolution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This doctoral dissertation project will support academic training of a female graduate student and Peruvian undergraduates, strengthen research connections between Peruvian, Brazilian, and US universities, and promote interest among children in science and conservation through an educational program at a local school in Peru. Finally, monitoring of saki monkeys and predators, including ocelots, at the field site will support local conservation initiatives. The conservation implications are particularly important because the region is undergoing rapid development, including increased logging and mining.</AbstractNarration>

However, because predation events are rarely witnessed, much remains unknown regarding how primates perceive and respond to threats. Even less is known about predator response to primate anti-predator behaviors. Our project addresses the questions: How do primates cope with the possibility of being eaten and do these coping strategies thwart hunting by predators? We investigated these questions from the perspective of a Neotropical primate, bald-faced saki monkeys (<em>Pithecia rylandsi</em>), and of one of their main felid predators, ocelots (<em>Leopardus pardalis</em>), at a field site in Peru. Specifically, we utilized: 1) behavioral data on monkeys and radio-collared felids to assess whether saki monkeys are perceptive of spatial variations in felid predation risk; 2) playback and predator model experiments to determine how sakis respond to acoustic and visual cues of different types of predators; and 3) playback experiments on radio-collared ocelots to examine whether saki monkey alarm calls are salient to predators and result in changes to their hunting behavior. The ability to thwart predators using alarm calls is particularly important in the presence of ambush-style hunters, such as felids, which rely on surprise attack. However, this &lsquo;pursuit deterrent&rsquo; function of primate alarm calls has almost never been tested. By incorporating prey and predator perspectives, our project contributes a more complete picture of predation risk and its impacts on the evolution of primate behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>Our main findings are as follows: 1) Saki monkeys appear to alter some behaviors (e.g. resting/socializing, intragroup spacing, and alarm calling rates) according to spatial variations in felid predation risk, suggesting that sakis perceive areas frequented more often by felids to be riskier. However, other behaviors (e.g. vigilance) did not increase in high use felid areas. This finding indicates that other factors such as habitat structure may be important in assessing risk. Due to difficulties in observing predator behavior, few studies have examined primate anti-predator responses in relation to actual predator movement and activity patterns. Our findings support evidence from birds and other mammals that show predation is predictable enough for prey to assess and adapt to patterns of risk. 2) Results from our audio playback experiments indicate that saki monkeys recognize the vocalizations of their predators and exhibit anti-predator strategies adapted to predator hunting strategies. While not surprising, our data confirm patterns of anti-predator responses found in Old World primates. 3) Saki monkeys respond with significantly more alarm calls, longer alarm calling durations, and stronger behavioral reactions to visual predator models than to acoustic only playback experiments. Although playbacks are traditionally considered a reliable method of simulating predator presence, our results show that the mode of presentation (e.g. acoustic vs. visual) may have a significant impact on primate behavioral responses. 4) Lastly, our playback experiments showed that ambush predators, in our case radio-collared ocelots, are able to distinguish between primate alarm and affiliative calls and are deterred by alarming monkeys.
