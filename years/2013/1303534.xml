<AbstractNarration>SES-1303534&lt;br/&gt;Elizabeth Boyle &lt;br/&gt;Hollie Nyseth Brehm &lt;br/&gt;University of Minnesota-Twin Cities&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Genocide is not a random event but a process that unfolds systematically.  Preliminary work and existing literature have suggested that genocide can be predicted and perhaps even one day ameliorated using a combination of sociological and criminological explanations. Yet, many questions remain, and this dissertation seeks to answer two of them: 1) What are the causes of genocide at societal, state, and international levels? 2) What accounts for temporal and regional variation during genocide? To assess what leads to genocide, the dissertation begins with a quantitative analysis of the preconditions of genocide in all countries over the last 50 years. Then, to analyze how genocides unfold, it turns to case studies of the genocides in Rwanda, Bosnia, and Sudan.  Each case study includes quantitative analysis of genocidal violence over time and by region.  To better understand reasons behind variation in violence, it also draws upon historical analysis and 20 interviews per case.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent works have suggested that sociology and criminology hold much promise for the study of genocide, though sociologists and criminologists have largely neglected the study of this crime of crimes.  This dissertation draws upon these literatures to better understand two aspects of genocide?its causes and how it unfolds.  Political scientists and historians have begun to address the causes of genocide over the last several decades, though the majority of research focuses on the intricacies of particular cases and the importance of political leaders in planning and implementing genocide. Such in-depth analyses are important, though few scholars have actually assessed the general factors that contribute to the occurrence of genocide. These may include factors beyond the roles played by individual leaders, including societal factors (such as societal diversity), state factors (such as the type of government), and international factors (such as engagement in the international system through trade or organizational membership), which have not been thoroughly studied in regard to genocide despite the growing interdependency of the international system.  While these factors are considered in relation to the initial occurrence of genocide, this study also disaggregates the events of genocides and conceptualizes genocide as a process.  Extant literature on the causes of genocide focuses on what leads to genocide; however, viewing genocide as an undifferentiated event misses the opportunity to truly understand the violence. Few studies have explored regional and temporal variation in genocide, and no studies have done this comparatively&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This dissertation will produce both quantitative and qualitative data that will be used to better understand genocide.  Such research has the potential to inform policy makers, think tanks, and research centers around the world as they strive to create early warning systems for genocide.  Understanding the process of genocide could also inform interventions in genocide by international actors as well as local organizations.  Accordingly, the findings will be disseminated through publications and conference presentations at both local and international conferences.  Notably, the co-PI has interned with the Rwandan Government Genocide Prevention Commission and a similar organization in Bosnia, and both organizations are interested in the results of the study.  In addition, the co-PI has been in contact with Genocide Watch and several other nongovernmental organizations and will ensure that the findings from the research are disseminated.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Project  Although countries have continually vowed to prevent genocide and mass violence, pictures of piles of bodies, endless rows of faces behind barbed wire, and starving children in refugee camps fill news media around the world and remind us that genocides continue to occur with alarming frequency. This violence has often appeared to be incomprehensible, chaotic, or even psychopathic. Yet, like other social processes, genocide is structural and systematic. Although each genocide is unique, there are also discernible patterns among genocides, much like civil wars, hate crimes, or terrorism. To that end, this study seeks to understand the causes and processes of genocide. As such, it asks two key questions: 1) What are the causes of genocide at societal, state, and international levels? and 2) What accounts for temporal and regional variation in violence within genocides?

During the Tenure of the Award  Prior to receiving this award, the co-PI conducted fieldwork and analysis on Rwanda.

One research assistant helped the co-PI code hundreds of CIA documents about troop locations during the genocide in Bosnia, an important part of understanding how the violence unfolded. The other research assistant helped with interview transcription.   Findings and Dissemination  Overall, the co-PI found that the factors associated with regional and temporal differences in violence vary based on who the perpetrators are and how they are organized. In Rwanda, members of the community who were not part of previously organized formal groups participated in the violence. As such, criminologyÆs social disorganization theory&mdash;which argues that community cohesion influences crime rates&mdash;helps explain variation in this violence.
