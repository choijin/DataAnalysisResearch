<AbstractNarration>The project (a three-day conference) addresses the question of language change, and in particular, how the pronunciation of words changes over generations. Pronunciation is associated with social identity and group membership but the factors that underlie changes in pronunciation may be general cognitive and phonetic mechanisms that are not under direct control of speakers. This topic relates to general questions of how social organization emerges from individual behavior that are relevant to many different types of social organization (including political and economic systems). The linguistic system, as compared with other types of social organization, is more directly tied to sensory and motor systems and thus the factors that shape the system are more directly observable. The conference brings together researchers in linguistics, sociology, cognitive science, and computer science to exchange results and refine methods.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[A  three day linguistics conference was held on May 28-31,  2014. The topic of the conference was "Sound Change".  Here's a brief description of what a linguist means by sound change.  Languages change over time, from generation to generation and many different aspects of language undergo change.  New words are introduced and old ones may be abandoned.  New syntactic constructions may come to be used, while old ones are forgotten. And (the focus of this conference) the words and sounds of language may come to be pronounced in new ways. All languages change, and all aspects of every language changes.  And this happens despite the fact that educators (and parents) may resist language change.  The scientific study of this pervasive and fundamental aspect of language was the focus of this conference.   The conference brought together linguists, psychologists, and sociologists from around the world,  together with local linguists and non-linguists, to advance the current  state of the art in Linguistics by focussing on how the many factors  involved in sound change (phonetic, cognitive, social) interact with  each other. One key intellectual merit of the conference was its  integrative approach and the range of the participantsÆ areas of  expertise. The broader impacts of the conference may lie in the  involvement of key researchers in adjacent disciplines (computer  science, psychology, neuroscience) by helping these leaders in their  disciplines come to know the issues and phenomena involved in sound  change and by introducing linguists to some relevant research being done  in adjacent disciplines. The  conference was held on the campus of the University of California, at  Berkeley, and a record of the event is preserved in a web page:  http:/linguistics.berkeley.edu/SCIHS.  The meeting was organized into  five &frac12; day sessions of oral presentations around some theme in the  theory of sound change, with two late-afternoon poster sessions.  Thirty  research papers were presented in the oral sessions and 30 research  papers were presented in the poster sessions.  Each oral session was  capped with a general discussion led by one of the organizers [Hyman and  Garrett], or by a distinguished guest (these were Paul Kiparsky  [Stanford], Aditi Lahiri [Oxford] and Robin Dodsworth [NC State]).   In  two of the sessions, local researchers in allied disciplines gave  presentations on how their research intersects with the research under  discussion in the session.  These were Prof. Rodolfo Mendoza-Denton,  Psychology, UCB, on social psychological measures of personality, and  Prof. John Houde on models of speech motor control.  The general  reaction to these presentations was extremely positive.   One  half of the conference attendees (48/96) were from the US and the rest  traveled from around the world to attend the conference.  The  international participants ranged from graduate students to  distinguished professors.  Four of the eleven invited speakers at the  conference were from outside of the US (two from Scotland, one from  Sweden, and one from Canada).   The main functions of the conference were to desiminate knowledge and cross-fertilize research programs from different perspectives.  About one half of the participants were graduate students, and we used about a quarter of the budget to provide travel assistance to graduate students so they could attend the conference (the remainder of the budget was used to rent the conference rooms, and provide travel costs for invited speakers).  It was important to us that it not be only a meeting of distinguished researchers trading ideas, but we also wanted to pass on the current state of the art to the next generation of researchers.  Our approach to the second main function - to cross-fertilize research programs - was to bring people with quite different perspectives and knowledge bases together and have them hash out differences in public.  The meeting was a success in this regard a...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
