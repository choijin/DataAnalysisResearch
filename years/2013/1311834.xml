<AbstractNarration>Most of this research proposal is dedicated to the study of the geometry and topology of Teichmueller space, moduli space, and mapping class groups. Some specific projects involve solving some generalizations of the conjugacy problem for mapping class groups, investigating the properties of the systole-length function on moduli space, and finding a coarse description of the geodesics in the Thurston metric on Teichmueller space. The PI also proposes to study the homology growth of irreducible automorphisms of a free group in finite covers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Surfaces are two-dimensional spaces like the surface of a ball or a doughnut. Their topological and geometric properties have captured the minds of mathematicians for centuries. The study of surfaces is not only interesting and beautiful, but has generated entire fields of mathematics and arguably lies at the intersection of all fields of mathematics. One way to understand a surface is to study the various ?natural? geometric structures on the surface and how the different structures relate to each other. The parameter space all geometric structures on a given surface is a fundamental mathematical object called the moduli space. This is usually a higher-dimensional space that itself naturally carries many rich and interesting geometric structures. The study of moduli space is part of the guiding mathematical principle that, in order to understand one particular structure on a space, one must try to understand the structure of the meta space comprised of all structures. The work of the PI is dedicated to expanding our knowledge about moduli space and some related spaces.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="p1">During this award, the PI has published four research papers and produced three preprints that are currently under peer review. These papers make substantial contribution to the fields of geometric group theory and low-dimensional topology. For instance, the PI, together with Cashen, resolved an 20-year-old problem in the area of growth tightness in groups as introduced by Grigorchuk and de la Harpe. With&nbsp;Arzhantseva and Cashen, the PI generalized the notion of growth tightness. This new lens allowed them to recover all previously known results in the area, and extend these results to several new settings. With Rafi, the PI exploited the phenomenon of redundancy in transformational systems as introduced by Sleator, Tarjan, and Thurston, to study growth rate of groups. This work has applications to matrix groups and mapping class groups. The PI also continued her long term program to studying the geometry of the Thurston metric on Teichmuller spaces. This is a difficult area first introduced by Thurston in 1986. The PI's recent work with Lenzhen and Rafi provides the most advanced understanding of the geodesics in this metric.
