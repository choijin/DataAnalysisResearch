<AbstractNarration>The goal of this series of workshops is to engage engineering faculty in a discussion of the role of Massive, Open, On-line Courses (MOOCs) in undergraduate engineering education. The workshops are scheduled to take place at major conferences for three different professional societies: American Society of Engineering Education, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, and the American Society of Mechanical Engineering. This series of workshops brings together content experts and learning experts who would not otherwise collaborate to discuss MOOCs and their role in engineering education. The outcome of the workshops is a report to NSF that summarizes the issues raised by the panelists and the participants. Another outcome of this workshop is the creation of a moderated forum in which faculty can discuss issues associated with MOOCs.</AbstractNarration>
