<AbstractNarration>This award will support student travel to The Fourth Annual ACM Conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH 2013). The conference is being held in Indianapolis, Indiana during October 26-31, 2013. SPLASH includes OOPSLA, one of the flagship ACM SIGPLAN conferences, as well as many co-located events: Onward!, Wavefront, the Dynamic Languages Symposium, SPLASH-E (Education), the International Conference on Generative Programming: Concepts &amp; Experiences, the International Conference on Software Language Engineering. SPLASH also includes a program of tutorials, posters, demonstrations, a Doctoral Symposium, and an ACM SIGPLAN Student Research Competition. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. The funding provided will enable broader student participation, especially by those without adequate support at their home institution, and will help build the next generation of programming language and software engineering researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ACM SIGPLAN conference on Systems, Programming, Languages and Applications: Software for Humanity (SPLASH) embraces all aspects of software construction and delivery to make it the premier conference at the intersection of programming, languages, and software engineering.      SPLASH is the top technical forum for new and exciting advances in programming languages, especially those involving objects and beyond, including matters of programming in the large, reusability, design and programmer productivity. The conference covers a wide range of topics including: requirements, modeling, prototyping, design, implementation, generation, analysis, verification, testing, evaluation, maintenance, reuse, replacement, and retirement of software systems; studies of large-scale software repositories; tools (such as new languages, program analyses, or runtime systems); and techniques (such as new methodologies, design processes, code organization approaches, and management techniques).      SPLASH is the umbrella event for both the OOPSLA Research and Onward! conferences. OOPSLA (Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications) is the premier conference on Object-Oriented Programming, having been the forum for some of the most important software developments over the last several decades. OOPSLA was the incubator for CRC cards, CLOS, design patterns, Self, agile methodologies, service-oriented architectures, wikis, UML, test driven design, refactoring, Java, dynamic compilation, and aspect-oriented programming, to name a few important innovations. OOPSLA is not only about objects but it never strays far from them. Onward! is a multidisciplinary conference focused on everything to do with programming and software: including processes, methods, languages, communities, and applications. Onward! is more radical, more visionary, and more open than other conferences to not yet well-proven but well-argued ideas.  In 2013 SPLASH was also host to the International Conference on Software Language Engineering (SLE), the ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Generative Programming Concepts and Experiences (GPCE), and the Dynamic Languages Symposium.  There were 610 attendees at SPLASH 2013 drawn from major government and industry research labs, universities, and corporate development.  Of these attendees, over 100 were full-time students from around the world.  NSF provided support to SPLASH 2013 to encourage US-based research student attendance at SPLASH by defraying the cost of their travel and accommodation expenses. The focus is on encouraging students in PhD graduate programs at US universities who would otherwise be unable to cover the costs of attendance at SPLASH.  A key focus of NSF support is to promote attendance by women, underrepresented minority, and younger students new to the research area.  Students made formal application to the ACM SIGPLAN Professional Activities Committee, indicating their financial need, and eligible applicants were selected for funding on the basis of their being registered students in accredited graduate programs at US institutions.  In 2013 NSF travel support was provided to 14 students.  Of these, one was female, and one an under-represented minority.  In addition, NSF support subsidized free registrations for 53 student volunteers (including 11 women).       Last Modified: 02/09/2015       Submitted by: Antony L Hosking]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
