<AbstractNarration>The goals of the Magnetics Information Consortium (MagIC) are to develop an open community&lt;br/&gt;digital data archive for rock and paleomagnetic data with web portals that allow users free&lt;br/&gt;access to archive, search, visualize and download these data to improve research capabilities&lt;br/&gt;in the Earth sciences. Much progress has been made, with data from more than 4,000 scientific&lt;br/&gt;publications in its holdings and a state-of-the-art user search interface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this award,the principal investigators extend their current 2-year grant into a 5-year overall project to bring MagIC into the realm of modern-day interoperability with other Earth Science databases (e.g. with GPlates and IODP), and with initiatives like EarthChem and Geochron, to provide seamless access to geochemistry information and radiometric ages on the sample data stored in MagIC. They also will focus on streamlining data entry, providing a personal workspace, an online review system, simple web services, providing advanced visualization tools from Google and involving more researchers in the archiving and reviewing uploaded data in order to maintain the reliability of the archive.</AbstractNarration>
