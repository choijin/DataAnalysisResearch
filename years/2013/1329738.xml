<AbstractNarration>This project will result in fundamental physical and algorithmic building blocks of a novel cyber-physical for a  two-way communication platform between handlers and working dogs designed to enable accurate training and control in open environments (eg, disaster response, emergency medical intervention).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Miniaturized sensor packages will be developed to enable non- or minimally-invasive monitoring of dogs' positions and physiology. Activity recognition algorithms will be developed to blend data from multiple sensors. The algorithms will dynamically determine position and behavior from time series of inertial and physiological measurements. Using contextual information about task performance, the algorithms will provide duty-cycling information to reduce sensor power consumption while increasing sensing specificity. The resulting technologies will be a platform for implementation of communication.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Strong interactions among computer science, electrical engineering, and veterinary science support this project. Work at the interface between electrical engineering and computer science will enable increased power efficiency and specificity of sensing in the detectors; work at the interface of electrical engineering and veterinary behavior will enable novel physiological sensing packages to be developed which measure behavioral signals in real time; Project outcomes will enable significant advances in how humans interact with both cyber and physical agents, including getting clearer pictures of behavior through real time physiological monitoring.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Students are part of the project and multidisciplinary training will help to provide development of the Cyber-Physical Systems pipeline. Project outreach efforts will include working with middle school children, especially women and under-represented minorities, presentations in public museums  that will promote public engagement and appreciation of the contribution of cyber-physical systems to daily lives. The goal of each outreach activity is to encourage  both interest and excitement for STEM topics,  demonstrating how computer science  and engineering can lead to effective and engaging  cyber-physical systems.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of this project has been to conduct the fundamental research that enables technology-enhanced cyber-physical systems for computer assisted training, handling, and more generally communicating with canines. The project contributed the fundamental physical and algorithmic building blocks of a novel cyber-physical communication platform between humans and canines, called Computer Assisted Training Systems (CATS) for Dogs. The project resulted in the techniques and technologies to enable computers to supplement and augment the two-way information exchange between humans and dogs, addressing the core asymmetries in communicative production and comprehensions between the species. This project provided solid steps towards achieving novel capabilities for: 1) humans to acquire a comprehensive physiological and behavioral picture of their dogs in real-time; 2) dogs to acquire clear, non-aversive tactile and aural inputs from humans remotely, using technology to enable long-distance and non-line-of-sight communications between dogs and handlers; and 3) closing the loop between sensors, algorithms, and communication paradigms to enable computers to perform fully-autonomous positive reinforcement training. The project progressed in four parallel thrusts: Sensor Development, Sensor Integration, Algorithmic Innovations, and Field Demonstrations and Evaluations. In addition, a large emphasis on STEM outreach---especially to underrepresented minorities and women---was a hallmark of the project. Project PIs and graduate students regularly hosted visits from middle and high school students, gave lectures at science museums and outreach events, and conducted live demonstrations in response to numerous requests. Dogs and technology combined are highly mediagenic, a characteristic that resulted in numerous major national and international media outlets highlighting the work. The resulting attention from that coverage was an invaluable tool for broadening the outreach efforts. Prototypes during project development were evaluated with stake holders from relevant working dog and animal welfare communities, including search and rescue, animal assisted therapies, guiding people with visual disabilities, animal rescues and shelters, veterinary behavior analysis, animal-robot interaction, and canine training. The project's efforts to achieve these capabilities have already promoted improved two-way communication between dogs and handlers with wide-ranging applications, leading to numerous citations in RFPs from other government agencies and research and development partnerships with non-profit and private entities across the country.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/11/2019<br>      Modified by: David&nbsp;L&nbsp;Roberts</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1329738/1329738_10277104_1549940827689_IMG_4866--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1329738/1329738_10277104_1549940827689_IMG_4866--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Smart Harness Research Platform"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1329738/1329738_10277104_1549940827689_IMG_4866--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Smart Harness Research Platform"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A Labrador Retriever wearing a prototype smart harness, consisting of on-board processing, communications, and physiological, behavioral, and environmental sensors.</div> <div class="imageCredit">David L.
