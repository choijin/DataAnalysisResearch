<AbstractNarration>The objective of this award is the development of novel methodologies for treating cardiac arrhythmias associated with abnormal electrical activity in the heart.  This will include the computation of energy-optimal stimuli which drive the states of myocardial cells to a region of phase space for which they become nearly synchronized, thereby terminating spiral wave activity and preventing spiral wave reentry.  The algorithm used to accomplish this will involve new computational approaches for finding appropriate target regions of phase space and solving the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation in higher dimensions.  Another methodology will use the action potential duration restitution curve, which is an experimentally measurable function that describes the duration of an action potential as a function of the time since the end of the preceding action potential.  Given this curve, the methods of dynamic programming will be applied to determine an optimal pulse train within a family of possibilities for synchronization of myocardial activity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cardiac arrhythmias can disrupt the coordination that is essential for the effective pumping of blood, and can lead to cardiac arrest. Survivors of cardiac arrest often receive an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), but defibrillating shocks from ICDs can lead to fibrosis in the myocardium, making it necessary to use stronger defibrillating shocks.  The shocks can also cause adverse short-term side effects such as intense chest pain and post-shock dysfunction. If successful, this research will represent an early step toward the use of energy-optimal stimuli for ICDs, which would reduce the need for surgical replacement of their batteries,and might mitigate some of the deleterious side effects of defibrillation. This work will also contribute to the development of computational tools which can be used to find optimal control strategies in a wide range of applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There are various types of cardiac arrhythmias associated with abnormal electrical activity in the heart, and these can disrupt the coordination that is essential for the effective pumping of blood.  Cardiac arrhythmias can lead to cardiac arrest, which according to the American Heart Association occurs hundreds of thousands of times per year in the United States alone.  These considerations motivated our computational studies into different methods for eliminating cardiac arrhythmias using electrical stimuli.    Cardiac arrest is frequently associated with fibrillation, which is often the final step in an increasingly complex series of events that begins with a phenomenon known as cardiac alternans.  Alternans is the beat-to-beat alternation of electrochemical cardiac dynamics which can occur despite pacemaker cells stimulating the cardiac tissue at a constant rate.  We designed electrical stimuli which stabilize healthy non-alternating response to such pacing, using as little power as possible.  We also devised a methodology to determine an optimal pattern of stimuli to synchronize firing patterns of cardiac cells, which our simulations show will terminate spiral waves associated with fibrillation with improved probability. These results suggest that designing stimuli which promote synchronization in cardiac tissue could improve the success rate of defibrillation, and point towards novel strategies for optimizing cardiac interventions.
