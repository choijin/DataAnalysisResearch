<AbstractNarration>This award contributes support for the conference Evolution of Colloidal Matter, to be held June 27-29, 2013 on the campus of New York University.   The conference brings together a group of world leaders in colloidal sciences and related areas to discuss recent computational, theoretical, and experimental developments in colloidal locomotion, growth, new amorphous and crystalline structures, active matter and applications. The interaction among the participants will contribute to the definition of the basic problems of the field and nucleate further research leading to new scientific advances. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference reflects the excitement of the field reflected in the major innovations in colloidal materials over the past decade, more than in the entire previous history of the field. Colloids are fluids with tiny particles suspended in them. Modern designer particles come with controllable shapes, made possible by inventive chemistry or lithography, functionalization with proteins, complementary DNA strands, and complementary particle shapes directed by patches and particle geometry. Among the new class of colloids are particles with interesting properties such as Janus Particles, Patchy Particles, Lock and Key colloids, and Slippery Particles.  Composite particles or patches can contain catalysts making the colloids microreactors which can lead to particles that can surf or swim. So, colloids include nonequilibrium, driven systems and enable active materials which can be switched on and off with for example the application of light. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These advances open new areas for fundamental research and also routes to synthesize new materials.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks to the breakthroughs in the synthesis, characterization and modeling of colloidal assemblies, various technological advances have emerged including complex microfluidics devices, self-healing materials, self-replicating colloidal arrays, cell scaffolds and photonic materials with unique properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award contributes support for the participation of women, underrepresented minorities, and early-career speakers in the conference.</AbstractNarration>
