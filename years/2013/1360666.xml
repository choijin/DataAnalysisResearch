<AbstractNarration>Overview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant will support a CST cruise on the R/V Atlantic Explorer from Barbados to Bermuda&lt;br/&gt;in May and June 2014. Chief Scientist Training (CST) cruises are part of an educational initiative&lt;br/&gt;designed for young US oceanographers, from senior graduate students to junior faculty, to&lt;br/&gt;increase their participation in seagoing research by educating them about the capabilities&lt;br/&gt;and opportunities provided by the UNOLS research fleet. In addition to providing sampling&lt;br/&gt;opportunities for individual research, a CST cruise is specifically organized to teach cruise&lt;br/&gt;participants how to successfully plan and execute a research cruise, from proposal to post-cruise&lt;br/&gt;reporting. Cruise participants will be selected based on the feasibility of their proposed&lt;br/&gt;science objectives, with an additional goal of maximizing scientific, societal and geographic&lt;br/&gt;diversity of the participants.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit :&lt;br/&gt;The ship track covers a oceanographically important transitional area in the western subtropical&lt;br/&gt;Atlantic, and thus the participants will be able to obtain scientifically valuable data in&lt;br/&gt;addition to gaining valuable skills and training that will help them to plan and execute successful&lt;br/&gt;cruises in their future careers.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts :&lt;br/&gt;The CST cruise will help develop future expertise in the US oceanographic community by reducing&lt;br/&gt;the barriers to participation of young scientists in seagoing research, particularly those&lt;br/&gt;scientists from non ship-operator institutions. The activities proposed will help to disseminate&lt;br/&gt;information about the research opportunities that are provided by NSF and the UNOLS research&lt;br/&gt;fleet. The training and workshop activities are projected to increase the number and breadth&lt;br/&gt;of future proposals requesting ship support as well as to improve the quality of execution&lt;br/&gt;and success of funded cruises. The CST cruise opportunity will also help to broaden the&lt;br/&gt;geographic representation of the research community that is involved in ship-based scientific&lt;br/&gt;studies as well as increase the diversity of this community.</AbstractNarration>
