<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Organic materials broaden the scope and reach of electronic applications and devices by enabling their fabrication in previously inaccessible locations, surfaces, and applications. A common example is organic light-emitting diodes, which are widely used in commercial displays and have been demonstrated on flexible, transparent, and large-area surfaces. The capability to perform a range of functions, including light-emission, computing, sensing, solar energy conversion, energy storage, and catalysis is constrained by inherent disorder, especially at interfaces between organic semiconductors, and by a limited understanding of optoelectronic processes that occur at these interfaces. The central hypothesis of this work is that an emerging class of polymeric materials known as all-conjugated block copolymers can give enhanced energy and charge transfer, controlled nanoscale structure, and fundamental insight into the electronic properties of organic semiconductor interfaces. This hypothesis will be tested through the following research objectives: (1) quantify the role of crystallization, micro-phase segregation, and interfacial energy on the microstructure of all-conjugated block copolymer films, (2) develop a logical framework for improving the performance of OPVs, and (3) elucidate the role of interfacial structure and electronic properties on charge transfer between donor and acceptor organic semiconductors. This will be accomplished through polymer synthesis, structural characterization using grazing-incidence X-ray scattering, device fabrication and testing, and both steady-state and transient photophysical measurements.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organic electronic materials are widely used in applications such as lightweight LED displays and efficient, low-cost lighting. The work proposed here aims to increase the functionality of organic electronics for more ambitious targets, including affordable solar energy, printable computers, and rechargeable batteries. This will be accomplished through the development of novel materials capable of absorbing light, generating electricity, and transporting both positive and negative charges. Additionally, recognizing that community colleges educate large and diverse pools of future scientists and engineers, the Principle Investigator plans to establish a program for increasing the scientific literacy of community college students and encouraging their participation in undergraduate research programs. The outreach activities will provide community college students with knowledge of current research, familiarity with scientific writing and journal publications, and teamwork to discuss and solve problems. Students will also enhance their experience in chemistry, physics, and engineering through summer research.</AbstractNarration>

Unlike the commercial silicon-based photovoltaics, polymer-based devices are thin, lightweight, printable, and portable but generally produce much lower currents and harness only a fraction of solar energy. This project explored a novel class of polymeric materials to understand the fundamental limitations of the solar energy conversion process. This project focused on understanding the solar energy harnessing process, improving the effectiveness of converting sunlight to produce electricity, and producing mechanically robust photovoltaic devices.</p> <p>Polymer based photovoltaic devices are able to absorb light and produce electricity. The conversion of sunlight to electricity involves multiple steps, including the generation of negatively-charged electrons and positively-charged holes after absorption of sunlight. In order for a polymer photovoltaic device to generate significant amounts of electricity, this process should be efficient as possible, and ideally each photon of light absorbed would produce a positive and negative charge. The most efficient route to producing polymer photovoltaic devices involves blending two different materials ? a donor and acceptor, which carry the positive and negative charges, respectively, produced in the photovoltaic process. In this project, we performed work to understand how the properties of the donor and acceptor influenced the photovoltaic process and, specifically, whether chemically linking these two together could enhance performance. Introducing a chemical linkage between donor and acceptor is an appealing way to improve the photoconversion process. It provides control over the distance between donor and acceptor materials and the properties of the interface. Our work demonstrated that the chemical linker joining the donor and acceptor had a significant impact on the photovoltaic process and provided insight into linkers that could enhance or reduce performance.</p> <p>In another goal of this project, we studied the mechanical robustness of polymer photovoltaic films. Although polymer photovoltaic devices are thin and lightweight, they can crack under moderate bending or stretching resulting in failure of these devices even under relatively moderate strains. This is potentially a significant impediment to the development of portable and mechanically robust polymer OPVs. To address this challenge, rather than re-engineer the chemistry of the donor acceptor, we developed an elastic network that could be produced in the device to improve elasticity and resistance to fracture. We studied how the presence of the elastic network impacted mechanical properties and photovoltaic performance, and demonstrated a range of conditions where our approach could enhance performance under bending or deformation.</p> <p>In addition to the research activities described above, this project accomplished a number of educational objectives. Students from Houston Community College were recruited to participate in the project and trained in the relevant laboratory techniques. Over the 5 years of the grant, 10 students from community colleges participated in the project. Additionally, undergraduate students from Rice University were also trained and participated in the project. The project also supported the participation of two PhD graduate students. Students involved in the project received training in polymer chemistry, device fabrication and testing, writing, and oral communication skills. Outreach activities focused on K-12 activities that introduced a diverse group of students to challenges in energy and sustainability through lectures, hands on activities, and laboratory tours.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/12/2019<br>      Modified by: Rafael&nbsp;Verduzco</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1352099/1352099_10287787_1573618484553_journalcover--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1352099/1352099_10287787_1573618484553_journalcover--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Journal Cover"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1352099/1352099_10287787_1573618484553_journalcover--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Journal Cover"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Journal cover showing schematic for donor-acceptor linking</div> <div class="imageCredit">Rafael Verduzco</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rafael&nbsp;Verduzco</div> <div class="imageTitle">Journal Cover</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1352099/1352099_10287787_1573618566158_FlexibleOPV--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1352099/1352099_10287787_1573618566158_FlexibleOPV--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Flexible OPV devices"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1352099/1352099_10287787_1573618566158_FlexibleOPV--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Flexible OPV devices"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Images of flexible polymer photovoltaic devices</div> <div class="imageCredit">Rafael Verduzco</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rafael&nbsp;Verduzco</div> <div class="imageTitle">Flexible OPV devices</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1352099/1352099_10287787_1573619042851_flexibleOPVschematic--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1352099/1352099_10287787_1573619042851_flexibleOPVschematic--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Schematic for flexible OPVs"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1352099/1352099_10287787_1573619042851_flexibleOPVschematic--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Schematic for flexible OPVs"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Schematic for the preparation of an elastic interpenetrating network for OPVs</div> <div class="imageCredit">Rafael Verduzco</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rafael&nbsp;Verduzco</div> <div class="imageTitle">Schematic for flexible OPVs</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1352099/1352099_10287787_1573619598750_Participantsyear5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1352099/1352099_10287787_1573619598750_Participantsyear5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Project Participants year 5"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1352099/1352099_10287787_1573619598750_Participantsyear5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Project Participants year 5"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Project Participants in year 5 of the project.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Rafael Verduzco</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rafael&nbsp;Verduzco</div> <div class="imageTitle">Project Participants year 5</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1352099/1352099_10287787_1573619926496_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1352099/1352099_10287787_1573619926496_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Participants year 4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1352099/1352099_10287787_1573619926496_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Participants year 4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Participants year 4 of the project</div> <div class="imageCredit">Rafael Verduzco</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rafael&nbsp;Verduzco</div> <div class="imageTitle">Participants year 4</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
