<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop and commercialize advanced film capacitors with high energy density, high power density, and high thermal stability. Current dc bus capacitors in many medium and high power systems are dominated by polypropylene (PP) film capacitors which were developed more than 60 years ago and they have low thermal stability. This project will develop prototype capacitors using proprietary three-phase nanodielectric compositions combining high thermal stability, high dielectric constant, low dielectric loss, as well as low cost.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is development of cost-competitive advanced electrostatic capacitors that are critical components in many pulsed power and power electronics. These advanced capacitors will be able to minimize the capacitor size, weight and reduce the material and maintenance cost of power inverters in hybrid and plug-in electric vehicles, smart grid, oil/gas/geothermal down-hole drilling and exploration, wind turbine generators, grid-tied photovoltaic, and many other energy and military systems. The success of this project will facilitate the broad adoption of advanced switch technologies which can save the electricity energy loss by 30%.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ High temperature capacitor is a critical component in many power electronics that are used in electric vehicles, wind turbine generators, grid-tie photovoltaics, high-speed train, smart grids, and downhole drilling of oil, gas, and geothermal. If successfully used in all power electronics, advanced wide band gap semiconductor switches can reduce the electrical energy loss by more than 30%. However, one of the technical barriers for the success integration is the lack of low-cost high-temperature capacitors.  In this SBIR Phase I project, we performed preliminary development on high temperature nanodielectric compositions with high energy density, high thermal stability, and low dielectric loss. The test results and the capacitor modeling are consistent and show promising performance for application in large-size high power capacitors with high thermal stability.  One of the most feasible applications will be the DC link capacitors ini electric drive vehicles (EDV) including hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in electric vehicles, all-electric vehicles, or fuel-cell powered vehicles. Use of the high temperature capacitors may reduce the requirement on thermal cooling accesory, and reduce the size, weight, and cost of EDV.  If these materials are successfully used in large size capacitors, they will enable the adoption of high efficient power electronics and promote the wide use of renewable energies, and reduce the US dependence on foreign oil.
