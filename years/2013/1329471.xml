<AbstractNarration>This investigation aims to examine eggs and eggshell structures of modern megapodes with respect to their nesting strategies and environments. It will provide novel data on their evolutionary reproductive adaptations and reproductive fitness in the face of the present climate-driven environmental changes. Australasian megapodes are most intriguing because they display the practice, unique among birds, of incubating their eggs by utilizing only external heat sources rather than body heat. This study will focus chiefly on the eggshell structural and microstructural functional adaptative characteristics related to their respective nesting environments. Observations and microcharacterizations will be performed at Flinders University and the world-renowned Australian Microscopy and Microanalysis Research Facility located within Flinders University, the University of Adelaide, and the University of South Australia, all three&lt;br/&gt;located in Adelaide, South Australia. The collaborative study will be performed at Flinders University with Dr. Prideaux and his team. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A professor at the Oglala Lakota College (OLC) in Pine Ridge, the only higher education institution in the largest and poorest Native American Reservation, will collaborate in this project and is interested in the ecology, evolution, and reproduction of a box turtle colony discovered on the Reservation. The present study will greatly benefit this study.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A Study of the evolutionary, functional oological adaptations, and brooding behaviors of the Australasian megapodes in respect to their unique nesting behaviors: eggshell gas exchange, biomaterials, molecular architecture, biomechanics, and phylogenetic implications      The major goals of the project were to  Evaluate the possibilities of      collaborating with scientists at the Flinders University; Evaluate the capacities of      several new microcharacterizations for the intended purposes of the      research; Evaluate the specimens at the      South Australian Museum (SAM) and at Flinders.    To  Quantify variation in the      structure of megapode eggs and eggshells in each of the five nesting      strategies. Quantify interspecific      variation of eggs and eggshell structures, regardless of nesting      strategies. Determine the relationship      between the variations in the morphological features of eggs and eggshells      with respect to their specific nesting strategies. Determine the variations of gas      diffusion through the eggshells according to the nesting strategies. Formulate hypotheses on the      reproductive fitness of megapodes with respect to their nesting behaviors      in the face of rapid climate-driven environmental changes.      What was accomplished?  Activities, objectives, and results  A collaboration was      successfully established between the PI and T. Worthy and G. Prideaux,      which was immediately follow up by the submission of a fellowship      application for the PI at Flinders University under the "Flinders Visiting      International Fellowship".  The application was successful. The PI      returns to Adelaide from June 1st to July 22nd 2014 to pursue a      novel aspect of the original NSF proposal (see below); The equipment at the Australian      Microscopy &amp; Microanalysis Research Facility (AMMRF) shared between      the three universities in Adelaide proved to fit well with the proposed      research and results were already obtained; More megapode specimens than      originally projected are housed at (The South Australian Museum) SAM.                      As originally planned, the PI performed several sequential microcharacterizations of the available megapode eggs at SAM.  The bulk of the microcharacterizations (SEM, EDS, EBSD) focused on Alectura lathami and Leipoa ocellata, the two most common Australian megapodes and two megapodius eggs curated at SAM. Micro-CT observations delved, due to time constraints and limited funds, only on A. lathami and L. ocellata.  The preliminary results indicate that high-level microcharacterizations enable visualization of eggshell characters that are diagnostic for each of the observed species.  Therefore, our original hypothesis of a possible relationship between the variations in the morphological features of eggs and eggshells with respect to their specific nesting strategies, seems entirely substantiated.     What was accomplished?  Other achievements  While in Adelaide, the PI fortuitously (see following section) met Dr. Thompson, the dean of research of the University of Sydney. Dr. Thompson, although working at U. Sydney, is originally from Adelaide. Moreover, M. Thompson completed his doctorate at the University of Adelaide under Dr. Seymour. The topic of his doctorate was the diffusion of water vapor in A. lathami, L. ocellata eggs. M. Thompson shortly after introduced the PI to Dr. Seymour at U. Adelaide. Further projects now also encompass collaborative studies between the PI, M. Thompson, and R. Seymour. M. Thompson also contacted the ACMM at U. Sydney and agreed to have the micro-CT results processed for expediency sake by the M. Foley in charge of the ACMM micro-CT.     The broader impacts?  A. HigaÆs (Oglala Lakota College) participation in this project was to broaden her exposure to biology, physiology, and how structural and physiological traits of organisms underlie their capacities to live in specific ecosystems....]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
