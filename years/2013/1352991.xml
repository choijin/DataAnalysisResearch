<AbstractNarration>This proposal supports the participation of US researchers in an international gathering of scientists, educational practitioners and policy makers. This award supports a series of 3 international meetings of scientists that are jointly sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), the OECD Centre for Educational Research and Innovation (CERI), and UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization). The set of planned conferences include: (a) a Science of Learning Symposium hosted by Shanghai Institute of Neuroscience that will highlight research from the US Science of Learning Centers to explore areas of common or complementary interests with other participants from Asia and Europe, (b) a day for informal interactive activities among researchers and UNESCO representatives to discuss specific case studies and their links to relevant research; (c) the OECD/UNESCO/NSF meeting which is centered around discussion of advances in research about learning and their implications for educational practice and policy;  and (d) a Learning Symposium hosted by East China Normal University (ECNU), Shanghai Normal University, and the University of Hong Kong which will provide an even broader presentation of work by Chinese researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Learning is an important research topic with broad societal impacts.  The proposed activities promote advances in research and researchers' ability to address educational challenges by: 1) bringing together an international group of researchers to integrate their understanding of learning across disciplinary boundaries;  (2)  to discuss and to disseminate scientific knowledge about learning in ways that are accessible and meaningful to educational practitioners and policy makers; and (3) promote collaborations among these disparate communities that would lead to more effective integration of scientific findings to future innovations in education and policy.  The opportunity for sharing ideas, successes and failures across countries will facilitate new thinking and new partnerships to better address the challenges faced in education. Broader impacts of the proposed activities include: (1) the development, adoption and adaptation of effective models of learning and/or teaching that have proven successful in various countries, (2) establishment of new international research collaborations on learning that integrate knowledge across disciplinary perspectives to advance methods and theory, (3) create a better understanding of the value of learning research among policymakers, practitioners, and broader audiences across countries, and (4) promote more stable partnerships to facilitate reciprocal exchanges between research and practice.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>NSF funded an International Conference on the Science of Learning, which took place March 1-6, 2014, in Shanghai, China. The purpose of the meeting was to gather a large number of scientists, educators, policymakers, and some members of the lay public to discuss implications of the Science of Learning and of specific successful practices for education. The conference exceeded expectations with regard to the number of participants, and with regard to international collaborations that were formed, and follow up activities, which included publication of a book. This conference and book encouraged synergies between education, cognitive science, and neuroscience, for the improvement of education. At the meeting, researchers and educators discussed common problems and how to create new investigations and increase communication between and among the participants. Two major accomplishments were that: (1) A book entitled, <em>The Science of Learning in the 21st Century: Implications for Policymakers</em>, edited by Patricia K. Kuhl, Soo-Siang Lim, Sonia Guerriero, and Dirk Van Damme, will be published by OECD in 2018. The book offers concrete recommendations for policymakers based on the science of learning research, and (2) An NSF conference will take place in February of 2018 in Washington, DC to further enhance discussions on international collaboration. These activities established a bridge between scientists and society at large through strong relationships with the media, which were advanced by the conference.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>
