<AbstractNarration>In the past decade, the New Guinea region has been found to be a mega biodiversity hotspot for amphibians, containing one of the most ecologically diverse groups of amphibians in the world, the asterphryine frogs. Asterophryine diversity is likely influenced by New Guinea's unique geological history. These accretion events are fairly well dated, allowing the investigators to calibrate biological diversification to geological events and to determine the geological context in which evolutionary novelties arose. This system is not only ideal for studying how species multiply but also offers the unique opportunity to infer the relative order in which important processes occurred. This project will produce a comprehensive phylogenetic tree for the asterphryine frogs, assessing the geological conditions required for species to multiply, and determining whether natural selection preceded species diversification or vice versa. These studies will identify the mechanistic basis for this adaptive radiation of species, and will provide valuable insights for understanding the factors which promote biodiversity in all living groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The impacts of this research are numerous. The project will:   (1) provide the first detailed evolutionary study on any portion of the remarkably diverse but poorly studied New Guinea fauna; (2) include educational field trips for elementary-aged school children, allowing them to learn about biodiversity, amphibians, functional morphology, and conservation from working scientists; (3) train graduate and undergraduate students in research, teaching, public outreach, and professional skills; (4) recruit underrepresented minorities and women in the sciences; and (5) strengthen scientific training in a traditionally disadvantaged region.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project had two goals: first, to determine the evolutionary relationships of frogs of the lineage Asterophryinae so as to understand the reasons this group forms one of the most spectacular adaptive radiations of frogs in the world, and, second, the discovery and description of new species of amphibians and reptiles within Milne Bay Province, Papua New Guinea (PNG), a small portion of southeastern New Guinea that has one of the highest densities of endemic reptiles and amphibians in the world. These goals were met by conducting three expeditions to Milne Bay Province, completing a study of evolutionary relationships among the asterophryine frogs based on molecular data, and conducting detailed studies of the material collected during the expeditions to identify and name new species of frogs, lizards, and snakes.     By providing the most complete assessment of the evolutionary history of asterophryine frogs (&gt;320 species), we were able to demonstrate that the diverse array of ecological lifestyles adopted by these frogs has been independently acquired on a repeated basis throughout the past 28 million years.  However, most of this ecological diversification occurred early in the history of this group of frogs, and this subsequently led to elevated rates of speciation.     The three expeditions resulted in the collection of more than 1000 specimens, more than 450 tissue samples, hundreds of color photos of animals from this region, and the discovery of one new frog and three new snakes beyond the 113 new species discovered in this region by me on earlier expeditions. During this project I described thirteen new frogs and four new snakes out of this pool of newly discovered species.  On-going studies of the specimens collected during this and prior expeditions will result in the description of approximately 90 additional new species.  This research continues to confirm that the Milne Bay region of Papua New Guinea seems to have the highest density of endemic (narrow-range) reptiles and amphibians on Earth, with at least 150 unique species confined to eleven small areas of local endemism in an area of only 15,000 km2.      Recognition of this remarkable density of unique species has catalyzed local efforts within Milne Bay Province to develop a conservation atlas for the region that would serve as a single sources of compiled information on the unique species of this area (both in published and on-line form).  This atlas would then be used to guide local development of conservation projects that engage village landowners in protecting their lands, thereby providing the sort of local-level control of conservation decision making that can provide the greatest conservation security for the region.     Molecular studies with collaborators on many of the tissues obtained during this and earlier work are making clear that former arcs of islands that have shifted positions in the southwestern Pacific over the past 30 million years were important sources of modern lineages of snakes and geckos that speciated and colonized continental lands farther to the west and southwest.  This is noteworthy because it contradicts the common belief that the Pacific islands have been one-way recipients of colonizers from these continental lands.
