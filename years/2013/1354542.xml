<AbstractNarration>Processes of Knowledge Co-production for Adaptation Decision-making in Semi-Arid Regions&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This two-year project, undertaken by a biologist/science policy scholar, a geographer, and two graduate students from the University of Colorado, will document how knowledge is currently produced, articulated, represented, transmitted, and incorporated within coping and adaptation decisions by actors in semi-arid regions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their results promise to provide the means for better integrating scientific and local knowledge so as to improve decision-making regarding asset management and allocation of resources among those engaged in animal husbandry. Results will also be shared with policy makers and scientists.</AbstractNarration>
