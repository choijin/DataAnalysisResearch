<AbstractNarration>The technical objective of this project is to develop tsunami loading and design recommendations for bridges that address issues that must be treated differently for bridges than for buildings.   These issues include (1) three-dimensional bridge geometries such as deck shape, skew and embankments, whose hydraulic characteristics can lead to channelization, bore entrapment, and shielding; (2) debris impact and debris damming that can greatly increase the forces on a bridge, both during the initial impact of the tsunami waves and during the outflows; and (3) fluid-structure interaction effects that can be significant for particular types of bridges and retrofit strategies, such as the deployment of fenders or in cases with flexible structures.   Bridge-specific retrofit strategies will also be explored.  Recent advances in the development of parallel processing software and the availability of powerful computational platforms make it possible to simulate these complex effects.  Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling will address the effects of three-dimensional hydraulic geometries.  The Material Point Method (MPM) will address the effects of debris impact fields and damming by modeling debris explicitly.  The Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM), as implemented in OpenSees, will allow researchers to consider the fluid-structure interaction, the effects of the preceding earthquake shaking and the effect of uncertainties.  As part of this planning grant, the simulation strategies will be developed sufficiently to guide the detailed design of critical experiments in a NEES2 facility early in FY2015.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Over the past decade, tsunamis have caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and hundreds of billions of dollars of damage.  The loss of critical lifeline structures has exacerbated these catastrophes by delaying emergency response efforts and post-event economic recovery.  Large tsunamis also threaten at least five U.S. states and numerous U.S. territories.  Nearly all past tsunami research has focused on run-up modeling, the development of evacuation strategies, and more recently, on the design of buildings to resist tsunamis.  In comparison, little research has addressed the tsunami performance of bridges, and no guidelines are available to design safe and economical tsunami-resistant bridges or to develop retrofit strategies.  To these ends, the proposed research will transform the design of tsunami-resistant bridges, and consequently, greatly improve post-event response and recovery efforts.  Data from this project will be archived and made available to the public through the NEES data repository.  This award is part of the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the past decade, tsunamis have caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and hundreds of billions of dollars of damage.  The loss of critical lifeline structures has exacerbated these catastrophes by delaying emergency response efforts and post-event economic recovery.  Nearly all past tsunami research has focused on run-up modeling, the development of evacuation strategies, and more recently, on the design of buildings to resist tsunamis.  In comparison, little research has addressed the tsunami performance of bridges, and no guidelines are available to design safe and economical tsunami-resistant bridges and retrofit strategies.  To that end, the primary goals of this project were to develop tsunami loading and design recommendations for bridges, including three-dimensional effects such as bridge skew or superelevation, debris impact and damming forces, and fluid-air-structure interactions between the tsunami wave and the structure.  This work took advantage of recent advances in computational modeling using open source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software to address the effects of three-dimensional hydraulic geometries and the material point method (MPM) to address the effects of tsunami-induced debris loading.   Ultimately, as a planning grant, the end result of this work was to validate and extend these models sufficiently to develop a follow-up experimental program specifically designed to provide a series of numerical/experimental testbed simulations for future model development. A follow-up experimental program (approved by NSF) is just beginning at the NHERI wave-flume facility at the Oregon State University.  This experimental work will provide the opportunity to validate the simulation strategies developed during this project.  It will also allow the researchers to explore experimentally key variables (e.g., effect of debris, characterization of three-dimensional flows) that were identified during this study.  Over the three years of this project, several key outcomes were achieved, as listed below:  A preliminary assessment of      tsunami risk to the coastal bridge infrastructure for the Alaska,      California, Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington was developed.  Typical bridge systems along the Pacific      coastlines in these states were surveyed to find common construction types; Detailed assessment of the      applicability of the draft ASCE 7 tsunami provisions to bridge structures      was performed.  A presentation of      these results to members of the draft committee during development stages,      resulting in several modifications to the provisions;   Development and validation of the facilities at the OSU Wave Research Lab, the UW hydraulics lab, and the PWRI experimental facility using the modeling techniques noted above was successfully completed; Experimentally validated models were extended to consider forces on bridge decks to confirm that modifications to the bridge deck geometry, such as the addition of skew, slope, and superelevation, can have a significant effect on the predicted forces in a way that cannot be captured using traditional two-dimensional analysis; Development of the capabilities to efficiently model the complex geometries of existing, real-world bridge structures typical for the U.S. Pacific coast and to begin to assess their resilience to tsunami impact was completed; A novel analysis technique was presented showing that component-level force predictions can not only provide superior insight into how a tsunami interacts with and subsequently applies load to a structure with a complex geometry, but also can help to explain aberrations in trends due to fluid-structure interaction phenomena; Models were developed to study debris impact and damming forces on bridge superstructures.  Fluid and solid components of the material point method model were validated against closed form solutions. Comparisons with the ASCE 7 recommendations for evaluation of forces on bridges due to debris carried by tsunamis led to extension of ASCE 7 recommendations for conditions not considered in the original set of guidelines.     The research performed during this project implemented and improved three state-of-the-art simulation strategies that are essential to understanding complex three-dimensional, multi-physics phenomena of wave-structure-debris interaction, pushing the limits of the computational capabilities with respect to these types of problems.  This work has been transformative in improving the understanding of how tsunami-like waves impact structures with complex geometries and, through extending these concepts in the coming years, could have a significant impact on the design of tsunami-resistant bridge systems, greatly improving post-event response and recovery efforts.  As part of this project, the research team was also able to provide outreach to the Seattle, WA, community as part of the University of Washington?s (UW) Discovery Days, where several thousand K-12 students and their parents participate in hands-on demonstrations and learn about research being conducted at UW.  In addition, a three part module on tsunami loading of structures, geared toward graduate students in structural engineering, was developed to present fundamentals of fluid loading on structures, state-of-the-art topics in tsunami-structure interaction research, and a real world case study of a tsunami evacuation structure currently under construction on the Washington coast.
