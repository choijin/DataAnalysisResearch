<AbstractNarration>Researchers have developed a software framework that helps to automatically define, acquire and consume cloud based services. A simple prototype demonstrating some of these features was successfully demonstrated at a recent cloud computing conference. Researchers are now looking to address some key open questions and create a more robust version of this prototype or a "cloud broker" tool that will enable users to select the best suited service (or a combination of services) from the plethora of services/providers in the market. Unlike much of the existing work, this will involve (automated) negotiation between the service provider and the consumer to arrive at a machine understandable and processable service-level agreement (SLA). Such a system addresses a key identified gap in existing cloud technology. The research team plans to use Semantically Web (W3C standard) languages to build the prototype. They have developed ontologies and rules to describe cloud services, requirements, security and privacy. This solution may have the ability to capture and leverage federal cloud standards currently in development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Customers are currently acquiring cloud services manually by hiring consultants to review and compare the services and conditions (terms, pricing, compliance, security etc.) being offered by the cloud providers, establish SLAs, and then monitor SLAs during usage. This is a very time consuming and human intensive process which reduces return on investments and impacts security and privacy. As a result, large organizations with complex enterprise policies are unable to use full potential of the cloud. There is a market need for a well-researched, tested solution that addresses these barriers to cloud adoption.</AbstractNarration>

We were given valuable insight into how to develop a business canvas, determine our product's value proposition, identify customer segments, revenue streams and potential partners.  For the I-Corp program we talked extensively to over a 100 potential customers over six weeks. We observed the following pain points and preferences in the user community for cloud based services.     Data Security was a top concern for customers. There was a concern that cloud vendors were not as transparent about their technology as users would like. Hence,  organizations were hesitant to move their business critical data to the cloud. Cloud Identity Management , specially regards to security and privacy of data, was of interest to organizations maintaining large datasets. Customers are ready to pay more for security and hence preferred going with big vendors , even though smaller vendors were selling the same service for less.    The total cloud market has been predicted to grow to be around $240 billion by 2020. Among the potential market sectors, we observed a very high interest for a cloud broker like product amongst federal agencies, International Agencies and higher education sector.
