<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2013 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Grigori Avramidi is "Geometry and Topology of Noncompact Aspherical Manifolds." The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Utah, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Mladen Bestvina.</AbstractNarration>
