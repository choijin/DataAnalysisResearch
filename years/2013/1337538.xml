<AbstractNarration>This collaborative award to the University of Washington and Cornell University funds the development of a calorimeter detector that would be used to measure the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon.  This quantity is of fundamental interest because of discrepancies between a recent measurement and theoretical predictions of the standard model of particle physics.  The magnetic moment of the muon will be measured with greatly increased precision.  If the discrepancy is confirmed, it would imply the existence of new subatomic particles, so far undetected, and would fundamentally reshape our understanding of the world around us.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The muon is a heavy and unstable cousin to the electron.  It decays principally into an electron and two neutrinos with a lifetime of a few microseconds.  Both muons and electrons are fundamental, point-like building blocks of the Standard Model (SM), and each has an intrinsic spin angular momentum.   Just as a spinning toy top will precess in a circle on a tabletop owing to the torque from gravity, an muon or an electron will precess when placed in a magnetic field.  That means the direction of its spin axis will wobble about the magnetic field direction in a very predictable manner.  In 1947, precise measurements performed on electrons revealed that the wobble rate occurred a tiny bit faster than predictions.  This fact, along with precise atomic physics experiments, led to the remarkable development of quantum electrodynamics, now the most precise theory in physics.  The wobble rate could then be totally explained.  Over the decades since then, measurements like these, when compared to calculations, have reached extraordinary levels of precision.  The calculations can predict the spin rate owing to a deep understanding of all of the known SM particles and interactions.  The measurements then can confirm or refute that the understanding is complete.     In 2004, a measurement performed at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) determined the muon?s spin precession rate with a sub-parts-per-million precision.  The value found is slightly faster than predicted by the SM and the significance of the discrepancy is greater than 3 standard deviations.  This finding led to thousands of citations and hundreds of speculative explanations, usually involving a model of new physics that would require modifications of the Standard Model.   In particle physics, the threshold for an acknowledged discovery is a significance exceeding 5 standard deviations; the BNL experiment was just not precise enough to be definitive.  To improve in precision, the Muon g-2 Collaboration built a new experiment at Fermilab with a goal of acquiring more than 20 times the data compared to BNL and a commensurate reduction in systematic uncertainties.  While the new experiment uses the original superconducting muon storage ring, it requires entirely updated instrumentation to measure the muon?s spin precession frequency.  This National Science Foundation MRI award supported the development of that instrumentation.   Because of parity violation in muon decay, the spin direction of the muon is correlated with the emitted decay electron energy.  The new instrumentation measures electron energy vs time of arrival and from that information, one can deduce the muon spin precession rate.  The instrumentation consists of a suite of 24 electromagnetic calorimeters, each composed of 54 lead-fluoride crystals that are viewed by a silicon photo-multiplier light transducer.  The analog signals from these detectors are recorded using custom 800 MSPS, 12-bit depth waveform digitizers.  The raw data rate from the 1296 devices exceeds 20 GBytes/s.  Our fast data acquisition system uses a GPU farm to process and select data in real time such that a manageable rate can be saved for offline evaluation.  A precision clock and control system ensures that the timing &ndash; and thus the extracted frequency &ndash; is accurate.  We have completed all design, construction, and implementation of these central components, as well as many mechanical and electrical support devices required to make the system function as a coherent whole.  Because of the novel nature of some of this work, we have published several technical papers to date and have presented the development at professional meetings.  We note that many graduate and undergraduate students contributed to this project, gaining invaluable experiences in design, simulation, construction, quality control, testing, and implementation of state-of-the-art detector, electronics, and data acquisition systems. With this MRI work complete, physics data taking for the entire experiment is beginning and results are expected over the next few years.  Perhaps soon, we will know if new physics is required to explain the rapidly precessing muons.          Last Modified: 11/26/2017       Submitted by: Lawrence Gibbons]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
