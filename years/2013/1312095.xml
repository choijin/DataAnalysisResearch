<AbstractNarration>Cosmological simulations of galaxy formation provide the most complete approach for understanding the evolution of structure in the universe. The ultimate goal of such simulations is to trace the formation of galaxies from first principles; but the enormous dynamic range, and the many poorly understood physical effects involving baryonic matter  in galaxies, make this an extremely difficult computational challenge. In this project, a model for the visible universe will be constructed using state-of-the-art cosmological simulations. The simulations will include both dark matter and baryons, and will employ a novel moving mesh technique implemented in the new code AREPO. Using convergence tests, it will be possible to determine which results are robust to variations in the treatment of star formation, black hole growth, and feedback, which will be handled in ways that are more physically motivated than in earlier studies. The scientific effort will focus on understanding: 1) the formation of galactic disks in a cosmological context and the impact of feedback on galaxy morphology and kinematics; 2) the nature of gas inflows into galaxy halos and the accretion of gas by disks; 3) the interaction between accreted gas and galactic outflows of chemically enriched material and consequences for the circumgalactic medium; and 4) the co-evolution of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes. The simulation results, including snapshots of the full simulations, galaxy catalogs, images, and videos, will be made available to the research community through a web-based interface. The project will support the work of a postdoctoral scholar and a graduate student; in addition, a series of lectures will be developed to be given to high school students in Cambridge, MA on topics covering the evolution of the Universe and its constituents.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project studied the formation and evolution of galaxies using numerical simulations. The calculations begin shortly after the Big Bang and follow the growth of galaxies through cosmic time. Many aspects of galaxy formation are poorly understood, such as the details of how stars form from interstellar gas, and how supermassive black holes seen at the centers of nearby galaxies originate. However, their effects are crucial to the development of galaxies as they are able to return energy to the gas in galaxies that is available to form future generations of stars, limiting the star formation efficiency at different rates, depending on the masses of the galaxies.  In our simulations, we employ simple physical models to describe the effects of this "feedback," making it possible to self-consistently follow the assembly of galaxies accounting for the larger-scale, cosmological environments in which they reside.  Our work culminated in the first simulations of large volumes of the Universe that account for its known constituents, including dark matter, dark energy, and ordinary matter, and that have sufficient numerical resolution to capture the internal structure of galaxies as they form. The first of our simulations comprise what had become known as the "Illustris Project," and demonstrate that starting from initial conditions appropriate for the early Universe, before stars and galaxies existed, the combination of gravity and physical processes related to star formation and the growth of supermassive black holes are sufficient to yield a population of galaxies with properties remarkably similar to the real Universe. Of course, given the simplicity of some of the assumptions we were forced to make, it was not surprising that not all of the predictions from the simulations agreed with observations.  Subsequently, we examined the circumstances responsible for the shortcomings of the simulations and found that they were mainly caused by the manner in which feedback energy from growing supermassive black holes was treated.  We therefore formulated a new model and tested it using simulations that were idealized in character and enabled us to achieve much higher resolution than is possible in full cosmological simulations. We iterated these calculations to determine a suitable implementation for much larger scale applications and used these to perform a new set of simulations that make up the "IllustrisTNG Project."  Based on a first analysis of these simulations, we have been able to determine that they provide an even better representation of galaxies in the actual Universe.  Future work will enable us to test our new models in even greater detail to identify under what conditions they may still not be adequate.  Along with running and analyzing the simulations, we have put together a website for disseminating the data, along with visual images and animations. Our animations have now been used in hundreds of broadcasts and planetarium shows world-wide.  Details can be found at the website www.illustris-project.org.
