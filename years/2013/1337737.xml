<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation award supports instrument development at the University of Kansas Center for Research Inc. The instrument is an ultra-high-vacuum scanning probe microscopy-tip enhanced Raman spectroscopy characterization chamber integrated with an existing UHV sputtering-atomic layer deposition (ALD). The objective is to provide unique, state-of-the-art research infrastructure that would allow in situ fabrication and characterization of structural, chemical and physical properties at surfaces and interfaces with nanometer resolution and surface dynamics up to femtosecond temporal resolution. This instrument will directly benefit research in quantum device physics, nanomaterials, energy, and biomaterials. It will significantly advance fundamental knowledge in the pursuit of answers to the following major challenge in basic science: How do we design and perfect atom- and energy-efficient syntheses of revolutionary new forms of matter with tailored properties? The instrument will enable research designed to lead to the development of novel nanomaterials for quantum devices and solar energy harvesting and storage. The unique capability of this instrument will allow researchers, for the first time, to investigate correlation between the structural, physical and chemical properties of the Josephson tunnel junctions, which are the heart of superconducting qubits-building blocks of quantum computers. Quantum computation enabled by high-performance superconducting qubits has the potential to revolutionize information processing. The solar energy research enabled will lead to methods for increasing solar energy capture efficiency in artificial or hybrid systems for long-term electricity production for large-scale and cost-effective renewable fuel production. Further, novel low cost and high performance nano-structured photovoltaic devices for solar energy conversion will be developed.  In addition, ALD grown materials will be explored for improved energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors and batteries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;*****&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award supports instrument development at the University of Kansas Center for Research Inc. The instrument is a novel ultra-high-vacuum scanning probe microscopy-tip enhanced Raman spectroscopy (UHV SPM-TERS) characterization chamber integrated with an existing UHV sputtering-atomic layer deposition system. This integrated UHV growth-characterization system will enable in situ topographic, electrical, and chemical characterization, structural, electronic and optical properties of materials.  Researchers will acquire fundamental understanding essential to developing novel functional materials for quantum devices and energy applications. In addition, the instrument will also support researchers in sensors, catalysis, and bioengineering. The anticipated outcomes/breakthroughs enabled by the instrumentation will lead to the development of novel and viable quantum-information and energy-related technologies with national and global impact. Existing education and outreach activities at the University of Kansas and the collaborating institutions will be leveraged by the instrumentation. Specifically, these activities will produce a unique and diverse future workforce in science and engineering, particularly in the quantum information and energy fields. Existing partnerships with minority-serving institutions, such as Haskell Indian Nations University, will promote diversity in recruiting and effective training.</AbstractNarration>
