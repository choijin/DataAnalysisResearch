<AbstractNarration>This project is focused on computational framework for stochastic motion planning and estimation of complex dynamical systems.  As uncertainties in a dynamical system arise from various sources and they cannot be completely eliminated from any numerical analysis or experiment, the evolution of uncertainties should be carefully characterized in motion planning and estimation.  This research utilizes non-commutative harmonic analysis to represent an arbitrary type of uncertainty distributions in an intrinsic fashion, and they are propagated according to the Fokker-Planck equation.  Based on these, stochastic optimal motion planning will be designed to obtain feasible paths of a vehicle that maximize the probability to achieve a goal in uncertain environments.  In addition, nonlinear estimation schemes will be constructed according to Bayesian framework to characterize uncertainties accurately with sensor measurements.  These formulations will be developed in a coordinate-free fashion on nonlinear configuration manifolds represented by a Lie group.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will provide a fundamental framework for stochastic analysis with arbitrary large uncertainties, eliminating the common restrictive assumption that uncertainties follow a specific Gaussian distribution with small variances.  This result will be particularity useful for motion planning and estimation of complex dynamical systems in highly uncertain circumstances, such as unmanned aerial vehicles that are capable of interacting with unknown dynamic environments through agile maneuvers autonomously.  This award will contribute to the development of an engineering-driven computational math course and a research monograph, through which we aim to cross-train students in both mathematics and engineering. The results will be disseminated broadly to K-12 students by organizing engineering summer camps, thereby exposing them to research activities in an earlier stage and invigorating their interests in math and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

Such nonlinear spaces are referred to as manifolds. Various dynamical systems in aerospace engineering and robotics evolve on a manifold, and these may include a simple pendulum, rotational attitude dynamics of a satellite, posture of a humanoid robot or complex multibody systems. On the other hands, uncertainties are ubiquitous in science and engineering. They arise from multiple sources, including sensor measurement noise or unmodeled dynamics, and they cannot be completely avoided in practice. As such, careful characterization of uncertainties is critical, and a decision based on stochastic information can be drastically different from deterministic approaches.  However, it is often assumed that uncertainties are small, or they follow a specific, canonical form.  In particular, Gaussian distributions, that are commonly known as the bell curves, are the most celebrated probability distribution in science and engineering. According to the central limit theorem, the sum of a large number of independent random variables tends toward a Gaussian distribution, and the majority of the estimation schemes, such as the Kalman filter, are derived analytically in an explicit form when the relevant random variables are normally distributed. The issue is that Gaussian distributions are formulated on the linear, Euclidean space, and they cannot be utilized for any rotational dynamics on a compact, nonlinear manifold. In other words, the common current practice is not adequate to deal with large uncertainties evolving on a manifold.  This project is to characterize uncertainties for dynamic systems evolving on a nonlinear manifold, so as to estimate its state with a calculated level of confidence. According to the proposed stochastic formulation, we are able to construct a probability density function that describes the complete stochastic properties of a dynamic system under consideration.
