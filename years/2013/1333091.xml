<AbstractNarration>This project will create a Theoretical and Computational Astrophysics Network with major nodes at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University of California at Berkeley, and Princeton University, to advance the theory of black hole accretion and outflows. Accretion of matter onto black holes is central to many astrophysical and gravitational phenomena, but current theory lacks self-consistent models both for high accretion rate flows where radiation forces are important, and for low accretion rate flows where collisionless plasma effects are important. The network team brings together expertise in high performance computing techniques, astrophysics, and plasma physics in order to address this need. The team will develop a general relativistic, radiation magnetohydrodynamics code to study luminous accreting black holes, and a multi-fluid relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code with anisotropic electron and ion pressures, conduction, viscosity, and radiative heating and cooling to study slowly accreting systems. These new codes will be used to address fundamental questions about the structure and observational appearance of the inner accretion disk as well as the origin and maintenance of the large-scale magnetic fields believed to power relativistic jets, and then will be made publicly available to the research community. The network will contribute to scientific workforce development by supporting the work of undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdocs; and a program of visualizations, released on the internet, will help communicate the excitement of black hole astrophysics to the scientific community and to the broader public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ When black holes accrete matter from their surroundings, they produce  powerful relativistic outflows of matter and become some of the most luminous objects in the known Universe.  Thus, the theory of how matter accretes in to black holes is central to many areas of  modern astrophysics.  This project was a collaboration between  researchers at Princeton University, the University of Illinois, and the University of California Berkeley to study black hole accretion in two very important regimes: (1) systems with very high accretion rates where radiation forces are important, and (2) systems with very low accretion rates where collisionless plasma effects are important.  Significant advances were made in both regimes.  For luminous  accretion flows, we developed powerful new numerical methods for studying radiation-dominated magnetized plasmas.  We used the nations largest supercomputers, with access provided by the DOE INCITE program, to run the largest numerical calculations to date that follow radiation-dominated black hole accretion flows.  We discovered new phenomena, for example spiral density waves dominate angular momentumm transport in highly radiation pressure dominated disks. For the first time, we were able to compute what fraction of the energy released by accretion is radiated away, what fraction goes in to driving outflows which impact their surroundings, and what fraction is accreted into the black hole.  These results are important for understanding systems such as active galactic nuclei.  Attached is an image from one of our simulations.  For low-luminosity accretion flows, we were able to use advanced  numerical methods to compute the dynamics of collisionless plasmas and study angular momentum transport and magnetically-driven turbulence in this regime.  We showed that even in weakly collisional plasmas, the dynamics is well-modeled by simpler mathematical models such as magneto-hydrodynamics.  Our results help explain observations of the black hole at the center of our own Milky Way galaxy.  Attached is an image of our calculations in this regime.  Our work has advanced our understanding of these important astrophysical systems.  We developed and have made publically available new  numerical codes that can be used to study a variety of problems in plasma physics, these codes have already been downloaded hundreds of times by research groups around the world.  Nearly half a dozen postdoctoral research associates participated in this collaboration, many of whom have gone on to research positions at universities and  the national labs.  We ran a very popular summer school for  undergraduates on numerical methods for plasma physics, with over 100 students from around the country participating.  This project was a major part of the PhD thesis of two graduate students at Princeton, and also supported two undergraduate summer research projects at Princeton (both students involved have enrolled in PhD programs in physics).  Finally, we published numerous refereed papers, gave dozens of research talks and seminars, and to desseminate our results more widely to the public, we created animations, visualizations, and wrote several popular-level reviews on our results.
