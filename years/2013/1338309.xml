<AbstractNarration>This project will provide ground-based optical imaging measurements during the DEEPWAVE field project which will take place in New Zealand in June-July 2014. The DEEPWAVE campaign seeks to understand the generation and propagation of atmospheric gravity waves from orographic and other sources from ground-level up to 100 km altitude, and will use airborne and ground-based instrumentation. This project will utilize a multi-spectral all-sky imager located at Mt John Observatory, New Zealand. It will be underneath several of the planned DEEPWAVE flight-paths. The measurements will characterize the gravity wave field in the mesosphere/lower thermosphere (MLT) and its temporal evolution, and will also yield intrinsic gravity wave parameters such as horizontal and vertical scale-sizes, momentum and energy fluxes prior to, during, and after DEEPWAVE flights.&lt;br/&gt; Data will be disseminated via a website at Boston University and the CEDAR and MADRIGAL databases, as well as to the general public via press releases and informal outreach. The project will be carried out in collaboration with scientists from New Zealand.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The aim of this project was to investigate mesospheric gravity wave (GW) occurrence during the DEEPWAVE campaign. The DEEPWAVE campaign was a collaborative research campaign held during June-July 2014 in New Zealand (NZ) and involving ~100 researchers from several countries (United States, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia). Its mission was to investigate the prediction, generation, and evolution of gravity wave activity from ground level up into the regime of space near 100 km altitude.</p> <p>The campaign featured the NSF/NCAR Gulfstream-V (GV) aircraft which undertook ~20 flights during periods of predicted and known tropospheric GW activity in order to investigate their characteristics and evolution. A large array of ground-based instrumentation complemented the GV observations.</p> <p>This particular project utilized two Boston University all-sky imagers, located at Mt. John Observatory and Lauder station in NZ, to obtain 2-D all-sky imagery of GW&rsquo;s in the four brightest mesospheric nightglow emissions: OH at 87km altitude, Na at 90km, O<sub>2</sub> at 94km, and O<sup>1</sup>(S) at 97km (see Figure 1). During the night-time, several narrow layers of nightglow occur in the mesospheric and lower thermosphere (MLT) (80-100km altitude) due to chemoluminescence. Each layer is the results of a different atomic or molecular species and their narrowness allow to be used as dynamical tracers.</p> <p><strong></strong>Analysis of the images yielded horizontal and vertical scale-sizes, propagation direction, emission brightness, wave amplitude, momentum and energy fluxes, flux divergence, and temporal evolution information associated with each GW event. &nbsp;</p> <p>Most importantly, the momentum flux estimates will quantify the GW flux divergence, and hence wave momentum and energy deposition rates, in the ~85 to 100 km altitude region. In addition, they will provide an independent ground-based validation of the estimates obtained by other DEEPWAVE colleagues during the campaign.</p> <p>The investigation yielded several outstanding results. Three particular results will be described.</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">1). 21 June 2014 Event</span></strong> A large standing mesospheric GW, the first ever seen over NZ, was characterized. Figure 2 shows the evolution of large breaking waves in hydroxyl emission from near 87 km altitude over the South Island of NZ. The waves appeared to be associated with a large-scale upwelling of air from below. Estimates of the momentum flux associated with the OH waves near 85 km showed large values of 150-300 m<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-2</sup>, almost two orders of magnitudes larger than typical values (1-20 m<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-2</sup>), and an unexpected result. Slightly higher, near 95 km, the momentum flux was found to be lower (40-60 m<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-2</sup>), suggesting that the waves had deposited their momentum and energy at the lower altitude.</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">2). 30 May 2014 Event</span></strong> A large standing wave formed around the landmass of NZ. In other words, the effect of the NZ landmass was communicated at the 80-100 km altitude region (Figure 3). The wave structure was analogous to a ships wake. Similar to 21 June 2014, this event exhibited very large values of momentum flux (50-345 m<sup>2</sup>s<sup>-2</sup>).</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">3). 30 May 2014 and 19 June 2014 Events</span></strong> We found evidence of dynamic wave coupling extending from the 80-100 km altitude region up to 250 km altitude. During periods of GW activity, unusual GW activity was also observed in the thermospheric emission of atomic oxygen centered near 250 km in altitude. Previous work has shown that these types of waves are associated with secondary GW generation due to breaking waves at lower altitudes. In the case of the 30 May 2014 and 19 June 2014 GW events in the MLT region, GW breaking was observed to occur and secondary GW&rsquo;s produced by that breaking wave activity propagated up into the thermosphere. The direct imaging of such behavior appears to be unique to the NZ region and importantly it indicates that the transport of energy to higher regions occurs with a frequency and intensity previously unknown. A large number of these types of events have now been identified.</p> <p>The DEEPWAVE campaign was the first and most comprehensive yet to investigate the characteristics and that into the role that gravity waves play in transporting energy and momentum from the earth&rsquo;s surface into the upper atmosphere and also into the space regime. The DEPWAVE results also indicated that the GW&rsquo;s reaching the upper atmosphere exhibit very large quantities of momentum and energy. This result has important implications for understanding energy transport throughout the entire atmosphere, a topic that is still poorly understood.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/26/2017<br>      Modified by: Steven&nbsp;M&nbsp;Smith</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1338309/1338309_10287558_1488139744364_MJ--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1338309/1338309_10287558_1488139744364_MJ--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1338309/1338309_10287558_1488139744364_MJ--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1.
