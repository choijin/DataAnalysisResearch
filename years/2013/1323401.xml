<AbstractNarration>This TUES Type 2 project is establishing the Center for Infrastructure Transformation and Education (CIT-E) as the centerpiece of a community of practice.  The aim is to facilitate the transformation of undergraduate civil and environmental engineering programs by incorporating infrastructure topics into their existing curriculum.  This project builds upon the sophomore-level courses and other modules on civil infrastructure developed by the Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) Department of the University of Wisconsin-Platteville and the Civil Engineering program at West Point Military Academy.  The six collaborating institutions are of varying sizes, student population, and settings (Arizona State University, New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, Norwich University, Portland State University, Rowan University, and University of Toledo).  The project objectives are to: 1) establish and sustain the Center for Infrastructure Transformation and Education (CIT-E) as the source for infrastructure education materials that can be continuously improved by a community of practice, 2) develop educational expertise in infrastructure topics and in pedagogy in faculty at collaborating institutions, 3) deliver, assess, and institutionalize infrastructure-themed courses or modules for CEE and other majors at collaborating institutions, 4) enhance the ability of CEE students to view components and systems designed in CEE sub-disciplines as integral parts of the larger infrastructure system, and 5) enhance the ability of CEE students to view infrastructure challenges from a societal, rather than solely technical, perspective. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project employs a creative model that engages collaborating faculty in roles of content creators and module maintainers of the infrastructure-themed course material to develop and sustain the community of practice.  In addition, a structured plan to facilitate the adoption and institutionalization of infrastructure curricular material at the six collaborating institutions, and provide faculty development and support is used.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than 500 students and fifteen faculty at eight diverse institutions, including some with large numbers of underrepresented minority students, are directly impacted by the project activities, increasing the number of students and faculty with knowledge and expertise in sustainable infrastructure topics.  A community of practice centered on CIT-E and multiple faculty development workshops is employed to facilitate the dissemination and adoption of the curricular material and practices developed in this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This TUES award created a learning community of civil engineering educators at a dozen US universities to create new curriculum and a new understanding of how engineering students learn about infrastructure as a complex system.  The Arizona State University contribution created a simulation game played by 468 different students in 16 different play-testing environments on four different campuses.  The game focused on the difficulty of managing an ageing water distribution infrastructure, given the need to balance three, inter-related objectives: 1) minimize costs, 2) maximize reliabilty, and 3) maintain public approval.  During repeated play, student come to understand that the interrelated nature of these three variables makes a single correct, optimal, answer impossible.  Rather, students gain an understanding of adaptive management that balances all three competing interests.  The game has proven successful at engaging student interest, promoting active and team-based leanring, and improving understanding of the mechanisms of infrastrcuture funding and ageing.  Students at the Naval Post Graduate School, Arizona State University, Purdue University and Univeristy of Illinois - Chicago participated, and results have been shared throughout the TUES network. Game play revealed that student hold common misconceptions about he operation and financing of infrastrcture and helps instructors diagnosis and correct those misconceptions.  In all, 18 instrutional modules related to different infrastrcture systems were developed by faculty throughout the network.
