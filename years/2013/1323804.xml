<AbstractNarration>The ASCEND research and development project is a collaboration of UC Santa Cruz (several departments) with area museums, municipal government programs in vocational training and local businesses that explores the impact of integrating and comparing two sustainable engineering apprenticeship approaches for at-risk youth -- design-build and digital-storytelling about the design-build experiences.  It applies and expands into informal STEM education a model that UCSC has implemented for undergraduates.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project objectives are: (1) understand how to motivate and prepare at-risk youth for careers in green technology; (2) learn via a research study whether/how digital-storytelling can increase youths' proficiency in STEM, content knowledge and practices; (3) explore how the science museums can be part of a community network addressing project-based learning and local sustainability efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project seeks to better coordinate and leverage existing Santa Cruz green technology and sustainability projects as a basis for preparing at-risk youth for STEM-based careers in the sustainability/green technology field.  The project intends to provide a model for how museums can work with other organizations (in this case, municipal wharfs businesses that employ green design) to create lasting community relationships around sustainable practices and careers.  The feasibility, proof-of-concept study involves approximately 60 at-risk youth, as well as several local professionals and entrepreneurs, staff and visitors at the museums, municipal officials, undergraduate students as mentors and university instructors and researchers in the content domain and in digital storytelling approaches.  Drawing on its findings over the course of the project, the team's intention is to expand the model conceptually and geographically around California and the USA.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Outcomes Report      Apprenticeships in Sustainability Science and Engineering Design (ASCEND), explored whether production of "learner-generated" digital media can add quality and increase participation in sustainability science and engineering. Designed to serve at-risk youth enrolled in public alternative education or vocational training programs, this program was spearheaded by researchers at UCSC and NOAA staff at the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary Exploration Center. We compared learning outcomes for two groups of youth (ages 15-19) involved in sustainable engineering projects. Our hypothesis was that the involvement of youth in "digital storytelling" projects (ie. filmmaking projects featuring green-tech innovation) could create attractive pathways into the Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) workforce for a demographic that is not otherwise well represented in STEM occupations while achieving learning outcomes comparable to youth involved in the hands-on design and implementation (a.k.a design-build) of green technologies and systems.  We also hypothesized that public screenings of youth produced films at informal science learning centers and museums could be used to welcome friends and families of these youth into places they otherwise might not visit. Comparisons focused on skills related to articulating problem statements and  identifying tradeoffs. Data was collected using three types of performance-based learning assessments: pre/post annotated drawing tasks, "audio diary" entries recorded in response to weekly prompts, and semi-structured focus group interviews using video to stimulate recall.   Youth participation: After an introductory training period, approximately 60 participating youth were given options to get involved in either the implementation of a design-build project or the production of a "digital story" documenting the goals, successes, challenges and community impacts of selected projects. Youth worked in teams to complete project tasks in collaboration with undergraduates from the Impact Designs: Engineering and Sustainability through Student Service (IDEASS) program at UCSC with additional support from local professionals.  Youth met with their team mentors for 50-minute sessions approximately twice a week over a 6-month period.   Over a two-year period, hybrid teams of undergraduates and youth contributed to the development of green technologies and produced seven short films about featured projects. See the web site .   Outcomes: Overall, ASCEND demonstrated that digital storytelling is a viable means of incentivizing and preparing youth to pursue careers in the green-tech workforce.  The focus on media production not only provided youth with direct access to projects that might otherwise have been beyond their reach, but authenticated their ability to make valued contributions to these projects. Participation was possible through the use of readily available, low cost mobile technologies/software already familiar to most youth.

Digital storytelling also may be a more convenient way to expand apprenticeship learning to multiple sites and involve more participants due to the relatively low cost of the materials and equipment involved, low risk, fewer logistics and lack of safety concerns as compared to design-build.

The events were organized to promote community-dialogue about the feasibility and impacts of innovations featured in the films or demonstrated on site as well as to generate proposals for new community projects.
