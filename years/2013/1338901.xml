<AbstractNarration>Planning Grant for an I/UCRC for Multi-Functional Integrated System Technology &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1338901 University of Florida; Nishida &lt;br/&gt;1338895 University of Central Florida; Yuan &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vision of the proposed Center "Multi-Functional Integrated System Technology (MIST) is to pioneer the More than Moore" era by translating novel materials, devices, and manufacturing processes into multi-functional integrated systems that yield rich functional diversity compared to traditional integrated circuit platforms. The University of Florida (UFL) and the University of Central Florida (UCF) are collaborating to establish the proposed center, with UFL as the lead institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed Center aims at the innovation beyond Moore's Law. Through iindustry-driven collaborative research initiatives, interdisciplinary mixing and intersectional collisions will be promoted in order to catalyze innovation opportunities such as combinations of computing, sensing, actuation, and energy storage/generation on the same system on a chip (SoC) or system in package (SiP). The MIST Center will lay the pavement on the roadmap to next-generation integrated electronic systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A result of Moore's law is the transformation of the computing platform from the advent of the solid-state mainframe computer to the desktop computer to the laptop computer, and most recently to the tablet computer. Research at the MIST Center will operate at the forefront of this transformation by connecting research advances in materials science, electronics, magnetics, acoustics, photonics, microfluidic devices, MEMS, and circuits to societally relevant technologies with industry guidance. The proposed I/UCRC MIST Center will integrate a strong team of complementary investigators, train the next generation of graduate students who are versed in cutting edge research, actively recruit and introduce participants from underrepresented groups in science and engineering, and team with industrial member companies, governmental agencies, and associations. These exchanges will broaden the perspectives of all involved participants.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The key outcome of the NSF Planning Grant: Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Multi-functional Integrated System Technology (MIST) was to successfully organize and hold the planning meeting for the MIST Center.   The vision of the MIST Center is to innovate "More than Moore" technologies for smart systems in the Internet of Things era by translating novel materials, devices, and manufacturing processes into multi-functional integrated systems that yield rich functional diversity compared to traditional integrated circuit platforms.  Multi-functional integrated systems are typified by the synergistic integration of different materials, length scales, input/output energies, devices, transduction mechanisms, and power sources.  Integrated functionality is a key enabler for the transformative electronic systems of tomorrow, such as contextually aware smartphones, augmented reality displays, and personalized digital medical assistants.  The center seeks to catalyze innovation opportunities at the intersections of multiple emerging technologies by fueling research interactions between our academic, industry, and government stakeholders.  The MIST Center consists of a unique cluster of cross-disciplinary experts at the two founding universities: the University of Florida (UF) in Gainesville and the University of Central Florida (UCF) in Orlando.  Located just 115 miles apart, UF and UCF have the two largest engineering departments in the third most populous state in the U.S.  The faculty participants are a self-assembled group spanning six different academic departments who combine their infrastructural resources and complementary expertise in materials science, electronics, magnetics, acoustics, photonics, microfluidic devices, MEMS, and circuits to tackle complex research challenges that are critical to the development of multi-functional integrated systems.     The MIST Center serves as a resource for industrially relevant fundamental research on materials, processes, devices, and their integration in multi-functional systems needed for smart systems in the Internet of Things era. Considering the growing usage of MEMS accelerometers, inclinometers, gyroscopes, compasses, and microphones in smartphones, individually, each sensor provides a device "feature" to differentiate one smartphone from another.  However, when working together as an integrated system, these integrated sensing/ computation/ communication devices can create entirely new products and markets, e.g. smartphone-based health monitoring.  In partnership with industry and government stakeholders, the mission of the MIST Center is to help catalyze industrially, academically, and societally relevant technologies at the intersection of multiple complementary disciplines (material/ sensor/ actuator/ device/ energy/ circuits) that when integrated can transform smart systems.
