<AbstractNarration>Low-dose inspection for nuclear threats using monochromatic gamma-rays is a novel method to detect shielded nuclear material (SNM) with a potential to significantly outperform currently employed methods. The key advantage of the method we are pursuing is in low dose (&lt;20 mrad), ability for high-speed screening, accuracy in identification of nuclear materials, and relatively low cost and simplicity in design and operation. The advantages are achievable through use of ultra-compact superconducting accelerator technology applied to sources development, which can be tailored to produce multiple monoenergetic gamma rays and/or neutrons. Furthermore, monoenergetic sources coupled with the development of advanced radiation detectors and a new information science-driven approach for system design and data analysis have a potential to create unprecedented performance of the system in view of safety, efficiency and accuracy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The unique and innovative approach to the design is the enabling factor for future SNM detection technologies. Integration of the novel method of monoenergetic source generation through use of a new generation of ultra-compact accelerators with advanced imaging detectors has a potential for a paradigm shift in the ability to rapidly and accurately clear objects from nuclear threats. Moreover, this interdisciplinary work requires a broad combined expertize in the areas of compact hadron accelerators, monochromatic gamma-ray sources, detectors, and algorithms making our team particularly well-suited for the task. This research combines several new and high-risk ideas and, if successful, could bring about revolutionary advances in the methods to detect shielded SNM, with broad impacts and benefits to the welfare and security of the nation and society and promote the diversity and public understanding of science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has as its goal the development of a reliable means for the detection of nuclear materials that could possibly be smuggled as part of a potential terrorist effort.  Such means must consider the practical aspects for detection technologies such that actual systems could eventually be deployed in a field operation. The detection of nuclear materials requires both the localization of the potential threat and confirmation of its nuclear properties.  The current approach uses large high energy x-ray radiography systems.  Although these systems are widely deployed at ports and border crossings, they suffer from problems with radiation dose and lack of specificity in determining which materials indeed represent a threat.  Distinguishing dense materials with these systems requires a very large dose to the inspected cargo since the radiation from such sources covers a wide range of energies, most of which do not contribute to image contrast.     In the work we have done, we have devised a method for producing beams of high energy x-rays which are narrow in their energy spread ("monoenergetic") and as a result simultaneously reduce the dose and increase the specificity of the system. We have done this by replacing traditional large x-ray sources with small particle accelerators which generate the x-rays by means of low energy nuclear reactions which result in the production of intense sources of high energy monoenergetic gamma rays.  The use of monoenergetic gamma rays for transmission imaging provides a means for both high contrast imaging of shielded SNM and the means to confirm the fissile nature of the material.     The physical basis that underlies this technique relies on the large difference between the pair production cross-section for mid and low-Z material and for uranium and subsequently, the large difference in absorption at high energies.[Figure 1] The required monoenergetic gammas (as well as neutrons) are easily produced using small particle accelerators, as shown in Figure 3.  Using simple targets, we produce two intense gamma rays at 4.4 and 15.1 MeV and can distinguish uranium in steel shielding [Figure 4].  At the same time, this approach reduces the dose to cargo and potential stowaways by orders of magnitude compared to traditional techniques (e.g. dual energy bremsstrahlung radiography from high energy linacs).  An extension to this approach is to build somewhat more complex targets to produce three or four monoenergetic gamma rays and then to separate actinides from materials such as lead and tungsten.     For our current work, we have been using the reaction d(11B,n&gamma;)12C.  Using 3 MeV deuterons from a commercial radiofrequency quadrupole accelerator (RFQ), this reaction produces fast neutrons peaking at around 12 MeV (with a broad distribution at lower energies) and, more importantly, intense gamma rays at 4.4 and 15.1 MeV (as well as others at 10.7 and 12.7 MeV).  Using this reaction, we have demonstrated the ability to cleanly distinguish materials of different atomic number such as iron and uranium while still maintain a very low incident dose.  Experimental data [Figure 2] shows the transmission of gamma rays through materials of varying density and atomic number.  Keeping in mind that the absorption at 4.4 MeV is essentially a density measurement (Compton scattering dominant), we see that when absorption is normalized to that at 4.4 MeV, the high Z materials exhibit greater absorption at 15.1 MeV as expected. Figure 3 shows a100 cc U cube (2 kg) in 40 cm Fe block imaged with 15.1 MeV gammas (MCNPX simulation).  We have developed an efficient method for evaluating information rewards in detector arrays. The computation complexity of optimal design is generally prohibitive. The new algorithm, which also generalizes to other settings, reduces this complexity by orders of magnitude. This outcome greatly simplifies the process of near-optimal detector array design while preserving theoretical ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
