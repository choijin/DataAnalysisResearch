<AbstractNarration>Luskin&lt;br/&gt;1310835&lt;br/&gt;Park&lt;br/&gt;1310849&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Through this collaborative proposal, the investigators develop numerical analysis and improved surface Cauchy-Born methods to ensure their reliability and improve their efficiency.  The mechanical behavior and properties of nanomaterials is dominated by the effects of surfaces, whose effects become increasingly important with decreasing nanostructure size.  Surfaces can cause unique, non-bulk mechanical properties, including elastic strengthening (i.e. smaller is stronger) and phase transformations, and can serve as the nucleation point for defects such as dislocations and twins.  Major extensions of the numerical analysis of finite element methods for continuum elasticity and its coupling to atomistic models is required to enable the surface Cauchy-Born methods to accurately compute problems with surfaces (defects) and discrete surface microstructure, because the complex multi-well energy landscape of real nanostructures must be confronted. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Many important future nanotechnologies, such as nanoscale resonant sensors, nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS), and stretchable nanoelectronics, can be improved by a better understanding of how localized nanoscale surface effects impact their effective mechanical properties and reliability.  In particular, the numerical analysis of surface Cauchy-Born methods improves the representation of the key atomic-scale surface physics that govern defect nucleation, elastic strengthening or softening, and the failure mechanisms of surface-dominated nanomaterials.</AbstractNarration>

The improved Surface Cauchy-Born methods developed in this project improve the capability to simulate and understand the key atomic-scale surface physics that govern defect nucleation, elastic strengthening or softening and the failure mechanisms of surface-dominated nanomaterials.  The major outcome of this project was the development of improved Surface Cauchy-Born methods and their numerical analysis to ensure their reliability and improve their efficiency. Numerical analysis and theory-based numerical experiments were used to develop the most accurate and efficient means of incorporating nanoscale surface physics into the finite deformation continuum formulation, including optimization of the surface Cauchy-Born energy, decomposition of the nanostructure into regions requiring atomistic accuracy and regions that can be coarse-grained with continuum modeling, and efficient scaling of the mesh in the surface region.  As prototypical multiscale models, SCB methods were an ideal arena in which to introduce undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers to the most challenging multiscale computational problems in contemporary nanoscale science and engineering.  The PI developed courses, organized seminars, and supervised thesis research that taught students the mathematical and computational foundations that will enable them to contribute to the solution of diverse scientific problems that have too many degrees of freedom and too many time scales for direct simulation methods. This research program naturally led students to question the limits of purely atomistic or continuum models, and to question the fundamental assumptions behind various models for dynamics, and to investigate the general problems of dimensional reduction that are universally found throughout science and engineering.
