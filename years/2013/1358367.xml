<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks partial support for the Phase Transformation and Microstructural Evolution Symposium to be held at the 143rd TMS Annual Meeting &amp; Exhibition on February 16 - 20, 2014, at the San Diego Convention Center in San Diego, California. At this symposium, participation by students and other young investigators will be encouraged as critical to the fostering of future generations of materials scientists and engineers. NSF funding is requested for registration support and/or partial travel support for at least 5 students and 3 post docs or special attendees. The organizing committee of the symposium will identify appropriate students, postdoctoral fellows, or special attendees.</AbstractNarration>
