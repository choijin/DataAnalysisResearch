<AbstractNarration>In-situ analyses of isotopic and chemical composition are critical for documenting spatial heterogeneities within geological samples, and are now commonly accomplished by laser ablation methods. Improvements in laser technology are of current interest to the geochemical community and the potential advantages of relatively new technology has shown some growing pains but holds great promise. This award allows the researchers to evaluate the approaches needed for high-precision stable isotope analysis of major elements using new laser ablation technology by comparing two key laser ablation systems. The research will focus on iron isotopes to rigorously test issues of mass bias, the results of which can be extended to other isotope systems. Iron is also a major element that occurs in most rock-forming minerals, and so it will be of widespread interest to the geochemical community. The results will provide a basis for inter-laboratory comparisons of different methods of in situ analysis. The award will provide training and expertise for a postdoctoral fellow on the physics involved in laser ablation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award funds the development of techniques for the high-precision stable isotope analysis of major elements using laser ablation (LA) and to compare femtosecond (fs)- vs. nanosecond (ns)-LA technologies to understand potential processes of isotopic fractionation during the ablation and ionization processes. The accuracy of fs- and ns-LA for isotopic analysis of iron isotopes will be evaluated due to known isotope heterogeneities at relevant scales. The results will be applicable to other stable isotope systems such as magnesium, silicon, and calcium, and should be extendable to radiogenic isotope systems in terms of mass bias issues associated with fs-LA and ns-LA. The specific research goals are targeted to evaluate the degree to which fs-LA is free of matrix effects and to determine what specific aspects of fs-LA appear to generate matrix free analysis as compared to ns-LA and standard solution nebulization methods. The study will be devoted to measuring the particle size distribution, chemical and isotopic composition, and morphological characteristics (e.g., agglomerates and spheroids) of aerosols generated by both fs- and ns-LA. Moreover, matrix effects will be characterized by using mineral group isotope standards (e.g., minerals such as siderite, ankerite, ferroan dolomite) and addition of elements into the LA aerosol stream by ?teeing? in the aerosol produced from a desolvating nebulizer.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Lasers with different pulse widths (150 femtoseconds and 5 nanoseconds) were evaluated to determine their relative merits for Fe isotope analysis by laser ablation.  Iron isotope laser ablation analyses are typically done on iron oxide and sulfide minerals that behave as semiconductors.  Past work has established that for isotopic analysis of metals such as copper or iron a femtosecond laser is required to avoid isotopic fractionation associated with melting which occurs for lasers with pulse widths that are in the picosecond regime or longer.  In contrast, for insulators, such as most silicate minerals, it has been found that both ns- and fs-LA provide for accurate isotope ratio analyses.  It is unknown how important laser pulse width is for semiconductor substrates.  Lasers were evaluated by characterizing the aerosol produced by laser ablation for their morphology and evaluating the Fe mass distribution and Fe isotope composition of aerosols sorted by their aerodynamic size using a cascade impactor.   The Fe isotope composition of laser ablation generated particles is a function of their aerodynamic size for both femtosecond and nanosecond lasers and this highlights the importance of quantitative transport of the aerosol from the ablation cell to the mass spectrometer source.  Overall, it appears that both femto and nanosecond pulse width lasers are able to produce accurate Fe isotope analyses but based on the variability in the particle morphology and size distribution, as a function of substrate and laser fluence, nanosecond laser ablation requires careful standard matrix matching as compared to femtosecond laser ablation which produces similar particle morphology and size distribution as a function of laser fluence and substrate mineralogy.  Moreover, fs-LA stoichiometrically samples the substrate under all laser and substrate conditions investigated whereas ns-LA does not stoichiometrically sample the substrate under low fluence conditions.  Differences in morphology and particle size distribution of aerosols produced by fs-LA versus ns-LA are best explained by the extensive heating and melting that occurs during nanosecond laser ablation  Heating during femtosecond laser ablation is very minor.     The broader impacts of this study includes the scientific training for a graduate student and a post-doctoral fellow in methods of laser ablation and aerosol characterization.  Moreover, these studies can be used by other workers to evaluate what laser pulse width is most important for their laser ablation studies.
