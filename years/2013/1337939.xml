<AbstractNarration>1337939&lt;br/&gt;Levinson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A state-of-the-art desktop scanning electron microscope (SEM) system will be purchased for faculty and undergraduate students at Lafayette College to conduct research and design projects and to expand research training in both engineering and the sciences. This instrumentation will extend the research concentrations and capabilities of the individual investigators while also facilitating collaborations between departments. In addition to its high-quality and high-resolution imaging capability, this user-friendly instrumentation is equipped with electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) for compositional analysis and employs a suite of software applications that provide compositional mapping, three-dimensional surface roughness reconstruction, and fibermetric analysis, all of which are integral to the described research activities. The system also includes a variety of sample holders that permit a diverse array of materials to be imaged at different orientations. The instrumentation provides analysis that is critical to the thorough understanding of the dimensions, form, and function of the objects being studied. Application areas include the study of materials, lab-on-chip or optoelectrical devices with submillimeter components, geological samples, and biological and/or bioengineered systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Summary: The primary goal of this project was to acquire a state-of-the-art desktop scanning electron microscope (SEM) system for faculty and undergraduate students at Lafayette College, and integrate the use of the instrument into faculty-led research projects and the undergraduate curriculum in both engineering and the sciences.  The Phenom ProX Desktop SEM system and accessories were purchased from Nanoscience Instruments, Inc and installed at Lafayette College in January 2014.  The system is equipped with electron dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) for compositional analysis and employs a suite of software applications that provide compositional mapping, three-dimensional surface roughness reconstruction, and fibermetric analysis, and includes a variety of sample holders that permit diverse materials to be imaged at different orientations.  The instrumentation provides analysis that is critical to the thorough understanding of the dimensions, form, and function of the objects being studied.  Application areas include the study of engineered materials, geological and environmental samples, and biological tissues.   Intellectual Merits:  This instrumentation has extended the research concentrations and capabilities of the individual investigators, as well as enhanced the opportunity for interdisciplinary collaborations across campus.  Since installation, the instrument has been used by at least eight faculty members in four different departments at Lafayette College.  The acquisition of the SEM has enabled micro- and nanoscale imaging of an array of novel engineered materials that have been developed at Lafayette, including biomimetic and thermoresponsive polymeric fiber matrices and synthetic hydrogels for tissue engineering/drug delivery applications, 3D printed composite materials, and polymer blends fabricated from recycled materials.  Additionally, the SEM has allowed for the chemical and microstructural characterization of regional rock units and soil samples, as well as volcanic products (lava, pumice, ash, minerals) from Alaska and Iceland.  Finally, the SEM has been utilized for characterization of the morphology and microstructure of diverse cellular systems and biological tissues.   Collectively, the SEM has been instrumental in furthering the investigator?s understanding of structure-function relationships in engineered materials, diverse geological processes spanning many geographical locations, and correlations between physical and chemical properties in biological systems.   Broader Impacts: The instrument has also been integrated into the curriculum of multiple courses in the Natural Sciences and Engineering, exposing 50-100 undergraduate students to SEM imaging and analysis per academic year.  Further, the instrument has been used extensively by faculty-led research projects that have engaged undergraduates in hands-on use of the SEM for diverse scientific applications.  These research projects include senior honors theses, full-time summer research projects, research for academic credit.  The results of these projects have been presented to diverse audiences at Lafayette and professional regional/national scientific conferences, as well as disseminated via peer-reviewed manuscripts.  Students involved in undergraduate research at Lafayette are typically inspired to pursue advanced degrees and research-related professions in both academia and industry, and experience with the SEM has provided valuable exposure to state-of-the art analytical instrumentation as they prepare for their post-undergraduate endeavors.
