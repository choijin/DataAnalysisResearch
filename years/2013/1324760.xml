<AbstractNarration>Our dynamic landscape evolves as sediment travels a path through mountain slopes, rivers, and deltas in events like landslides, floods, and hurricanes. In nature, these processes typically occur over vast length and time scales, making them difficult to study directly.  Laboratory sedimentary experiments enable improved control and observation of these Earth-surface processes. However, such investigations often occur in isolation, and there is little if any coordination for our scientific community. We will form a Sediment Experimentalist Network (SEN) to help integrate the efforts of sediment experimentalists and build a knowledge base for guidance on best practices for data collection and management. We will also facilitate cross-institutional collaborative experiments, and communicate with and educate the research community about data and metadata standards for sediment-based experiments. This effort will improve the efficiency and transparency of sedimentary research for field geologists and modelers as well as experimentalists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Major outcomes from SEN will be 1) creation of a Knowledge Base (SEN-KB), 2) coordination of Experimental Collaboratories (SEN-EC), and 3) integration of Educational efforts and Data standards development (SEN-ED) with tools for propagating new technology and methods. SEN-KB will be a collection of online resources for management and discovery of experimental data, metadata, analysis tools, methodologies, and other user-driven needs. SEN-EC will pilot infrastructure to foster multi-laboratory collaborations on experiments addressing broad and interdisciplinary grand challenges that are difficult to solve in a single laboratory: 1) extrapolation of experiments to natural systems and theory, 2) comparability of experimental results from disparate facilities, and 3) decoupling of external versus intrinsic processes observed in experiments. SEN-ED will provide training for data management through workshops and outreach for collecting and sharing experimental data. The project will facilitate access and use of new and existing data for a wide range of users in the experimentalist community and beyond toward modelers and field geologists.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>With millions of dollars in recent investments and a proliferation of accessible technologies, research in experimental Earth-surface processes and subsurface stratal development is in a data-rich era that is rapidly expanding. The community is conducting an ever-increasing number of experiments at larger scales and finer resolutions than before. However, sediment experimentalists typically conduct research with one-of-a-kind experimental set-ups, isolated from other experiments, creating data that is difficult to manage, share, and access, and they rarely used beyond their original purpose. We organized the community to build the Sediment Experimentalist Network (SEN) and a centralized, web-based resource to increase the visibility of laboratory facilities and to leverage data beyond its original purposes. SEN has worked towards three major goals: 1) creating a SEN Knowledge Base (SEN-KB), 2) coordinating a set of Sediment Experimental Collaboratories (SEN-EC), and 3) educating the community, especially young scientists, with workshops in data management and related technological issues (SEN-ED).</p> <p>SEN-KB has collected online resources for the management of discovered experimental data, metadata, analysis tools, experimental methodologies, and other topics as driven by user need. The SEN-KB website, comprised of a data catalog and wiki, currently hosts 171 entries by more than 150 registered users. The centralized knowledge base has promoted more efficient communication and has resulted in collaborations based on experimental data previously too narrow in scope.</p> <p>SEN-EC uses the power of multiple experimentalists and their facilities to address single problems by dividing them up into smaller pieces. Live broadcast equipment for multi-laboratory experiments was installed at Nagasaki University, The University of Texas at Austin, University of Wyoming, and UC Berkeley?s Richmond Field Station. We conducted collaborative experiments designed and set up by users and participants at workshops held in Nagasaki University in Japan in 2013, Utrecht University in the Netherlands in 2014, University of Colorado, Boulder in 2016, and Tsukuba University in Japan in 2017. The experiments and collected data were broadcasted and shared, fostering new interactions and collaborations.</p> <p>SEN-ED provides trainings, particularly to young geoscientists, through workshops, Town Hall meetings, and the Summer Institute on Earth surface Dynamics (SIESD). We focused on improving data management and curation, leading to increased clarity in data management plans for our proposals. SEN-ED published a paper in Geomorphology and a summary article in the Society of Sedimentary Geology (SEPM) magazine,&nbsp;<em>The Sedimentary Record,&nbsp;</em>which provide guidelines for data and metadata standards and the collection and storage of experimental data.
