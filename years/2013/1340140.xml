<AbstractNarration>1340140&lt;br/&gt;Bowman, Katherine W.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The suite of new analytical, computational, communications, and other technologies on which researchers draw may have implications for the tools, facilities, human capital, and other forms of architecture that enable the life sciences to progress.  The proposed scoping meeting will provide the foundation for a new series of activities to address systematically the implications of these tools and technologies in the changing nature of the life sciences. The understanding gained from these activities will in turn have important implications for how life sciences research is best organized, conducted, and supported. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of the proposed meeting is of significant interest to NSF, particularly to the Divisions of CBET and MCB, as it will help in developing funding strategies for future developments in life sciences and its derived biotechnologies.  Therefore, the meeting will be co-funded by both divisions.</AbstractNarration>

The project "Enabling Architecture for the Next Generation of Life Sciences Research" supported a small meeting that brought together scientists from academia and national laboratories along with representatives of agencies and foundations interested in advancing the life sciences. The meeting discussed transformations taking place in the life sciences, the components that might form part of a coherent vision for the "architecture" that underpins the field, and what is needed to enable and support the life sciences of the future. The meeting and a subsequent discussion document are part of an effort to think strategically about the evolving structure of life sciences research and to learn about key developments and key challenges from scientists in the community. The project may provide a foundation for further activities designed to address some of the issues raised.
