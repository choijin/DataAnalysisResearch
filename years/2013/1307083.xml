<AbstractNarration>We  study the interaction of attosecond pulses, which last for less than one femtosecond, with matter. In particular, we study the interaction of short (ultraviolet) wavelength (ultraviolet) attosecond pulses with matter subjected to a delayed  laser pulse with a much longer (near infrared) wavelength. These near-infrared-extreme untraviolet (nir-xuv) pulse pairs are automatically available when attosecond radiation is made by the strong &amp;#64257;eld process of high harmonic generation. These two-color pulse pairs have a wide variety of uses, from attosecond metrology to the control of strong &amp;#64257;eld processes such as multiphoton ionization. The short duration of the pulses and the strength of the applied &amp;#64257;elds dictate that accurate calculations require a nonperturbative solution of the laser-matter interaction, which we achieve by direct integration of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation. The work is directly relevant to ongoing collaborations between the principle investigator and experimental groups at the forefront of strong &amp;#64257;eld physics and attosecond science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Attosecond light allows us to study and manipulate atomic, molecular and biological processes at sub-femtosecond time scales, yielding new ways to understand and control matter via its interaction with light. The basic research on attosecond physics supported by this project will broaden the U.S. knowledge base on attosecond science.  The research will result in the training of graduate students and postdoctoral research associates in the interdisciplinary &amp;#64257;eld of atomic, molecular and optical science. They will gain a broad education in both atomic physics and high intensity laser science, and a thorough understanding of both the theoretical and experimental issues involved. They will also receive training in advanced numerical simulations, with applications to a wide variety of problems in government and industry. The research topics supported by the grant will be incorporated into the PI's teaching of time-dependent quantum dynamics at both the undergraduate and graduate levels.</AbstractNarration>
