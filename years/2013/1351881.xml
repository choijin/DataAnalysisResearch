<AbstractNarration>CBET-1351881&lt;br/&gt;PI: Yaguo Wang, University of Texas at Austin&lt;br/&gt;CAREER: Ultrafast Phonon Dynamics in Complex Nanostructures: Systematic Investigation with Ultrafast Phonon Spectroscopy and Femtosecond Thermal Reflectance Technique&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phonons are quantized lattice vibrations and the major heat carriers in many crystalline materials. Our scientific understanding of phonons lags behind that of electrons and photons, mainly because of the difficulties in measuring and manipulating individual phonon. In bulk materials, the phonon transport is purely diffusive and governed by Fourier's Law. In nanostructures, phonons can travel ballistically, scatter at boundaries, interfaces and nanoparticles, and can be localized by quantum confinement effects. When different nanostructures are integrated together, phonon dynamics becomes exceptionally complicated. This research will investigate individual phonon behavior in complex nanostructures with ultrafast phonon spectroscopy and femtosecond time domain thermal reflectance technique. The effect of different nanostructures on specific phonon modes will be examined in detail through a systematic introduction of boundaries, interfaces, nanoparticles, and quantum wells into the material. Phonon lifetime and group velocity will be characterized for specific phonon modes with the ultrafast phonon spectroscopy, and the effect on macroscopic thermal conductivity will be measured by time domain thermal reflectance technique. Quantitative information will be provided about the effects resulting from the degree of lattice-mismatch, superlattice period, nanoparticle size, type and concentration, and the interplay of these mechanisms. The results will be used to validate the predictions from numerical and theoretical studies and bridge the gap between macroscopic thermal property measurements and microscopic phonon properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will address the fundamental heat transport problems encountered by researchers in a wide variety of disciplines: thermoelectrics, quantum cascade lasers, infrared detectors, and nanoelectronics. The new discoveries obtained from this study will be integrated into both graduate and undergraduate courses.  This project will prepare next-generation leaders in thermal sciences, ultrafast optics, material science and physics. Outreach activities will include demonstrating research findings in pre-college programs focused on K-12 students, and providing research opportunities to undergraduate women mentored by graduate women.  This project will also enhance diversity at University of Texas at Austin by actively recruiting graduate students from under-represented populations, such as women and minorities.</AbstractNarration>

Along this line, our efforts are mainly focused onto two areas: (a) coherent phonon excitation and detection with femtosecond coherent phonon spectroscopy and (b) thermal conductivity characterization. This CAREER project generated 13 journal publications, more than 10 presentations and one provisional patent application.</p> <p><strong>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Coherent phonon excitation and detection.</strong> Femtosecond (10<sup>-15</sup>s) laser could excite phonons with well defined phase relation, of which the atoms vibrate collectively, instead of randomly. Coherent phonons provides good (and probably the only) physical model to study the dynamics of individual phonon mode. We studied the coherent phonon transport in a wide range of semiconductor nanostructures. In GaAs/AlAs superlattice (Fig.1), we observed quantum coherent coupling between phonons, which may result in phonon entanglement, in a similar to photon entanglement for quantum communication. In Bi<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>/Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub> superlattice (Fig. 1), we measured the high-frequency coherent thermal phonons and provided direct evidence of phonon filtering effect by superlattice interfaces. In Bi nano-films, we used coherent phonons as a probing tool and discovered a thickness-dependent transition from low-symmetry to high-symmetry structure. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio of coherent phonon detection, we also developed a surface plasmon based technique and demonstrated an enhancement of acoustic coherent phonons in Au nanofilm.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Thermal conductivity characterization.</strong> Thermal properties affect the reliability and performance of devices. Optical techniques provide a non-contact tool to measure thermal properties. We successfully developed two new techniques for thermal properties characterization: (<strong>i)</strong> A thermal grating imaging technique that is capable of measuring thermal properties along both in-plane and cross-plane directions (Fig. 2a). By simply imaging a metallic phase mask onto the sample surface, we generated optical gratings of both heating and probing laser beams on the sample surface. We demonstrated this new technique by measuring the thermal conductivities of copper nano-films and GaAs/AlAs superlattice (SL). This technique can be integrated into any thermoreflectance system with ease. A provisional patent application based on this technique was filed by the UT OTC [UT Docket No. 6878 Wan]. (<strong>b)</strong> A picosecond thermoreflectance system (ps-TTR) that provides fast measurement with a delay time of up to one millisecond (Fig. 2b). This ps-TTR system utilizes a low-repetition rate (1kHz to 10kHz) picosecond laser as the heating source and a continuous wave (CW) laser as the probe. The CW probe eliminates the need for a mechanical delay stage and enables fast detection with a photodiode (500ps resolution) and digital oscilloscope. We demonstrated the capability of this new system by measuring thermal conductivities in a wide variety of materials. This ps-TTR system could be built up for less than $50K.</p> <p>Furthermore, we successfully integrated a high pressure Diamond Anvil Cell (DAC) into our ps-TTR system to study thermal behavior of materials in extreme environment (Fig. 2c). Characterizing materials? thermal properties in extreme environment (high temperature, pressure, etc) is important to maintain the reliability of space crafts and engines. Until now, thermal properties of most materials in extreme environment are estimated with theoretical models, because traditional devices for thermal characterization cannot survive in such environment. A DAC device can generate hydrostatic pressure as large as 100GPa by exerting force onto two pieces of diamonds facing with each other. We observed a 7X enhancement of cross-plane thermal conductivity in MoS<sub>2</sub> from 3.5 W/mK at ambient pressure to about 25 W/mK at 15 GPa, which corresponds to about 9% compressive strain (Fig. 2d).
