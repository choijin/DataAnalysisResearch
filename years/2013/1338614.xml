<AbstractNarration>A collaborative team of investigators from Michigan State University and the University of Idaho is working with instructors and students in interdisciplinary environmental science programs (IESPs) to conduct systematic, critical analysis of ethical concepts in the context of interdisciplinary environmental science. IESPs have multiplied in post-secondary and graduate curricula in response to pressing environmental problems. Ethical considerations are of immense importance in addressing environmental topics, because they often involve value judgments and the ethical issues involved are complex, multi-faceted, and high-stakes. Yet, ethics education materials for graduate IESP courses have not kept pace. This education and research project is developing an approach to graduate ethics education in IESPs that can better prepare the next generation of environmental scientists to solve complex problems. Materials development is being guided by two pedagogical commitments: (a) a constructivist paradigm that recognizes the social and collaborative nature of learning; and (b) a commitment to problem-driven models of education. A structured, yet flexible, framework is being created to enable development of course modules that can subsequently be adopted for use in classroom dialogue, building on results of work previously funded by NSF (the Toolbox Project - NSF award #0823058). The framework consists of materials for instructors and students that help them identify contexts in their IESP where ethical dilemmas generated by value judgments are likely to occur. The framework has two dimensions, corresponding to "content" and "method". The "content" concerns value judgments that relate to (a) the conduct of interdisciplinary scientific research, and (b) the impact of interdisciplinary environmental science on societal needs and policies. The "method" engages students, as teams or groups, in critical, conceptual analysis of value and policy aspects of their own practice as scientists and engineers. Students in courses using these modules will participate actively in identifying and assessing values-related challenges that are at the intersection of multiple environmental perspectives and at the intersection of science with policy. In addition to developing this framework, the project team is conducting a rigorous evaluation of its effectiveness for facilitating better consideration of ethical issues in IESP courses. Dissemination of the framework broadly through presentations and publications will strengthen interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate education and will also provide professional development opportunities, ethics training, and mentoring for graduate research assistants.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project, "Collaborative Research: Values and Policy in Interdisciplinary Environmental Science: A Dialogue-based Framework for Ethics Education," involved researchers from Michigan State University, Oregon State University, and the University of Idaho in developing and evaluating a curriculum to teach social ethics to interdisciplinary environmental science graduate students. We understand 'social ethics' to refer to ethical issues and values that are intrinsic to the practice of science as well as those that are extrinsic to the practice, such as the appropriate relationship between science and policy making. The curriculum is designed to be adaptable to different environmental science contexts, yielding different implementations depending on the thematic focus of the program.</p> <p>Graduate students who work through the curriculum are taught to investigate the values and policy aspects of their specific interdisciplinary environmental science context. It was designed with input from a national survey of interdisciplinary environmental science instructors that revealed the need to train future environmental professionals to appreciate the different values, different forms of knowledge, and contentious decisions that arise when one addresses complex problems that involve stakeholders (Hall et al. 2017). Influenced by the results of this survey, the project team developed a curriculum that includes the following elements:</p> <ul> <li>An introductory lecture that can be adapted to any interdisciplinary environmental science course context</li> <li>Case studies with supporting materials designed to help the students understand the values and policy aspects of their specific environmental science context</li> <li>Materials designed to help the students tease out particular values and policy commitments that may divide them from one another as they examine the concerns that arise in their context</li> <li>A dialogue method that can be used to structure collective conversation about the commitments identified by the students, modeled on the NSF-supported Toolbox dialogue approach (<a href="http://tdi.msu.edu/">http://tdi.msu.edu/</a>) </li> <li>Follow-up assignments that build on the insights made during the student dialogue</li> </ul> <p>To help instructors and students think about values and policy in their particular courses, we focused the curriculum on four cross-cutting themes that are common across many contexts: expertise, risk and uncertainty, policy constraints, and non-human impacts. The full curriculum and supporting materials are available for free download at the course website (<a href="http://eese.msu.edu/">http://eese.msu.edu/</a>) and the Online Ethics Center (<a href="https://www.onlineethics.org/">https://www.onlineethics.org/</a>).</p> <p>To evaluate the curriculum, we implemented it in five graduate classes at two US universities, and we used a pre-test, post-test mixed methods research design to evaluate its effects on students' ethical reasoning about values and policy. The results of this evaluation suggest that our semi-structured, dialogue-based curriculum enhances student awareness of and reasoning about values and policy in environmental research (Hall et al. 2018). We are currently developing a model-based evaluation metric for use by instructors to assess the impact of the curriculum on student learning.</p> <p>In addition to the dissemination of our findings through presentations, publications, the project website, and the Online Ethics Center, broader impacts generated through the project include the development of two article projects that extend the research into the development of tools for engaged philosophy (Valles et al. <em>Forthcoming</em>) and into the identification of initial assumptions of environmental science graduate students. In addition, two graduate students were provided with professional development opportunities, ethics training, and mentoring. The curriculum has also been adapted for use in undergraduate courses at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley and the University of Dayton.</p> <p>In addition to the curriculum, the project has produced two published papers (Hall et al. 2017, Hall et al. 2018) and one forthcoming paper (Valles et al. <em>Forthcoming</em>). Two remaining papers remain in prep: one that addresses what how early environmental science graduate students envision research-policy decision making, and the other that summarizes the project as a whole.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Publications</span></p> <p>O'Rourke, M., Hall, T.
