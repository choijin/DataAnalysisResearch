<AbstractNarration>1346751 &lt;br/&gt;Ukeiley&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding is being  provided to facilitate participant travel to the American Physical Society, Division of Fluid Dynamics, 66th Annual DFD Meeting 2013 in Pittsburg, PA, November 24-26, 2013.  This is the largest international annual meeting of fluid dynamicists in the world, with 2,500 anticipated attendees.  The meeting has been successfully run for over sixty years.  The priorities of the travel grant program are to partially fund students, young scientists, and, in general, scientists from under-represented groups.   The APS DFD Executive Committee plans to contribute $15,000 and the American Institute for Physics plans to contribute $10,000 to the overall budget for travel awards.  This total amount expected is $45,000 to facilitate travel subsidies and registration fee coverage for about 65 participants.  The chief intellectual merit of this conference lies in the exchange of scientific ideas, presentations of cutting edge research, and exposure to a richly diverse array of topics in virtually every sub-discipline of fluid dynamics.  The broader impact will be to increase participation of students and young scientists who would not otherwise be able to afford to travel to the meeting and pay associated costs.  Preference is given: (i) to those presenting talks at the meeting, (ii) to students, (iii) to those who have not received such an award in the past, and (iv) to no more than one applicant from a given research adviser.  Since the awards are meant to supplement participant travel funds, not to cover these entirely, the committee takes into account the travel budget entered on the application.  Special effort is made to achieve diverse participation from underrepresented groups in engineering, including women and members of minority groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This funded effort was used to grant supplemental travel awards to the American Physical Society 66th Annual Division of Fluid Dynamics Meeting which was held in Pittsburg Pennsylvania on November 24-26, 2013.  The goal of this effort was to facilitate a means for broader participation of students and young scientists in this international conference which covers a wide range of fluid dynamics and is typically the largest meeting of fluid dynamicist in the world.  The APS Division of Fluid Dynamics External Affairs Committee which consisted of 8 appointed members, solicited the applicants from conference website and received approximately 230 valid applicants.   The committee evaluated the applicants based on a prescribed series of conditions which included those presenting talks at the meeting, students, those who have not received such an award in the past, etc&hellip;.  From the applications 40 recipients of a $500 travel supplement were selected by the committee.  All of the awardees were students at US institutions with 36 graduate students and 4 undergraduate students.    The students came from 33 different US institutions and were limited to one per research advisors group.  All of the students presented contributed talks at conference allowing them to gain exposure at one of the premier fluid dynamics conferences in the world.
