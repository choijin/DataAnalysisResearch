<AbstractNarration>This cross-cultural research investigates cultural models (CMs) of nature held by populations across several cultures and five continents ranging from long-time primary food producers, e.g., farmers, fishermen, herders (and also hunters and gatherers) to those who recently shifted to become primary food consumers due to globalization forces. CMs of nature, typically held out of one's or a community's awareness, affect environmental actions in ways not necessarily predicted by more traditional ecological models. The project comprises fifteen scholars and six graduate students who are experts in a particular cultural area. Linguistic and experimental data will be collected and analyzed by a common protocol that combines qualitative and quantitative approaches. Methodology and ethnography play paramount roles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Researchers expect to discover a variety of CMs of nature that characterize each community investigated. These CMs represent specific organizations of the constitutive categories underlying the concept of nature, that is, humans, animals, plants, weather, physical environment, and the supernatural. They also expect causal relationships to be one of the major forces (in addition to spatial relationships) weaving together these categories. Similarly, while attributed to different elements and in a different potency, intentionality will be universally present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results, because of the focus on primary food producers, will provide insights on how this kind of population typically constructs a CM of nature. In addition, one can explore the possibility that conceptions of space are central to the construction of CMs (in this case, of nature), thus, provide supporting evidence for an architecture of the mind that includes a major role for the spatial domain in the forming of other domains of knowledge. Finally and more importantly, the findings are intended to supply policy makers, i.e., major actors in finding solutions to climate change induced problems, with information on indigenous CMs of nature that will assist them in their decision-making.</AbstractNarration>

I was entrusted with collecting both qualitative and quantitative data on Lithuanian farmers on this topic. As an anthropologist my goal is not to dictate to people what they should do or think, nor to prepare questionnaires and obtain responses. Rather, one of my aims was to spend time with them, to walk and talk with them and have them tell me what they think and do.  The questionnaires and interviews complement these more informal ways of collecting data.  Hopefully the formal and informal, qualitative and quantitative methods converge to yield holistic, reliable and valid results.    We (three assistants and I) conducted fieldwork studies in different areas of Lithuania with large and small farmers (ranging between 5-1500 acres).  All the work with the farmers was conducted in Lithuanian. I speak, write and read Lithuanian sufficiently well to get by but usually relied on an assistant to clarify "rough spots" and nuances in responses. We used freelisting methods, interviews and a method referred to as "the animals-in-a row task."  The goal was to obtain an emic as opposed to etic perspective of the farmersÆ conceptions of themselves vis-&agrave;-vis nature and farm work. An emic perspective refers to what is meaningful to them and how they view the world around them and their actions in it. The etic view refers to an external "experts" conceptions of what is and is not important.  The freelist questions ask farmers basic questions such as "what farming tasks do you do?" "What crops do you grow?"  "What do you think about climate change?" and so on.  They then provide a list of answers and these are compared across farmers to see if there is some kind of cultural pattern or consensus. Most of the interview questions are derived directly from the responses of the farmers and thus continue in the emic vein.  The "animals-in-a-row" task is etic.  That is it is not something "natural" to the farmer and there is already an algorithm for analyzing the data. This task goes as follows: we present the farmer (or any subject) with three plastic farm animals&ndash;a pig, horse, and cow.  We put them in a row &ndash; tail to head &ndash; and ask the farmer (or any subject) to look at it; we then turn 180 degrees and ask the farmer to place the animals in a row in the same order they originally saw them. There are two main ways of ordering the animals, one is "absolute" in which the animals are put in the same order as previously (say east to west). The other way is to take into account the "turning around" and order the animals with regard to their placement relative to ego (left to right).   The "relative" method suggests that the sequencing depends on egoÆs perspective and so ego or the "self" is of central importance in determining the "correct" order. In the absolute method, the self is not taken into account. Thus the relative method tends to be associated with individualistic societies in which nature is viewed as distinct from the individual, while the absolute method tends to be prevalent in more "traditional" societies where people are viewed as embedded and part of their environment.  Our results for the animals-in-a-row task were that 71% (n=153/215) of the time farmers used the absolute methods, seeing themselves in nature rather than acting on nature.  The freelisting results showed that farmers have two fairly distinct views of nature: firsts as a place to rest and reinvigorate themselves, to enjoy the clean air, family and barbecues; and second as an economic resource that depends mostly on their knowledge of farming. All farmers said that they worked long hard days, but none complained about their work and all saw it as meaningful&ndash;they are entrusted with feeding the nation. Most said that one is born to be a farmer, it is in your blood, thus it is not purely an econom...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
