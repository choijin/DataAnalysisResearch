<AbstractNarration>1360810&lt;br/&gt;Larson&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports development of code that hopes to allow for reliable, automated, remote detection of plumes of erupted volcanic ash and gas using extant global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers installed at locations around the world that are proximal to active volcanic systems (e.g., the Aleutians, Iceland).  Most extant continuously operating GNSS receivers that have been installed around the world are used for detection and quantification of subtle (mm) or not so subtle (m) position changes caused by tectonically, seismically, volcanically, surface load or subsurface fluid dynamics-forced deformation of the Earth? crust.  In preliminary analyses of GNSS signal to noise ratio observations at stations proximal to volcanoes with a known record of eruptive ash cloud activity, the PI has demonstrated the feasibility of the technique for detection of plumes.  This project will further develop and test algorithms to automatically detect volcanic plumes using GPS signal strength data and will rely on GNSS data taken from hundreds of sites over multiple years to establish the precision of retrievals. The sites will include U.S. GPS and Russian GLONASS capable satellite receivers from various manufacturers.  The results will be validated against scanning radar observations of volcanic plumes in Alaska and Iceland.  The performance of different receivers will be catalogued to provide feedback to volcano scientists seeking to implement GPS plume sensing networks.  In addition to developing code for GNSS detection of volcanic ash plumes, the project will involve forward modeling of GPS data in an attempt to link GPS signal strength observations to ash concentrations and particle size.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Having another observational modality in the toolkit for detection of hazardous volcanic ash plumes at marginal cost, given that multiple GNSS networks are operating around the globe with many proximal to active volcanic systems, has implications for the protection of life and property and is of particular interest to mitigating airline hazards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>GPS instruments are frequently deployed by Earth scientists near volcanos. Data from these instruments are used to measure deformation of the Earth&rsquo;s crust, thus providing valuable constraints on changes going on in the magma chamber and subsequent eruptions. In 2013 it was shown that GPS signals that travel through a volcanic ash plume are lower in power than normal signals. This suggests that data from GPS instruments located near volcanos could be used to improve hazard warnings needed for aircraft safety and public health. This project evaluated this new data source to investigate several recent volcanic eruptions. We initially focused our research on eruptions of Redoubt Volcano in Alaska and Mt. Etna in Italy. We demonstrated with the Alaskan data that GPS data are sensitive to two important parameters &ndash; how rapidly the ash is moving in the plume and the initial time of the eruption. These data are used by the Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAAC) to forecast potential ash levels around the world. These warnings are particularly important for aircraft safety. The Etna data were used to validate the method by comparison with data collected by radars and seismometers. More recently we extended our analysis to include the 2018 crater eruptions at Kilauea, Hawaii. Two major and one minor ash plumes at Kilauea were detected. These GPS ash plume detections are particularly valuable as the technique works day and night.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/30/2018<br>      Modified by: Kristine&nbsp;M&nbsp;Larson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
