<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;#1351110&lt;br/&gt;Eric J. Seibel&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this EAGER project a new engineering design for an endoscopic medical device is proposed.  This new approach will allow a working channel to be included within an ultrathin and flexible endoscope of 1.7-mm diameter. Instead of shrinking the conventional endoscope of separate channels for illumination, imaging, flushing, and biopsy; the new approach will place an ultrasmall imager at the tip of a working channel that provides flushing and biopsy. This new approach is transformative for clinical imaging and critically helpful for accelerating the development of optical biopsy.  The working channel will provide the key requirements of fluid exchange and tissue vacuum, biopsy, and retrieval. Testing will involve  the biopsy apparatus, which is suction of the epithelial mucosa into a cutting chamber that is connected to the proximal end for biopsy retrieval. The biopsy apparatus will be modified in an iterative manner using test results from a synthetic phantom and ex vivo pig lung. The integrated microendoscope and biopsy apparatus will be fabricated and tested for endoscopic guidance to specific sites for biopsy. Fluorescently labeled cells and microspheres will be injected into the luminal wall so that accuracy as well as adequacy of the biopsy will be the quantitative milestones.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Flexible endoscopes and bronchoscopes are inserted into the openings of the human body, such as the mouth to enter the upper GI tract and the lungs.  Since modern flexible endoscopes use cameras that guide a working channel, the size of the camera and working channel can limit the diameter of the endoscope and how far the scope can extend in the narrowing airways.  Typically, the smallest flexible endoscopes are 3-mm in diameter, thus limiting access of the biopsy device to take samples of cells and tissue in the smaller airways.  At the University of Washington (UW), we have developed an ultrathin endoscope or bronchoscope that uses a small optical scanner at the distal tip which allows for smaller overall diameter of the UW scope.  The smaller UW scope provides the ability to enter the more peripheral airways that are currently inaccessible.  In this exploratory project, we are developing the UW scope to provide image-guidance of taking a piece of tissue (biopsy) from a very small airway (roughly 2-mm in diameter).  To accomplish this, we have developed a new design of the 1.2-mm diameter UW scope that uses feedback control to maintain high image quality during the process of taking a tissue specimen for disease diagnosis or future minimally-invasive surgery.  This new design was implemented and tested by a PhD student in mechanical engineering, and upon successful completion, has led to three journal papers and his doctorate degree from the UW.  In addition, a team of undergraduate students developed a lung airway models with silicone tissue that mimic the natural human airways in the periphery of the lung.  The undergraduate student team and a research engineer tested their 1.7-mm diameter prototype UW scope with associated new biopsy tools in both the synthetic model and animal tissues.  These tests are ongoing in future versions of the UW scope.  The intellectual merit of this work is demonstrated by the validated new design of the UW scope that allows continuous high-quality imaging while a tissue specimen is being removed.  This is critically important for providing safety and efficiency to the physician performing the minimally-invasive procedure, such as taking a biopsy for performing personalized medical treatments.  Because the ultrathin and flexible scope can reach many more places in the human body and perform image-guided diagnosis and treatment, there is more access to minimally-invasive medical procedures.  Thus, less open surgeries are required which requires much longer hospital stays.  Importantly for medical research using animals, no longer does an animal have to be sacrificed for monitoring new drugs and therapies if the ultrathin and flexible scope can be used repeatedly in the same animal.  The broader impacts of this exploratory project are to provide physicians and surgeons with a new high-performance minimally-invasive scope that can be used safely on small children.  Previously the smallest and most flexible scopes did not have the high-quality imaging of the UW scope; and now from the results of this project, are new capabilities of adding the biopsy tool without sacrificing imaging performance.
