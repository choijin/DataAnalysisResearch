<AbstractNarration>Technical description: The goal of this project is to test three models of faunal change in response to biotic and abiotic forcings during the transition to the modern grassland ecosystem in the Great Plains over the last 4.5 My: the Red Queen, the Court Jester, and the Equilibrium Theory of Island Biogeography. In doing so, we will answer four specific research questions: 1) Do long-term changes in local habitat or climate control taxonomic diversity dynamics? 2) Does climate change associated with the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation at 2.5 Ma impact diversity dynamics or the ecological structure of communities? 3) How do catastrophic events (major ashfalls) impact diversity dynamics and ecological structure of communities? 4) How are immigrant species accommodated in the ecological structure of the contemporary community? We will analyze diversity dynamics with an existing database of species occurrences in the Meade Basin, SW Kansas in relation to reconstructions of local paleoecology, paleoenvironment, and paleoclimate.  We will characterize ecological structure of communities with body sizes estimated from tooth dimensions and trophic categories reconstructed from carbon isotope compositions of tooth enamel using laser ablation isotope ratio mass spectrometry and a novel combination of morphometric analyses based on high resolution microCT scans. Interpretation of paleodiet proxies will be constrained by isotopic and morphometric analyses of modern species with known diets and habitats from existing museum collections and live trapping in grasslands around Meade, KS. Paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic reconstructions will be based on a comprehensive suite of proxies measured on paleosol carbonates and bulk sediment samples collected in stratigraphic association with known fossil sites and major ashfalls: carbon isotope ratios of bulk organic matter, carbon and hydrogen isotope ratios of leaf wax n-alkanes, lignin phenol ratios, plant phytolith assemblages, carbonate clumped isotope paleothermometry, and paleosol elemental geochemistry and mineralogy. Paleoclimate proxies and isotopic data will be compared to output of regional scale, isotope-enabled paleoclimate simulations under various forcings. Finally, we will construct ecological niche models for modern mammal species and genera in the region and use paleoclimate model output to test how climate change may have forced range shifts and taxonomic turnover in the Meade record.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical description: Understanding the origin of modern communities is a fundamental goal of ecology, but reconstructing the history of communities that include species with stratigraphic durations on the scale of hundreds of thousands to millions of years necessarily requires data from the fossil record. Similarly, inferences about the paleoecology of past communities are most robust when informed by data from both living and fossil populations of extant species. Despite the logical connections between ecology and paleoecology, relatively few studies have bridged the gaps in the characteristic observational timescales and methodologies of these disciplines to achieve a comprehensive view of the long-term evolution of specific modern communities.  The need to bridge these disciplinary gaps is increasingly pressing in the face of anthropogenic climate change and uncertainty about the magnitude and direction of responses by local communities. This project will examine the ecological, environmental, and climatic context of the origin of the modern small mammal community in the grasslands of the central USA over the last five million years. We will test the effects of both biological and non-biological factors on long-term taxonomic turnover and ecological change in a stratigraphic sequence of local communities using a combination of ecomorphology, biogeochemistry, paleoclimate modeling, and biogeography. This project will link evolution, ecology, and paleoecology with biogeochemistry to trace the emergence of a modern ecosystem over geological time.</AbstractNarration>

To do this, we first used a comprehensive suite of biogeochemical, paleoenvironmental, and paleoclimatic proxies measured on sediments and fossil soils through the study interval.

The geochemistry of fossil rodent teeth through our study interval shows that rodents in the area did not shift their diet to include more warm season grasses as these became more abundant on the landscape through time. Instead, typical diets mostly included parts of herbs, forbs, shrubs, and possibly cool growing season grasses, although the species at each site varied considerably. As a comparative framework, we generated large datasets of the same geochemical indicators of diet for modern rodent specimens live trapped in the study area and from museum collections from sites across the Great Plains. For modern rodents, we found dietary patterns more or less  indistinguishable from those of fossil rodents in the region over the  last 4.5 million years: the modern specimens also on average do not rely heavily on warm growing season grasses, even when those comprise 80% of the local native vegetation, but are quite variable locally. Thus, rodents have maintained a similar distribution of diets through time in southwest Kansas over the last 4.5 million years to the present even as the structure of habitats changed by an increase in the abundance of warm season grasses. Finally, we used high resolution CT scans of the skulls, jaws, and teeth of modern rodents from North America to develop quantitative methods to estimate diet category and body mass from 2D and 3D measures of tooth shape and size. Using six a priori diet categories, we can use tooth shape to assign diet type with 90% accuracy. Rodent teeth are morphologically very diverse, so traditional methods of estimating diet from tooth shape that work for other groups of mammals cannot be applied for all kinds of rodents. Additionally, we can use various measures of tooth size to estimate body mass with better than 95% accuracy. As rodents are the most speciose group of living mammals and constitute a large fraction of fossil mammal species over the last 65 million years, our new paleoecological methods will be useful tools in future studies. Overall, our results suggest that long-term local environmental changes, at least as archived in the sedimentary rock record of our study area, may not be the primary driver of changes in ecological structure of the rodent communities we analyzed and that major, unpredictable environmental disruptions such as major ashfalls possibly drive rapid changes in community structure in terms of taxonomic composition from one stable state to another.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/19/2018<br>      Modified by: David&nbsp;L&nbsp;Fox</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
