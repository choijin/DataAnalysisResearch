<AbstractNarration>The principal investigator will investigate problems in functional analysis, specifically on the geometry of Banach and metric spaces. The proposal keeps its focus on the asymptotic version of the Ribe program. The PI is interested in general metric spaces and seeks to identify  classes of Banach spaces that are closed under specific sets of maps. The PI has done some interesting work and much more is expected from this project. These constitute the intellectual merit of the proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topics treated in this project make contact with many areas of analysis and areas outside of analysis, including operator theory, group theory, geometric analysis, and theoretical computer science, and these constitute part of the broader impacts of the proposal. Furthermore, the principal investigator is a member of various committees who goals is to either create a dialogue with undergraduate students or  help improve their learning condition.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Many aspects of modern life can be modeled by distances between certain objects.  For example, two webpages can be considered to be close or far apart depending on the numbers of links to go from one page to the other one.  The study of objects and the distances that connect their elements is called metric geometry.  (In this sense, the internet as described above is a metric example of a geometric object.)     Classical geometry, both the finite and the infinite-dimensional versions, has been studied for a long time, and has a wealth of classical results.  The present project played a role in an active line of research that strives to formulate classical geometric properties in purely metric terms.  The project especially focused on infinite-dimensional geometries, and on techniques called asymptotization.     The technical outcomes of the project can be described in connection with two metric geometries.  The first one is the metric tree, where distance is the number of steps to go from one node to another.  By considering another more complicated construct, the project showed that a classical linear geometric space, called a space with property beta, where balls are nicely rounded in an asymptotic sense, cannot cover a metric tree in a way that controls distances.  In other words, a map that goes from the beta space onto the tree must eventually distort distances.  The project also found that the quantitative version of this result is more subtle.     The project also obtained results on a second metric geometry called the diamond.  In this aspect, the project focused on the asymptotization technique, and defined a new linear geometry that gave another asymptotization of nicely round spaces.  The project proved that these new asymptotizations are actually new spaces, different from beta, and that as opposed to trees, the metric spaces of interest to study them are the metric diamonds.  The project's study of these new spaces gave both linear and metric results.     The project's outcomes provided a new store of techniques and results that connect classical linear geometry with metric geometry.  While strengthening the mathematical activities in this field of research, these results also at the same time added to the body of knowledge that other applied sciences, such as for example computer science or economics, could potentially use to approach problems in their areas.     The PI has disseminated these research results to the appropriate venues.  The PI has also supported mathematical activities on a wider scope such as for example, on a professional level, by co-organizing a mathematical conference; at the academic level, by serving in a scholarship committee at the PI's institution to encourage young math majors; and at the community level, by providing free math help.
