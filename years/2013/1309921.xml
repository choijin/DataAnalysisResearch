<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to develop a novel wireless surgical camera system to enhance &lt;br/&gt;and improve surgical procedures for single incision laparoscopic surgery. The camera system can &lt;br/&gt;be inserted into a body cavity via an incision or a natural orifice for the operation instruments, &lt;br/&gt;which eliminates the need for dedicated incisions for laparoscopic cameras and the shared use of &lt;br/&gt;an incision for surgical instruments. The key innovation of the insertable camera is the design of &lt;br/&gt;a semi-spherical driving unit driven externally by a specially designed magnetic stator with &lt;br/&gt;varying thickness of tissue insulation. The design addresses the challenges in anchoring and &lt;br/&gt;manipulating single or multiple camera systems inside body cavities during surgical operations &lt;br/&gt;by elegantly coupling manipulation and navigation functions into the semi-spherical driving unit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is the technological and theoretical bases for a new class of wireless &lt;br/&gt;laparoscopic cameras that consist of an in vivo rotor and an ex vivo stator for single incision &lt;br/&gt;laparoscopic surgery. The innovative design enables precise translational and rotational control &lt;br/&gt;of laparoscopic cameras, and the estimation of critical depth information of the surgical scene &lt;br/&gt;and instruments for hand eye coordination.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are the societal benefits to patients by reducing unnecessary muscle cuts and &lt;br/&gt;scars, blood loss, hospital stay duration, post-operative pain, and recovery time. This project also &lt;br/&gt;provides education and outreach activities to undergraduate and graduate students by innovative &lt;br/&gt;teaching and project design modules, and demonstration activities at local K-12 schools and &lt;br/&gt;youth summer camps.</AbstractNarration>
