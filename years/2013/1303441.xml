<AbstractNarration>As a capacity building effort to increase the pipeline of women security professionals, this project is working to build momentum toward a movement of proactive efforts to diversify the cybersecurity workforce. For the first time, Women in CyberSecurity (WiCyS) conferences are being organized. It is a unique effort to bring together women from different levels in academia, industry and government to promote recruitment, retention and progression of women in cybersecurity. Tennessee Tech University is leading this collaborative partnership with the National Centers for Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education at the University of Memphis and at Jackson State Community College. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Apart from orchestrating the WiCyS conference, project activities include: development and deployment of "Discovering Cybersecurity" workshop for raising students, awareness of and interest in cybersecurity careers; development and deployment of "Facilitating Active Learning in Cybersecurity" workshop for faculty professional development, post-conference research apprenticeship in security for students; networking and mentoring platform through WiCyS online community. The project is assessing how its various activities contribute to increase: undergraduate women's awareness of and interest in pursuing further study in cyberseccurity, faculty expertise using active learning strategies to teach cybersecurity, female students' participation in security internships and security research experiences and female students' recruitment into the CyberCorps: Scholarship for Service Program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is to provide substance and practice that has the potential to be continually used to increase awareness as well as capabilities of a greater cybersecurity workforce, with special emphasis on women who are underrepresented in computing fields and especially in cybersecurity. Full participation of a diverse workforce is crucial to integrate more creativity and multi-perspective problem solving to shape technology in cybersecurity. As a part of the expected broader impact, this project contributes to increase in the ability of the United States higher education enterprise to produce diverse group of cybersecurity professionals.</AbstractNarration>

The WiCyS Annual Conference is limited in size and is focused on bringing together students who aspire to have a career in cybersecurity with those who are already in the field. An equal balance of participation from academia, industry, and government provides significant opportunities to network, deliver hands-on workshop sessions, share cutting edge research, and support conversations to expose and resolve discrimination and unconscious bias toward women and minority groups in the cybersecurity profession.  The Conference meets several criteria of broader impact.  The Conference provided learning and mentoring opportunities for high school students, college students, graduate students and postdoctoral students, as well as junior faculty.  It stimulated the interest of students in research experiences and provided a professional development opportunity for computer science teachers.  It broadened the participation of women and minorities in computer security through both recruiting new women and minorities into the field and helping to maintain those already in the pipeline through support and mentoring systems.  The Conference helped to enhance the infrastructure for research and education by establishing collaborations among researchers in industry and academic institutions.  The Conference also provided an opportunity for other NSF projects to broaden their dissemination to teachers and industry.  Through strengthening the pipeline for computer security, the Conference also provides benefits to society by enhancing national security through strengthening cybersecurity.  During the past year, WiCyS began its transition toward a self-sustaining non-profit with 501(c)(3) status.  WiCyS has created a Governing Board of Directors and developed its Bylaws.  According to the Bylaws, ?the specific purpose of the corporation shall be to support recruitment, retention and advancement of women in the professional field of cybersecurity, help increase the number of women security professionals and improve diversity in the cybersecurity workforce. WiCyS brings together women (students/faculty/researchers/professionals) in cybersecurity from academia, government and industry for sharing of knowledge, experience, networking and mentoring.?   In its new role as a non-profit organization, WiCyS is expanding on the Annual Conference to offer the following essential activities:  A WiCyS membership community (so far 2,700 have joined to be WiCyS members) Maintenance of the public WiCyS online community (so far 2100 people are on the listserv) A WiCyS Job Board, where members can post and partners/sponsors can recruit for jobs. A WiCyS Speakers Bureau, where members can sign up to be invited speakers to be connected to various events/conferences. WiCyS Student Chapters, which are provided guidance and seed funding (so far close to 40 chapters have been established) Local or regional WiCyS Affiliates, where members come together in periodic meetings to support outreach, awareness and advancement of peers (so far, one affiliate has been established and two are underway)   The WiCyS initiative contributes to increase in the ability of the United States higher education enterprise to produce a diverse group of cybersecurity professionals.
