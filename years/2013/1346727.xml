<AbstractNarration>This award facilitates scientific research using the large, new, computational resource named Blue Waters being deployed at the University of Illinois. It provides travel funds to support technical coordination between the principal investigators, the Blue Waters project team and the vendor technical team.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaborative award to Pennsylvania State University and Princeton University formally links high-resolution astrodynamics design and coordination of space assets with  Earth science impacts.  This is accomplished through the project's petascale many-objective global optimization framework.  The multidisclinary research team will exploit Petascale global sensitivity-based model diagnostics to evaluate the predictive fidelity of the astrodynamics and Earth system models, and allow visualization of design tradeoffs. With Blue Waters, the project's research aims to transform the scale and scope of systems-of-systems engineering design challenges that can be explored. From the design cognition perspective, this use of Blue Waters  will radically advance ability to discover and visualize optimal many-objective satellite constellation design tradeoffs that include Earth science applications.  In this case the research will demonstrate the planning framework on Blue Waters using Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM). GPM provides a highly challenging design benchmark that has strong links to Earth science through its (1) 4-D characterization of freshwater availability, (2) improved characterization of the microphysical properties of precipitation events, (3) improved climate predictions based on enhanced estimation of surface water fluxes, (4) high value operational data for numerical weather prediction, and (5) global enhancements in hydrologic prediction and management of floods, droughts, landslides, and hurricanes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the US and Europe, there is a critical deficiency in the in-situ Earth observations needed to monitor floods and droughts. In the developing world, water managers are reliant on future satellite observations and in particular on satellite-based precipitation information. The proposed framework will strengthen our ability to serve this critical need by providing a specific evaluation of how candidate GPM designs can potentially improve our ability to use satellite data for flood assessment, drought monitoring, and assessing water availability in large river basins.  The project will also be used in the training of 15-25 demographically and geographically diverse graduate PhD students from engineering, computer science, mathematics, statistics, operations research, and the Earth sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ [1] Scientific Goals for Blue Waters  This project is advancing a petascale planning framework that is broadly applicable across space-based Earth observation systems design. We have made substantial progress towards three transformative contributions: (1) we are the first team to formally link high-resolution astrodynamics design and coordination of space assets with their Earth science impacts within a petascale "many-objective" global optimization framework; (2) we have successfully completed the largest Monte Carlo simulation experiment for evaluating the required satellite frequencies and coverage to maintain acceptable global forecasts of terrestrial hydrology (especially in poorer countries); and (3) we are initiating an evaluation of the limitations and vulnerabilities of the full suite of current satellite precipitation missions including the recently approved Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission. This work will illustrate the tradeoffs and consequences of the GPM missionÆs current design and its recent budget reductions.   [2] Accomplishments   Our hypotheses related to passive control have required high fidelity astrodynamics simulations that account for orbital perturbations, which dramatically increase serial design simulation times from minutes to weeks if done serially. This project has completed the first 10,000 member Monte Carlo global hydrologic simulation at one degree resolution that characterizes the uncertain effects of changing the available frequencies of satellite precipitation on drought and flood forecasts.  The simulation optimization components of this work have set an initial theoretical baseline for the best possible frequencies and coverages for global precipitation given unlimited investment, broad international coordination in reconfiguring existing assets, and new satellite constellation design objectives informed directly by key global hydrologic forecasting requirements.  We can categorize our project accomplishments to date within three foci: (1) scalable many-objective design optimization benchmarks, (2) advances in the use of high-fidelity astrodynamics simulation to permit passive control (i.e., minimum energy satellite constellations), and (3) benchmark the effects of reduced frequencies of satellite-based precipitation on global drought and flood forecasting.  1. With respect to many-objective design evaluation, we have completed the largest and best benchmark in terms of search quality and scalability for our teamÆs underlying optimization algorithms. The results were made possible by the Blue Waters Friendly User period access. At 524,288 cores, our search approaches theoretically ideal performance. These results are the best benchmark ever attained for the challenge problem of focus and provide a strong foundation for our future tradeoff analyses.  2. In the context of passive control, our preliminary results focus on the patented four-satellite "Draim" constellation. Our Draim results reveal that carefully optimizing an initial orbital geometry to exploit natural perturbations (e.g., effects of sun, moon, etc.) to maintain continuous global coverage performance as a function of elevation angle. This minimizes propellant and station keeping requirements to dramatically reduce mission costs while increasing mission duration. The Draim constellation represents a stepping stone to the more complex suite of global precipitation missions that will require the analysis of more than ten satellites.  3. We are one of the first teams to show how limits in satellite-based precipitation observations propagate to uncertainties in surface runoff, evaporation, and soil moisture at distinctly different locations globally. Our results are based on the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) global macroscale land surface model at 1.0&deg; spatial resolution. For each realization of the VIC ensemble, each model grid cellÆs satellite precipitation is resampled at different temporal resoluti...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
