<AbstractNarration>This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the NeTS program in the Division of Computer and Network Systems in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering, and the Directorate for Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will design and build "The Optical Turing Machine" (OTM) a digital device that computes using a optical data modulation format compatible with long-distance, high-speed transmission to support terabit-per-second. It integrates computation and communication by computing with the same symbols used for transmission, which enables native optical processing of network data while avoiding costly optical-electronic-optical conversion or modulation format conversion (e.g., serial to parallel). Specific to the NSF INSPIRE program, OTM explores in-network high-speed processing that necessitates concurrent cross-disciplinary development across networking, computation, and optical devices.  It involves new perspectives on modulation to support computation, the transformation of algorithms into serial architectures and system design based on the needs of networking within the constraints of optical capabilities that cannot be developed from any single vantage point or focus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OTM motivates research in serial computation, algorithms in higher-order logic, homomorphic transforms, new methods for big data analysis, and new active optical devices. OTM benefits society by enabling faster communication and computation at potentially lower power and complexity, supporting enhanced in-network capabilities for privacy, error correction, and packet services at rates far in excess of those capable by current electronic processing. If successful, it also provides an opportunity to reexamine the fundamental assumptions of several decades of attempts at optical computing. Cross-publication across both CS and EE will enhance this effect.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit: The project advanced knowledge and appreciation of the duality between communication and computation as both relate to data transmission, storage and processing. Its analysis led to new approaches of "compute-friendly" signal regeneration and for improved understanding of the critical need for hybrid optical integrated circuits (combining passive devices, reactive nonlinear devices, and active phase-aligned laser sources).  Broader Impact: The project demonstrated the benefit of integrating research in networking, computational theory, digital logic, and optics. It provides a distinct alternative to bio-inspired and quantum approaches as a way to overcome the limits of Moore?s Law in improving computer performance. Its examples may lead to improved computer networking, operating at higher speeds and including privacy and security far beyond current approaches.
