<AbstractNarration>CBET-1336659&lt;br/&gt;Bischof&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Vitrification or freezing to a ?glassy? rather than crystalline phase, is a form of biopreservation and an important enabling approach for cellular and regenerative medicine.  In principle, this approach offers the powerful ability to store and transport cells, tissues and organs which can be used in biomedical labs, biological banking organizations and companies worldwide.  Unfortunately, practical application of vitrification has been limited to smaller systems such as cells and thin tissues due to diffusive (heat and mass transfer) and phase change limitations. Specifically, devitrification (crystallization) and cracking during thawing preclude the use of vitrification in bulk systems such as organs and larger tissues. To circumvent this fundamental problem we propose here to use radiofrequency (RF) excited magnetic nanoparticles (mNPs) to create uniform heat generation within biomaterials thereby avoiding size or boundary condition dependence which can lead to failure during thawing.  As a part of this work, we will characterize the heating and phase change behavior of mNP-laden cryoprotective solutions. This will include selection of cryoprotective agent (CPA) and mNPs (magnetic nanoparticles), physicochemical characterization of these solutions (i.e. thermal and magnetic properties, aggregation, and devitrification), and RF thawing measurement and modeling to demonstrate improvements over traditional approaches. After characterizing the mNP CPA solutions we will investigate the impact of more uniform and rapid thaw on biological outcomes. Here the solutions will be loaded into cells and tissues by diffusion or perfusion, then these loaded systems will be assessed by imaging, staining and other analytical approaches to demonstrate where the CPA and mNPs have loaded. Further, the critical cooling and warming rates necessary to vitrify during cooling and avoid devitrification or cracking upon thaw will be determined. Finally, improvements to the viability and structure of these systems by avoiding devitrification and cracking after RF excited mNP thawing will be demonstrated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the potential to dramatically improve biomaterial vitrification and therefore biopreservation which impacts cell banking and therapies, tissue transplantation and other important regenerative medicine and biomedical applications worldwide.  Our approach will yield faster and more uniform thawing rates that are expected to improve both viability and structural integrity upon thawing of biopreserved systems. The most dramatic opportunity of this new technology will be use for larger biomaterials where devitrification and cracking routinely result in preservation failures, and where faster thaw rates may also help reduce the amount of potentially toxic CPAs needed. More broadly, the proposed research will lead to greater understanding of the interactions of NPs within frozen and vitrified biological systems, with potential applications that go beyond biopreservation.  The research undertaken will provide educational opportunities for several graduate and undergraduate students and collaboration with both academic and industrial colleagues.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award investigated the use of radiofrequency excited iron oxide nanoparticles to rewarm vitrified bulk systems to improve cryopreservation of larger tissue systems.  This involved both intellectual merit and broader impacts.     Intellectual Merit (This abstract is from our recent paper in Science Translational Medicine paper which acts as a nice summary of work done towards achieving our goals):     Vitrification, a kinetic process of liquid solidification into glass, poses many potential benefits for tissue cryopreservation including indefinite storage, banking, and facilitation of tissue matching for transplantation. To date, however, successful rewarming of tissues vitrified in VS55, a cryoprotectant solution, can only be achieved by convective warming of small volumes on the order of 1 ml. Successful rewarming requires both uniform and fast rates to reduce thermal mechanical stress and cracks, and to prevent rewarming phase crystallization. We present a scalable nanowarming technology for 1- to 80-ml samples using radiofrequency-excited mesoporous silica&ndash;coated iron oxide nanoparticles in VS55. Advanced imaging including sweep imaging with Fourier transform and microcomputed tomography was used to verify loading and unloading of VS55 and nanoparticles and successful vitrification of porcine arteries.

In aggregate, these results demonstrate new physical and biological evidence that nanowarming can improve the outcome of vitrified cryogenic storage of tissues in larger sample volumes.    Broader Impacts:  This highly interdisciplinary work with a diverse group of students and collaborators from mechanical engineering, chemistry, radiology, biomedical engineering, physiology and surgery involved the research training of multiple graduate students and post-doctoral students.   The work also involved a collaboration with Carnegie Mellon for the solid mechanics aspects of the work.  It has been broadly disseminated to several journals including Science Translational Medicine, Cryobiology, Journal of Biomechanical Engineering, Molecular Pharmaceutics, Magnetic Resonance in Medicine and Technology.  Several undergraduates and high school students have participated in experiments and studies in the lab during the course of this funding.  Furthermore, the investigators and students have disseminated this work widely through seminars, workshops and invited and contributed talks at numerous scientific and other meetings.  The PI was the conference chair for the successful NanoEngineering in Medicine and Biology meeting sponsored by ASME (http://www.asmeconferences.org/NEMB2015/).  The PI also participates in several academic exchange programs with Germany (University of Hannover) and China (Xi?an Jiaotong) and is actively engaged in translation of this technology to company partners.
