<AbstractNarration>Sulfur is a ubiquitous element on Earth. Because it exhibits a wide range of valence states, sulfur can behave as an electron acceptor or donor and thus is a potent driver of redox reactions, dictating the mobility of metals and serving as an energy source for life. Understanding sulfur geochemistry in the deep Earth is thus critical to understanding the origin of ore deposits, the evolution of oxygen in the atmosphere and marine environment, the pathways of biogeochemical processes, and climate change. As a small step towards better understanding the deep sulfur cycle, these researchers will characterize the sulfur content and isotopic composition of a volcanic arc, from the mantle through the crust.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How sulfur cycles between the endogenic (crust, mantle, and core) and exogenic (ocean, atmosphere, and biosphere) Earth systems is of particular interest regarding the role of sulfur in various redox-driven processes on Earth. The locus of sulfur flux between these Earth systems occurs in volcanic arcs, where mantle melting in the subduction wedge induces shallow melting and ultimate storage or eruption of magma within or through the crust. The goal of this project is three-fold: 1) quantify how much sulfur and what type (sulfate vs. sulfide) is transported via the slab to depths of magma generation in subduction zones, 2) construct the ?stratigraphy? of sulfur from the mantle through the crust in volcanic arcs, and 3) define the average sulfur concentration of juvenile and mature continental crust. From this information the sulfur content and isotopic architecture of an arc from the mantle through the crust can be constructed, with implications for sulfur cycling between the endogenic and exogenic Earth systems. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project was to investigate the oxidation state of the mantle and magmas in the deep parts of subduction zones, with the primary implications being for the origin and transport of volatiles and metals from the mantle to the surface.  Of specific interest is the role of subducted sulfur in controlling the oxidation state of the mantle.  To see through the effects of crustal contamination and degassing, the deepest samples of arc crust were investigated for sulfur isotopes and europium systematics, the former a measure of the source of sulfur and possible redox state of such sulfur and the latter a measure of the europium redox state and oxygen fugacity.  Sulfur isotopes of deep arc crust in two different sections show that the deepest and most primitive crustal cumulates have S isotopic composition identical to ambient mantle, showing no contribution of seawater S.  S isotopic compositions develop a seawater signature during crustal differentiation of magmas.  The deepest samples are found to have negative europium anomalies. These observations indicate that primary arc magmas are not as significantly oxidized as widely believed. These observations suggest that subducted seawater sulfur, in the form of sulfate, may be released well before the arc magmatic front, oxidizing the fore-arc wedge but playing minimal direct role in controlling the generation and evolution of arc magmas. This work suggests that crustal differentiation processes may be important for oxidizing arc magmas as they evolve.       Last Modified: 07/02/2017       Submitted by: Cin-Ty A Lee]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
