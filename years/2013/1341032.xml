<AbstractNarration>1341032 (Webber).   This workshop seeks to facilitate networking and coordination among professional organizations (particularly engineering societies), practitioners, and researchers addressing energy-water nexus concerns and issues. The goal of the workshop is to generate a coherent research agenda that can be used to overcome infrastructure, technical, and societal challenges to implementing solutions that address and mitigate emerging energy-water nexus problems. The workshop will seek to identify research pathways for reducing the water-intensity of providing energy, and the energy-intensity of providing water. The four main specific topics for attention are: (1) managing water demand for the production of power (?water for power?), (2) managing water demand for the production of fuels (?water for fuel?), (3) managing the energy demands of extracting, treating and transporting water (?energy for water?), and (4) managing social, behavioral, policy, and economic structures to enhance water and energy use efficiencies. The workshop will strive to identify the barriers to technology acceptance (whether technical, economic or social) and the research necessary to overcome those barriers. The topics of discussion will include systems integration, materials, component design, information technology, improved processes, social and behavioral sciences, economics, and policy and regulations. The workshop will be organized around introductory talks in each of the theme areas outlining the key challenges and opportunities as they now exist and to provoke further thinking and discussion on current and future needs and how they might be addressed.  Then, the workshop will move to small breakouts, with highly engaged participants submitting their input in facilitated sessions.  Participation in the workshop will be by invitation only.  The workshop is scheduled to be held at NSF on June 10-11, 2013.</AbstractNarration>
