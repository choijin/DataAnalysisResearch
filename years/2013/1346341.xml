<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project?s primary objective is to develop a glucose-responsive platform  for  24-hour delivery of insulin for type 1 and type 2 diabetes, which will cover the patient?s entire daily dose in a single administration.  The company?s drug delivery technology platform is designed to passively deliver the right amount of insulin at the right time.  Successful development of this technology is expected to 1) make basal and prandial insulin obsolete (a projected $32 B market in 2018), 2) reduce the need for constant monitoring and multiple injections per day, 3) improve glucose control, via a self-regulating system that requires no patient intervention post-dose, 4) better protect patients against long-term diabetic complications, and most importantly, 5) give those with diabetes a chance at a normal life.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is substantial. If successfully, the proposed platform could enable hundreds, if not thousands, of other stimulus-responsive medicines. The proposed delivery system can encapsulate many other types of drugs within the core particle system, and we have identified stimulus responsive elements that respond to hypoxia, inflammation, etc. The possibilities are limited only by the imagination of scientists. If medicines are released on a controlled basis, upon other types of stimulus, this technology may open up a world of continually personalized medicine that will substantially improve the health and quality of life for patients worldwide.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF Phase I STTR Project Outcomes Report  Award ID &ndash; IIP-1346341   Principal Investigator: Moradi-Araghi, Michael  Company: Sensulin, LLC    Title: Sensulin AVT: A 24-hour glucose-responsive insulin     Overview:   This report was written to provide a non-confidential summary of the research carried out, the results, and potential outcomes for the public.  Sensulin is developing a Glucose-Responsive Insulin (GRI) for type 1 and type 2 diabetes.    Should we succeed, we may eliminate the need for 4-8 separate insulin injections every day (for type 1 patients), in lieu of one daily dose, taken with breakfast.  For both type 1 and type 2 pateitns, we may also be able to control blood sugar more tightly, with fewer incidences of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar - can be deadly for T1D) and hyperglycemia (high blood sugar - where most of the long-term complications of diabetes arise).  Most importantly, we think that our product can offer patients a chance at a normal life, by eliminating most of the complexity associated with insulin.       Technical Objectives:   The Phase I Technical Objectives were designed to prove that SensulinÃ†s Agglomerated Vesicle Technology (AVT) drug delivery platform is commercially viable for an insulin application, and then attempting to prove that it is safe and effective in a diabetic rat study.       Methods:  Sensulin made hundreds of formulations and ultimately tested 4 in rats, by starting with an injection of our insulin at 8AM and tracking the rats throughout a normal 8 hour work day (for our lab scientists, not the rats), and measuring blood sugar every 15-30 minutes.  One final blood sugar reading was taken the next morning at 8AM.       Conclusions:   Based upon the studies conducted, Sensulin believes that it has met the most important goals of the phase I proposal.  We found four formulations which successfully controlled blood sugar for an 8 hour work day, one of which even worked at the 24 hour time period.  Naturally, we have to repeat this experiment and optimize the formulation further, though if the result stands, it would be the first successful demonstration of a single-dose 24 hour insulin.  Though not a cure, it is perhaps the next best thing for many patients.    It is our hope that Sensulin may soon secure the financing necessary to complete its first-in-human studies, find a commercial partner, and thus have the opportunity for our technology to improve the quality of life for patients with Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes.    We are immensely grateful for the support provided by NSF, the general public who ultimately pays for this research, and the eternal patience of our Program Manager, Dr. Jesus Soriano Molla.
