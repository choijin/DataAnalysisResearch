<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Jonathan Rochford of UMass Boston seeks mechanistic insight into the solar driven production of chemical feedstocks from carbon dioxide.  One such product, carbon monoxide, is a valuable precursor towards further reduced carbon-based fuels as well as syngas, a staring material used in the petrochemical industry. There remain major obstacles to overcome before such multi-electron photocatalysis can be efficiently utilized from single photon initiated processes in molecular systems. In this context, Professor Rochford and his research group designs rhenium(I)carbonyl systems with non-innocent ligands that are capable of efficient light harvesting in the visible spectrum while also displaying strong potential as carbon dioxide reduction photocatalysts.  While rhenium is a precious metal and its supply is limited, this research project repeatedly reuses tiny amounts of the metal to create significant amounts of desired product, making the overall effort more environmentally friendly than current techniques for the production of fuels and industrial feedstocks.  This research is considered under the "SusChEM" initiative as it converts a non-petroleum based feedstock (carbon dioxide) into useful carbon-containing materials.  By combining a rational program of synthesis, electrochemistry, and photophysical analyses, a greater understanding of design strategies towards solar carbon dioxide conversion is developed. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mimicking natural photosynthesis by harvesting the sun's energy towards a sustainable process for fuel production represents one of the grand challenges of science today. This project aids in further understanding artificial photosynthesis and provides multi-disciplinary training for students at UMass Boston. Furthermore, key concepts and findings of this project are integrated into the undergraduate curriculum at UMass Boston to educate future generations of scientists on the importance of utilizing solar energy as our society works towards a sustainable and greener future.</AbstractNarration>
