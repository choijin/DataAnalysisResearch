<AbstractNarration>Introduced, invasive species are known to have negative effects on our native ecosystems, but the mechanisms that drive invasions are not well understood.  One introduced plant now abundant in Eastern deciduous forests, garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), is thought to release toxic chemicals that harm native plant species.  Furthermore, garlic mustard has a longer growing season than most native forest plants, allowing it to take advantage of light during the fall, winter, and spring when natives are dormant.  These mechanisms may reinforce one another if the extra light available to garlic mustard during its extended growing season is used to increase production of chemical toxins. This project will test this hypothesis by measuring the growth, chemical production, and impact of garlic mustard on native species in the presence and absence of extended light availability. Results will help to fill an important gap in our understanding of invasion biology by showing how interactions between mechanisms may increase the invasiveness of introduced species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Invasive plant species threaten native biodiversity throughout the United States, and impose significant economic costs (approximately $137 billion/year). For example, forest invaders such as garlic mustard may inhibit forest regeneration and cause long-term reductions in timber production, recreation, and other services that forests provide.  Understanding the mechanisms that drive invasion will facilitate more effective mitigation and prevention, helping to reduce the environmental, economic, and social costs associated with plant invasions.  This project will also promote the scientific and ecological literacy of undergraduate and high school students participating in the research, and of members of the public reached through a public lecture and a nature center exhibit on the threats of invasive species and the steps that can be taken to protect the biodiversity and ecosystem services provided by our native forests.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Exotic invasive species cause significant ecological and economic harm in the United States.  In order to manage and prevent future invasions, it is essential to understand the mechanisms that drive species invasions.  The invasive plant garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata) suppresses the growth of native plant species in deciduous forests in the Eastern United States.  Garlic mustard likely benefits from several invasion mechanisms, including allelopathy (the release of toxic chemicals into the soil) and extended leaf phenology (having green leaves for a longer period of time each year compared to native plants).  While these mechanisms have been studied separately in the past, a full understanding of invasion requires us to understand how these mechanisms interact with one another.  For example, does having greater access to resources through extended leaf phenology enable garlic mustard to produce higher quantities of toxic allelochemicals?      In a series of experiments designed to test the interaction of multiple invasion mechanisms, we found that garlic mustard benefits from extended leaf phenology through increased growth and survival. There was no clear synergistic relationship between extended leaf phenology and allelopathy. However, further examination revealed that the lack of a strong interaction across many populations was driven by high inter-population variation in responses to light. Some populations increased glucosinolate production with increasing light, while others decreased glucosinolate production. As a result, we concluded that extended leaf phenology may increases allelopathic impact in some populations of garlic mustard, but not others, and further study is required to determine what factors predict garlic population-level responses to light.     Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts: The funded research contributed significantly to our understanding of the drivers of plant invasions in forests of the Eastern United States. The results of this line of research represent a significant extension of the recipientÆs PhD dissertation research, and have been disseminated through five peer-reviewed publications, as well as through several conference presentations.  This project also provided educational opportunities for several undergraduates, including one who completed an independent research project that was presented at the Indiana Academy of Sciences annual meeting in 2014.  Experimental findings and outreach on invasive plants were shared with the general public at educational programs at a local nature center, and results were included in lectures delivered to undergraduate students in an upper-level Ecology course at Indiana University.
