<AbstractNarration>ID: 1359344           PI:  Ubic, Rick                             ORG:  Boise State University&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Title:  REU Site: Materials for Energy &amp; Sustainability&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this 9.5-week REU/RET program is to provide undergraduates and teachers an intensive research-team experience with state-of-the-art facilities while exploring activities within the theme "materials for energy and sustainability."  The projects used to deliver this experience are highly interdisciplinary, allowing students to be exposed to the forefront of science and engineering.  The activities can be broadly categorized as:  energy generation (e.g., photovoltaics, solid-oxide fuel cells, nuclear energy, magnetic shape-memory alloys), energy storage (e.g., sodium-ion batteries), energy conservation (e.g., radiation sensors, energy piles, magnetic semiconductors, nanoelectronics), or sustainability (e.g., atmospheric impacts on watershed).  Participants have their own individualized projects but are also integrated within an interdisciplinary summer research community, training them to both communicate effectively across disciplines and more clearly understand the concepts central to their own work.  Students also participate in a number of supplemental workshops on library resources, intellectual property, ethics, collaboration, and graduate school; and they will ultimately present their results at the annual summer research conference.  A comprehensive assessment program has been developed to gauge the learning and growth of participants as well as their confidence, satisfaction with the REU experience, and the factors which influence their perceptions of the lab environment and research generally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION&lt;br/&gt;Materials science is the enabling technology behind everything from modern electronics to fashion, safe and recyclable packaging, faster and fuel-efficient vehicles, novel energy generation and storage, aerospace propulsion systems, affordable housing, medical engineering, sensors, nanotechnology, and micromachines.  One of the most exciting directions in science and policy-making is sustainability, with its emphasis on energy conservation, storage, and renewable production.  The objective of this Research Experience for Undergraduates program at Boise State University is to provide an intensive research-team experience with state-of-the-art facilities while exploring activities within the theme "materials for energy and sustainability."  The program was created to expose a diverse group of individuals, including Native Americans, African Americans, Hispanic students, and women to the research environment and to help them develop as professionals.  Inclusion of mentors from various disciplines enables students to develop skills needed to excel in both academic and industrial research environments, where interdisciplinary teams are standard.  Students ultimately present their results at the annual summer research conference.  The Site incorporates a Research Experience for Teachers component as well, aiding the integration of research with education and multiplying the benefit to both students and teachers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>During the past three years a total of <strong>32 students</strong> have participated in our REU Site from a pool of <strong>230 applicants</strong> submitted from <strong>37 states plus Puerto Rico and Brazil</strong>, including <strong>32% from female</strong> students, <strong>11% from Hispanic </strong>students, and<strong> 5% from African-American</strong> students.&nbsp; The total participation rate of students from under-represented groups was 44%, and the participation rate of students from institutions where access to research is limited was 66%.&nbsp; The 2016 cohort is shown in <strong>Fig. 1</strong>.<br /><br />The overwhelming majority of student participants had extremely positive research experiences.&nbsp; As just one example, Gabriel Hanson (REU 2015) commented that "to have the chemistry produce something that worked was <strong>one of the best feelings of my life</strong>."<br /><br />All 14 RET participants also had extremely positive research experiences and improved their appreciation of what materials science is, what materials professionals do, and how materials science serves society.&nbsp; One 2016 participant commented that "I enjoyed being integrated as a 'full member' of the lab.&nbsp;<strong> I felt my experience was quite authentic</strong>."&nbsp; Another participant said that "a program like this is <strong>a model for how other STEM fields at BSU could help Treasure Valley teachers</strong>."</p> <p>In a paper the team presented at the 123rd ASEE Annual Conference &amp; Exposition we argued that, on the basis of exit interviews, the summer research experiences helped participants to become <strong>more confident</strong> in their ability to undertake research and develop a better understanding of the research process.&nbsp; The interviews were wide-ranging, and what emerged was that the combination of intensive laboratory work, industry tours (<strong>Figs. 2-3</strong>), career-planning workshops, and social events helped the participants in the REU/RET summer research experience <strong>develop their skills as researchers</strong> and build confidence in their ability to do research (<strong>Fig. 4</strong>).&nbsp; Benefits of participation described by the participants included the opportunity to <strong>apply theoretical knowledge</strong> to the solution of real problems; develop technical and communication skills; learn more about materials science and engineering (for the teachers and students coming from disciplines outside of engineering); and develop strong connections with faculty members, other people working in their labs, and the other participants in the REU Site.&nbsp; Learning how to manage time and complete their research projects in the relatively short timeframe along with dealing with unexpected issues and setbacks presented a challenge to several of the participants that resulted in <strong>personal growth</strong>.<br /><br />The teachers participating in the research experience described an additional set of benefits related to the application of what they had learned to their students and their teaching.&nbsp; These benefits included appreciating the opportunity to work alongside undergraduate students, a greater knowledge of the opportunities available for students and for collaboration at the university, and an increased willingness to <strong>incorporate research experiences in their classrooms</strong>.<br /><br />As anticipated, the RET component added an extra dimension to the REU Site and enabled <strong>outreach</strong> on a scale not otherwise possible.&nbsp; For example, Boise State senior lab engineer Paul Lindquist led a workshop on electromagnetism for 300 8th/9th graders at West Junior High School in Boise (2015 RET participant Arwen Gelsthorpe's school).&nbsp; In addition, Sarah Wright, one of the 2014 RET teachers, presented her research on self-healing concrete to a local group called the Cosmos Coffee Club on 4 August 2014.&nbsp; Now Alison Fielding (RET 2015) is taking her experience to her AP Chemistry students (<strong>Fig. 5</strong>) in a series of guided-inquiry labs in which they synthesize two-dimensional nanoflakes like graphene, molybdenum disulfide, and hexagonal boron nitride.&nbsp; The Micron Foundation donated $1200 in cash plus $2,400 worth of equipment and supplies and worked with one of their vendors, VWR &ndash; a global laboratory supply company &ndash; to secure an additional $1,800 worth of items for her.&nbsp; The funded project leads students through a &ldquo;top-down&rdquo; synthesis experiment in which thin layers of three-dimensional layered materials such as graphite are produced by peeling off atomically thin layers with a liquid exfoliation technique.&nbsp; As a consequence of contacts she made at Hewlett-Packard during the RET, the company is allowing her students free use of their scanning electron microscope to identify the structure of their materials.&nbsp; Furthermore, Heidi Maimer (2016 RET participant) expanded the Discovery Center of Idaho's Zap! exhibition on energy generation transformation, distribution, and use by creating a demonstration of thermoelectric power (<strong>Fig. 6</strong>).</p> <p>In short, we have created a highly effective REU Site at Boise State over the past three years, with faculty participants fully invested in their <strong>mentoring</strong> roles; and we hope to continue and increase the success of the Site over the coming years.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/22/2017<br>      Modified by: Rick&nbsp;Ubic</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div
