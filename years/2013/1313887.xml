<AbstractNarration>PI: Jocelyn K. Rose (Cornell University)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CoPI: Zhangjun Fei (Cornell University)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The application of 'omics' (next generation nucleic acid sequencing, proteomics etc.) approaches in the study of multicellular organisms have generated an enormous amount of data that is difficult to comprehend visually.  This proposal outlines a strategy to create a novel, high resolution graphical interface to display 'omics' data in a scalable format that will allow easy visualization and interrogation in four dimensions (three dimensions through time). In this project tomato fruit development will be studied as a model system to generate tools to project data sets onto a digitized computed tomography (CT) composite image of the fruit and, thereby, create a 4D platform to spatially and temporally examine the regulatory and structural pathways underlying fruit development and metabolism. An important utility of this platform is that it is readily adaptable to any complex multicellular organisms (plants, animals etc.) whose structure is amenable to CT scans.  The specific aims are to (1) generate a digitized CT based profile of tomato fruit development and ripening at the micron and/or submicron level of resolution, (2) develop laser capture microdissection RNA-Seq profiles of the five principal cell/tissue types in tomato fruit pericarp across the same developmental gradient and, (3) create a bioinformatics/analytical pipeline to integrate the data sets derived from aims 1 and 2.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will train two postdoctoral research associates in modern biological and bioinformatics approaches.  If successful, the imaging and RNA-Seq data will be combined with existing proteomic and metabolomic data and made publicly available as a Tomato Expression Atlas, which will be accessible through the Sol Genomics Network website (http://solgenomics.net).  Opportunities for training in the use of the bioinformatics tools developed by the project will be made available at the annual Workshop in Plant Genomics and Systems Biology held at Cornell University.</AbstractNarration>

For example, genes are often described as being expressed in æleavesÆ, æroots, æstemsÆ or æfruitsÆ at particular developmental stages, or in responses to developmental or external signals, but with no additional association with particular cells or tissues that might provide critical functional insights. This challenge is of increasing concern in the current era of rapid DNA sequencing and protein identification (ægenomicsÆ and proteomicsÆ, respectively.

There is thus an æinformation voidÆ when it comes to describing the expression of plant genes and their derivative products that urgently needs to be filled. Moreover, not only are valuable spatial data lost, but lower abundance cellular components that are present only in certain cell types are often diluted below the level of detection, particularly when those cell or tissue types represent a disproportionately small portion of the organ.  This project involved exploring the next frontier of gene functional resolution using laser capture microdissection (LCM), which allows the precise isolation of individual cells/tissue types without loss of cell constituents. LCM technology was used in combination with high-throughput DNA and protein sequencing instruments to study the multiple cell types of tomato fruit æfleshÆ during fruit development development and ripening. Tomato is a commercially and societally valued crop and the development of a resource to promote the understanding of tomato production has clear practical agroeconomic implications, ranging from increasing yield quality and quantity to environmental considerations.  In addition to resolving gene expression down to the level of cell and tissue type, these studies have resulted in: (i) the identification of a relatively large number of previously undescribed genes, demonstrating the value of LCM as a tool for gene discovery; and (ii) the ability to infer the functions of many genes, or at least assign them to a set of functional categories, based on the patterns of tissue or cell type&ndash;related expression.

These high resolution 3D or 4D images are digitized and so provide a means to present the complex gene expression data sets generated through the LCM analyses.  This project has generated a new type of gene expression database, termed the Tomato Expression Atlas" (TEA) that allows the user to visualize the expression of a gene, or a collection of genes, at high resolution in any tissue or cell type of the tomato fruit through time/development. These data are also linked to the high resolution CT-based digitized fruit images. An important component of the TEA database is a novel tool that also allows users to ask which genes are expressed at the same time and same place in the fruit, which can provide vital information as to which genes are operating together in specific biochemical or signaling pathways and thus may share a similar function.  The TEA database is based on tomato fruit development and ripening but, importantly, this...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
