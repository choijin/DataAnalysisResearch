<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to conduct a rigorous "proof of principle" experimental test of coherent perfect rotation (CPR), which is a first example of a hermitian (thus reversible), multiport, 100% quantum efficient optical mode conversion process. Hermitian "coherent perfect" processes are a generalization of the antilaser (coherent perfect absorption, or CPA that combines wave interference with a (sufficiently large) time reversal symmetry breaking transport process. The PIs have shown theoretically that CPR can optimize the optical efficiency and contrast in many optical devices including cavity-based laser frequency locks, opto-magnetic sensors, and optical modulators.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The theory of CPR is relatively complete, simple and subtle. As a general result of linear optics, CPR provides useful insights into optimizing optical systems with components as ubiquitous and prosaic as beam splitters and cavities. This understanding of fundamental symmetry (time-odd optical elements) combined with coherence may be used to improve select non-linear optical processes as well. Verification of CPR will be a first step in the extension and diffusion of this methodology for improving optical design and devices.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;Because this research illuminates the use of fundamental symmetries and coherence in optimizing quantum efficiency, experimentally verifying the method is of value for a broad array of optical devices and protocols, and may ultimately inform commercial optical design.&lt;br/&gt;Testing CPR will involve mentoring a postdoc and undergraduate physics and engineering students, through their inclusion in the Photonic, Electronic, and Optical Materials (POEM) research group at YSU.&lt;br/&gt;Their participation will include extensive, novel laboratory work, co-authorship of scientific publications (for some of the students it will be their first peer-reviewed scientific publication) and presentation of research findings at national meetings. The PIs have a proven record of successful and effective post-doc mentoring.&lt;br/&gt;The PIs have long-standing commitments to science education in northeast Ohio through YAPA (a teacher outreach program active since the 1970's, initiated during the PSSC era) and the Ohio Section of the American Physical Society (OSAPS) and the regional American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT). The PIs will use activity generated by this research support in outreach by promoting public interest in science and exciting younger students about the innovative careers opportunities in technical fields (primarily Physics and Electrical Engineering).</AbstractNarration>

In light the electric and magnetic fields are shaking, and they point and evolve transverse to the motion of the wave (unlike sound waves which are longitudinal). Of course, since the path of the light is along one direction, the other two directions indicate the possible polarization of the wave. As light&nbsp; goes through a glass-like material, the plane of the polarization of the light can change in predictable and technologically useful ways.&nbsp; But light is often reflected somewhat at the air-glass interfaces, leading to often substantial (10%-level) inefficiencies, inefficient in that not all the light goes through the material and has its polarization rotated. We proposed that it is possible to combine (from both sides) light on a glass polarization rotator, adjusting the color, intensities and phase, in such a way as to make the rotation potentially 100% efficient. In this process there is effectively no reflection, and all the light that emerges is forced to go through the glass (and have its polarization rotated). One last thing that turns out to be key; theory indicated that this was only possible if the glass was immersed in a magnetic field, for example, directed along the light path, using a process called Faraday Rotation, after Michael Faraday who first observed this effect and correctly understood it (before James Clerk Maxwell's theory unifying light and electricity) as revealing the intrinsic electromagnetic nature of light.&nbsp; To take these ideas beyond theory and to test them experimentally we needed help, mostly in the form of a postdoctoral research associate skilled in optics and some equipment and some stipend support for our undergraduate physics students who participated in this experiment primarily during the summers of 2014 and 2015.&nbsp; The postdoctoral research associate funded by this grant, Dr. Chuanhong Zhou, was essential to the substantial setup, testing, and experimental data collection that was necessary to test this theory, and he also trained many students and with us wrote papers (2 already appeared in high impact peer-reviewed physics journals, one additional currently under review) and grants (one with the NSF, not funded,&nbsp; and some smaller grants) during his year in our research group at YSU.
