<AbstractNarration>In the sixties, Grothendieck had the motivic idea that one should replace all the different cohomology theories of algebraic varieties (Hodge, de Rham, etale, crystalline, etc) by the "universal" one. This insight led to major breakthroughs and to several categories of motives. Noncommutative algebraic geometry, a recent branch of mathematics, is concerned with the study of noncommutative algebraic varieties, i.e., differential graded (=dg) categories. Recently, Kontsevich had also the motivic idea of replacing the different homology theories of noncommutative algebraic varieties (K-theory, cyclic homology, topological Hochschild homology, etc) by the "universal" one. Similarly, this led to several categories of noncommutative motives. The main objective of this project is to bridge the gap between the above two motivic ideas. Concretely, the Principal Investigator (PI) will construct appropriate symmetric monoidal functors relating the categories of motives and noncommutative motives. Among the manifold uses of such functors, the PI will exploit them to address the Schur/Kimura finiteness of motives as well as the rationality of motivic zeta functions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The theory of motives was envisioned by Grothendieck in the sixties and greatly developed since then by Beilinson, Deligne, Voevodsky, and others. In contrast, the theory of noncommutative motives was only recently introduced by Kontsevich. The PI proposes to construct precise bridges between motives and noncommutative motives. These will enable the interchange of results, techniques, ideas, and insights between the commutative and the noncommutative world. In order to make these results accessible to the mathematical community, the PI will lecture graduate courses, disseminate them online, organize working seminars, and write the first book on the subject. Complementing these educational activities, the PI will also mentor undergraduate students through research projects on applications of motives to several areas of mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The theory of motives was envisioned by Grothendieck in the sixties and greatly developed by Voevodsky (and his collaborators) in the nineties. In contrast, noncommutative motives were only recently introduced by Kontsevich as the central part of his broad program on noncommutative (algebraic) geometry.   The major goal of the project was to bridge the gap between Voevodsky's theory of mixed motives and Kontsevich's theory of noncommutative mixed motives. Such a goal was successfully achieved by the end of the project. Among other applications, it enabled the interchange of several results, techniques, ideas, and insights, between the classical theory of Voevodsky's motives and the recent theory of Kontsevich's noncommutative motives. Moreover, in order to achieve such a goal the PI developed some new mathematical tools which are of independent interest.  The work developed in the project was presented at numerous conferences, workshops, seminars, and summer schools. Moreover, it was published in sixteen journals articles and in one book.  Several areas of mathematics such as algebraic geometry, algebraic topology, representation theory, symplectic geometry, and mathematical physics, are related to Kontsevich's broad program on noncommutative (algebraic) geometry. As a consequence, multiple of the results obtained during the project had a direct impact in these areas of mathematics.   Finally, during the entire duration of the project, the PI supervised several undergraduate research projects related to the topics of the project.
