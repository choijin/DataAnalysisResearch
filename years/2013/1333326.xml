<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to develop and implement first-order trust-search methods for use in large-scale data-generated optimization problems.  Data-generated problems arise in applications such as signal and image processing. These problems are especially difficult to solve since the data are often high dimensional and are noisy, incomplete, and/or inexact.  This research will develop first-order quasi-Newton trust-search methods for solving large data-generated problems.  The methods to be used are trust-search methods, which are hybridizations of the most fundamental types of methods for unconstrained optimization: trust-region methods and line-search methods. Trust-search methods seek to implement line-search strategies in combination with trust-region theoretics to obtain more robust methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will help scientists and engineers solve  optimization problems involving large volumes of corrupted data.  In today's world, scientific data are more abundant than ever before; moreover, projects are already underway to produce even more data at a faster rate.  To keep pace, the emerging field of "big data" requires sophisticated, fast, robust, and large-scale numerical algorithms.  This research will use linear algebra and optimization theory to develop software for processing and analyzing very large data sets.  In particular, the results of this research will help solve important problems in image processing applications such as medical imaging, low-light video surveillance, and nocturnal ecological activity monitoring, where the generated data are not only very large but are very noisy.  The algorithms will be disseminated publically for use within and outside the scientific community.  Graduate students will be trained in scientific research and programming through this research, and the participation of students from under-represented backgrounds will be highly encouraged.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main research goal of this grant is the development and implementation of optimization methods for solving large-scale problems arising in applications such as signal processing.  The field of mathematical optimization involves identifying a solution that optimizes a particular objective.  Many problems in science and engineering such as curve fitting, airfoil design, scheduling, power grid planning, and supply chain management can be posed as optimization problems.  Our work focused on three areas: (i) optimization method design, (ii) numerical linear algebra underlying the optimization methods, and (iii) applications to signal processing.  (i) Optimization method design: We developed mathematical software that can solve large-scale optimization problems using trust-region methods based on quasi-Newton methods. Trust-region methods define a region in which a model to the objective fuinction is trusted to be an accurate approximation and compute a search direction within this region. Gradient-based optimization methods generally form into two categories, with trust-region methods being one of them and line-search methods being the other. Quasi-Newton methods are used when the second-derivative is difficult to compute or invert, with the latter being true in general for large-scale problems. For this grant, the quasi-Newton trust-region methods that the we developed were shown to outperform well-established trust-region and line-search methods on a standard test set of optimization problems. Our trust-region methods exploit the compact representation of quasi-Newton matrices, which results in a fast and accurate subproblem solution at each iteration.       (ii) Numerical linear algebra: A key component to the success of our trust-region methods is the compact representation of the quasi-Newton matrices.
