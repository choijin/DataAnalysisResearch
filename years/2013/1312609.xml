<AbstractNarration>Escobar&lt;br/&gt;CBET - 1231324&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Membranes are widely used in the chemical, petrochemical, food processing, food packaging, medical and pharmaceutical industries.  Therefore, it is crucial for U.S. scientists and engineers to participate in activities that foster professional growth and new ideas in an area that impacts the U.S. economy.  This proposal seeks funding to partially support the travel of 20 U.S. graduate students to attend the North American Membrane Society (NAMS) 2012 National Meeting in June 2012.  The objective of this funding request is to encourage student participation in the largest American meeting focused on membrane science and engineering, to provide opportunities for them to present their work, meet other scientists and engineers from around the world with similar interests, and see state-of-the-art presentations from other research groups working in this area.  This opportunity will help develop the next generation of scientists and engineers and retain U.S.?s standing in membrane education and research.  Attendence is expected from the most respected and accomplished membrane scientists and engineers from government, industry, and academia.  The meeting will cover emerging areas of membrane science and engineering and feature three world-class lectures on water treatment and sustainability, gas separations, and materials.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The requested support will allow U.S. graduate students to attend the 2012 NAMS National Meeting and present research results on membrane science and technology.  The students will develop professionally through an extensive student program comprising of the Young Membrane Scientist Forum, ?Dining with the Legends? event, student workshop on career planning and a student poster competition.  There will also be four workshops planned for students to receive intensive, tutorial training in key fundamental and developing areas of science and technology.  The selection committee will ensure representation of students from underrepresented groups.  Applications from students with disabilities will be encouraged.  Student participation will enhance research infrastructure by giving students access to leading scientists and engineers from around the world in the technical sessions and in workshops.  Students will also have the opportunity to network with potential employers and with students and faculty members with similar interests.  This activity will produce better trained, more knowledgeable graduate students to push the frontiers of membrane science and technology in a wide range of practical applications.</AbstractNarration>
