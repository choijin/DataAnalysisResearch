<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to develop a feasible plan to further develop a privacy-preserving technology for cloud computing. Researchers are developing techniques for the virtualization software to protect users' privacy in cloud computing environments.  The research team plans to develop a demo version based on their technology and investigate its potential application for end-users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successfully implemented, this research could have impacts in research and education by enhancing the understanding of structural design to support user-controlled privacy protection in cloud computing. The proposed technology could make the deployment and configuration of cloud computing simpler.</AbstractNarration>

Through the training, the PI and the team obtained necessary knowledge and skills to commercialize the technology for privacy protection in cloud computing environments.  During the project, the PI and the team, interviewed more than one hundred potential customers in terms of product features, functionalities, and special user requirements. According to the interview results, the original proposed technology does solve privacy protection problems in clouds and user-configurable privacy protection is very appreciated by potential customers.  However, our original technology requires replacement of existing cloud platforms, which causes big concerns from potential customers because existing investment will be wasted and training of cloud administrators to use new technology will be mandatory.   Thus, we concluded that our originally proposed technology is not ready for commercialization, though the functionality and features are very appreciated by potential customers.   Instead, based on potential customers' feedback, we found that a plug-in mechanism to add privacy protection into existing cloud platforms will be well accepted by potential customers, thus become a better commercialization solution.  Through the project, one Ph.D. student received training on technology commercialization. The PI and the team learned knowledge and skills about technology commercialization process.
