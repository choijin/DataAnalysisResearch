<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable development of a family of ?smart? automation elements that can be interlinked to provide robotics for a wide range of purposes at a significantly lower cost than current solutions. The concept uses autonomous telescoping struts and interconnecting hubs that can be readily assembled into smart mechanisms. The struts include a novel compact transmission called a ball rotor that is capable of very high mechanical advantages in a single stage. Each strut has an independent, programmable, control system that communicates with the other struts it is linked to over an embedded network providing a multitasking control system for the robot?s programmed motions. The new device will be more capable than existing alternatives and less expensive because it is simpler.  This project will test the viability of the concept by producing and testing functioning prototypes of the basic components involved in the technology. The proposed research focuses on understanding the performance of the struts.  These will be tested, measured and modeled to ensure that the ranges of useful working speeds and loads are known, stresses are sustainable, and material limitations are understood ? all necessary to ensure a dependable working device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is tied to versatility, ease of programming, greater capabilities and (projected) significantly lower costs of this novel automation solution.  We expect early adopters to include automation suppliers (ease of assembling customized mechanisms, and lower costs), manufacturing (readily assembled simpler automation for productivity boosts), and the academic market (students re-use autonomous struts in different configurations). The lower cost will also enable applications in many activities that are currently shut out of automation by the expense and need for specialist knowledge.  Our vision is to trigger the development of a vast range of useful, smart mechanisms by making the basic components inexpensive and user-friendly. This will parallel the impact of PCs when they evolved from, expensive, specialized mainframes into the devices that the general public relies on daily. Democratizing access to robotics is crucial to increasing the number of minds that apply robotic solutions in non-traditional areas, opening new markets. It could preserve an economic edge for the US, especially in a global race-to-automate. Lower-cost, and easily implemented robotics will improve US competitiveness vs. low-cost foreign labor. This is key to improving manufacturing potential in the US, and creating new higher value jobs.</AbstractNarration>

The concept uses autonomous telescoping struts and interconnecting hubs that can be readily assembled into smart mechanisms. Each strut has an independent, programmable, control system that communicates with other linked struts over an embedded network.

The Phase I grant helped significantly in the production of the first working prototypes, developing computer models of the basic performance of the devices, and initiating a test program to define device limits. It has taken considerable resources and time to develop a successful ball rotor strut.      Results  Our primary goal under this grant has been to assure the technical practicality of our proposed product, the Autonomous Telescoping Strut and its associated hardware. The productÆs viability is dependent on its application as a low-cost, compact, robust solution. It is therefore important that the high-risk elements of the concept be addressed early to assure that successful hardware can be produced without increasing the target manufacturing cost. To assure the feasibility of these goals, the following tasks have been completed.     A ball rotor linear transmission has been developed for the automation struts. Prototypes have been made. This device is highly compact and is capable of high gear ratios in a single stage. The current prototype mechanism operates smoothly and is tolerant to manufacturing variations. The manufacturing costs turned out to be slightly lower than originally estimated.   An inexpensive and very compact extension sensor has been designed and prototyped. It measures absolute position of the strutÆs extension. The prototype sensors performed well with good repeatability. Resolutions were acceptable and close to the values expected. Manufacturing costs were in line with the original estimates.   A ball rotor dynamic model, comprised of a collection of analytical solutions, was developed and is now embedded in an Excel workbook. This has been used to predict performance, and analyze loads within the ball rotor strut.  The analytical models have the tremendous advantage of providing insight into the dominant factors affecting forces and kinematics.  For example, the actual loads on the ball rotor parts depend on numerous parameters involving the history of exact positions of all the balls, and many stiffness factors (all largely unknown).  But in reality, we found that the actual loading is dominated by the static loading.  And solving this case forced us to address indeterminacy consistent with the laws of motion and of friction. The end result was a helpful understanding of how the device works and a convenient way to run out calculations. Going forward, this analytical tool will be invaluable in producing a robust product.   We have shown that a highly compact controller can be produced in a size allowing it to be embedded in the plunger tube of the strut assembly. We have found high-performance, low cost components that will keep the controllerÆs manufactured cost under $12 in quantities of 10,000.   Two prototype automation struts were built and have undergone preliminary testing. There have been no performance issues to date.     Through the analysis performed and experimental testing of prototype hardware, a good understanding of the technology has been gained. This is critical to the future development of our product.     The work completed thus far has mitigated most of the high-risk elements of the product concept and demonstrated that the envisioned product can be produced within the cost target.
