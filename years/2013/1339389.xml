<AbstractNarration>Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the world's most important food crops and a staple for billions throughout the world.  Hidden within loaves of bread is one of largest and most complex genomes of important plant species.  The size and complexity of the bread wheat genome, which is more than five times larger than the human genome, have hindered development of a reference framework that can serve as a resource for genetic studies and breeding applications.  A better understanding of the wheat genome will also give insight into the structure, function and evolution of complex, polyploid plant genomes.  Advancement of population-based sequencing methods for assembling plant genomes will have broad implications throughout the plant genomics community, particularly for species with limited genomic resources and large, intractable genomes.  User-friendly tools for population sequencing developed through this project will enable applications of this approach in the broader plant genome community.  Through integrated education and outreach activities, this project will recruit and train new generations of computational biologists to address complex and challenging genomics questions.  In partnership with the Kansas Foundation for Ag in the Classroom (KFAC), multi-tiered educational materials on plant genomes and domestication will be developed and implemented in middle and high school classrooms across the state.  Through KFAC, students will be given access to advanced material targeting Next Generation Science Standards, including resource materials on careers in plant science.  At the undergraduate level, internships will be developed to attract non-biology students from computationally-intensive fields.  Interns with diverse social and academic backgrounds will be challenged with cutting-edge bioinformatics through coursework and research in U.S. labs followed by summer internships working with European project collaborators.  At the postdoctoral level, scholars working on this project will gain skills in cutting-edge genomics along with mentoring and international research experience.  To disseminate bioinformatics approaches developed through this project, annual workshops for bioinformatics training in population sequencing and genotyping-by-sequencing will be held for graduate and postdoctoral training.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an approach for developing sequence resources for crop plants with large genomes, next-generation sequencing (NGS) can be applied to rapidly generate a whole genome sequence that is readily assembled into short contigs.  These contigs primarily contain the gene-rich, non-repetitive portions of complex genomes.  However, WGS assemblies have limited utility because these gene-rich contigs remain unanchored and unordered on the chromosomes.  Novel, cost-effective approaches are needed for anchoring and ordering large, complex genomes.  Through this project, new methods for assembling and ordering complex plant genomes will be developed and applied to understanding the genomes of wheat and its wild relatives.  NGS will be applied to segregating populations of diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid wheat species, leveraging linkage information to develop an ordered whole-genome assembly for each species.  This approach (POPSEQ) uses millions of genetic markers to order the assembled gene space onto a physical framework.  The project will target 1x whole-genome sequence coverage across multiple diploid (AA and DD genomes), tetraploid (AABB) and hexaploid (AABBDD) populations to develop high-density genetic maps.  These high-density genetic maps can then be used to anchor sequence contigs and scaffolds, giving physical context to genome assemblies.  Ordered assemblies will be iteratively improved and made available to the wheat community through MIPS (http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/plant/genomes.jsp), T3 (http://triticeaetoolbox.org/) and GrainGenes (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/) databases.  Genetic stocks will be made available through the KSU Wheat Genetics Resource Center and the USDA-ARS National Small Grains Collection.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Wheat is one of the most important crops in the world, providing over 20% of the calories and protein consumed worldwide.  The combined challenges of growing populations, increased demand for food, less favorable environments, and reduced natural resources present a critical need to develop improved, high-yielding and climate resilient wheat varieties.  Precision breeding technologies that can be applied to accelerate variety improvement are greatly facilitated by a complete reference genome map.  Completing the bread wheat reference genome sequence, however, has been a formable challenge.  Containing 16 billion base pairs of DNA, the wheat genome is over five times larger than the human genome.  Adding to this complexity, the wheat genome is hexaploidy, meaning that it is comprised of three sub-genomes. Through coordinated efforts by the international wheat genome consortium, with contributions from this project, the reference genome assembly for bread wheat was completed and published in 2018.  This landmark achievement paves the way for the future of wheat research and breeding through increased understanding of its biology and the use of that information for wheat improvement.  The completed reference sequence for bread wheat will have broad impact on wheat breeding and research throughout the world by enabling rapid identification of important genes for yield and disease resistance.  Using this knowledge and molecular breeding approaches, breeders will be able to make faster and more precise selections of the most promising new candidate varieties in the program.  The work on genome sequencing and assembly approaches for the reference genome of ?Chinese Spring? has facilitated further developments to rapidly assemble additional wheat reference genomes.  As a founding member of the Wheat 10+ Genomes Consortium, we have worked closely with international collaborators to sequence and assemble additional wheat genomes representing important wheat cultivars around the world&mdash;to study and understand the genomic diversity found in the crop.  Leading the U.S. contributions to this collaborative effort, we have sequenced and assembled the genome of ?Jagger?, a landmark winter wheat variety from the U.S. Central Plains.  The genome sequences from multiple different varieties are being compared to understand the structural diversity and important characteristics that make each wheat variety unique.   While making direct contributions to the world of wheat genomics, we are also looking to the future of plant science through education and outreach at both the primary grade level and the undergraduate level.  Through partnership with Kansas Foundation for Ag in the Classroom (KFAC) and teachers? groups spanning K-12 grades, we have developed curriculum and lesson plans for elementary and secondary students throughout Kansas focused on wheat and wheat genetics.  The curriculum has been developed directly by teachers with technical input and resources from the university project team.  Lesson plans and teaching resources have been pilot tested through focused teacher groups, and distributed to through KFAC to networks of teachers across the state.  Continuing on into the undergraduate level, we have hosted multiple research experiences for undergraduates in the summer and during the school year.  By targeting students from STEM fields like statistics and computer science to work on challenging plant science problems, we are exposing them to exciting new areas of research related to their fields.
