<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Douglas Adamson of the University of Connecticut will synthesize and study polymers that can form stable, single chain globules in solution. Natural proteins, in a very general sense, are polymers containing mostly hydrophobic monomers and a relatively thin layer of hydrophilic monomers at the surface of the protein globule.  It has been predicted that single chain polymer globules can be stabilized to aggregation and precipitation if they possess this type of morphology. To test this prediction, polymers will be synthesized that contain a hydrophobic main chain and a set number of hydrophilic grafts serving to stabilize the single polymer chain against flocculation and precipitation. The design of the polymer architecture will be driven and informed by theoretical work that predicts the effect of the placement and type of hydrophilic components on the stability and morphology of the synthesized polymer. The broader impacts such research include increasing our understanding of the folding and morphology of proteins, as well as opening the door for synthetic materials that may perform some of the functions of proteins. In addition, the project will involve visits to local schools and will contribute to the training of undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The creation of precisely defined structures that have dimensions on the order of nanometers (termed "nanostructures") continues to be a challenge for chemists.  Nature has perfected many methods to assembly nanostructures, including the folding of proteins into precisely defined 3-dimensional nanostructures.  Polymers are long chain organic molecules and are found in many facets of everyday life that utilize plastics, including food packaging, structural materials for automotive and aerospace transportation, and lightweight electronic devices. This project seeks to understand how synthetic polymers can mimic the nanostructure forming abilities of proteins at a very fundamental level.  Ultimately, precisely defined synthetic nanostructures could impact technologies ranging from pharmaceuticals to biotechnology and electronics.</AbstractNarration>
