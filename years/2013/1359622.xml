<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for junior scientists to attend Hot Quarks 2014:  A Workshop on the Physics of Ultrarelativistic Nucleus-Nucleus Collisions for Young Scientists.  The format of this workshop is unusual in that only junior scientists (graduate students, postdocs, and early career faculty members) can attend.  The workshop is focused on the exchange of scientific information related to understanding the behavior of matter at extremely high densities and/or temperatures.  Such a state of matter is expected to have existed soon after the Big Bang.  Participants will be discussing results from experiments at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Lab, and the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, in Switzerland.  Research in this area contributes to our fundamental understanding of the nature of matter and has implications for other areas of science, such as cosmology.  Focusing on the participation of junior scientists plays an important role in educating the next generation of experts in nuclear science who will be essential to the Nation's future in this area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The 6th edition of the Workshop for Young Scientists on the Physics of Ultrarelativistic Nucleus-Nucleus Collisions (Hot Quarks 2014) was held in Las Negras, Spain from 21-28 September 2014. Following the traditions of the conference, this meeting gathered more than 70 participants in the first years of their scientific careers.     As in the past, the Hot Quarks workshop offered a unique atmosphere for a lively discussion and interpretation of the current measurements from high energy nuclear collisions.  Recent  results and upgrades at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and  Brookhaven's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) were also presented.  Recent theoretical developments were  extensively discussed as well  as the perspectives for future facilities such as the Facility for  Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR) at Darmstadt and the Electron-Ion  Collider at Brookhaven. The physics topics that were covered in these talks can be summarized as:     QCD at high temperature/density and lattice QCD Initial state effects and Color Glass Condensate Relativistic hydrodynamic and collective phenomena Correlations and fluctuations Jets in the vacuum and in the medium Baryons and strangeness Heavy flavor, dileptons and photons Applications of String Theory and AdS/CFT Experimental techniques and future programs     The conference's goal to provide a platform for young researchers to learn and foster their interactions was successfully met.     The proceedings for this conference will appear in the Open Access Jorunal of Physics: Conference Series (JPCS), which is part of IOP Conference Series.
