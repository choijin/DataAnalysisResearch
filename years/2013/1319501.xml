<AbstractNarration>This project addresses the problem of design space exploration for high-performance embedded computing platforms.  Such systems  are increasingly heterogeneous, and include powerful multi-core microprocessors (CPUs), many-core Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), and Digital Signal Processors (DSPs). Despite the availability of these powerful platforms, many barriers exist for application developers and platform designers to reap the full benefits of these devices.  Some of these challenges include finding effective mappings of applications to a wide range of heterogeneous compute platforms and defining/exploring the most appropriate memory interfaces.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is development of a Heterogeneous Design Environment (HDE), that will allow one to define algorithms at a high level, and automate the search of the design space to select hardware and software implementations to meet desired objectives. Towards this co-design goal, the research includes investigation of methods of expressing algorithms at a conceptual, functional level; exploration of static methods of analyzing parallelism of applications; and extending simulation frameworks to support and accurately model power and performance on CPUs, GPUs, and DSPs at different levels of abstraction. The target application domain for proof of this concept is computer vision, one of the fastest growing market sectors within embedded high-performance computing, in which applications tend to be data-driven, compute-hungry and power-constrained.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Heterogeneous Design Environment is expected to simplify development of power-efficient embedded computing applications across a set of heterogeneous devices.  By providing a rich set of design exploration tools in the context of industry-standard programming frameworks, such as Multi2Sim and OpenCL, the project aims to accelerate the pace at which new computer vision applications are developed. Integrated education and outreach activities include new development of new courseware, delivery of tutorials, involvement of undergraduates, participation in a summer program for middle-school students, and use of the HDE in undergraduate and graduate courses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ High-performance embedded platforms are increasingly heterogeneous, and include powerful multi-core microprocessors (CPUs) and many-core Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). OpenCL and the Heterogeneous Systems Architecture (HSA) are two programming standards that are shaping the future in high-performance embedded systems.  In this project we have developed three different efforts to break down barriers to leveraging these powerful platforms.  We have developed both simulation tools and fundamental optimizations, resulting in powerful next-generation Heterogeneous Design Environments (HDEs).  The first effort results in Multi2sim-HSA simulator, supporting exploration of collaborative computing on CPU-GPU platforms.  The simulator suports the Heterogeneous Systems Architecture 1.0 standard.  Along with the simulation, the project has  developed a benchmark suite named HeteroMark, that provides system designers with collaborative execution patterns to explore the heterogeneous design space.  The second effort is ongoing, and supports heterogeneous execution on a CPU-multi-GPU environment.  The framework is called GCN3Sim, which is developed Google?s Go language, is focused on providing efficient simulation of the AMD GCN3 microarchitecture.  A third effort focused on execution on a heterogeneous CPU-FPGA environment.  We deliver three fundamental optimizations/architectures: 1) we develop source-level optimizations that consider efficient execution of pipelined kernels on an FPGA, 2) we consider synthesis optimizations that perform hardware thread reordering to better serve irregular application execution, and 3) we explore a novel architecture approach that builds a new class of device that combines the benefits of a customized compute unit of an FPGA, with the latency hiding associated with a GPU.   The project has supported 5 PhD and 1 MS students, with 5 of these students working at Intel, AMD or Qualcomm, and the sixth has been hired into a tenure track position in the US.  The project has also involved 2 undergraduate researchers.  The project included presenting tutoritals on the tools developed in this project.  Continuation of the work is presently being supported by the Heterogeneous Systems Architecture foundation.       Last Modified: 12/29/2017       Submitted by: David R Kaeli]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
