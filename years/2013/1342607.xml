<AbstractNarration>Abstract (Zhao, 1342607): &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of graduate students and postdocs to participate in the "2013-2014 Clifford Lectures" to be held on November 08-11, 2013, at Tulane University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The event aims to bring together leading experts and researchers in nonlinear partial differential equations (both on the applied and theoretical sides). The list of speakers includes top mathematicians such as G. Iyer, A. Kiselev, N. Masmoudi and E. Titi. The audience will consist of the participants from various universities and institutions in Louisiana and the New Orleans area, as well as other parts of the United States and abroad, such as, Loyola University, Xavier University, University of New Orleans, Louisiana State University, University of Louisiana, Princeton University, Stanford University, and Simon Fraser University and University of British Columbia. The organizers anticipate the participation of minority scholars. This is a high impact conference for the region of Louisiana.</AbstractNarration>
