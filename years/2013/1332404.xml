<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  &lt;br/&gt;Several novel systems approaches and an alternative target biofuel are brought to bear in this project to develop sustainable processes for the production of fuels and chemicals by cyanobacteria. The project has been awarded to a multidisciplinary team, consisting of Professors Kenneth F. Reardon, David S. Dandy, Thomas H. Bradley, Christie A.M. Peebles, and Graham Peers, all of Colorado State University, Fort Collins, CO.  To address the goals of increasing commodity yields and increasing the sustainability of photosynthetic microbe-derived fuels, the research team will synthesize knowledge and approaches from fluid dynamics, photosynthetic physiology, proteomics, metabolic engineering, and life cycle analysis methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In a novel approach to engineer photosynthetic efficiency, the team will model the environment of different photobioreactors and use these models to design accurate scale-down systems for laboratory cultivations, opposite to the usual practice. This will allow them to identify and target industrially relevant biology at a small scale and make accurate predictions for large-scale systems. Next, the team will quantify energy losses and stresses associated with photosynthesis, and target these for genetic improvements. This genetic research will be coupled to the metabolic engineering of cyanobacteria to shuttle carbon to a novel sesquiterpene fuel molecule, bisabolene, which offers promise as an alternative biodiesel which does not require transesterification processing, necessary in the current biodiesel production from vegetable oils. To separate the cyanobacterial cells from their cultivation liquid in an energy-efficient manner, the team will develop a novel inertial migration-based cell concentration mechanism. All of these studies on system performance will be guided by feedback from new life cycle analysis methods developed by modeling the productivity of large-scale reactors using the scale-up relationships developed in this project. The Colorado State team predicts this integrated approach to solving the major issues associated with photosynthetic microbe-based fuels will result in a rapid increase in the accuracy and speed with which the productivity of the system can be manipulated; greater yields of target molecules in industrial deployment; large, quantified increases in the overall sustainability of the process; and transferrable approaches toward the cultivation of photosynthetic microbes and the production of other biofuels or biochemicals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  &lt;br/&gt;The proposed work, which encompasses understanding of photobioreactor process dynamics, physiological responses of cyanobacteria to photobioreactor conditions, engineering of cyanobacteria to produce biofuels and biochemicals, and life cycle analysis, will lead to photosynthetic production of advanced biofuels and biochemicals with the potential to be environmentally sustainable.  The engineered strains will serve as a platform for future research on biofuel upgrading strategies and on biochemical production strategies.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide interdisciplinary training for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral scholars, with significant efforts being made to include members of underrepresented groups.  Students will gain broad experience in modeling, metabolic engineering, systems biology, microbial cell cultivation of photosynthetic organisms and life cycle analysis, placing the students at the forefront of research in biofuel production from photosynthetic organisms.  The project includes opportunities for mentoring of K-12 students in research, as well as teacher training.  The results of this project will be disseminated in leading peer-reviewed journals, national meetings, in new courses, and via an interactive website.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Photosynthetic microorganisms such as cyanobacteria have the ability to use sunlight and carbon dioxide to produce fuels and chemicals at higher rates (mass per acre per year) than can plants. Furthermore, cyanobacteria do not require high quality agricultural land or large volumes of fresh water.  The goal of this project was to advance the development of sustainable processes for the production of fuels and chemicals by cyanobacteria.  The multidisciplinary project team applied life-cycle assessments to focus research on key limitations that limit the use of cyanobacterial biorefineries.  The project research thrusts were to engineer photosynthetic efficiency, to alter carbon flux towards the potential fuel molecule bisabolene, and to develop low energy methods for concentrating cells. To achieve these objectives, one project focus was to identify the environment experienced by cyanobacterial cells in large-scale cultivations and to understand how that environment affected their physiology and metabolism. In this part of the project, we determined through mathematical modeling and experiments that cells in large photobioreactors under normal day-night cycles spend the majority of their time in the dark and are exposed to high light conditions for short periods.  We determined that they respond to these light stresses in unexpected ways.  We obtained new insights into physiological changes because this was the first study to consider realistic mixing conditions.  This portion of the study involved a productive collaboration between experts in computational fluid dynamics and experts in photosynthesis.  The second focus was on the genetic engineering of cyanobacteria to produce bisabolene, a replacement for diesel fuel.  Several important outcomes emerged from this part of the project, including new genetic tools for controlling gene expression based on light exposure and evidence that approaches used for model microorganisms do not translate well to cyanobacteria.  Bisabolene production was achieved in both constant light and normal day-night cycles. The third area of technology advancement was the development of a novel approach for harvesting cyanobacterial biomass from cultivations. The new method uses microfluidic networks to separate cells from the surrounding fluid simply by the way they move under certain conditions.  Research in this project demonstrated that high concentration factors can be achieved with this new method, with high recovery of the biomass.  While the microfluidic systems are small, our research showed the potential for energy savings and that the systems can be scaled up with minimal loss in performance. These technology advances were integrated using new life cycle analysis approaches that accurately model the productivity of large-scale photobioreactors and provide the ability to identify the next targets for research and development.  In addition, two funding supplements allowed the project to evaluate the use of cyanobacteria to improve wastewater treatment and to involve military veterans to participate in research and develop their professional skills in STEM fields.    This project advanced the development of photosynthetic biorefineries, an approach that has the potential to provide fuels,chemicals, food, and advanced wastewater treatment more sustainably than current approaches. Importantly, the project provided research, learning, and professional development opportunities for more than 20 undergraduate and graduate students. Enhancements to research infrastructure were achieved and new techniques were developed and disseminated.  Project results were shared within the projects core disciplines as well as with young students and teachers interested in STEM fields.
