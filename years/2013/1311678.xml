<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project combines observational and theoretical efforts with a goal of improving knowledge of magnetic fields on low mass stars.  They will use high precision lightcurves of M-dwarfs from the Kepler satellite to probe starspots on late type stars to determine how stellar mass and rotation affect local magnetic fields.  They will use data already acquired from Kepler, and new photometry with moderate sized (1-m aperture) robotic telescopes and new spectra with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope.  Starspots are short-lived areas on the surfaces of stars that are caused by magnetic activity.  The researchers will also investigate the effect of magnetic fields on fundamental stellar properties, such as temperature, luminosity and radius as a function of M-dwarf mass.  They will also determine the relative importance of magnetic fields on observatory activity, such as flares and hydrogen-alpha emission.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include providing research opportunities to undergraduate students in STEM majors, with an effort to broaden participation by students from traditionally underrepresented minority groups.  They will also engage a group of amateur astronomers to obtain time series photometry of bright eclipsing binary stars.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to map both small and large scale magnetic field structures, such as starspots, on low mass stars (smaller than the Sun). Since it is not yet possible to take direct images of the stars in order to see the starspots, we used indirect methods to infer their sizes and locations.  One method involved using the Kepler observatory to see the transit of an exoplanet over the face of a star.  When the planet crosses over a starspot, we observed a difference in the light that was received from the star and were able to infer the size and temperature of the spot.  A second method was to observe the light variations from a star as starspots rotate in and out of view, and to model the observations with a sophisticated new computer program that we developed to find the best distribution of starspots that reproduces the observed variations. Finally, we looked at the distribution of stellar flares (strong spikes in brightness similar to solar flares) and found that they did not occur at the times when the most starspots were visible, indicating that there are probably smaller, more complicated magnetic structures that do not contribute to the brightness variations, but which are the locations where flares are produced.  Three graduate students received their PhD degrees at the University of Washington as a result of their contributions to this project.  More than a dozen published papers in refereed journals, and numerous invited talks at scientific conferences and seminars at universities, observatories and scientific institutes have been used to disseminate the results.  The data and software used in this work have all been made publicly available.          Last Modified: 02/08/2018       Submitted by: Suzanne L Hawley]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
