<AbstractNarration>The regulation of emotions is an integral part of everyday life.  Despite the widespread interest in emotions, very few statistical models exist for formally evaluating the dynamics of emotion regulation.  The collaborative work stemming from this project will enhance theoretical and methodological developments in the field of dynamic systems modeling by introducing novel methodologies suited for testing existing theories of emotions.  It also will create opportunities for methodologists to refine existing techniques and develop new ones for studying dynamic systems that will benefit other scientific disciplines.  The tools developed in this project can be used to examine irregularly spaced survey data frequently observed in the studies of other dynamic processes, such as family dynamics, social networks, and the propagation of diseases.  Physicians and other clinical practitioners may benefit from findings concerning how emotions vary over time.  To broaden the educational impact of this project, graduate students will be involved in all phases of the project.  Statistical tools developed in this study also will be disseminated to a broader research audience through online tutorial, forums, and conference workshops.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Empirical studies of human dynamic processes, such as studies of circadian rhythms, emotions, propagation of diseases, and dyadic and family-level interactions, frequently involve irregularly spaced longitudinal survey data.  In the study of human emotions, researchers often adopt ecological momentary assessment (EMA) procedures to obtain responses at random or event-contingent time intervals.  Such designs facilitate the collection of data that reflect an individual's ongoing emotional states "in the moment."  Common approaches based on ordinary and stochastic differential equations can be used to accommodate the irregular time intervals observed in such data, but they are not directly suited for handling the noisy, high-dimensional nature and diverse time scales characterizing EMA data.  The diverse range of time intervals also leads to computational challenges in determining the appropriate interpolation intervals in fitting differential equation models to empirical data.  The study will yield an integrated set of software tools for: (1) fitting and evaluating continuous-time regime-switching models for extracting key phases of emotion processes with homogeneous dynamical structures; (2) conducting Bayesian local influence analysis to assess the sensitivity of the proposed modeling extensions to perturbations to the hypothesized prior, sampling distribution, and data; and (3) determining the most robust interpolation intervals for fitting continuous-time models with regime-switching features under conditions that mirror real-life EMA studies.  Simulation studies as well as two existing EMA data sets will be used to test and validate the techniques developed in this study.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Measurements of human emotions and stress experiences are often enhanced by ecological (naturalistic) momentary sampling of such processes at irregular intervals to allow participants to provide responses &ldquo;in the moment&rdquo; as they go about with their daily lives. Testing models using irregularly spaced data, in turn, provides valuable insights to scientists, practitioners, and the public on effective timing and strategies for emotion and stress regulation. Common approaches based on differential equations can be used to accommodate irregular measurement intervals, but they are not directly suited for handling the noisy, high-dimensional nature and multiple time scales implicated in such data. This project (1) developed a series of Bayesian and frequentist procedures for fitting stochastic differential equation (SDE) models of human emotions, cardiovascular activities, and infant-mother interactive dynamics; (2) developed procedures for detecting outlying cases and/or time points with unusual deviations in change and measurement characteristics, and for conducting local influence analysis to assess the sensitivity of the proposed modeling procedures to minor changes in data and model specification; and (3) developed estimation procedures to accommodate regime-switching extensions to these models to identify phases with homogeneous dynamic relations among the variables that constitute these systems.</p> <p>The estimation approaches and dynamic models developed in this project have provided renewed insights into how dynamic modeling of ecological momentary assessment data can help hasten our understanding of everyday dynamic and stress regulation processes. As an example, previous studies have reported a greater tendency for African American than White American participants to show blunted blood pressure (BP) dipping -- a well-established marker of adverse cardiovascular outcomes (see Figure 1-AI). The team (Lu, Chow, Sherwood, &amp; Zhu, 2015) developed and applied a multiresolution Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm (MCMC) to fit a nonlinear SDE model to ambulatory blood pressure data from the Duke Behavioral Investigation of Hypertension study (see Figure 1-AII) to strengthen the performance of the MCMC sampler in synthesizing information across multiple time scales. Findings from the project clarified that African American participants exhibited higher daytime &ndash; but not nighttime &ndash; cardiovascular equilibrium than White American participants; in addition, they showed slower rates of return to their nighttime equilibrium compared to White participants. This has important implications for the cumulative effects of daytime stress on nighttime recovery. Results from conducting local influence analysis and outlier detection using a related model is shown in Figure 1B.</p> <p>In another paper, the study team (Chow, Ou, et al., in press) fit a regime-switching differential equation model to automated movement data from the Strange Situation Procedure (SSP), in which infants were separated from and reunited with their mothers twice. In previous studies, data from the SSP were often manually coded to rate the infants&rsquo; levels of secure attachment based on how much the infants could be comforted by staying close to their mothers while expressing intermittent interest in exploring the room.&nbsp;Using a regime-switching differential equation model that allowed the infant-mother dyads to show ongoing but individual- and time-specific transitions between a proximity-seeking and an exploration regime (see Figure 1C), the study team was able to extract useful information concerning switches in infant-mother movement dynamics that concurred with automated measurements of infant fussy/cry vocalizations.</p> <p>To improve computational speed and to allow a broader community of researchers and applied practitioners to utilize these tools, we programmed our estimation algorithms in C and integrated the algorithms into a statistical package in R called Dynamic Modeling in R (dynr), which is available for download from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dynr/index.html">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dynr/index.html</a>. Included in the dynr package are functions that allow users to specify linear and nonlinear differential/difference equation models with or without regime-switching properties in R, while performing the computationally intensive estimation in C (see Figures 2 and 3 for screenshots from fitting nonlinear differential equation and regime-switching models, respectively, using dynr).
