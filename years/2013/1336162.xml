<AbstractNarration>1336162/1336254&lt;br/&gt;Mannan/Wang&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Highly flammable polymers like poly (methyl methacrylate) used in homes for construction, in case of fire, cause an alarming number of deaths and property loss.  The objective of this work is to facilitate the accomplishment of the ultimate goal of fire retardancy, extensive charring of the polymer matrix, which means that the polymer can be used at the service temperature, whereas in case of fire, it would rapidly char, limiting the production of combustible volatiles.  This will be accomplished by forming new polymer nanocomposites which show synergistic effects of the two types of nanofillers: one forms a physical barrier and the other catalytically chars the polymer by changing its degradation pathway during burning.  In view of the lack of qualitative and quantitative understanding of the fire retardant mechanism of each type of nanofiller, this research will focus on studying the kinetics and the mass and heat transfer processes involved in the burning of the polymer with and without the nanofillers, qualitatively using thermal analysis and quantitatively using cone-calorimeter experiments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new knowledge generated would be disseminated through publications, book sections, and fire safety courses at Texas A&amp;M University and Oklahoma State University.  The broad impact of this research is twofold, such that it would contribute to better understanding of the role of nanofillers in fire retardancy at the fundamental level and at the same time give a practical insight on the development of new and better fire retardant materials with the potential of replacing existing materials, providing enough time for timely evacuation and timely control of fires due to less heat release.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The outcomes of this project can be summarized as follows:   1)    In-situ synthesis procedure was developed for preparing different scale of polystyrene nanocomposites. A specialized mold was developed as a part of the synthesis process that can accommodate formation of large-cale samples of 100 mm x 100 mm x 0.5mm for the cone calorimeter test.  2)     Nanosilica and montmorillonite (nanoclay) embedded in polystyrene (PS) were successfully synthesized using the in-situ method. Smaller samples were prepared for materials characterization studies, while larger samples were prepared for cone calorimetry studies. The TGA and DTG data show that the  nanocomposites are more thermally stable than neat polystyrene, with the largest reduction in peak mass loss rate of approximately 23% for PS-1 wt% silica nanocomposite.  An increase in onset temperature was observed for the nanocomposites compared to neat polystyrene indicating that introduction of nanofillers delays degradation process. A significant 72-87% increase in char yield was also observed for the nanocomposites compared to neat polystyrene. Extensive charring is an indication for better flame retardancy.   3)     The glass transition temperature as obtained from the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and the dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) were almost comparable except for PS-1 wt % silica nanocomposite. The decrease in glass transition temperature and reduction in storage modulus for the PS-3 wt% MMT was indicative of agglomeration that is responsible for weakening polymer filler interaction.  Introducing nanofillers also reduces hardness of the nanocomposites compared to the neat polystyrene as evident by the hardness values obtained in the nanoindentation test.   4)     The flammability studies conducted in cone calorimeter provided insight as to how the flame retardant nanocomposites would behave in a well developed fire scenario. The heat release rate data obtained from the cone calorimeter tests for both the neat polystyrene and the polystyrene nanocomposites fiollowed the trend of a thermally thick charring polymer with reduced peak values for the nanocomposites. The nanocomposites also showed better fire retardancy in terms of 56-84% increase in char yield. There was also visual indication of char formation. The nanocomposites yielded less smoke presented by lower specific extinction area compared to neat PS. Overall, the nanocomposites demonstrated better flame retardancy in terms of reduced peak heat release rate, lower mass loss rate and lower fire load.
