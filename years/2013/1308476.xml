<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the application of techniques from probability and complex analysis to mathematical problems concerning scaling limits of random planar growth and lattice model that originate in physics. The main focus is on models related to Loewner's differential equation, and in particular on the Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE). Three principal directions of investigation are proposed. First, the PI intends to study almost sure fine properties of the SLE curves, primarily from the point of view of multifractal analysis. One of the main questions concerns the properties of the almost sure multifractal spectrum of harmonic measure on the boundary of the SLE hulls, but the PI will also investigate, e.g., the winding of the curve at the tip and the geometry of the SLE curve's collisions with the boundary of the domain where it is defined. All of these questions can be formulated in terms of the boundary behavior of the random conformal maps that generate the SLE curves. Secondly, the PI intends to study rigorous connections between the SLE processes and related discrete models and Conformal Field Theory (CFT). One goal is to develop the rigorous understanding of the objects and algebraic structures of CFT from probabilistic and analytic points of view. Finally, the PI will study the Hastings-Levitov family of models which uses iterated random conformal maps to model planar aggregation processes. A specific regularization will be studied with an understanding of scaling limits and the predicted phase transition as ultimate goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discrete probabilistic lattice models are used in physics to model a range of phenomena, and they provide a source of many interesting mathematical problems. Techniques related to the random fractal Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) curves, which approximate interfaces between phases in the models, have led to much progress in the mathematical understanding of such models in recent years. Within the project the PI will develop the understanding of the SLE curves' rich random geometric and multifractal structures. Beside the intrinsic and fundamental interest of these structures, and their strong connections with physical models, the universal nature of the SLE process suggests that methods and insights developed in the study of its geometric properties will be useful in the study of other random fractals. An important physics approach to lattice models uses Conformal Field Theories, CFTs, which (roughly) are ``smeared out'' continuum versions of the discrete models. The rigorous SLE machinery is still limited compared to the scope of the non-rigorous CFT predictions, and many connections between CFT and discrete models remain mysterious from a mathematical perspective. The PI intends to develop the rigorous understanding of the objects and structures of CFT from probabilistic and analytic points of view, in particular direct connections with SLE and the discrete models themselves. A related circle of questions concerns models of aggregation where planar clusters are grown to model important natural processes such as diffusion limited aggregation and flow of viscous fluid. Recent advances in the understanding of random growth models related to conformal maps has provided new tools which the PI will use to study versions of the so-called Hastings-Levitov family of aggregation models.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Statistical Mechanics studies systems consisting of a large number of microscopic elements whose states are random and governed by microscopic, local interactions; simple prescriptions for randomness and interaction on microscopic scale can lead to complex structures on the macroscopic scale. This covers a variety of phenomena in condensed matter physics, such as ferromagnetism.   While it is natural to consider statistical physics in three dimensions, in many relevant cases, such as superconductors, the system is constrained to a thin layer and effectively two-dimensional. Mathematically, the two-dimensional set-up is special due to an abundance of so-called conformal symmetries, not present in higher dimension.   Starting from the 80's, theoretical physicists developped Conformal Field Theory (CFT), a framework that exploits the strong constraints emanating from conformal symmetries to describe possible large scale behaviors of 2d statistical mechanics models. This non-rigorous, strongly algebraic set-up produced tantalizing predictions on quantities such as critical exponents and correlation functions that eluded mathematicians for many years.  In the last twenty years, several breakthroughs (Schramm-Loewner Evolutions, discrete complex analysis and exact solvability) enabled to recover some of the CFT results. These new mathematical tools are probabilistic, geometric and combinatorial in nature, in contrast with the algebraic CFT framework.  More recently, significant effort went into putting the methods and concepts of CFT themselves on a rigorous footing, and reconcile the probabilistic and analytic approaches with the algebraic and combinatorial ones, with some successes (Virasoro representations, Liouville quantum field theory) and many outstanding challenges remaining. Concomitantly, closely related problems in random geometry (where not only the state of the matter, but also the geometry of the underlying space are random) have seen spectacular progress.     Intellectual Merit  The project focussed on (a) connecting the microscopic, combinatorial models with the macroscopic, continuous objects; (b) connecting the algebraic approach and results of CFT with the probabilistic and analytic framework; and (c) integrating the recent developments in random geometry to these two problems.  Concrete progress has been realized on these fronts, such as the fine study of loop-erased random walks; relating Virasoro representations to correlations of random curves (Schramm-Loewner Evolutions) and random fields (Liouville field theory); and constructing random metrics.  The problems involve techniques and ideas, and bring together researchers from a variety of fields within or adjacent to probability theory, as well as Mathematical Physics. This is evidenced by the participation in several workshops supported by the project.     Broader Impact  While condensed matter theory has seen spectacular applications from engineering to nanotechnology and quantum computing, many of its key insights still lack a sound mathematical foundation. Under this project, progress has been made towards reconciling some concepts of Conformal Field Theory with a rigorous probabilistic framework.  Three focussed workshops organized through this project enabled dozens of junior participants, including many from underrepresented groups, to interact with leading researchers, deepen their understanding of the latest developments in a fast-moving field, and appreciate potential fruitful interactions with other fields.
