<AbstractNarration>This is an observational project devoted to measuring the parallaxes of nearby low-mass stars in the Upper Sco and Chamaeleon I clusters.  Low-mass stars, such as M0-M3 spectral types, are the focus because of their importance to stellar evolution and planet formation models, and because very few accurate distances are known for these spectral types, due to not being included in the Hipparcos mission and other surveys (due to being too faint for previous studies). The PI has obtained most of the necessary data and will use the CAPSCam at Las Campanas Observatory to get the rest of the observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include training and mentoring a postdoctoral researcher, and undergraduate students participating in the Carnegie Summer Scholars program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This project measured distances to a statistically significant sample of individual stars with masses less than one solar mass in nearby young stellar associations.  Prior to this project, distances to the low mass members of young associations, those of age 5 - 10 Myr, were scarce, and luminosities for individual stars had to be calculated using an average distance to the association. It was a goal of this project to explore the range of ages within each association and, in particular, to measure how long circumstellar disks last.   A special purpose camera, CAPSCam, at the Carnegie Institution's 2.5 m du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, was used to obtain trigonometric parallaxes (distances), which requires many images of the same stellar field taken over years.   For the TW Hydrae Association, a loose grouping of about 50 nearby young stars, we measured distances to 14 stars and found an average age for the association of 8.7 +/- 1.2 million years (Myr). We were also able to add new stars the association, and eliminate previously suggested stars, based on their distances and motions across the sky. We analyzed the motions of the stars through the Galaxy and showed that the association was never much more compact in the past than it is today.    We measured the distances to 55 low-mass stars in Upper Scorpius, which is one of the nearest massive associations of young stars. Most of the stars in this group lack the raw materials for planet formation, which are found in disks of dust and gas around young stars.  We observed stars in Upper Scorpius with and without disks and obtained distances to 31 stars with disks and 21 without disks, as well as three for which it is not known if they have disks.   We inferred ages of the individual stars by combining our measured parallaxes with theoretical models of how young stars evolve. Our published work on Upper Scorpius finds there is a significant difference in the ages of stars with and without circumstellar disks. The stars without disks have a mean age of 4.9 +/- 0.8 Myr and those with disks have an older mean age of 8.2 +/- 0.9 Myr.  This is a counterintuitive result because other work has shown that disks disappear over time.   Our result suggests that disk and stellar evolution are closely intertwined, so that the apparent age of a star may depend on its history, and the presence of a disk may also depend in a related way on the star?s properties and history.     We also collected data to measure distances to stars in the Chamaeleon star forming region, which is younger than the two associations already described. Many of the stars in this group were close binary stars, and this had a deleterious impact on our ability to measure precise distances. We have a preliminary distance to the association as well as follow-up data on the binary stars.
