<AbstractNarration>Conference title: "Frontiers of Hierarchical Modeling in Observational Studies, Complex Surveys and Big Data"&lt;br/&gt;Dates: May 29-31, 2014&lt;br/&gt;Location: University of Maryland at College Park &lt;br/&gt;Conference website: http://www.jointprogram.umd.edu/ghosh/ &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference, titled "Frontiers of hierarchical modeling in observational studies, complex surveys and big data," will cover a range of topics, which include Bayesian methods, random effects, hierarchical models, small area estimation, case-control studies, and large scale data analysis. The conference will promote the role of statistics in both interdisciplinary research and the general science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference is expected to have an impact on the next generation of statistical researchers and educators, through interaction with peers and senior professionals from academia, industries, and government agencies. The conference will have an excellent slate of plenary, invited, contributed, and poster sessions. In addition, a special plenary session will be organized for poster presenters to give three-minute highlights of their papers. During the regular poster sessions, the conference attendees will have ample time to discuss their research. Students will be selected for travel awards based on their submitted papers/posters. The event will provide a forum for junior researchers and students from diverse backgrounds to interact with respected senior leaders in the field and with one another. While selecting the recipients, special consideration will be given to women and minority students.</AbstractNarration>
