<AbstractNarration>This project is being supported under a special funding focus for STEP, "Graduate 10K+," an activity of the National Science Foundation, supported in part by donations from the Intel Foundation and the GE Foundation, to stimulate comprehensive action at universities and colleges to help increase the annual number of new B.S. graduates in engineering and computer science by 10,000 over the next decade.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Washington (UW) and Washington State University (WSU) are collaborating in an activity to develop and implement the Washington State Academic RedShirt (STARS) program to increase the retention rates of economically and educationally disadvantaged students who are incoming freshmen in engineering through a first-year curriculum that prepares these talented and highly motivated students for pre-engineering coursework. The STARS program is providing access to engineering degrees for 64 students per year from low-income (as defined by Pell Grant eligibility) and educationally disadvantaged backgrounds (as defined by high schools in Washington State with 50% or more of the students on free or reduced priced lunch).  The project's goal is to increase the number of economically and educationally disadvantaged students graduating with engineering degrees from WSU and UW by 225 annually.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in the innovative and focused program based on effective evidence-based interventions to improve the success of first-year engineering students.  The STARS program is adapted from the successful GoldShirt program at the University of Colorado at Boulder.  STARS is strengthening the students' academic preparation and learning skills, connecting the students to a supportive academic and social community, providing personal and effective academic advising and counseling, building a clear and compelling understanding of the engineering profession, and providing significant financial support.  During the students' first year at WSU and UW, they are receiving intensive support for developing the academic and learning skills required to be successful in engineering through interventions such as a first-year academic preparation curriculum and residential living-learning communities. During the second year, STARS students are continuing to be actively supported as they transition to a standard pre-engineering curriculum.  The STARS program is expected to significantly increase student retention to the upper division, allowing STARS students to complete engineering degrees.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's broader impacts are being realized in the comprehensive and coordinated interventions that increase the number of minority and economically disadvantaged students pursuing, succeeding, and earning degrees in engineering.  This activity, along with the ongoing activities focused on supporting community college and transfer students in STEM, presents a model for statewide collaboration across universities and community colleges to increase the retention and graduation rates in STEM.  Moreover, robust strategies and strong relationships with existing programs for recruiting underrepresented minorities, women, and economically disadvantaged students are being leveraged to recruit STARS candidates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of Washington (UW) and Washington State University (WSU) were awarded a collaborative grant by the National Science Foundation to establish the Washington STate Academic RedShirt (WA STARS) program.  The STARS program provides highly motivated students from low-income backgrounds with a specialized first-year curriculum designed to build learning skills and academic preparation.  While specifically targeting students from academically and economically disadvantaged backgrounds, the STARS program also sought to increase the number of undergraduate engineering degrees awarded to underrepresented students.  The STARS program had several institutional-level goals including:  Increase by 225 the total number of engineering and computer science degrees awarded at WSU and UW. Retain 75% of STARS students to the upper division of an engineering program. Increase by 50% the retention of Pell Grant-eligible students who enter WSU and UW directly as freshman to the upper division of an engineering program. Increase by 20% the number of underrepresented minorities pursuing engineering degrees.   To accomplish these high-level goals, STARS targets students who are US citizens or permanent residents with the following characteristics:  Have a clearly articulated interest in engineering. Are Pell grant-eligible. Attended a Washington State high school with 30% or more of students on free or reduced-priced lunch. Are a first-generation college student.5) Are behind their peers in Math.   WA STARS has been successful in meeting most of its five-year goals within four years, both at the institutional level and the student level.  In the first four years of the program, STARS programs at UW and WSU served 233 students and most were retained in engineering.  Of the first four cohorts of students who completed the STARS program, 91% were enrolled in engineering in the fall of their sophomore year, 86% of students in the third cohort were enrolled in engineering in the fall of their third year, and 100% of students in the fourth cohort were enrolled in engineering in the fall of their second year.  STARS students also have more confidence in their academic abilities than their peers after a full year of participation in the program and receive higher grades in math and science courses.  The high levels of retention and academic performance among STARS students result from the social and academic support provided through the program.  Focus groups and surveys conducted with students participating in STARS and a group of students eligible for the program but not participating consistently reveal that STARS students feel a stronger sense of belonging in engineering, identity as engineers, and certainty in their choice to pursue engineering as a career.  The success of WA STARS has made it a model for other programs.  In the fourth year of STARS, UW and WSU joined with four other universities to form the Redshirt in Engineering Consortium.  This Consortium will strengthen existing Redshirt programs at the UW, WSU, and the University of Colorado Boulder, and help to build new Redshirt programs at Boise State University, the University of California San Diego, and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.  Through the support provided by this collaborative effort, WA STARS has expanded the number of students it serves, developed sophomore programming, and added a faculty mentorship component.  Participation in the Redshirt in Engineering Consortium will allow STARS to continue improving the already strong programming it provides.
