<AbstractNarration>Our understanding of tropical meteorology and its ability to influence the middle latitudes is the major stumbling block to increasing medium term (two week) weather prediction over the United States (midlatitudes). In this project, the PI proposes to study multiscale asymptotics for the PDEs which govern tropical atmospheric waves and their connection to midlatitude waves, extending the PI's  previous work in the field. The three aspects of this project are: (1) A boundary layer asymptotic analysis connecting tropical waves in the weak temperature gradient approximation to quasi-geostrophic mid-latitude waves through a new subtropical matching layer; (2) The effect of the (large scale) climatological flow (the Hadley circulation) and the sub-grid circulation (moist convection) on the Intraseasonal Multiscale Moist Dynamics models of tropical waves and the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO). This involves the derivation of a closed planetary scale description of the MJO using the PI's stochastic sub-grid models and multi-scale asymptotic theory; (3) The analytic and numerical study of three non-linear PDEs - two of which are non-local - which arise from the analysis of tropical atmospheric waves.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dynamics of the atmosphere in the middle latitudes has long been studied as a problem of both practical interest (for understanding weather patterns over North America and Europe) and of theoretical interest (since the equations which govern atmospheric dynamics displayed a rich set of behavior as soon as scientists began studying them). More recently, however, we have realized that the tropical atmosphere also provides an enormous set of unsolved problems both for practical purposes and for mathematical theory. Computer simulations have shown that a better understanding of tropical atmospheric dynamics will not only improve our understanding of tropical weather but it will greatly increase our understanding of weather patterns in the middle latitudes, thereby improving weather predictions over North America and Europe. This project focuses on two general phenomena: (1) how tropical weather is organized on very large scales and (2) how tropical weather patterns interact with midlatitude weather patterns and thereby modify midlatitude weather. In the process of studying these phenomena, the PI has found new simplifications to the complicated equations of atmospheric dynamics - these equations are approximations which elucidate the important aspects of tropical organization and tropical/midlatitude interactions. This work is an example of scientific problems creating new mathematics and careful mathematical analysis creating better scientific theories.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Tropical Kelvin waves occur constantly in Earth’s atmosphere and ocean. They constitute an isolated and powerful component of the observed atmospheric wave spectrum, whereas oceanic Kelvin waves drive up- and downwelling in the Pacific Ocean thermocline, which affects the El Ni&ntilde;o&ndash;Southern Oscillation. In the atmosphere, Kelvin waves are initiated by and coupled to convective activity (storm systems), mostly over the Indian and the Western Pacific Oceans, whereas in periods of large-scale convective organization, such as the Madden-Julian Oscillation, equatorial Kelvin wave activity is suppressed.   Analysis of computational weather forecasts has determined that our ability to predict weather over North America is limited by our understanding of tropical weather.   The purpose of this grant has been to understand tropical waves, and their interactions with mid-latitude weather.   The intellectual merit of this line of research is to ultimately improve weather forecasting over the United states, and also to help understand the mechanisms which generate tropical waves, and which are currently not fully modeled by computer simulations.  Broadly speaking, modern applied mathematicians employ two techniques.  The first is analysis which means  the construction, and (often partial) solution of models of natural phenomena.  The second is numerics, which means computer simulations whose models and algorithms are developed by analysis.     The research conducted in this grant used computations and asymptotic analysis to arrive at the results we will present.  Asymptotic analysis is the careful, systematic approximation of equations (in this case the equations of atmospheric fluid dynamics) with an eye to elucidating the essential phenomena in the solutions.  Computation, also, is ultimately a method of approximation, but asymptotic analysis can often find more general properties of solutions, while computation finds one solution at a time.  In a series of papers with graduate students (funded by this grant) and other collaborators, the results of the project have been significant.  Our analysis has explained the lack of linear waves at the largest longitudinal sizes in the atmosphere.  This is a result that has been seen in observations, but never really questioned, much less explained.   We have shown that it is the north/south circulation of the atmosphere (the Hadley Circulation) which  precludes the formation of these longest waves with the criterion that if the convergence rate  of this circulation exceeds the frequency of the wave, then the wave cannot exist.   This result has major implications for the atmosphere since at these largest scale, a very complicated, non-linear wave packet called the Madden-Julian oscillation does exist.    We have speculated that the non-existence of the linear waves may channel energy into the nonlinear Madden-Julian oscillation.  We have also better understood the instability of east/west wind jets in the subtropical atmosphere.  We have found that, if the jets are fast enough to match the wave speeds, then they create an effectively coupled pair of waves - one which looks like an equatorial Kelvin wave, and the other which looks like a mid-latitude Rossby wave.   Each of these waves transport precipitation at their respective latitudes, so that this coupled mechanism  provides a strong tropical/midlatitude connection by which moisture from the tropics can be rapidly ejected into midlatitudes, and midlatitude waves can rapidly cause tropical convection.

All of these projects had in common the same basic asymptotic analysis which was used in the atmospheric science problems.    The broader impacts of this grant involve the funding and training of three female graduate students.   The grant funded one graduate student to the completion of her Ph.D. dissertation,  Dr. Amanda Back.  Dr. Back is now employed at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the Global Systems Division.
