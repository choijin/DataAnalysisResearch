<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to characterize sparse solutions to optimization problems arising from applications such as image processing and portfolio selection. The primary goal is to develop a new theoretical framework that will establish the existence of sparse optimal or approximate solutions to classes of intractable and non-convex quadratic optimization problems and derive precise probabilistic characterization of the sparsity of the sparsest optimal or approximate solutions to the underlying optimization problem. These theoretical results will be validated via comprehensive numerical experiments.  The exploited sparsity at the optimal solution will be used to design provably-good efficient algorithms for certain classes of quadratic optimization problems. The new algorithms developed in the project will be tested and compared with existing conventional approaches in the literature. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the project will not only transform understanding of sparse solutions and help solve several long-standing open problems in portfolio theory and optimization, but also provide effective tools for solving classes of non-convex quadratic optimization problems that are at present computationally intractable.  The tools developed through the project will have practical benefit in lowering investment risk via novel diversification techniques and in extracting meaningful patterns from different data sources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Sparse solutions to classes of optimization problems are crucial in various applications from different domains such as image processing and portfolio.  In this project, we focus on the class of quadratic optimization problem and show that the optimal solution to several classes of quadratic optimization problems  is guaranted to be sparse assuming that the Hessian matrix in the underlying optimization problem is generated from a certain distribution, and thus the problem is non-convex in general. Then, by exploring the sparsity at the solution, we design simple effective algorithm for the underlying optimization method.  The  results from the project helped to address several long-standing issues in optimization and portfolio selection, as well as issues from other fields such order statistics and financial engineering.  In the first half of the project, the PI and hiscollaborators focused on the theoretical study on sparse solutions in quadratic optimization. In the second half of the project, the PI and his collaborators focused on the design of effective algorithms for classes of nonconvex quadratic optimization from other field such as financial engineering.   Three PhD students have received partial support from the project, and one has successfully graduated in 2014, and now working as an assitant professor in academy.  Nice peer reviewed papers have been published based on results from the project. One PhD student supported by the project has received two research excellence awards from both the  industrial and academic community.
