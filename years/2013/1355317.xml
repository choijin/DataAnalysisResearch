<AbstractNarration>The proposal seeks to develop and optimize a novel approach for detection of a blood borne marker (Troponin I) associated with cardiovascular disease.  This biomarker has been shown to have predictive value in diagnosis of myocardial infarctions. Therefore, it is important to monitor such biomarker rapidly and onsite - either in the first responder vehicle or in the emergency room.  This proposal addresses the need for rapid detection of troponin by simplifying traditional sandwich immunoassay/ELISA used for analysis of this biomarker.  This simplified assay will use just one antibody/one step for detection of troponin and will involve a novel mutant antibody oriented on the surfaces of the biosensor in a controlled manner.  Troponin binding to this to this fluorescently labeled antibody will result in the change of fluorescence intensity.  Successful completion of this project may lead to future development of biosensor for rapid, point of care diagnosis of myocardial infarctions.</AbstractNarration>
