<AbstractNarration>The Innovation Institute: From Problem to Product (I2) takes high school students through the entire process of inventing a device, software or other technology. This proposal makes use of a Makerspace at the New York Hall of Science (NYSCI), which is located in a community with a high proportion of both immigrant and low-income residents. I2 builds on NYSCI experience with the Maker movement and leverages its Explainer program (where high school students who work as exhibit or program facilitators) by providing: 1) a product prototype/design program for high school Explainers and 2) afterschool and Saturday activities for middle school students, with mentoring provided by the Explainers. It will serve a total of 60 high school students (20 in each cohort) and 1000 elementary and middle school students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using a quasi-experimental design, the project evaluation addresses these questions: &lt;br/&gt;1. Does engaging in the process from design to product, emphasizing entrepreneurship, engineering, and the use of technology, lead to Explainers':  Deeper learning and 21st century skills?; STEM and ICT knowledge, skills, dispositions?; and Persistence in the STEM workforce? &lt;br/&gt;2. Does transferring the learning to younger students lead to deeper learning on the part of the Explainers (transfer and self-regulated learning), increased knowledge of the engineering process, and increased knowledge and skills in using technologies? &lt;br/&gt;3. Does participating in design-based activities increase middle and elementary students' positive attitudes, engagement and interest in STEM and STEM careers and lead to the perception of Explainers as role models? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will disseminate a replication handbook for scaling up the model and project evaluation reports. Project results will be further disseminated through articles submitted to peer-reviewed academic journals, workshops presented at museum conferences, and articles in other publications such as Make Magazine, a publication that targets those in the Maker movement.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  To help address the ongoing challenge of underrepresentation of women and other groups in STEM, research and program staff at the New York Hall of Science (NYSCI) established the Innovation Institute (I2), which offers solutions to broadening participation in STEM by taking young people through the entire iterative process of inventing a device, software, or other technology. The literature provides evidence that design and making lead to deeper learning skills of transfer and self-guided learning&mdash;critical skills for the 21st century. I2?s overall approach stresses STEM content and process in engineering, entrepreneurship, and innovation, and links to a critical national priority: creating renewed interest in scientific and technological innovation, particularly among young people. Over the course of three years, project staff worked with three diverse cohorts of New York City public high-school students recruited from a larger pool of participants in NYSCI?s Science Career Ladder (SCL) program, all of whom work as docents on the museum floor (called "Explainers") while also attending a wide variety of professional development and training opportunities. (A majority of Explainers are girls and young women, and many are also from first- or second-generation immigrant families.) Participating Explainers moved through the entire process of inventing a device, software, or other technology while learning about STEM content and processes and their relationships to engineering, entrepreneurship, and innovation. Each cohort of high-school students devoted 15 months to the project. They conducted design research in Corona, Queens, a largely first-generation immigrant community of families from Mexico and Central America, and created products of value to that neighborhood. They also shared what they learned about design research, entrepreneurship, and making with middle- and elementary-school students at several culminating events. Significant project outcomes included the following: 1. Structuring I2 as an internship added value to the program: Both staff and Year 3 participants indicated that participating in an internship was a key part to recruitment and interns? persistence in the program. Staff reported greater ease in recruiting when the opportunity was labeled as an internship. Focus group participants indicated that both listing the internship on resumes and college applications and being paid were reasons for choosing to become involved and stay involved in the program. 2. Although challenging at times, the emergent and adaptable nature of the curriculum promoted youth ownership of their projects: The purposefully emergent curriculum of the I2 program led to youth demonstrating increased ownership of their ideas and projects. At first, interns faced challenges coming up with ideas to develop and managing their time to complete projects; at times, staff found the program complex to manage given its youth-driven nature. Upon reflection, program staff relayed anecdotes in which interns who were less outspoken at the start of the program later expressed commitment to the success of their final project.  3. Developing relationships was as important as building interns? STEM knowledge, skills, and dispositions: Rather than focus only on the design process and building interns? STEM content knowledge and skills, program staff intentionally planned activities for interns to build relationships with program staff and with one another. 4. I2 focused on exposure: As staff and focus group participants explained, some of the opportunities to develop STEM knowledge, skills, and dispositions included an exposure to things they had not had access to before participating in the program. These new aspects included the process of design, Making tools, STEM workplaces, STEM professionals, NYSCI, a diverse range of museum guests, and presenting in front of large and small audiences. 5. I2 provided opportunities for continued engagement: Although the program for each cohort ran just over one year, NYSCI and the program staff offered interns opportunities to remain involved with NYSCI and the STEM workforce through programs like NYSCI?s Explainers.
