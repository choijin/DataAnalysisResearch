<AbstractNarration>This ITEST strategies project is providing high school students with experiences in robotics to galvanize their interest in STEM and prepare them for STEM programs at the college level. The project is delivering a pre-engineering experience, advanced math coursework, and project-based instruction.  High school teachers receive technical training to build their STEM teaching competencies. 112 underrepresented students are being recruited from 5 high schools in the Cleveland Metropolitan School District. The project plan includes dual-enrollment, tutoring, mentoring and other support mechanisms. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal builds on the successes of a previous project (ATE-0603427) and addresses the lessons learned from that project. That project successfully stimulated STEM interest in about 200 high school students from Cleveland. It is remarkable that 100% of the students who completed the project graduated from high school and 87% enrolled in higher education, 70% at Cuyahoga CC. However, a follow-up study revealed that only 6 students completed a 2-year degree in a STEM field, because most of the rest were unable to overcome barriers, particularly the remedial mathematics courses.  This proposal addresses the need to better prepare students for college, especially mathematics, and provide better supports while continuing with the activities that were successful at generating student interest in STEM. The project team includes Cuyahoga Community College, Cleveland MSD, and Cleveland State University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The evaluation will addresses the following goals: 1) Encourage students' readiness for and interest in STEM careers and increase the number of students pursuing technical/engineering degrees; 2) Decrease the need for remedial math coursework in post-secondary education; 3) Equip teachers with the resources to ensure that their students consider and are prepared for the STEM workforce of the future; and 4) Develop a new robotics competition based on the Arduino platform, and measure its efficacy to engage youth.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The STEM Academy for Youth featuring Youth Essential Skils - SAY-YES! project for Cuyahoga Community College's Youth Technology Academy sought to find the solutions to several key issues that students from underrepresenteded populations face when it comes to pursing STEM studies and careers.Our goals included: 1. Encourage students' readiness for, and interest in post secondary STEM studies and STEM professions. 2. Reduce the need for remedial math coursework among students matriculating from CMSD to post-secondary education. 3. Equip teachers with the resources to ensure their students consider, and are prepared for, entering the STEM workforce in the future. 4. Develop a new robotics competition using the Arduino platform, and use the competitions to engage youth and increase youth participation. Over the life of the project, YTA has worked to succesfully reach each of these goals.&nbsp;</p> <p>Over the four years, we have been able to serve over 400 students within the Cleveland Metropolitan School District, growing our enrollment numbers each year of the project. We were able to provide in school college-level engineering courses covering various subjects, growing the number and variety of courses as our numbers grew. As we added more students to the program, we were also able to introduce different technical workshops for any students within the Cleveland area, even for students who may not&nbsp;have had the option of taking one of our college courses. As the project progressed, we found it necessary to add a variety of STEM camps and workshops so as to appeal to a larger number of students with varied interests. In addition to camps and workshops, we also focused on exposing our students to a large variety of STEM careers through career nights, company visits, and working alongside industry mentors. We found that most students had not had the opportunity to fully explore what STEM careers were available to them, so we made sure to provide students with these opportunities.&nbsp;</p> <p>In regards to math readiness, we made sure to embed college-level math standards into each course offered, as well as within our workshops and camps. We also created Math in Motion, a course aimed at helping students increase their math understanding and test into college-level math courses. Math in Motion used a highly adaptive teaching technique combining math concepts with "academic soft skills" to make sure students had all the tools they required to succeed in college-level math. Though only a small group participated in the course in year four (21 finished both semesters), six of those students were able to test directly into college math by the end of the course, with a total of nine students increasing their scores enough to skip at least some remedial math courses. We found that Math in Motion had a significant impact on not just students' performance, but also their attitude towards math in general. Most students felt more confident in their math and academic abilities by the end of the course.&nbsp;</p> <p>Throughout the four years of the project, we held many technology training workshops and bootcamps for local teachers. We made sure to supply each teacher with the tools they needed to teach various courses, as well as asked for input on what they felt students needed to succeed academically. Teachers were also encouraged to assist with student workshops and camps so that they could build one on one relationships with students.&nbsp;</p> <p>The development of new competitions for students allowed us to engage students in a number of different ways, creating a variety of competitions depending on the courses taught. Students were able to take whay they had spent the semester building and compete against classmates, allowing them to see their projects in action. We were also able to host an annual competition at Cedar Point Amusement Park where students who performed well at their home schools could come and compete against students from other high schools. We found that students were more motivated to learn and apply what they learned in class when competitions were part of the curriculum.&nbsp;</p> <p>Overall, the SAY-YES! project had a significantly larger impact than we originally anticipated. We were able to grow our program from teaching just robotics to including a large variety of technologies in our curricula. The project also allowed us to move beyond the classroom, and impact the community via workshops, camps, and career exploration. It is our plan to apply what we have learned from the project and continue to apply it to various programs within Youth Technology Academy.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/05/2017<br>      Modified by: George&nbsp;Bilokonsky</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
