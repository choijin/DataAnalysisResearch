<AbstractNarration>Through the Mentors Enable, Connect, Help, Advocate, Nurture, Intervene, Sustain, and Motivate (MECHANISM) project a team of faculty and administrators at Pitzer College is increasing the number of academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn baccalaureate degrees in chemistry, biochemistry, or molecular biology. The project is recruiting sixteen first-year students with the goal of retaining them to graduation in the selected STEM fields through a comprehensive program of student development that emphasizes the value of utilizing academic resources. In providing increased access to these majors, the project is contributing to the enlargement of the STEM workforce that can help meet regional and national needs. In addition, to broaden participation, students from groups that are under-represented in the sciences - African American, Latino(a) American, Asian American/Pacific Islander, and Native American (ALANA) - are actively being recruited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical features of the project implementation involve students in an array of opportunities including (a) learning from peer mentors (tutoring and supplemental instruction), (b) improving written communication skills (Writing Center), (c) experiencing other cultures (Study Abroad), (d) creating peer networks and practicing high-level reasoning skills (Howard Hughes Medical Institute Summer Immersion Program), (d) contributing to cutting-edge research, and (e) participating in internships. Data generated through assessment and evaluation is expected to support the rationale that high retention of students in STEM fields is achievable through cultivation of "cultural capital," (e.g. dispositions, attitudes, and beliefs related to students' academic success throughout their academic careers). Project evaluation focuses on student academic engagement and use of support services, student content knowledge, and faculty feedback. Moreover, the project expects to track its students after graduation and interview them about the project's ongoing impact. Dissemination of the project results is expected to provide a model for how helping STEM students develop cultural capital can be used as a means of retaining them through graduation.  The project team plans to present its work through Teaching and Learning Centers in the Claremont Colleges Consortium as well as through national meetings of the American Chemical Society.</AbstractNarration>

The major goals of the project were to provide scholarships to two cohorts of students (16 students total) who demonstrated financial need, academic ability, and who majored in a Science, Technology, Engineering, or Math (STEM) field.
