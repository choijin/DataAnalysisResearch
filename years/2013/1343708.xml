<AbstractNarration>This NUE in Engineering program entitled, "NUE: Multifunctional Nanostructures for Integrated Electrical, Chemical, Mechanical and Geological Applications: A Multidisciplinary Laboratory Education Program", at Mississippi State University (MSU), under the direction of Dr. Priscilla Hill, will be a collaborative effort between the Colleges of Engineering and Arts &amp; Sciences. This exciting new educational approach builds upon the research collaborations of faculty in nanoparticle synthesis/characterization, nanowire fabrication/device development, nano-electromagnetics, geo-nanomaterials, and nanomechanics; and builds on a recently developed nanotechnology certificate program. This recently developed certificate program consists of lecture classes with little simulation or laboratory experience. The proposed laboratory education program will address these deficiencies by (a) developing a new laboratory course to accompany a recently developed nanotechnology-intensive lecture course, (b) developing simulation modules for four courses including two core courses and two nanotechnology-intensive courses, and (c) developing laboratory modules for six courses including two nanotechnology-intensive courses. The proposed program has strong support across two colleges and five departments and would be easily accessible for any MSU student enrolled in science or engineering (~5000 students). Professional audio/video documentation of the nanotechnology modules will help to recruit students into the program while fostering outreach through existing university mechanisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students will be excited about nanotechnology via professional audio/video materials, course content, laboratory experiments and projects and simulation projects. Outreach to K-12 students will be performed through the NanoClub. There will be active recruitment of students from underrepresented groups for this program.  In addition, significant impact is anticipated with university/industry collaborations including technology commercialization and development of spin-off businesses.  By equipping students with stronger interdisciplinary background in nanotechnology, this NUE will further promote MSU technology commercialization, helping to create new local employment opportunities and opportunities for student co-op/training.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A diverse team of faculty is offering a nanotechnology education program with support from an NSF Nanotechnology Undergraduate Education (NUE) award.   Because nanotechnology impacts a number of fields including electronics, mechanics, geology, and materials, this program provides education across a range of fields including aerospace, chemical, electrical, and mechanical engineering as well as geological sciences.  The main benefit of this program is that it has added hands-on experiences including laboratory experiments and computer simulations to better educate undergraduates. While students learn from traditional class room experiences, many students better understand concepts when they can observe phenomena themselves.  These hands-on activities are not limited to recently developed nanotechnology intensive courses, but they are also incorporated in required courses.  As a result, students from a wide variety of majors are impacted.  The program includes an outreach program for K-12 students through an after school enrichment program named the NanoClub.  This operates through the local Boys and Girls Club of Starkville and primarily involves 5th and 6th grade students.  This program uses fun activities to teach the students some of the concepts involved in nanotechnology.  For example, students observed and competed with each other to see who could make a paper clip float on water.  They had to explain the "what" and "why" from their observations.  The students loved competing with each other and learning more about surface tension.  Other activities the students enjoyed were comparing the behavior of regular sand and "nanosand" (sand coated with silica) in oil and water.
