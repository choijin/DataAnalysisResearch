<AbstractNarration>The proposed project seeks financial support for the participation of student, underrepresented groups and young researchers in a conference to be held at the Gaylord Hotel Convention Center, National Harbor, MD, from August 25 to 30, 2013.. The International Conference on Nitride Semiconductors ICNS10 will address research areas in Wide bandgap group-III nitrides. This annual meeting offers an important forum to review and identify all aspects of energy efficiency electronics, infrared and solid state lighting. The topics are divided into twelve sections and the committee has assembled a group of invited speakers, experts in the field, for each section: Bulk and Template Growth, Epitaxial Growth and Structural Properties, Nanostructures and Novel Nitride Alloys, Light Emitting Diodes and Improving Efficiency, Lasing and Laser Diodes, Power and High Frequency Devices, Optical and Magnetic Properties, Solar Cells and Energy Harvesting, Device Fabrication and Reliability, InN and Related Materials, Theory and Modeling of Materials and Devices, Sensors and Photodetectors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 10th International Conference on Nitride Semiconductors (ICNS-10) presented high-impact scientific and technological advances in materials and devices based on group-III nitride semiconductors.  Hosted in Washington DC, the conference featured plenary sessions, parallel topical sessions, poster sessions and an industrial exhibition.  The exhibit offered the most direct access to researchers from around the world who are seeking technical solutions to their challenges.  Two primary objectives were to (1) implement and increase information exchange and collaboration among academic, industrial, and government scientists and policy makers to accelerate scientific and technological advances; and (2) provide to young scientists, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty members a great opportunity to present their most recent research results and to interact with worldwide recognized experts in the nitride research area.  The plenary and contributing invited speakers sessions included scientists and engineers whose research work has resulted in major breakthroughs in specific nitride semiconductor research areas such as ultraviolet emitters and detectors, sensors, solar cells, and high-power and high-frequency electronic devices.  Despite the ongoing global economic climate, the conference was very well attended with 893 participants from 31 countries.  The steady attendance is testament to the continuing development of III-nitrides as a material for a wealth of applications including those needed for a 'greener' world with applications in both more powerful and efficient lighting, electrical power transmission, and electrical vehicles.  The field continues to grow and diversify; and as a result, for the first time, the conference series ran four parallel sessions covering the entire spectrum of III-nitride semiconductor research and application, extending to cover newer, or less developed concepts such as solar cells and sensor applications.  The organizers received 184 submissions for the conference proceedings to be published in Physica Status Solidi.  Of these, 177 have been accepted for publication in a special volume, with 37 being accepted for the special sections:  Phys.Status Solidi A and B.  NSF funding for this conference provided travel support for invited speakers and graduate and undergraduate students who, otherwise, would not have been able to attend the conference.
