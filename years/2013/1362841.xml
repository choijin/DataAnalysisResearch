<AbstractNarration>Through this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Division of Chemistry supports work by Professor Gary Molander of the University of Pennsylvania in developing synthetic approaches to a class of fluorinated organic compounds.  The presence of fluorine in organic molecules is known to have profound effects upon bioavailability and/or stability.  Families of versatile, stable, perfluoroalkyl-substituted building blocks are being constructed that can be installed in large fragments through the development of a variety of carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom protocols.  Success in these regimes will provide methods for the synthesis of organic molecules with extensive fluorination, expanding and creating novel chemical space by methods that increase molecular complexity in highly convergent yet modular synthetic processes.  These highly flexible, prefabricated subunits thus provide a platform around which to build libraries of molecules for investigation of their properties within the context of the pharmaceutical or agrochemical industries, for example, facilitating the discovery of novel compounds with unique properties and providing these industries new tools to bring innovative molecules to the market more efficiently and at lower cost.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The importance of embedding fluorine atoms within organic molecules to alter their physicochemical and biological properties has been firmly established, and thus the selective introduction of trifluoromethyl groups, as well as polyfluorinated alkyl groups, has consequently been of high interest to the synthesis community. Most of these efforts have supported the installation of fluoro- or trifluoromethyl groups onto aromatic systems. By contrast, general methods for the incorporation of functionalized, perfluorinated subunits into alkyl systems, particularly in an enantioselective manner, is much less well developed, yet increasingly more important in terms of structural diversity and expanding chemical space.   The research to be carried out will allow the development of operationally simple and effective routes to borylated organofluorine materials.  The first subgoal of the investigations is to develop convenient syntheses of a diverse family of stable, polyfluorinated alkylboron reagents to be used for the incorporation of perfluoroalkyl units into alkyl substructures.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported efforts in the group to place fluorine atoms into carbon-based (organic) molecules.  All pharmacologically active small molecules (prescription drugs) are carbon-based materials, and fluorine atoms embedded within these molecules impart many beneficial properties to them.  Thus, fluorine modulates both the physical and biological profile of these molecules in terms of properties such as their oral bioavailability, their interaction with specific protein targets in the body, and especially their ability to resist breakdown by enzymes in the body.  This latter property is particularly important because it leads to longer lifetimes of the drugs within the body, permitting lower doses to be prescribed for patients, thus saving money and dramatically reducing the possibility of negative side effects.  The group has developed several unique methods that allow the highly specific incorporation of fluorine-containing groups into carbon-based molecules that have promise for use in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries.  In addition to its use in pharmacologically active materials, fluorine is well-known for its use in cookware and many other applications in the form of Teflon.  Teflon imbues exceedingly useful properties to pots and pans, but one of its main drawbacks is that it does not break down in the environment - there are no organisms of any type that are known to degrade it, and thus it is destined to accumulate in the environment forever.  As another aspect of this NSF-funded program, we developed access to a material that appears to have many of the favorable properties of Teflon (e.g., low surface tension, low coefficient of friction, high chemical and thermal stability), but has the potential to be biodegradable.  A patent was issued to cover the invention resulting from the research.        Last Modified: 07/13/2018       Submitted by: Gary A Molander]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
