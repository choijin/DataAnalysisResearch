<AbstractNarration>Diets vary greatly across the globe, and our ability to digest foods depends on genes present in the human genome and bacteria found in the human gut (i.e., the gut microbiome).  Within the past few years, scientists have discovered that the gut microbiome has a very important influence on human physiology and can impact nutritional status, as well as disease risk.  Indeed, variation in the gut micriobiome is thought to play a role in obesity, malnutrition, auto-immune disease, and infectious disease susceptibility.  However, we do not know how much gut bacteria vary across diverse human populations, and what may account for that variation.  In addition, substantial variation exists for human genes involved in digestion, nutrition, and immunity, particularly for African populations.  By focusing on ethnically and geographically diverse Africans practicing a variety of human diets, this research project can significantly contribute to understanding these fundamentally important aspects of the biology of our species, addressing  fundamental questions about modern human history and the genetic basis of traits related to human biology and adaptation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will include field studies of three hunter-gather, three pastoralist, and three agriculturalist populations in Eastern, Central, and Southern Africa.  Data collected will include anthropometric measurements (e.g. height, weight, and body mass), DNA sequences of diverse Africans, lactose tolerance data, detailed information about diet and nutrition, and fecal samples (which will allow assessment of bacteria present in the gut microbiome). The gut microbiome data will be integrated with detailed information about nutrition, as well as anthropometric, metabolic, and genetic data, to better understand the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to human adaptation to diet.  For example, gut bacteria in pastoralists who drink large quantities of milk may be enriched for species that can metabolize the sugar lactose present in milk and, thus, may be informative for studying factors contributing to lactose tolerance, as well as for understanding gene, culture, and bacterial co-adaptation at a larger scale.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;The project will make a number of significant contributions to the fields of anthropology, genetics, microbiology, and evolutionary biology. Given the existing gap in our knowledge of African genetic and phenotypic diversity relative to other geographic regions, the publically-available data generated by the research will be an important resource for anthropologists, microbiologists, and genetic researchers, contributing to studies of human origins and the design and interpretation of disease association studies.  Additionally, because the gut microbiome has a large influence on nutrition, metabolism and immune response, this research project could have an important impact on understanding risk factors for diabetes, infectious disease and under-nutrition.  And through the collaborative research, this project also will contribute significantly to the research training of both American and African students and scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Global populations with different degrees of industrialization have shown marked differences in their gut microbial (GM) composition. Notably, &ldquo;Westernized&rdquo; microbiomes from individuals on processed diets largely derived from industrial agropastoralism show decreased diversity as compared to rural, non-industrialized groups practicing traditional forms of subsistence. Prior research has tended to focus on comparing individual populations from geographically disparate regions, which ignores the complex relationships with neighboring groups. The goal of this project was to characterize the GM composition of ethnically diverse Africans based on 16S RNA sequencing and examine correlations with diet, ancestry, and other environmental factors. We analyzed GM bacterial compositions of seven ethnically diverse rural populations in Tanzania and Botswana and a comparative urban cohort from Philadelphia, U.S.A., using 16S ribosomal sequence (16S rRNA V1-V2) classification. The seven African populations include two current or recent hunter-gatherer populations, three small-scale agropastoralist communities, and two current or recent pastoralists groups. A subset of Africans were genotyped on a 5M Omni SNP array, and this was used to test the relative impact of host genetic relatedness on compositional fitness. We find that GM diversity distances are strongly associated with host genetic similarity after controlling for geographic distance. Partitioning the bacterial abundance variation using linear mixed models indicates that several bacteria, most notably <em>Ruminococcus,</em> associate significantly with host relatedness. Some Botswanan Bantu agropastoralist GMs cluster close to U.S. samples, which could be the result of factors such as increased urbanization and industrialization. The mean bacterial diversity per host decreases from Tanzania to Botswana to the U.S., while the mean bacterial phylogenetic distances between individuals in the same population increases from Tanzania to Botswana to the U.S. Although the GMs of all populations have a similar rank order of most abundant bacteria, with <em>Prevotellaceae </em>and <em>Ruminoccocceae</em> as the two most abundant known taxonomic families, there is diversity in their relative abundances and in the presence/absence of lowly abundant bacteria. There is no clear signal of GM compositional "types" associated with subsistence lifestyle, and the evidence for unique single taxa that can distinguish pastoralism or hunter-gatherer life-style is marginal.
