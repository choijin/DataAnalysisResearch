<AbstractNarration>The thrust of this 3-year research program is to improve present understanding on two topics of fundamental importance for solar and heliospheric physics, namely: (1) the origin of suprathermal tails in the solar wind that have a common spectral shape in many different circumstances; and, (2) the behavior of the heliospheric magnetic field and the solar wind throughout the solar cycle.  By means of theoretical investigations, the project team aims to apply the Pump Acceleration mechanism to explain the spectral properties of suprathermal particles near the Sun.  Another aspect of the research includes tests of the basic principles of a theoretical model of the solar-heliospheric magnetic field developed by the PI during the current solar maximum, using both in-situ and spectroscopic observations.  The purpose of the research work is to provide a foundation for a predictive model of the solar wind.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project deals with fundamental properties of space plasmas, thus it has the potential for impact well beyond the discipline of heliospheric physics; e.g., the Pump Acceleration mechanism has been applied to accelerate galactic cosmic rays in the interstellar medium.  This project also has the important broader impact that the new concepts being developed are incorporated into the graduate education program at the University of Michigan, so that the next generation is encouraged to consider different ideas, and new ways to advance solar and heliospheric physics.  This project is also intended to support a female postdoctoral fellow to continue her development as a space scientist.  To summarize, the research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The underlying theme of this grant was to develop and establish as valid, fundamentally new concepts for three important problems in the heliosphere, the region of space carved out by the expansion of the solar atmosphere, the solar wind.  The first new concept was the coupling between the acceleration of the solar wind and the behavior over the 11-year solar cycle of the magnetic field of the Sun, particularly the component of the solar magnetic field that opens into and forms the heliosphere. The research supported by this grant demonstrated that the open magnetic flux  moves along the solar surface by reconnection with emerging magnetic loops, and this process also releases energy into the solar atmosphere that can contribute to the acceleration of the solar wind. The second new concept is the introduction of a new acceleration mechanism, a pump acceleration process that accelerates particles in regions of the solar wind with medium-scale compressions and expansions. The mechanism competes favorably with traditional acceleration of particles at shocks, and appears to be responsible for the acceleration of energetic particles in many settings in the solar wind, and possibly in other astrophysical settings. The third new concept concerns the interaction of the heliosphere with the local interstellar medium.  The Voyager spacecraft have been exploring the heliosheath, the region of space beyond the shock where the supersonic solar wind becomes subsonic, and inside the heliopause that separates the solar wind from interstellar gas. The Voyager investigators have claimed that Voyager 1 crossed the heliopause at 122 AU from the Sun.  Research supported by this grant resulted in a comprehensive model for the heliosheath, consistent with all Voyager observations, that argues that the Voyager investigators were wrong.  This controversy will persist until there are additional observations.          Last Modified: 08/24/2018       Submitted by: Lennard Fisk]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
