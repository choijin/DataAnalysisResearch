<AbstractNarration>Using energetics to understand the organization of stable mixed-species societies&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Mixed-species animal societies are ubiquitous in many communities, and range from fluid groups to ecologically stable associations with high fidelity by individual group members.  In some societies, certain species eavesdrop on alarm calls of other species, yet it is unclear what the overall costs and benefits are for each species and thus the nature of species interactions. In rainforests, mixed species bird groups take on the most extreme form of stability known, and attract other species on a facultative basis. The permanence of such stable animal societies sets the stage for the evolution of complex communication in which species eavesdrop on alarm calls of other species and where some species potentially deceive others with false alarm calls.   This project uses measurements of metabolic costs of flock members in and out of flocks to evaluate alternative hypotheses of how alarm calling and non-alarm calling bird species benefit from these associations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Multi-species flocks are crucial to the high diversity of tropical bird communities and are vulnerable to habitat degradation.  This project uses an integrative approach to ecology, incorporating physiology with behavior to evaluate the costs and benefits that drive the organization of stable mixed-species vertebrate societies.   It will also broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in science through the extension of inquiry-based science initiatives with rural Peruvian students and teachers, training opportunities for undergraduates, and the continuation of an inquiry-based field research design course for undergraduates from Latin America.</AbstractNarration>

Thus mixed species groups of animals are some of the most widespread examples in which species are hypothesized to use information from other species to lower predation risk and/or locate food resources. The aim of this project was to understand what factors drive the formation and stability of mixed species groups. In order to do this, a number of field experiments were conducted to evaluate the influence of different signals in maintaining multispecies group cohesion and movement patterns in an avian system of stable mixed species flocks in the amazon jungle of Peru. In these flocks, many species of birds respond to alarm calls from antshrikes (a bird species in the genus <em>Thamnomanes)</em>. These antshrikes provide vigilance for other species and it is hypothesized that several species of birds (up to 15 species) follow antshrikes and exploit habitats that would be too dangerous to forage in without information from an alarm-calling bird.&nbsp; For example, these risky habitats (e.g. areas where the forest is open) are frequented by ambush predators such as forest falcons. To test whether the species that listen for alarm calls use the information to forage in riskier habitat, a removal experiment was conducted to see if removal of the alarm-calling species causes a shift in habitat use by the remaining species in the flock.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The removals were implemented over short time periods, and the sentinel species were placed back into their flocks after the experiment.&nbsp; The experiment showed that experimental flocks (n=4) shifted habitat use dramatically when the alarm-calling species was absent, compared to control flocks (n=4) that did not shift habits during the same time period (Fig 1a, 1b). As predicted by the hypothesis, the remaining species in removal flocks shifted their habitat use to areas with denser vegetation (e.g. closed canopy and a higher presence of vine tangles). These areas presumably have lower predation from aerial predators that simply cannot maneuver in dense vegetation. Another important result of the experiment was that multi-species flock cohesion was lower in the absence of the alarm-calling birds, suggesting that there were decreased flocking benefits for the remaining species.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>These results are consistent with a number of other studies which have found that some species are more important than others in the formation, behavior and stability of multi-species groups.&nbsp; Understanding why certain species are influential in maintaining both the behavior and formation of the group is particularly important for understanding not only the basic biological roles of species on community ecology, but may also help predict whether the loss of particular species will disproportionately affect communities in areas being managed for the conservation of biodiversity. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/07/2016<br>      Modified by: Ari&nbsp;E&nbsp;Martinez</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1309320/1309320_10248307_1473293981255_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1309320/1309320_10248307_1473293981255_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Home Range Use of a Control Flock"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1309320/1309320_10248307_1473293981255_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Home Range Use of a Control Flock"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1 a) Habitat use by a mixed species bird flock used as a control in southeastern Peru, where blue= home range use when the main alarm calling species is present; red= home range use of the flock after the experimental removal of the alarm calling bird.</div> <div class="imageCredit">O.
