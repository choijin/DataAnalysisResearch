<AbstractNarration>1335478 (Geyer). The most significant environmental benefit of recycling and reuse is typically their potential to avoid or displace the production of equivalent materials and products from primary resources. This also means that lack of displacement would significantly reduce these environmental benefits. Unfortunately, the treatment of displacement in industrial ecology and life cycle assessment (LCA) is currently based on assumptions instead of scientific theory and evidence. The goal of this project is to advance dramatically the understanding of the causes, mechanisms and dynamics that govern displacement of primary production due to material recycling and product reuse. The project will achieve this by integrating pertinent economic concepts and methods into the analytical frameworks of industrial ecology and LCA. The resulting consequential analysis framework will use market models to determine the interaction between primary and secondary products and materials and thus estimate displacement. These models will account for supply and demand dynamics, competition between imperfect substitutes, and market growth and segmentation. The framework will be tested in several case studies. The case studies will include econometric analyses in order to determine pertinent economic parameters for key products and materials, and thus estimate actual displacement rates. The results from the research will be used to develop recommendations for the treatment of displaced production due to reuse and recycling in LCA, product-based greenhouse gas accounting, and product category rules for type III eco-labels. It will also be used to identify public and corporate reuse and recycling policies and incentives that foster and maximize displacement. Improved understanding of displaced production due to reuse and recycling has the potential to lead to significant improvements in public and corporate reuse and recycling policies. It will also enable science-based treatments of reuse and recycling in LCA methodology, greenhouse gas accounting standards, and environmental product declarations. The research will have direct impact on higher education through a multi-disciplinary graduate seminar and research opportunities for one PhD and two undergraduate students. The project will also provide pre-college research opportunities for high school students through the UCSB Research Mentor Program, which provides research opportunities for students from underfunded high schools. Public interest in the research findings will be served through outreach activities, including the design and presentation of webinars and a dedicated project website that will contain all public data, models, and materials, and will continue to be maintained beyond the duration of the research project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project studied if, how, and to what extent reuse and recycling activities displace primary production activities. Prior to this project this issue was understudied and poorly understood, even though it is critically important to the theory and practice of reuse and recycling specifically, and industrial ecology/environmental sustainability more broadly.  The project was able to make several major intellectual contributions:  It      introduced and applied novel partial equilibrium modeling to describe the      interaction between primary and secondary materials, components, and      products. It      introduced and applied the notion of Circular Economy Rebound to      Industrial Ecology, i.e. the idea that reuse and recycling activities can      lead to an increase in overall materials and product use. It      introduced and applied the use of sophisticated econometric regression      techniques to Industrial Ecology, such as two-stage least square      regression and difference-in-differences.   It significantly advanced the material flow modeling of plastics.   The intellectual merit of these contributions is reflected in the large academic output of this project and the various awards this output received:  21      Conference and workshop presentations 10      peer-reviewed journal articles 4 book      chapters 2 PhD      theses Outstanding      Paper Award, 7th Annual ARCS Research Conference 2017      Graedel Prize, Journal of Industrial Ecology Best Paper Prize International      Statistic of the Year 2018, Royal Statistical Society Altmetric      Top 100 Articles 2017 (#29)   Our work has inspired research in many fields of science and engineering, evidenced by the fact that the publications from this project already received several thousand citations.  The project also had outstanding broader impact. Our research has been covered by media outlets all around the world, has been instrumental in the development and support of environmental public policy nationally and internationally, is being used by NGOs to inform and support their strategies and actions, and is also starting to being used by companies and industry associations to inform their environmental efforts. Below is a non-comprehensive list of broader impact measures:  Our work informed public policy such as the European Directive on Single-use Plastics, the European Strategy for Plastics in a Circular Economy, and California Assembly Bill1080 / Senate Bill 54. Our work is used by the National Academy of Sciences, National Geographic, Ocean Conservancy, The Nature Conservancy, Surfrider Foundation, and Oceana. One of our journal articles alone was mentioned by almost 400 media outlets. Our work on recycling, displacement, and plastic flows was covered by dozens of radio shows, many of them broadcast by the BBC and NPR. Our work (and the PI Roland Geyer) was featured on CBS Sunday Morning, CBS 60 Minutes, and PBS News Hour. Our work on plastics was turned into a cartoon by The Guardian, which had 70,000 shares so far. Our research (and the PI Roland Geyer) is featured in a short documentary by apparel company Patagonia, which had 1.5 million views on YouTube so far. Our work and data has inspired multiple art projects around the world.   We are truly humbled and honored by the impact that this project had on our colleagues, our field, and the public at large and would love the thank the National Science Foundation for its generous support through CBET Grant 1335478. Without this grant this research would not have been possible.       Last Modified: 01/24/2020       Submitted by: Roland Geyer]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
