<AbstractNarration>It is well known that some social behaviors can lead to increased extinction risk when populations are small.  For example, there can be a breakdown of group defense against predators when there are few individuals. However, less is known about the flipside -- how some social behaviors might protect small populations against extinction. Research supported by this grant is focused on an unusual social behavior called cooperative breeding, whereby offspring from one year forgo breeding to assist their parents in raising offspring the next year. It is proposed that this behavior can help populations survive after their habitat has been degraded. This is being studied in the White-breasted Thrasher, a cooperatively breeding bird that lives on two small islands in the Caribbean. This species is endangered, with only 1000 individuals remaining in the largest population. It is of particular interest because several years ago part of its habitat was impacted to create a resort. It is predicted that that groups with cooperative breeders will increase in size.  The proposed research combines field work with modeling to determine  the role cooperative breeding as a possible buffer to extinction and the extinction risk for this species.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to helping understand extinction risk, this work will contribute directly to conservation of an endangered species.  It is listed on the U.S. Endangered Species Act and is the second-most endangered cooperatively breeding bird in the world. Results from this research will inform management actions to reduce extinction risk of the species, including animal translocations, forest restoration, and nature reserve design. In addition, through organization of after-school workshops and mentoring of undergraduates, this work will use birds to educate young people from both the Caribbean and the US about biological diversity and scientific research.</AbstractNarration>

This species is endangered, with about 1000 individuals in the largest population left of the species. It is of particular interest because several years ago a significant part of its habitat was cleared to create a resort, allowing us to compare demographic (survival rate and reproduction) and behavioral data collected before, immediately after, and now 5+ years after habitat loss. We predicted that because of cooperative breeding behavior, family groups would increase in size after habitat loss but that reproductive success and survival would not be reduced. Although data analysis is ongoing, preliminary results suggest that group sizes reached a peak six years after habitat loss and then declined to pre-habitat loss levels, while reproductive rates remained relatively stable over that same time period. To our knowledge, no one has documented this temporary increase in cooperative breeding group size due to anthropogenic factors, and our results support the idea that cooperative breeding buffers populations against environmental disturbance.
