<AbstractNarration>The ability to perceive and respond to light is vital to plant growth and development. Previous work by the Principal Investigator (PI) has identified and characterized two genes (LRB1 and LRB2) in the model flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana that regulate responses to red wavelength light. Mutant plants with disruptions of these two genes are, among other things, more shade tolerant. The PI has used these mutants as a basis for novel genetic screens intended to identify additional genes that have roles in light perception and response. This project will use a variety of standard molecular, genetic, and biochemical approaches to study these genes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By identifying and characterizing genes which had not been previously implicated in light responses, this project will provide new insights into the mechanisms by which plants respond to their light environment. Shade responses are important in agriculture, as shading can reduce agronomic performance by increasing lodging (falling over), decreasing yield, and reducing plant defenses to pathogens and pests, therefore the information obtained in this project may help guide future work on light responses in crop plants. Also, the majority of work in this project will be conducted by undergraduate students at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire (a four-year public comprehensive university), significantly enhancing their education and making them more competitive and better prepared as they enter graduate/professional school or the workforce.</AbstractNarration>
