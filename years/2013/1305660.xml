<AbstractNarration>With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Jason Bennett at Penn State University, Erie, Professor Eva Zurek at SUNY Buffalo, and their groups will be studying electrodeposited dicyano-ferriprotoporphyrin as an electrocatalyst capable of selectively oxidizing hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in the body while in the presence of carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO), two known interferences. Selective in vivo detection of H2S is important for understanding the molecule's physiological and pathological roles, specifically with regard to understanding various neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.  This project is expected to result in a strategy for modifying an electrode with a material capable of selective H2S detection that can be incorporated into a future amperometric sensor capable of real-time in vivo measurements. The gained knowledge will hopefully lead to improved understanding and subsequently better treatments for neurological diseases.  &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;To accomplish this goal, the electrodeposition process of the porphyrin molecule onto an electrode surface and its subsequent interactions with H2S, CO and NO will be investigated using a variety of electrochemical, microscopic, and computational methods of analysis.  These studies will allow for the optimization of the material for future incorporation into an H2S gas sensor.  Additionally, this research will expand computation methods that will improve the general understanding of electrocatalytic reactions.  Undergraduate research students will be involved in all facets of this project to further integrate year-round research into their education experiences concurrent with the NSF mission and objectives of the Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) program.  The collaboration between Dr. Bennett at a predominantly undergraduate institution (PUI) and Dr. Zurek at a large research institution will both broaden the experience of the undergraduate researchers at PUI, allowing them to conduct research at a large university, as well as provide training to one of Dr. Zurek's graduate students on how to effectively mentor undergraduate research students and prepare him/her for a future teaching position at a PUI.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award focused on understanding the polymerization of an electrocatalytic molecule (dicyano-ferriprotoporphyrin; FePP) on an electrode surface in order to implement it into a sensor designed to selectively detect hydrogen sulfide, a gas produced in the body that is important in central nervous and cardiovascular system health.  This detection scheme is illustrated in Figure 1.  The research during this award determined that FePP readily adsorbs and polymerizes on electrode surfaces, however the coverage is better on carbon-based surfaces compared to metals like Pt.  Figure 2 shows atomic force micrographs of the actual FePP-coated electrode surfaces.      Computational modeling of interactions between iron porphyrin and a Pt surface showed that previous modeling using a commonly-used method, B3LYP, is not an accurate predictor for this system.  This work highlights the importance of weak van der Waals interactions between molecules and the surfaces to which they adsorb.  Additionally, the stability of the binding sites between the iron porphyrin and Pt was found to depend upon the number of iron-platinum and carbon-platinum bonds that were formed.  Figure 3 shows a model of the  FePP molecule with a Pt surface.  It is important to note that not all platinum surface atoms were specifically bound to an atom in the iron porphyrin.  Interestingly, despite complete coverage of the electrode surface by the FePP, as shown in Figure 2, the underlying electrode was still able to participate in electrochemical reactions.  This is likely due to the Pt atoms at the surface that are not bound specifically to atoms in the FePP (see Figure 3) being available to participate in other reactions.  This is important because our original sensor design utilized PtIr wires due to their dexterity, however this material is too active towards hydrogen sulfide if it diffuses through the FePP layer.  We will need to consider new sensor desgins to get around this problem.   One possible solution will be to coat the underlying metal electrode with a layer of graphene oxide prior to FePP polymerization.  We developed a protocol for depositing electrochemically reduced graphene oxide (ERGO), which is a carbon material, onto metal electrode surfaces.  Our protocol was able to yield a more consistently covered electrode surface that was much thicker, rougher, and more reduced than previous protocols.  This is shown in Figure 4.  The next step will be to determine how FePP polymierizes on it.  This award will aid in the development of a future needle-like sensor capable of in vivo hydrogen sulfide detection.  In vivo monitoring of hydrogen sulfide will help in understanding various central nervous and cardiovacular system ailments, such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's.  This award has significantly enhanced the education and training of 12 undergraduate and 2 graduate research students by enabling them to conduct cutting edge research year-round as well as gain soft skills, such as student mentoring and reseach presentation skills.  The skills gained by the undergraduate students, in terms of more research hours, access to more advanced instrumentation, and increased number of presentations (18 at regional and national conferences) has set these students up to succeed after college.  The 10 students who have graduated (2 will do so next year) are all either employed full time in the field, attending a chemistry PhD program or are in DO school.  The 2 graduate students at SUNY Buffalo who worked on this projected also gained skills that they will utilize in the future.  For example, the graduate student who has graduated is now a Tenure Track Assistant Chemistry Professor at an undergraduate university, and the experience from this award is helping him effectively mentor his current undergraduate research students.
