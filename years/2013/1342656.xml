<AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of Dr. Robert Kelly, Mr. Nathaniel Kitchel will examine the earliest human occupations of northeastern North America through an examination of the stone used by the first settlers of this region to produce tools.  The data produced during this study will provide a better understanding of large scale settlement processes at the end of the Pleistocene both in the Northeast and throughout the Americas.  This research will address questions of landscape learning and settlement patterns to explore how the first human groups moved into previously empty regions following the retreat of continental glaciers. Geochemical sourcing using nondestructive X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) technology of the fine grained stone used by prehistoric people to produce their tools will augment previous visual identifications of these raw materials.  This technique will be particularly advantageous in the case of stone that is difficult, if not impossible, to identify by visual means alone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite more than a century of research the timing and process of the peopling of the Americas remains poorly understood.  Many competing models that describe the first settlement of the New World during the Pleistocene exist.  Though these models vary in detail, each tends to fall into two categories; rapid and less rapid models.  These model types also make specific predictions about how these first peoples interacted with their technology, landscape, and environment. These models also however, derive many of their predictions from observations of the archaeology of "Clovis" or early fluted point archaeology. While users of these large distinctive stone projectile points were once thought to represent the first human occupation in the Americas recent discoveries indicate this may not be the case. This study will avoid questions of when the first humans arrived in the New World through an investigation of landscape learning and settlement practices in the recently deglaciated Northeast thereby controlling for the possibility of an earlier settlement in the region.  These data will be used to evaluate colonization models of the Americas providing a greater understanding of how modern human groups moved into the New World, as well as other large uninhabited landscapes such as Australia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data produced by this project will also have impacts beyond the immediate goals of this study.  Through the course of this project a library of chemical "fingerprints" for at least seven stone sources used to manufacture tools in the far northeast throughout prehistory will be created.  These data can be used by other researchers to investigate the movements of these resources throughout the prehistory of the region.  The raw data will be distributed online making all data produced available for public use.  This project will also engage the public through presentations and outreach with the New Hampshire State Conservation Rescue Archaeology Program (SCRAP) as well as public presentations at the University of Wyoming for the Wyoming Archaeological Society.  Mr. Kitchel will also present the findings of this study to the public through non-technical publications and talks to the public at the Fairbanks Museum in St. Johnsbury, Vermont.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The XRF (X-Ray Fluorescence) instrumental analysis undertaken for the improvement of Nathaniel Kitchel's dissertation project has been completed.  These analyses, along with geological field work was undertaken to better understand how Paleoindians, the first humans to live in the northeastern United States more than 12,000 years ago, gathered stone to make stone tools.  Patterns in the use of these special types of stone can help archaeologists understand how these people moved into a completely uninhabited landscape, and whether this process in the Northeast followed previously proposed models.  Currently 400 XRF measurements have undergone post processing to make these reading usable for statistical analyses.  Approximately 400 more remain to be processed.  Using the 400 available readings statistical and computational methods are being developed to facilitate further analysis of the entire dataset.  These methods will not only expedite comparisons of Paleoindian artifacts to samples taken from known quarry areas, but also readings taken on artifacts from all other samples from archaeological sites examined in this study.  Patterning between sites will help with the identification of materials from sources not sampled during the research as well as the identification of previously unknown raw materials.  Though the final analyses of all the samples run during this project preliminary results are already changing our understanding of Paleoindian toolstone procurement and the first settlement of the Northeast as a whole.  These results have shown Paleoindian groups accessed a great diversity of raw materials during both the early and middle fluted point periods (the time period of interest for this research).  These findings also indicate these first peoples gathered stone from sources that are still unknown to archaeologists.  It is also intriguing that the majority of the flow banded rhyolite (a specific type of stone) found in many paleoindian sites comes not from a source on Mt. Jasper, Berlin, New Hampshire as previously thought, but from a much more recently discovered source of a similar material found in Jefferson, New Hampshire.  Though these results are intriguing and exciting a more complete analysis of the data needs to be conducted before the full potential of these data to inform current understandings of the first human settlement of the Northeast can be realized.  Though these results are ongoing, final results are expected not earlier than the fall of 2015 when a comprehensive report of the findings of this study will be completed.  While these analyses remain ongoing as of August 2015 this project has already produce geochemical signatures, or fingerprints for hundreds of Paleoindian artifacts and geologic quarry samples the most ever undertaken in the region for this time period. These data are not available for use by other researches for comparison to other geochemically sourced items.  Such comparisons will facilitate future studies by other researches in the Northeast helping to further our understanding of tool stone transportation and landscape use patterns through time.  As the remainder of the XRF readings for this project are processed and analyzed these data will provide a clearer picture of Paleoindian settlement patterns and behaviors.  This research will also provide the information needed for Mr. Kitchel to complete his dissertation as well as provide new perspectives on the first settlement of the region which will then be presented to the public through the New Hampshire State Conservation Rescue Archaeology Program, as well as other groups of interested members of the public.  Overall this research has contributed greatly to our understanding of Paleoindian settlement practices in the Northeast as well as a foundation for understanding subsequent land use patterns.  This information forwards not just Paleoindian studies but the archaeology of subsequent groups, providing a greater understa...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
