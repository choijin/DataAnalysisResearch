<AbstractNarration>The proposal is  on the interplay between the representation theory of affine algebras, its standard maximal parabolic subalgebra, namely the current algebra, and the quantum affine algebra associated to a simple Lie algebra.  It focuses on the study of families of infinite-dimensional and level zero representations for each of these algebras and develops connections with Macdonald polynomials, Demazure characters and Schur positivity.  One of the goals is to establish a Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand type duality principle for these categories and to investigate the combinatorial and homological consequences of having such a duality.  Another goal of this proposal is to develop a connection between the homological properties of the category of infinite-dimensional representations of the quantum affine algebra and the tensor structure of this category.  The existence of such a connection is unexpected and somewhat mysterious and is suggested by some recent work of the PI.  It exists only at the quantum level and a deeper understanding of this should have a substantial impact on the study of this category. It should also also yield connections with recent work of others on cluster algebras and categorification.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study of affine Lie algebras and their quantum analogs have long had remarkable connections to a number of different fields including string theory, conformal field theory, topological field theory, infinite dimensional geometry and mathematical physics.  Many of the  themes of the project are motivated by  questions arising in solvable lattice models.  Representations of affine Lie algebras and the standard maximal parabolic subalgebras will capture important physical information.  The project will also provide a representation theoretic framework in which to understand various combinatorial problems.</AbstractNarration>

The representation theory of the quantum affine algebra is a deformation of that of the affine Lie algebra but with some interesting non-trivial  differences. For instance, an irreducible representation in the deformed case become a reducible although decomposable representation in the  undeformeb case. This kind of phenomenon usually occurs only when working in positive characteristic and it was suprising to see this happen in a characteristic zero case.  The project studied many natural questions around this idea. One of the important achivements of the research supported by this grant was the connection with Macdonald polynomials.  It was known for a long time that the  Macdonald polynomials associated to a simply laced root system gave the character of the current algebra which is a particular subalgebra of the affine Lie algebra.  The situation in the case of the non-simply laced root systems remained mysterious for nearly twenty years. The  PI's past work on Weyl modues for quantum affine algebras was pivotal in this project; in joint work with Bogdon Ion she showed that these modules specialized at q=1 to a module for te current algebra whose character was the Macdonald polynomial in all cases (including the nonsimply laced and twisted cases). The PI also published over ten papers  in high quality journals while supported by this grant.      The project required a systematic deverlopment of the representation theory of current algebras.  The PI had six graduate students during the period and their theses problems were natural outgrowths of the project. The PI was also invited to speak on her work at many national and international conferences.                Last Modified: 04/09/2019       Submitted by: Vyjayanthi Chari]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
