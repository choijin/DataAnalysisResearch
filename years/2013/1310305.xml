<AbstractNarration>&lt;br/&gt;From 2007 to 2009, the University of Washington?s ADVANCE Center for Institutional Change (UW ADVANCE) promoted the advancement of women and other underrepresented faculty in STEM departments across the nation by annually creating and delivering in-person Leadership Excellence for Academic Diversity (LEAD) workshops. The success of this initiative has prompted many more institutions in the U.S. to request LEAD workshops; however, it is not financially feasible, sustainable, or desirable for UW ADVANCE to continue to curate and offer in-person LEAD workshops.  To meet the national demand for LEAD workshops, UW ADVANCE will create LEAD-it-Yourself! (LiY!), an online open source toolkit of planning and instructional materials to enable institutions to run their own local or regional LEAD-inspired workshops. LiY! will contribute to ADVANCE goals by disseminating LEAD planning and instructional materials to STEM departments across the nation. The online open source LiY! toolkit will provide UW ADVANCE leadership development content and best practices, customizable event planning guides, content guides (e.g., speakers suggestions, workshop topic ideas, leadership briefs with key tips and best practices, and sample presentations), and communication and evaluation templates that each institution can use as models. LiY!?s sustainability will be ensured by a leadership community that uses the online toolkit to engage in ongoing sharing, commenting, adapting, and rating of content and through an extensive iterative evaluation process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the LiY! project is to disseminate UW ADVANCE LEAD content to a widely dispersed community of leaders in higher education so as to support independently-run academic diversity leadership development workshops across the country. We will create a website to host the online open source LEAD planning and instructional materials, and we will evaluate both the materials and the website in diverse institutional contexts. We will engage a diverse group of  seven institutions in iterative evaluations to ensure that (1) the LiY! toolkit enables institutions to independently run fully customizable and successful leadership development workshops; and (2) the LiY! website supports usable and sustainable open source content dissemination. Pilot institutions will receive small amounts of seed funding for participating in the iterative evaluations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;LiY! will empower department chairs and faculty across the nation with rigorously evaluated and customizable materials for promoting the advancement of women and other underrepresented faculty in STEM. LiY! will encourage a community of leadership among geographically dispersed institutions through online dissemination and sharing.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In 2001 the University of Washington (UW) was among the first nine institutions to receive an ADVANCE Institutional Transformation award from the National Science Foundation (NSF). To advance female faculty in STEM departments, UW ADVANCE’s flagship program was a program of leadership workshops for STEM department chairs to engage them as cultural change agents and build their understanding of STEM faculty diversity challenges and opportunities. The recurring workshops help academic leaders to collaborate on issues pertinent to working with faculty, staff, and students, a critical part of their job responsibilities for which they do not traditionally receive training. This programmatic intervention not only influences individual department cultures, but also university culture more broadly because it fosters a culture of leadership development across departments and colleges, stimulates cross-departmental and cross-college interactions and idea pollination, and encourages departments to engage in more inclusive strategies for a wide variety of topics.     Due to national interest in UW ADVANCE’s leadership workshops, in 2004 UW ADVANCE expanded to offer LEAD (Leadership Excellence for Academic Diversity) workshops for STEM department chairs from around the country. By 2013, UW ADVANCE outgrew its capacity to continue to offer in-person national workshops and submitted and received NSF grant HRD-1310305 to develop LEAD-it-Yourself! (LiY!) a web-based toolkit to support institutions in running their own UW ADVANCE-inspired leadership workshops. LiY! is a highly-adaptable, easily-disseminated model that promotes equity in academia.     LiY! widely disseminates LEAD planning and instructional materials across the nation, and provides leadership development content and best practices, customizable event planning guides, content guides (e.g., speakers suggestions, workshop topic ideas, and leadership primers with key tips and best practices), and communication and evaluation templates that institutions can use as models. A user community is using the tools provided on the LiY! website and is contributing materials. In addition, users from the user community participated in evaluation throughout the development of the toolkit to improve its usability and offer helpful feedback.               Analytics of the LiY! toolkit were first captured May 1, 2018.  Those analytics show:     LiY! has 245 registered users, of whom 30 have been regularly active since the start of 2019.      The LiY! site receives an average of 350 &ndash; 400 page-views per month, with an average session time of 1.45 minutes.      Of the 164 resources create on the site, 76 were submitted by users who are not   at UW and 88 were submitted by users from UW.     From May 1, 2018 to November 2019, these are the top 5 most-viewed resources (in order):      1. Understanding Unconscious Bias (https://advance.washington.edu/liy/resource  /7193)  2. University of Michigan ADVANCE Faculty Hiring Evaluation Rubrics  (https://advance.washington.edu/liy/resource/31)  3.

Unconscious Bias Essay (https://advance.washington.edu/liy/resource/142)        The LiY! website was originally created using Drupal 7. The site was upgraded to Drupal 8 in 2019 and fully launched to the public in November 2019.  It now resides at https://advance.washington.edu/liy/ and is open for anyone who is interested in establishing an account, using or sharing resources, and joining the user community.
