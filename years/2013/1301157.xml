<AbstractNarration>David Coker of Boston University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods Program in the Division of Chemistry program to study excited state dynamics in condensed phase systems. Using simulation and electronic structure methods,  Coker and his research group are developing accurate quantum mechanical techniques, in particular they are extending their partial linearized density matrix propagation approach to enable efficient and broader application.  They  are  1) exploring how exciton transport in biological and synthetic light harvesting systems is influenced by local variation of chromophore environment and chromophore density, 2) studying the dynamics of multi domain complexes in which exciton transport is followed by competing charge separation and recombination processes, 3) incorporating new semiclassical mapping Hamiltonian methods for treating dynamics of many electron systems into their partial linearized propagation approach to treat dense systems of strongly interacting chromophores, and 4) developing a new approach to sample the initial Wigner distribution characterizing multistate thermal equilibrium that is required for the general implementation of their quantum dynamics methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this research, Coker and his research group develop accurate methods for studying energy transfer and dynamics in photo-excited nanoscale molecular structure such as natural and synthetic light harvesting systems.  The research is aimed at fundamental understanding of biological light harvesting processes, such as photosynthesis, as well as enabling the digital design of new enhanced functional materials for alternative energy, such as solar fuel production and photovoltaic applications.  The research also is relevant to quantum information science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Intellectual Merits of the project outcomes are focused in two areas:  (1) Development of First Principles Computational Methods to Explore Energy Transfer Mechanisms in Photosynthetic Light Harvesting  Nature has evolved nanometer scale pigment - protein photosynthetic light harvesting complexes that are capable of capturing solar energy and using it to separate positive and negative charges with near 100% efficiency. There is an intense ongoing international research effort aimed at understanding the fundamental design concepts underlying this remarkable efficiency with the goal of using this understanding to create new inexpensive synthetic materials for solar energy applications. It has been suggested that fundamental aspects of quantum mechanics play a central role in enabling this high efficiency, but the results of the complex spectroscopic experiments used to study these challenging systems can be difficult to analyze leading to ambiguous interpretations as a result of the semi-empirical fitted models that are typically used in this analysis.  The major outcome of this first project has been the development of a completely first principles approach for predicting experimental spectroscopy signals employing highly accurate electronic structure methods and new approaches to treating the electronic and nuclear quantum dynamics of these systems thus avoiding the use of ambiguous interpretive models. This new approach has been benchmarked in studies of a down converter pigment-protein complex from a type marine algae where there is a lot of experimental data for detailed comparison and testing. The down converter uses short bilin molecules to absorb higher energy bluer light and converts it to lower energy by transferring it to longer bilin molecules capable of absorbing lower energy red light.

Our published work demonstrated that this completely first principles approach is capable of accurately reproducing the experimental absorption spectrum, validating these new methods. The calculations also provide detailed mechanistic information about how the energy transfer pathways fluctuate to regulate these processes. To further validate our mechanistic predictions future work will focus on predicting detailed ultrafast dynamical spectroscopy measurements.             (2) Theoretical Studies of Passivation and Band Structure Engineering of Phosphorene by Surface Oxidation  Low dimensional materials, like atomically thin 2D sheets of graphene formed from carbon atoms, are revolutionizing many new technological application areas from flexible electronics, new sensors, transparent conductors, and nanometer scale device components. Phosphorene is a low dimensional material formed from corrugated sheets of phosphorous atoms, which, unlike the semi-metal graphene, has semi-conducting characteristics. Its band gap, which determines its ability to act as a transistor, can be tuned by the number of layers. Phosphorene thus offers great potential in transistor, logic and optoelectronic device applications. Phosphorene, however, unlike graphene, oxidizes in air. The second project thus involved extending first principles electronic structure and statistical mechanical methods to explore the surface oxidation reaction of phosphorene with O2. This work was done in collaboration with theoretical and experimental groups from the National University of Singapore.   The major outcomes of this work are: (a) a detailed mechanistic understanding of phosphorene surface oxidation chemistry; (b) a demonstration of the formation of stable oxide and sub-oxide surface layers whose calculated properties suggest they are insulating and can provide a transparent barrier layer capable of protecting the semiconducting properties of the pristine phosphorene sublayers, this behavior was verified in photoelectron spectroscopy experiments; (c) surface passivation with a number of other materials can enhance phosphorene semiconductor properties; and (d) we also explored how applied pressure to phosphorene layers can induce strain in the material and influence its electrical and magnetic properties.           The Broader Impacts of these project outcomes include:   (1) Four PhD students were trained in the development of highlevel theoretical and computational method for advanced materials simulations. Two of these students have graduated and gone on to post-doctoral appointments at major reseach centers in Europe and the US. The remaining two will graduate in the coming year.   (2) Four high school students were mentored by the graduate students working on these projects during summer research internships through the research in science and engineering (RISE) program run at BU. All these high school students are now persuing STEM degrees at top tier colleges throughout the US.

He also organized two smaller international symposia. These meetings all featured significant student engagement and women and under represented minority involvement.   (4) As indicated in the overviews of the projects presented above they have considerable potential for societal impact with the dual focus on new cheap and efficient materials for energy harvesting and new device technologies.
