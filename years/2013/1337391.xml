<AbstractNarration>The annual Geometry Festival is one of the main conferences in the world in the area of Geometry - Topology.  It has been held since 1985 in rotation at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Maryland, Stony Brook University, Duke University, the University of North Carolina and New York University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.  It will be held April 12 - 14, 2013 at the University of Maryland, in April 2014 at Stony Brook University, and in April 2015 at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of the Geometry Festival is to expose and explain the major recent accomplishments in the field to a diverse audience of interested students and faculty, and to advance discoveries in the field by bringing together present and future experts in a supportive atmosphere, with special attention to and financial support for under-represented groups, graduate students, and young faculty. The URL for the upcoming Geometry Festival at the University of Maryland is&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;http://www-math.umd.edu/research/conferences/geometry-festival.html</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Title: NSF GeomFest 2013  May 12, 2019     GEOMETRY FESTIVAL  PROJECT OUTCOMES REPORT for DMS 1337391  The annual Geometry Festival has been held since 1985 at the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Maryland, the University of North Carolina, Duke University, the State University of New York at Stony Brook, New York University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, Northeastern University and Princeton University.   The conference was hosted at the University of Maryland in the spring of 2013, at Stonybrook University in the spring of 2014, at NYU - Courant in the spring of 2015, Princeton University (for the first time) in the spring of 2016, at Duke (with the cooperation of the University of North Carolina) in the spring of 2017, and at the University of Pennsylvania in the spring of 2018.   This three day conference focuses on the major recent results in geometry and related fields. There are typically seven or eight invited one-hour talks, no parallel sessions, and ample opportunity and space for groups to get together for discussion.   In recent years, the Geometry Festival has devoted special attention to open problems, current directions and future opportunities in the field, and speakers are asked to direct a portion of their talks to these issues.     The NSF Geometry Festival grant provides partial support for graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, invited speakers and persons from under-represented groups to attend the conference.  Facilities at the Geometry Festival are handicapped-accessible.                  Last Modified: 05/12/2019       Submitted by: Herman R Gluck]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
