<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity will build on a National Research Council (NRC) study completed in 2011  (Future Science Opportunities in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean) as well as the Blue Ribbon report More and Better Science in Antarctica through Increased Logistical Effectiveness (OSTP, 2012). The 2011 NRC study developed a strategic vision for NSF-supported Antarctic research. This activity will build on this vision and use community-based workshops to identify a prioritized suite of science questions that the U.S. Antarctic Program (USAP) can use as a roadmap to guide the science support infrastructure needed to support to advance high priority science in the Antarctic. The proposed study will provide NSF with guidance on research priorities, fundamental observations, and essential infrastructure for the coming decade, aligned with reasonable expectations for the level of resources likely to be available. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;NSF?s investments in the USAP have the ability to advance high priority research questions in fields spanning astrophysics and geospace sciences, biology, ecology, geology and geophysics, glaciology, ocean and lower atmosphere, integrated systems, and climate science. The proposed study will help ensure that these investments are made as strategically and effectively as possible. Ultimately, this research will benefit decision makers and society by providing a sound foundation of scientific knowledge to help the importance of the Antarctic as a driving force in earth systems.</AbstractNarration>

The committee recommended that NSF continue to support a core program of broad-based, investigator-driven research, as a way to foster innovation and to continue advancing U.S. scientific leadership. In the Antarctic, however, even small-scale research has significant logistical requirements; thus it is important to actively pursue oppor&shy;tunities for efficiencies and coordination among independent studies. It is also important to balance the broad base of smaller-scale research with a few larger-scale, more directed efforts that focus a critical mass of resources toward key research goals.

It is also important to balance the broad base of smaller-scale research with a few larger-scale, more directed efforts that focus a critical mass of resources toward key research goals. The Committee applied a set of evaluation criteria to select three main research priorities:  1. How fast and how far will sea level rise? The Changing Antarctic Ice Sheets Initiative.  Melting of ice shelves in key areas around the edges of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) could trigger a collapse process that could potentially contribute 2 to 4 meters (6.5 to 13 feet) of global sea level rise. Observations confirm that certain areas of the WAIS are already becoming unstable.

How do Antarctic biota evolve and adapt to the changing environment? Decoding the genomic and transcriptomic bases of biological adapta&shy;tion and response across Antarctic organisms and ecosystems. For 30 more than million years, Antarctic ecosystems have evolved in near-isolation and extreme conditions&mdash;and are now facing new challenges such as a warming climate, ocean acidification, invasive species, and expansion of commercial fisheries. While Antarctic life is actively studied, a relatively unexplored research frontier is the infor&shy;mation encoded within speciesÆ DNA.  Recent technical advances that have made genome sequencing faster and less expensive can be harnessed to gain new insight into the biological diversity that has evolved in the Antarctic environment, and the capacity for species to adapt to current and future environmental changes. This initiative proposes a coordinated effort to sequence the genomes and transcriptomes of key species, as well as metagenomes and metatranscriptomes of the commu&shy;nities of species in environmental samples from soils, ice sheets, lakes and ocean water.  3.
