<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this EAGER project is to profile the dynamic interactions between circadian oscillator protein compleesx and other cellular machineries by using mass spectrometry-based proteomics and Drosophila melanogaster as a model. This project is to develop foundational data to probe the dynamic rewiring of the circadian interactome necessary for biological timekeeping.  Looking ahead, results from this project will lay the foundation for (i) functional characterization of new clock components, and (ii) comparative protein network analysis of the circadian interactomes in multiple species with distinct clock designs. This comparison coupled with rigorous mathematical approaches will highlight network rewiring and differential interactions that can reflect inherent flexibility and adaptability of the clock network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;Circadian biology is a fascinating topic that people of all ages and backgrounds can relate to, as circadian clocks regulate physiological processes that are of interest to many, and therefore represents a perfect platform for science education. The PI and her colleagues developed a multi-faceted plan to use insect circadian rhythms to educate and inspire future generations of scientists of all ages and engage the general public. This project will also provide cross-disciplinary training and career development opportunities for graduate students, undergraduates, and high school teachers.</AbstractNarration>
