<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2013 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Dani Neftin is "Embedding Problems and Their Applications." The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Michigan, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Michael Zieve.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[          Galois theory provides a bridge from group theory to arithmetic geometry, number theory, complex analysis, and complex dynamics, allowing us to transfer to these areas powerful machinery from group theory. Of particular interest is the group theoretic problem of classifying monodromy groups which has applications to fundamental questions concerning fields, curves, and rational functions, by studying their group of symmetries, that is, their monodromy groups. Results of my host Prof. Michael Zieve and myself complete this classification for rational functions of sufficiently large degree, suggesting that it will completed for all degrees in the coming few years.  Of special interest is the application of this project to studying a far reaching conjecture generalizing Mazur?s torsion theorem to a setup which applies to all curves. In particular, the conjecture predicts that for every rational function f over the rational numbers, the map on rational points is at most 16-to-1 over all but finitely many values. Using the classification of monodromy groups we settled this conjecture for indecomposable maps of sufficiently large degree. Our results have many other applications to arithmetic geometry and number theory including storger versions of Hilbert irreducibility type of theorems and characterizations of value sets of rational functions over finite fields. Our methods also produce concrete applications to the theory of 3-orbifold laminations in complex dynamics, Nevannlina theory in complex analysis, and Julia sets and measure of maximal entropy in complex dynamics.  The group of symmetries of algebraic numbers, called the absolute Galois group Gal(Q), is a central object in number theory. In a joint work with Bary-Soroker and Moshe Jarden, we discover a surprising decomposition of the large parts of the absolute Galois group (its p-Sylow subgroups) into two well understood parts. Furthermore, we characterize the interaction between the two parts using embedding problems. The decomposition can be used to model decompositions induced by Shafarevich's conjecture for the entire absolute Galois group, and hence is expected to be very useful for number theorists in the sequel.     Another project undertaken during the project tenure is motivated partially by coding theory, and concerns the growth of the number rational points on a curve over a finite field depending on basic invariants of the curve such as its genus. In a joint project with Michael Zieve, we find families of curves whose number of points is arbitrarily close the known upper bounds, depending on monodromy groups associated to these curves.     I have mentored two groups of REU students: In the summer of 2014, my REU student Eric Levin, at that point a freshmen at the University of Michigan, classified the degree 2 irreducible factors of separated polynomials.        In the summer of 2015, jointly with Michael Zieve, I have mentored a group of three students, two female members and a first year undergraduate student: Ellise Griffin (University of Utah), Ben Myers (MIT), and Heyi Zhu (Haverford College). The project makes progress towards solving the long standing open Hurwitz problem. More specifically, we analyze all congruence conditions on branching types that force a map corresponding to this branching type to be decomposable.
