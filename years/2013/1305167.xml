<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of U.S. participants in the "Workshop in Partial Differential Equations and Several Complex Variables" that will be held August 5-9, 2013, in Serra Negra, Brazil.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This event will focus on recent developments that have occurred at the crossroads of two important areas of mathematical analysis, namely, partial differential equations and several complex variables, areas in which the Brazilian mathematical community is well represented. The centerpieces of the workshop are two mini-courses directed at graduate students and recent Ph.D.'s: one by Irina Mitrea of Temple University on topics related to the geometry of real-analytic submanifolds of complex spaces, and the other by Bernhard Lamel of the University of Vienna dealing with the interplay of several complex variables with harmonic analysis and geometric measure theory. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The workshop provided opportunities to discuss recent developments in several complex variables and partial differential equations. The topics covered by the talks included solvability and regularity questions for systems of partial differential equations that are relevant to areas in several complex variables such as Cauchy-Riemann manifolds. Powerful methods of harmonic analysis and microlocal analysis which have proved useful in tackling many questions in the study of Cauchy Riemann manifolds and several complex variables formed another important area that was covered in the talks.  Two minicourses on the closely related areas of harmonic analysis, partial differential equations and several complex variables were an integral part of the workshop. These minicourses were designed for graduate students and other researchers at an early stage of their career. The minicourses provided an excellent opportunity for discussing open questions in several complex variables and partial differential equations.  Graduate students also participated by presenting their work in a poster session. This session enabled students to discuss their work and exchange ideas with many experienced researchers.  There are several researchers in the U.S. who have been collaborating with researchers in Brazil for several years. Some of these projects were started as a result of this series of workshops held in Brazil every two years for over fifteen years. The present workshop promoted the existing research collaboration between U.S. mathematicians and their counterparts in Brazil.
