<AbstractNarration>The PI plans to continue working on various topics in the representation theory of groups, with special emphasis on problems related to the Kazhdan property T or pro-finite groups. The main aims of the project are to study the expansion properties of Cayley graphs and to understand various representation theoretic properties of pro-finite and discrete groups. The project also involves studying objects central to the  geometric group theory, like automorphism groups of free groups. The PI will use algebraic, combinatorial, geometric and probabilistic tools to reduce the proposed problems to questions in combinatorics and theory of random walks and apply the results to important open problems in graph theory. As a byproduct of the project, questions in these areas are likely be answered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expanders are highly-connected sparse graphs widely used in Computer Science, in areas ranging from parallel computation to cryptography. Margulis gave the first explicit construction of expanders, following Pinsker's observation that random sparse graphs are expanders. This construction was improved in the eighties by  Margulis, Lubotzky, Phillips and Sarnak who constructed Ramanujan graphs (optimal expanders) using deep number-theoretic results. In the ensuing years the scope and depth of applications of expanders has increased -- over the past decade several completely new and unexpected lines of development have emerged and the field has undergone explosive growth. The principal investigator plans to pursue projects centered on expanders and involving mutually beneficial interactions between arithmetic, group theory and combinatorics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the last 3 years, I've continued my research in the representation theory of groups. The project resulted in several publications in several areas of mathematics related to group theory and geometry.  One of the main accomplishmets is finishing a project with J. Conant, A. Hatcher and K Vogtmann when we developed a novel viewpoint in understanding classes in homology of the automorphism groups of free groups, which leads to new understanding of all known nontrivial classes and constructed many new classes.  Other results of the projects are in the area of combinatorial group theory, where the PI studies various asymptotic properties of groups (like representation growth and intersection growth) developed new methods for constructing groups with prescribed properties.  In addition, some of the results of this project lead to new algorithms for constructive recognition of groups, which were included in software packages for computations with black box groups.  The Pi presented his work at many national and international conferences including an invited talk at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Soul, 2014.   The PI involved several graduates students as coauthors in some oh his papers. These results with included in the PhD thesis of two students: A Patotski and A.Said.
