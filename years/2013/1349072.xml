<AbstractNarration>Broader significance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Natural gas, composed primarily of methane, provides approximately a quarter of the total energy in the US and is therefore a major cornerstone of the US economy. Coalbed methane (CBM) provided about 9% of the total domestic natural gas production in 2010 and the U.S. Energy Information Administration (USEIA) estimates that CBM will continue to be an important part of the US energy portfolio through 2035 and in subsequent years. Through recent work and observation of deep coal-bearing sedimentary basins, it has become obvious that microbes are controlling the generation of this methane, and yet surprisingly little is known about what controls these microbes. There is growing public, regulatory, and industrial interest in recovery of natural gas from unconventional sources because of the continued need to develop alternative energy sources and the publicity associated with gas recovery from such sources, especially hydraulic fracturing (fracking). CBM production is estimated to remain constant through 2035, averaging 1.8 trillion cubic feet (CF) per annum.  Based on a current price of $4.57/MMBtu and the USEIA 2013 average heat content for natural gas (1.025 MMBtu/103 CF), CBM production has a value of approximately $8.43 billion/year. The investigators on this project propose to identify the component organisms in the communities that generate CBM, and importantly, what influences their metabolic processes leading to methane production. Armed with this knowledge it may be possible to increase the biogenic production of CBM, and provide a significantly more stable and profitable fuel resource. Enhancing current biogenic CBM production by even a modest 0.1% would, based on the above annual production value, would have an economic return of $8.43 million/year.  This research is supported via the NSF Sustainable Chemistry, Engineering, and Materials (SusChEM) initiative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research focuses on characterizing the genotypes and regulatory networks that mediate CBM-associated microbial metabolism in the subsurface. It seeks to build on our initial biogeochemical investigation of changes in hydrocarbon composition that accompany microbial incubations with coal extracts by elucidating the microbial community structure and functional regulation in bioreactor enrichments under controlled laboratory incubations.  Specifically, we will determine the influence of low concentrations of terminal electron acceptors on microbial community dynamics associated with increased organic matter degradation and altered rates of methane production. We will describe the genotypes of key components of each system, and determine how their relative abundance shifts over time and across experimental manipulations of terminal electron acceptor concentration. We will also map the transcription of their genes in response to experimental conditions and time, to determine the potential influence on the metabolism of the complex organic carbon in coals. These data, in concert with the physic-chemical parameterization of each bioreactor experiment will be combined to generate a compartmentalized metabolic model of the microbial assemblage. This model will be a first of its kind, laying the groundwork for modeling the metabolism of more complex systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[                 Natural gas (methane) production from coal beds is an important component of overall natural gas generation in the USA and other countries.  Knowledge gaps about coalbed methane (CBM) generation and carbon metabolism in coal beds, however, limit the success in utilization of such plentiful national energy resources. This collaborative research project between researchers at Indiana University and the University of Chicago evaluated fundamental biogeochemical processes associated with microbial degradation of organic matter (OM) during generation of methane in coals. The overall objective was to improve our understanding of the substrates that sustain microbial transformations of OM in coal beds, evaluate compositional characteristics of the coal that affect microbial degradation, and study the effects of low concentrations of environmental oxidants (terminal electron acceptors or TEAs) on the generation of methane. Our general approach involved incubation of both ground coals and organic extracts of coals in anaerobic batch reactors containing a subsurface-derived, microbial inoculum.   Methane production from these reactors was then monitored for several months and culture-independent metagenomic characterizations of microbial communities were also used to clarify how the original coal substrate composition, culture conditions, and the nature of the microbial consortia control the direction and extent of OM degradation.                  Experiments were specifically designed to evaluate the importance of coal petrographic composition by use of coals of similar maturity (high volatile bituminous rank) but of varying maceral proportions.  We found that more methane was produced in coals containing a high percentage of vitrinite macerals. Using two high-volatile bituminous coals from southwestern Indiana, LB-A coal had an 80.6% vitrinite content compared to 47.4% vitrinite in LB-C coal.  In bottles containing granular coal but lacking organic extracts, 15.1 &micro;mol/bottle methane was produced in bottles containing granular LB-A versus 6.2 &micro;mol/bottle in bottles containing LB-C.   A similar pattern was observed in bottles containing both granular coal and organic coal extracts.  The clear correlation between the presence of vitrinite macerals and the amount of methane production in the current experiments is consistent with our previous work and provides additional evidence that OM associated with vitrinite is more readily converted to methane than other coal macerals.                  The effects of three different concentrations of four different TEAs (oxygen, nitrate, iron (III), and sulfate) on methane generation were evaluated to determine if initial, partial oxidation of coal OM resulted in ?activation? of OM and increased subsequent methane production.  To summarize the results of these experiments with sub-stoichiometric TEA concentrations, in no case did we observe increased methanogenesis from organic matter activation as we had hypothesized.  As expected, however, high concentrations of oxygen and nitrate were inhibitory to methane production.  Interestingly, Fe(III) and sulfate did not produce any long-term inhibition of methanogenesis, even at the highest concentration used.                  We have also made contributions to the development of research techniques in coal biogeochemistry and microbiology.  Research progress in this area is impeded, in part, by sample heterogeneity and the utilization of different methodologies by different researchers.  In previous work and in the current experiments, we attempted to deal with intra-experimental heterogeneities through the use of solvent-extracted coal OM extracts, which allowed the use of a uniform initial substrate in all replicate bottles.  In the current project, the use of solvent-extracted OM was problematic due to the possible presence of residual solvent in some incubations along with potential extraction of toxic compounds from coals that may have inhibited subsequent methanogenesis.  Our current work suggests that the use of ground coals, while a source of heterogeneities, may be a more suitable substrate than extracted coal OM in future experiments.   According to the predominant methanogenic taxa, degradation of coal to methane was typically mediated through hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. However, if higher loading of acetoclastic methanogens (e.g. Methanosaetaceae) were added to initial inoculum, then those taxa were the predominant methanogenic taxa. This route of acetoclastic methanogenesis is contrary to expectations and recent literature, suggesting that it is possible to manipulate the pathways of coal degradation to methane by introducing different archaeal organisms. Enrichments were often dominated by Pelobacter spp. that ferments aromatic hydrocarbons to acetate, and could feed the acetoclastic methanogenesis.                  Research findings have been distributed to the wider scientific community via publications and presentations. To date, one peer-reviewed journal article has appeared in the scientific literature.  This paper describes the isolation of a new species of Fe(III)-reducing bacterium from co-extracted water from a methane-producing well in a coal bed.  At least 1-2 more publications are expected within the next year.  Four presentations have been made to date at international workshops, conferences, or at universities.  The project has also been effective in the education and training of students in complicated biogeochemical experiments under anoxic conditions.   At Indiana University, the project has funded a female PhD student and also provided partial funding for a male, MS student in environmental science.
