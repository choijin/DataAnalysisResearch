<AbstractNarration>The distribution of a species is thought to be limited by physiological tolerances to the environment, interactions with other organisms, or genetic constraints on adaptation.  In this project the importance of these factors on adaptation will be studied using populations sampled across the range of a naturally endemic flowering plant (Mimulus bicolor). Plant populations will be grown in growth chambers with varying precipitation and temperature regimes to determine whether plant fitness is limited by physiological tolerances to environments expected at the range edge.  The role of genetic constraints on adaptation will be inferred by studying patterns of population genetic diversity to determine whether populations at range edges are effectively small, inherently isolated, or experience maladaptive gene flow from populations at the center of the species range. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Understanding the mechanisms that limit the distribution of species will increase our ability to predict how the distribution of species will shift in the face of climate change.  In addition to answering this broad question, the research will train a graduate student and undergraduate students to conduct experiments in controlled environments and to use genetic markers to determine population structure and patterns of gene flow.  Each of these approaches will provide critical information on species range limits and can be used for future management decisions regarding species range shifts. Students will present their work at research meetings, which will disseminate their findings to other scientists and researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the project was to test ideas for why species have limited ranges in nature.  This is an important topic, since it informs our understanding of how rapid environmental change may alter species ranges and their viability.  The research project was conducted using a plant species (Mimulus bicolor) with a naturally small geographic range.  Using plants gathered from the center and edges of the species range, the co-PI challenged plants to environmental conditions expected across the geographic range and also beyond the range edges.  Results show that plant performance is generally at the range center and declines at the range edge.  These data support the idea that abiotic conditions (temperature, precipitation) limit plant populations.  Interestingly, the research also showed that plant populations had the highest fitness beyond the northern range edge.  Such a result implies that the species is limited in its ability to disperse to potentially the best environment for its long-term viability.  A manuscript covering these outcomes is currently in revision for the journal Functional Ecology.   In addition to the work described above, the co-PI used this plant species to test additional hypotheses on why populations at range edges.  Specifically, the co-PI tested the idea that maladaptive gene flow into range edge populations limits their viability.  Interestingly, crosses between populations at the range center and edges do not support this hypothesis.  Indeed, such crosses produce plants with the highest viability, suggesting that gene flow is not harmful but is actually helpful at range edges.  These patterns are also consistent with patterns of DNA sequence variation in this species, which were supported by the NSF award.  Range edge populations have reduced genetic variability, which is thought to set the stage for an increase in viability following gene flow.  The results of this research will soon be submitted to the journal Evolution as a brief communication.  In addition to these scientific outcomes which will be published in the primary literature, the research award supported the professional development of the co-PI.  With the research funding, the co-PI gained experience conducting manipulative growth chamber experiments, DNA sequencing, and analyses of genetic variation.  Furthermore, the co-PI presented the outcomes of research at a national scientific meeting (Canadian Society of Ecology and Evolution) in Kamloops, British Columbia.  This venue provided an opportunity for the co-PI to present research to a wide audience and to interact with experts in the field.  These research outcomes and these collective experiences played a large role in helping the co-PI attain a post-doctoral fellowship at Rothamstedt (UK), where the co-PI is using similar approaches to study potential limits of a problematic weed species.  As a result, the research has clearly developed the professional capacities of a young researcher, with potentially direct impacts on the management of problematic plant species.
