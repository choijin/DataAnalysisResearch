<AbstractNarration>This action funds Jessamyn Schertz of the University of Arizona to conduct a research project in Linguistics during the summer of 2013 at the Hanyang Phonetics and Psycholinguistics Laboratory at Hanyang University in Seoul, Korea.  The project title is "Native Language Influence on Second Language Sound Categories." The host scientist is Dr. Taehong Cho.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project examines how Korean listeners use different acoustic dimensions (voice onset time, stop closure duration, and pitch) to distinguish the three-way stop consonant contrast of Korean ([pul] 'fire' vs. [p*ul] 'horn' vs. [phul] 'grass'), as well as how these native language sound categories shape production and perception of the similar sound contrast ('pa' vs. 'ba') in English, their second language. The first set of experiments examines to what extent individual differences in native language 'cue weighting,' or the relative reliance on the different acoustic dimensions, correspond to differences in second language cue weighting (e.g. if a listener relies heavily on pitch to distinguish the contrast in Korean, they may be more likely to rely heavily on pitch when distinguishing the contrast in English as well, even though pitch is not a reliable cue for distinguishing the English contrast), as well as the stability of cue weighting strategies across speech perception and production. The second experiment explores factors contributing to the plasticity of these phonetic category boundaries (i.e. how easy it is to manipulate cue weighting strategies based on short-term training). The results of these studies will provide insight into the extent to which individuals differ in the structure and plasticity of sound categories in their native and second languages, as well as factors which influence responsiveness to training on foreign sound categories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the project represents a two-way training opportunity in which the Fellow and the members of the lab at Hanyang University can share their different areas of expertise with one another in their collaborations, and in particular allows the Fellow to extend her dissertation research to a language that she would not otherwise be able to study in depth. The Fellow will disseminate the research at professional conferences, such that the results of the project, which should provide insight into how people learn foreign sound categories, will be made available to researchers working more directly on second language acquisition.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This funding supported a graduate student to work in the Hanyang Phonetics and Psycholinguistics Laboratory in Seoul, Korea, as part of a larger project exploring how the sound system of a personÆs native language affects the way foreign sounds are pronounced and perceived. Speech sounds are distinguished from another using different acoustic "cues," and even sounds that are generally thought to be the same in different languages are usually defined differently (for example, although both English and Spanish have "p" and "b" sounds, they are pronounced slightly differently in the two languages). When speaking or listening to a foreign language, the pronunciation and perception of foreign sounds is often shaped by the use of cues for similar sounds in the native language, and this "filter" can contribute to a non-native accent or problems in intelligibility.     This project focused on how Koreans, whose native language includes an unusual three-way sound contrast ([pul] 'fire' vs. [p*ul] 'horn' vs. [phul] 'grass'), pronounce and perceive a similar contrast in English (e.g. "p" vs. "b"). The Korean sound contrast differs in two acoustic dimensions, or "cues": duration of "voice onset time" (VOT), the time between the release of the consonant and the beginning of the following vowel, and the pitch at the beginning of the following vowel. On the other hand, the English contrast differs primarily in VOT ("p" has a longer VOT than "b"), as well as a slight difference in pitch ("p" being slightly higher than "b" on average), although this difference is very small and does not distinguish the two sounds reliably.  Given the influence of native language on foreign sounds, we hypothesized that since pitch is very important in distinguishing a similar contrast in Korean, Koreans might also use pitch to distinguish the English contrast, even though it is a very weak cue for native English speakers.      We found that when speaking, Korean speakers pronounced the contrast much like native English speakers, using primarily VOT to distinguish the two sounds, although they also used pitch more than English speakers.  However, when listening, the Korean listeners used pitch more than VOT, unlike native English speakers who use almost exclusively VOT. Furthermore, there were striking differences between listeners, with some listeners using primarily pitch, others using primarily VOT, and the rest using both pitch and VOT when distinguishing the contrast; that is, different listeners had completely different ways of understanding a foreign sound contrast, even though their language background, as well as their pronunciation of the same foreign contrast was similar.  A follow-up experiment showed that despite the extreme variability between listeners, the individual strategies used by each listener to define the foreign sound contrast were consistent and systematic.     The funding for this project began a collaboration between two phonetics laboratories in the US and Korea.
