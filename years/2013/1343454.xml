<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating the science of catalytically enhanced superadiabatic combustion for efficient heat generation to fill a technology gap of efficient heat utilization for water heating purposes. The proposed technology translation research allows the development of a prototype of the residential water heater for efficient heat production as well as cost effective and clean water heating. The translated science of catalytically enhanced superadiabatic combustion inside porous ceramic media allows the use of ultra-lean fuel to gas mixtures in superadiabatic combustion to generate heat. The heat is used to operate natural gas/heating oil powered residential or commercial water heaters to provide exemplary efficiency, safety, and cost saving when compared to the leading competing open flame or electric water heaters in this market space.  The project accomplishes its objectives by (i) studying the fundamentals of catalytically enhanced superadiabatic combustion; (ii) studying materials aspects of the catalytically active coatings; (iii) designing and testing of water heater prototype with incorporated porous burner; (iv) and initial customer discovery and formulation of product launch and business development strategies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These efforts will result in the development of a prototype residential water heater, which will increase the potential to translate this technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. The partnership engages the University of Central Florida as an academic partner and Siemens Corporate Research Center, an industrial partner whose role is to provide guidance in the heat harvesting and efficient energy conversion implementation and commercialization.  The potential economic impact is expected to be in decreased energy consumption and pollution as well as a safer water heating unit, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the residential housing market space.  The long-termsocietal impact will be in development of new competitive commercial products. It is expected the project will also increase public awareness of the importance of the science of energy conversion for future technological development of humankind.</AbstractNarration>
