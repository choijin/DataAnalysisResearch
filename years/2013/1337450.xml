<AbstractNarration>1337450&lt;br/&gt;Elzinga&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant supports acquisition of a powder x-ray diffractometer (XRD) to support research and research education at Rutgers University Newark.  The XRD will support the research programs of six groups in the Department of Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences (DEES)  at Rutgers-Newark (RN) and the Department of Environmental Sciences at Rutgers-New Brunswick.  Research will entail characterization of fine grained mineral phases in soils, sediments, and aerosols for studies of: 1) autochthonous biomineralization processes in soils and mineral transformations that regulate the release and speciation of heavy metals (e.g., Arsenic, Uranium); 2) mineralogical controls of eolian Fe transport to the world's oceans and its effect on primary productivity; 3) controlled experiments of the electromagnetic signatures of mixed mineral materials; 4) mineralogical process influence on methanogenesis in high latitude peat soils; and 5) studies of soil mineral influence on forest ecosystem carbon and nitrogen cycling.  Students will be trained in methods of XRD-based phase identification and crystallographic structure refinement and will use the XRD for regional studies of urban impacted ecosystems and soils.  Rutgers-Newark has been consistently ranked over the last fifteen years as the most ethnically diverse academic institution in the U.S.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This proposal funded the acquisition of a powder X-ray diffractometer (XRD) to enhance the research activities of an interdisciplinary group of Earth scientists at Rutgers University with expertise in geochemistry, geophysics, soil science, biology and atmospheric chemistry.  The XRD supports a broad variety of research activities that cut across several areas of the Earth Sciences and Biology, including:  (i) Geochemical processes at mineral-water interfaces that control the environmental fate of pollutants.  (ii) Mineralogical controls on release of iron from continental dusts deposited in oceanic regions limited in primary production by nutrient Fe.  (iii) Development of geophysical methods to measure subsurface permeability.  (iv) Development of geophysical tools to detect microbial activity through geophysical signals of microbe-induced mineral dissolution and precipitation.  (v) Mineralogical controls on the electrical properties of rocks.  (vi) Environmental controls on methane emissions from peat soils.  (vii) Water movement and contaminant transport in urban and agricultural soils.  (viii) Nitrogen and carbon budgets of urban wetlands and brownfields.  The XRD instrument supports research efforts in such high-impact areas as carbon sequestration in terrestrial and marine environments, the impact of human activity on the delivery of iron to the oceans, the development of quantitative and qualitative models of the transport and fate of heavy metals and other pollutants in the environment, the design of novel remediation techniques and monitoring tools of contaminated sites, and the emission of methane from thawing subarctic peat soils. The instrument is additionally used as a teaching tool in mineralogy and geochemistry classes at the undergraduate and graduate level, and enhances the scientific training and expertise of graduate students and postdoctoral associates from at least 5 research groups.  Direct experience with advanced techniques will help prepare our graduates for the demands of the 21st century workforce in science and technology. The XRD unit has strengthened the research infrastructure of Rutgers-Newark, which has been ranked the most ethnically diverse in the US for 19 years in a row, and helped enhance the educational experience of our undergraduates.
