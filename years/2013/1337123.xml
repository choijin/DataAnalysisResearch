<AbstractNarration>1337123&lt;br/&gt;Petronis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant supports acquisition of an automated susceptibility core logging system and a field free-space.   The equipment will support a range of paleoclimatological investigations on core material already collected from the Central High Plain aquifer and regional paleosols and modern soils.  The equipment will complement existing paleomagnetic equipment at this minority serving undergraduate institution and support student experiential learning with modern techniques in paleomagnetic analysis and data interpretation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>

The new automatic core track system (funded by NSF &ndash; MRI awarded to PI Petronis) arrived in late September 2014 and we have analyzed all remaining four subsurface cores from the Ogallala in western Kansas.  On 18th September 2014, the drillers finished up the Norton County well and recovered 93 ft of, surprisingly, mostly very fine sand and clay with a 16 ft ash layer starting at 67 ft.  On the 19th September 2014, drilling began in Scott Country, just west of the Battle Canyon monument.  They hit the Ogallala Formation at 25 ft, about 30 or so feet higher than the canyon edge.  They drilled until they hit Cretaceous shale around 120 ft.  The remaining two wells were completed in mid-October.  In mid November, Dr. Jon Smith from the Kansas Geological Survey delivered the cores NMHU.
