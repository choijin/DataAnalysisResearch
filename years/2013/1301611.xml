<AbstractNarration>The 2013 International Conference on Mathematical Modeling and Computation will be held on May 16-19, 2013 at Wuhan University, China.   The conference will serve as a platform to showcase recent advances in computational mathematics and mathematical modeling, to provide a forum for exchanging ideas and disseminating results in computational/applied mathematics, to foster the interaction and collaboration between mathematicians and scientists from other disciplines,   to introduce computational/applied mathematics to graduate students, postdocs and junior faculty members, and to enhance the participation of women, underrepresented minorities and persons with disabilities in computational/applied mathematics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recently, applied and computational mathematics has emerged as a major driving force for interdisciplinary researches. Currently, the boundaries between traditional disciplines, such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology and engineering are evolving, redefining and coalescing. New challenges in science and engineering require collaborative and synergic efforts from mathematical, physical, and engineering scientists. Meanwhile, the applied and computational mathematics has preserved and enhanced its core value that defines the community. This conference will cover a wide range of topics in computational mathematics and mathematical modeling. The main themes of the conference include, but are not limited to numerical methods for scientific computing, optimization, and high performance computing, modeling and computation of condense matter materials, soft matter and complex fluids, modeling and computation of nano-fluidic systems and nano-electronic devices, modeling and computation of complex systems in biological and biomedical sciences, and multiscale and stochastic methods for science and engineering. Special efforts will be made to ensure a broad participation by students, junior researchers, college faculties, especially, women, under-represented minorities and persons with disabilities.  The results of the conference, including abstracts, presentations, and preprints, will be published online at http://math.msu.edu/?wei/ICMMC/index.html.</AbstractNarration>
