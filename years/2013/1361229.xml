<AbstractNarration>The goal of this engineering education research project is to understand the conceptual and epistemological differences between young undergraduates and early-career practicing engineers and to understand the processes that result in these differences. Past research has shown that engineering, science, and mathematics students do not understand concepts fundamental to their discipline, but researchers do not fully understand the conceptual and epistemological frameworks used by early-career practicing engineers.  Since one of the  objectives of undergraduate engineering education is to prepare students to practice engineering,  it is essential to understand how and what practicing engineers know.  This project, focused on the specific context of civil engineering, will model the development of student and early-career engineer epistemology and conceptual understanding of civil design concepts, and identify key conceptual and epistemological changes that challenge early-career engineers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To understand how students' knowing changes as they become practicing engineers this research project is based on two external sources of foundational research: &lt;br/&gt;(1) Theoretical cognitive research on conceptual change that provides extensive evidence of the value of conceptual understanding and a methodological basis for researching engineering thinking and knowing. &lt;br/&gt;(2) Epistemology research that provides clear evidence of the importance of epistemology to diversity, retention and learning and a  framework for understanding how engineers use knowledge differently than other disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project can directly inform engineering teaching and learning by providing roadmaps representing how conceptual change and epistemology vary across gender and ethnic backgrounds.  This knowledge can help understand, and thus improve retention. To maximize the impact of this research, the results of this project will be shared with engineering educators.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project was to describe changes in studentsÆ thinking as they transition from secondary education to the practice of engineering.  Drawing from cognitive science, learning science and educational psychology we tracked two elements of the participantsÆ thinking: (1) their conceptual understanding (CU), meaning their deep, intuitive understanding of a subject, and (2) their personal epistemologies (PE), meaning their understanding of how their own knowledge works.  Changes in the participantsÆ CUÆs would changes in ways of thinking about the world, while changes in their PEÆs would suggest changes in ways of thinking about their understanding of the world.  Our purpose was achieved through regularly interviewing two cohorts of students for three years.  The first cohort moved from sophomore to senior-level coursework and the second moved from senior-level coursework to 2 years of experience in engineering practice.  It is difficult to measure conceptual understanding or personal epistemology, and there are no surveys that are reliable and valid.  In following approximately 20 participants for three years, then, we have conducted more than 200 extensive interviews (90 minute interviews conducted twice a year to thoroughly describe participantsÆ conceptual understanding and personal epistemologies at that point in time) and 1500 check-in interviews (10-30 minute discussions conducted every two weeks to describe the participantsÆ work and coursework).  In total we have conducted, transcribed, and analyzed more than 3000 hours of interviews with students and early-career engineers.   Our research was guided by six primary questions:  How do students change conceptually and      epistemologically during the course of their undergraduate education? Which previous student beliefs and ways of       thinking are the most resistant to change, and interfere the most with       learning? How do early-career engineers change      conceptually and epistemologically during the course of their first 2      years of practice? How do the changes inspired in       undergraduate engineering programs help or hinder engineers through their       first 2 years of practice? How do engineers use the engineering       content (laws, equations, computational skills, understanding of       fundamental phenomena) they remember? What conceptual and epistemological      differences are there between the sociocultural contexts represented in      our sample?   This study provided an unprecedented understanding of the complexity of conceptual and epistemological development.  We found that participantsÆ CUÆs and PEÆs were shaped by their workplaces and experiences, but also played an important role in shaping those experiences through the participantsÆ expectations and interpretations.  This suggests that any useful understanding of studentsÆ development into engineers will require a robust way of describing these interactions between an individual and their environmental and social settings.  We have begun to develop methods to develop these descriptions.  Our participantsÆ CUÆs and PEÆs did not change significantly.  The largest difference between school-based and work-based modes of thinking was in how the participantsÆ dealt with certainty.  As students they sought absolute certainty and correctness in their own work and in their resources.  The complexity of the world was minimized compared to the "unclear" textbooks or "confusing" lectures: as students, participants expected to quickly develop complete and certain knowledge and were frustrated by the perceived delay.  All participants were forced to engage differently with uncertainty at work, where their information was often incomplete and imperfect, and compared poorly to the knowledge of the more experienced engineers around them.  Certain PEÆs seemed more flexible than others in helping students adjust to the uncertainty in engineering practice.  Their understanding of the source...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
