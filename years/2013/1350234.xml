<AbstractNarration>The present CAREER award integrates research and educational components focused on the understanding of nuclear properties and their application to the interdisciplinary field of nuclear astrophysics. The main focus of the research is to address the question:  How were the heavy elements made?  The research component aims at the study of the decay properties of exotic nuclei utilizing the technique of Total Absorption Spectroscopy (TAS). Measurements will focus on nuclei along the rapid-neutron-capture process (or r-process), which is believed to be responsible for the origin of half of the heavy elements. The measurements will build on the previous experience of the PI in the development and use of a Total Absorption Spectrometer and will utilize existing equipment at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory together with the implementation of new proposed equipment, in this case a tape transport system for the removal of background activity from the detection area.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The technical focus of the research is through the measurement of beta-decay strength distributions of nuclei along the astrophysical r-process. The beta-decay strength distribution is the only reliable parameter for constraining the theoretical models used in r-process calculations and improving their predictive power. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will also establish a unique, new one-week summer school for rising juniors in the area of nuclear physics.  The school will be available to 12 students each summer and provide hands-on laboratory activities as well as instruction in nuclear physics.  Students from schools that do not offer an undergraduate course in nuclear physics will benefit from this summer school. Ultimately it is important to increase the number of graduate students in the field of low-energy nuclear structure physics, which is important not only for the basic science addressed, but as a training ground for skilled workers in critical areas of homeland security.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award focused on the experimental study of nuclear properties that are important for understanding stellar processes. In particular, the synthesis of heavy elements in the universe has been one of the major open questions of the field of Nuclear Astropphysics.
