<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project proposes to develop a prototype foodborne pathogen analyzer that will employ a novel credit card sized sampling device to extract, detect, identify, and quantify the presence of specific pathogens in food matrices in 1 - 2 hours at the required sensitivity (10 - 100 cfu/g).  The goal is to extend the successful Phase I measurements of 104 cfu/g Salmonella typhimurium in spinach within 2 hours to 10-100 cfu/g S. typhimurium on equipment and in cheese, Listeria monocytogenes in cantaloupe, Escherichia coli O157:H7 in ground beef, and Campylobacter jejuni in poultry.  Foodborne diseases affect as many as 50 million people in the United States each year, resulting in 130,000 hospitalizations and over 3,000 deaths.  Unfortunately, current methods used to detect these pathogens rely on lengthy growth enrichment steps that take 1 - 4 days, negating effective prevention of contaminated food distribution and consumption. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be the development of a platform technology to detect pathogens on food handling equipment or in food in 1 - 2 hours.  This will benefit the food industry by increasing productivity, minimizing withdrawals and recalls, and most importantly, minimizing illness outbreaks and potentially saving lives.  The small footprint of the analyzer will allow measurements in process plants and supporting labs, and eventually, at food sources, ports, and inspection stations.  It can also speed the process of identifying the source of an outbreak, helping minimize illnesses and deaths.  The knowledge gained by developing the proposed sampling system will allow developing similar systems that can monitor pathogens in water supplies, detect bioagents in air, and infectious pathogens in hospital patients (e.g. detection of Staphylococcus aureus, human immunodeficiency virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Foodborne diseases affect as many as 50 million people in the United States each year, resulting in 130,000 hospitalizations and over 3,000 deaths.  The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, signed into law on January 4, 2013, aims to ensure that the US food supply is safe by shifting the focus from responding to contamination to preventing it.  The FSMA requires constant pathogen testing of food and food processing equipment (20-60 tests/food lot) to minimize contamination and distribution of food tainted with pathogens.  Unfortunately, the current, most advanced, analysis methods require 1-4 days to perform depending on the pathogen, negating effective prevention of contaminated food distribution and consumption.  Furthermore, the long analysis times impact productivity.  For every lot of food produced, the equipment is down for a day waiting for the pathogen analysis to clear the equipment for the next lot.  According to several Lab Directors, if the analysis could be done in 1 shift, the impact on production would be a "game-changer".      Clearly, a method that can detect and identify foodborne pathogens in a &lt;8 hours (within a shift) would greatly benefit this industry by increasing productivity, minimizing withdrawals and recalls, and most importantly, minimizing illness outbreaks and potentially saving lives.      The Foodborne Pathogen Analyzer is designed to meet these needs.  Specifically, it is intended to detect pathogens at &lt;10 colony forming units (cfu) per gm food or per mL broth with high specificity.      This NSF Phase II SBIR project successfully developed a prototype Foodborne Pathogen Analyzer (FPA), which employs an Assay Kit that can extract, detect, identify, and quantify the presence of pathogens in food.  The assay was designed into a 96-well format so that numerous samples could be measured in less than 10 minutes.  Analysis is performed as illustrated in the figure below.
