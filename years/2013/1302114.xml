<AbstractNarration>Over the past two decades, advances in multi-antenna wireless systems have opened up the possibility of tremendous increases in wireless communication throughputs. The practical realization of these increases in real-world wireless networks is constrained by size and cost considerations that limit the number of antennas, especially for mobile devices. This research aims to achieve the gains from multi-antenna techniques in a distributed fashion by having groups of wireless transceivers pool together and cooperatively act like a virtual antenna array. The concept of virtual arrays has broad transformative potential for wireless networks by extending the numerous benefits of multi-antenna systems to networks of single-antenna devices. We will prototype and demonstrate virtual array techniques experimentally on a software-defined radio platform, and we plan to share our implementations as reusable building blocks to stimulate technology transition and to promote interactions between the academic, open-source software community and radio hobbyist communities. The elements of a virtual array have an unknown, typically time-varying, geometry and are driven by independent oscillators, each with stochastic drift; the main technical challenge is in maintaining distributed coherence in the array in the presence of these effects. While this is a very challenging problem, recent results have demonstrated the feasibility of virtual arrays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will establish a solid theoretical foundation for distributed coherence and chart a clear path to technology transfer by applying the theory and techniques to the cross-layer design of concept systems based on virtual antenna arrays. Specifically we will develop a state space framework for tracking and prediction of oscillator dynamics and mobility, and scalable architectures for distributed transmission and reception appropriate for large distributed arrays of low-cost single-antenna devices. We will also identify fundamental tradeoffs and scaling laws for virtual arrays. We will apply and integrate the theory and techniques to two concept systems of great societal significance: Distributed base station provides multi-antenna capabilities even for low carrier frequencies where standard antenna arrays would be too bulky (e.g., white space frequencies). Distributed 911, enables a cluster of nodes to communicate with a possibly moving distant rescue vehicle which would be out of range for any one of the nodes. Our goal is to perform design and performance evaluation in sufficient detail to clear conceptual hurdles for implementation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The use of multiple antennas at the transmitter and/or receiver, often termed Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO), can significantly enhance performance in a wireless communication system.  A transmit antenna array can form a beam towards a receiver, and a receive antenna array can form a beam towards the transmitter, and this focusing of signal energy can be exploited for increasing the communication range or data rate, or to reduce transmitted power.  The goal of this project is to extend the benefits of MIMO to distributed settings, in which multiple transceivers which are not wired together cooperate to form a virtual antenna array.  Such distributed MIMO (DMIMO) techniques have a variety of potential applications. For example, a group of hikers lost in the wilderness could use DMIMO techniques on their mobile phones to communicate with a distant base station or an emergency vehicle that any of their phones cannot individually reach. As another example, a group of nodes can be used to construct a more powerful transmitter for applications such as rural broadband.  The fundamental challenge in realizing the DMIMO concept, however, is that independent transceivers have different clocks, which are not a priori synchronized, and which also drift randomly over time.  As a result, emulating a virtual antenna array requires solving difficult problems of synchronization.  One of the goals of this project, therefore, is to develop and validate distributed synchronization algorithms.  For distributed transmit beamforming, we have studied a number of feedback-based strategies, identified fundamental bottlenecks in a well-known algorithm, and proposed new approaches that are compatible with range extension applications. We have also developed techniques for distributed receive beamforming, which has a different set of challenges: how do we combine signals received at different nodes constructively?  We have explored both a direct approach based on digitizing the received signals and using a fast local wireless network to send them to a processing node.  In order to reduce the data rate required for the local network, we have explored the impact of severe quantization on the performance of distributed receive beamforming, and have shown that it is remarkably resilient.  We have also proposed and prototyped a different approach: use local distributed transmit beamforming so that the received signals add up in the air at the centralized processing node.  Another approach for distributed transmit beamforming is to use channel reciprocity to obtain implicit feedback: in principle, the cooperating transmitters can estimate their channel to the receiver via messages sent in the reverse direction.  In practice, the transmission and reception circuits in a given wireless node are not identical, hence reciprocity does not quite hold exactly.  Furthermore, using reciprocity for DMIMO requires the different cooperating nodes to be very precisely pre-synchronized.  We have developed methods for such pre-synchronization, based on message exchanges between the cooperating nodes.  Yet another application of MIMO is spatial multiplexing: a sufficiently complex channel between the transmit and receive arrays creates multiple spatial modes along which we can transmit independent data streams. We have developed a novel approach to distributed spatial multiplexing in which , even if there is not enough spatial modes from the transmitter to a given receiver, the natural geographic distribution of nodes can be used to synthesize multiple spatial modes.  This approach can be used, for example, to send very high data rates from a high-altitude drone to a network of ground stations.  While much of the focus of the project is to develop building blocks for DMIMO systems in terms of  architectures, algorithms, and theoretical understanding , we have also made progress in design of concept systems based on these building blocks.  Our example system design of a Distributed Base Station (DBS) using white space frequencies shows that ranges appropriate for rural broadband can be obtained by distributed transmit beamforming using relatively low-power transmitter nodes. However, we also show that the feedback link can become a bottleneck: if these ideas are to be extended to support highly mobile users, then sophisticated distributed receive beamforming is required at the DBS.  We have also taken a first step towards the design of a distributed 911 (D911) system, showing that a radio frequency (RF) beacon emitted by a transmitter can be used to effectively guide an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) towards it.  This concept naturally generalizes to multiple cooperating transmitters, and provides a building block for a powerful approach to search and rescue.
