<AbstractNarration>This proposal addresses NSF?s call for universities to nurture students and/or faculty who are engaged in projects having the potential to be transitioned into the marketplace. I-Corps Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their ideas, devices, processes or other intellectual activities into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With this project, the von Liebig Center at UC San Diego (vLC) will become an NSF I-Corps Site to further catalyze the commercialization of university discoveries by extending its services to an untapped population of graduate students, researchers and faculty early-stage discoveries with the expectations that vLC will:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- Build a larger and more robust pipeline of viable student team projects that can be translated into the marketplace from earlier stages of research discoveries.&lt;br/&gt;- Increase awareness and participation in technology commercialization among the broader UCSD research and student community, in particular among females and underrepresented minorities. &lt;br/&gt;- Provide real world experiential learning to the student teams participating in the process while facilitating access to the region?s innovation ecosystem and entrepreneurial support network. &lt;br/&gt;- Expand the suite of offerings that the von Liebig Center can provide to students and faculty for its services to the earlier stages of technology translation. &lt;br/&gt;- Collaborate on ?best-practices? by becoming a member of an I-Corps Site network that shares insights with a wide community of similar centers in the Nation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These goals will be accomplished through entrepreneurship curricula, identification, selection, and intervention activities, mentoring, and assignment of resources for early stage development - all of which contribute to the academic research translation process through the creation of an integrated, experiential, educational program that focuses on the training of academic innovators while they are still engaged in the early stages of the discovery process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vLC has solid processes in place for recruiting, vetting, and supporting teams through their I-Corps Site. They have many noteworthy examples of startups they have supported through their existing center and strong connections with the community, business and industry, and the state of California. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The vLC I-Corps SIte will strengthen and broaden the pipeline of innovations from the university while promoting entrepreneurial thinking and activities to thrive in the academic environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By encouraging student and faculty/researcher participation actively translating research to early stage development, new products or services will be launched resulting in the creation of high value jobs and economic growth in the region. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Entrepreneurial students from underrepresented groups will have a support network inside the university that will give them the confidence needed to thrive and participate in the process. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outcomes will be widely disseminated by becoming a member of the NSF I-Corps Site network, thus catalyzing innovation in technology discoveries. The most important impact of this proposed approach is building entrepreneurial principles, early-stage commercialization pipelines, and early-stage incubation schemas. These practices, when proven successful in this approach, can be integrated or replicated to other universities around the country.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The integration of the I-Corps program has not only created a training ground for our early-stage teams, but has also been leveraged to prepare and qualify teams and startups for our Technology and Business Accelerator Programs.  In 2018, IGE extended I-Corps into key verticals, creating customized workshops for blue and green tech with partners such as Scripps Institution of Oceanography. In 2019, we continued our expansion by initiating a new Medical Device Workshop program for medical device technologies and connected health-related technology teams, based on our supplementary I-Corps award.  The medical device focused version of I-Corps will continue as a pre-qualifier for our new Medtech Accelerator program which is set to launch in Fall of 2019.  A yearly schedule is currently being developed to host two yearly instances of the Medical Device I-Corps workshops and the associated Medtech Accelerator program.  In total, our site has impacted approximately 600 participants consisting of undergraduate and graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and alumni. 250 teams have formed since the start of our site (2013-2019).   We estimate 65 teams have formed active startup companies. Seven teams have participated in the National I-Corps program- SoleMate, Tortuga Logic, Cocoon Health, Codespell, PlasmaCaps, Dimensional Touch, and Hush Technology.   Highlights of selected I-Corps teams:  CARI- Clinical Addiction Recovery Institute- They participated in I-Corps program in Fall 2016, and was recently invited to participate in the IGE Business Accelerator program. Their company focuses on bio-sensor monitoring to advance treatment for opioid addiction. They have been accepted into the UC San Diego Qualcomm Institute Innovation Space (QIIS) program, awarded NSF Phase 1 SBIR Grant of $225k, awarded the NIDA Phase 1 STTR of $235k, and most recently (2018) were awarded the NSF Phase II SBIR Grant of $748k.  Cocoon Cam- Intelligent Baby Monitor (I-Corps Fall 2014): Participated in I-Corps Nationals, and showcased their technology to President Obama at the White House Demo Day in August 2015. They obtained a $4MM Series A funding round in June 2017. The funding brings Cocoon Cam?s total investment to over $6MM and is being used to help the company scale consumer marketing and sales, product development and engineering.
