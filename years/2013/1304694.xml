<AbstractNarration>This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research in support of the 2013 Materials Research Society Spring Meeting titled "Hybrid Materials for Life Science Applications" is cofunded by the Biomedical Engineering program in the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems. This Materials Research Society Symposium will focus on applying basic science and engineering principles that advance the design and synthesis of novel materials with emphasis on the following: Synthetic routes, including precursor development and functionalization; Interface structures in biological-inorganic materials; Structure-property relationships in hybrid biological materials for electrical, optical, mechanical, chemical, electrochemical, and photochemical applications; Materials and devices for sensors and detectors, biocatalysts, bio imaging, devices with integrated biological functionality; Absorption, adhesion, and adhesion promoters for biomolecules on inorganic surfaces; Smart biomaterials and drug-delivery devices; Functional biopolymers/ inorganic materials; Modeling and simulation of properties and behavior of multiple scales in hybrid biomaterials; and Immobilization of biomolecules at surfaces.  The planned sessions will provide cutting-edge scientific program and discussion forum that focus on specific fundamental and applied science and engineering challenges that would facilitate the translation of biomaterials and tissue engineering sciences to biomedical applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program serves to educate biomaterials and tissue engineering communities in the highly relevant areas with an interdisciplinary research in chemistry, biochemistry, analytical science, materials science, and physics. The symposium has not only excellent geographical diversity, but also includes many women, underrepresented minority scientists, and young and senior investigators among the invited speakers and discussion leaders. They will have the opportunity to interact with leading scientists throughout the conference, and will be able to present their own work. These interactions are expected to develop important synergies and collaborations with professional colleagues.</AbstractNarration>
