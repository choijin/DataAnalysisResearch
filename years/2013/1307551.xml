<AbstractNarration>The goal is to develop a set of algorithms to increase the energy&lt;br/&gt;efficiency of cellular wireless networks. These networks were&lt;br/&gt;originally designed without paying sufficient attention to their&lt;br/&gt;efficiency, calculated to be less than 10%. With cellular traffic&lt;br/&gt;increasing at exponential rates, the experts believe that in one&lt;br/&gt;decade the traffic will be 1000 times today's traffic. In the proposed&lt;br/&gt;research, a number of algorithms will be developed to improve energy&lt;br/&gt;efficiency. Examples are new modulation techniques, new link adaptation&lt;br/&gt;algorithms, or algorithms for the cellular network to adapt to&lt;br/&gt;changing traffic conditions such that cells with small traffic use&lt;br/&gt;only as much energy as needed, or cells shut down, their coverage to&lt;br/&gt;be taken over by their neighboring base stations. We analyze the&lt;br/&gt;contributions of a number of different techniques, and reach the&lt;br/&gt;conclusion that it is possible to reduce the energy consumption in the&lt;br/&gt;cellular network base stations to the 1.5-2% of its current levels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this proposal is in redesigning the cellular&lt;br/&gt;network and improving its energy efficiency by several orders of&lt;br/&gt;magnitude. This will be achieved by a new set of tools, methods, and&lt;br/&gt;algorithms employing a different set of tradeoffs such as deployment,&lt;br/&gt;bandwidth, and possibly delay.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Because the project relies on knowing a user's&lt;br/&gt;location, the project will enable location-based services. These are&lt;br/&gt;highly desired but cannot be implemented in today's networks. This&lt;br/&gt;project will build on our existing research, prototyping efforts, and&lt;br/&gt;an existing testbed.</AbstractNarration>
