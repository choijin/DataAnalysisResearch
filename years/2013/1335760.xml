<AbstractNarration>1335760&lt;br/&gt;Cernansky&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an effort to reduce emissions and fuel consumption, next generation ground transportation engines are expected to operate on cycles that employ Low Temperature Combustion (LTC).  However, the underlying chemical kinetics and rate limiting steps in LTC have not been directly explored because of an inability to measure the key chemical constituents, hydroperoxy (HO2) and alkylperoxy (RO2) radicals, that control the process.  In this study, a new laser absorption diagnostic combining two more traditional techniques will be employed to overcome this measurement problem and allow direct measurement of these peroxy radicals at preignition conditions, with the goal of developing a fundamental understanding of the underlying chemistry.  The new diagnostic, cavity enhanced magneto-optical rotation (CEMOR), combines cavity enhanced ringdown spectroscopy which provides the sensitivity to measure the radicals and magneto-optic rotation which provides the selectivity necessary to eliminate interference from other compounds with similar absorption characteristics.  This work will aid in the design of the next generation engine systems with increased efficiency and reduced emissions.  The broader impact of the work will include training students in combustion science and state-of-the-art optical diagnostics techniques. The data collected in this effort will provide necessary information to further understand combustion chemistry, its role in the generation of greenhouse gases, and the subsequent effect on climate change.  Efforts will be made to enhance minority student recruitment and participation in research and graduate education.  Outreach activities include NSF's RET and REU site programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcome or Accomplishment:  NSF funded researchers in the Combustion Chemistry Group at Drexel University have made improvements to their new diagnostic technique, called Cavity Enhanced Magneto-Optic Rotation (CEMOR), under development for making high resolution measurements of the hydroperoxy radical (HO2) in controlled combustion environments.  Measurement of this radical is particularly important in Low Temperature Combustion (LTC) systems, which are being developed to improve efficiency and reduce emissions.  A key aspect of the present work involved incorporating a narrow bandwidth continuous wave laser into the system, resulting in a novel design of CEMOR. Continuous wave Cavity Ring-down Spectroscopy (cw-CRDS) is integrated with Magneto-Optic Rotation (MOR) in order to make high-resolution scans of the HO2 spectra. The present method can easily be adapted for alkyl peroxy (RO2) radicals.  The effort also demonstrated the relationship between magnetic field strength and MOR signal.  Impact:  The CEMOR diagnostic will enable measurement of radical species in complex reacting environments. The narrower bandwidth of continuous wave lasers offers increased spectroscopic resolution over the pulsed Nd:YAG/OPO laser used for previous CEMOR development. New engine designs with reduced harmful emissions and increased fuel economy can be developed based on the improved combustion models from the incorporation of these radical species into chemical kinetic models. This diagnostic will also have application in atmospheric oxidation chemistry.  Explanation/background:  The design of new combustion systems incorporates numerical simulations of the reaction progress; simulations that require chemical kinetic models applicable over the entire range of reaction conditions.
