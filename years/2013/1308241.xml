<AbstractNarration>The award provides funding to help defray the expenses of U.S. participants in the "Computational Methods and Function Theory Conference, 2013" that will be held June 10-14, 2013, at Shantou University in Shantou, Guangdong, China.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This event, which is the seventh in a series of quadrennial international meetings devoted to the theme of interactions between complex analysis and scientific computing, will host a formal delegation of thirteen individuals from the U.S.  The delegation will comprise ten junior mathematicians (i.e., recent Ph.D.'s and graduate students) and three plenary speakers (Olga Holtz, Don Marshall, Joel Shapiro). Function theory, as one of the fundamental disciplines of mathematics, has widespread applications in many areas of the sciences and technology. Its methodology, for example, is a fundamental tool in developing computer algorithms for problems in systems theory and control. Conversely, some of the basic research problems in function theory have recently become more manageable through the use of the vast power modern computers provide. Thus there is a synergistic relationship between function theory and computational methods that greatly benefits both areas and that this conference will serve to highlight. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The NSF conference grant #DMS 1308241  helped substantially twelve young mathematicians and graduate students from the United States to attend the Computational Methods and Function Theory 2013 (CMFTÃ†13) conference,  which was held June 10-14, 2013 in Shantou, Guandong, China as well as the Constructive Functions 2014 Conference and School held at Vanderbilt University during the period May 26-30, 2014.  The general themes of the meetings concerned the various aspects of interaction between complex variables and scientific computation, including related topics from function theory, approximation theory and numerical analysis. A unique and important aspect of the CMFT meetings, previously held in Valparaiso 1989, Penang 1994, Nicosia 1997, Aveiro 2001, Joensuu 2005 and Ankara 2009 is to promote the creation and maintenance of contacts with scientists from diverse cultures.  Both meetings brought together mathematicians from more than 30 countries and included students, beginning researchers, and leaders in the field of constructive function theory.  These events included contributed talks, plenary addresses, and, for the Constructive Functions meeting,  four school lectures that provided an advanced introduction to areas of current research.  The applications of constructive function theory to applied science are well-known and include coding theory, geometric tomography, remote sensing, and mathematical physics.  Many of the talks given at the conference spoke directly to these applications and defined the state of the art in the field.   The scholarship and research developments presented at the conference have helped the young mathematicians define their directions for current and future research.   Furthermore, the slides from most plenary talks are freely available on the Constructive Functions conference website and at least two conference related publications describing results presented at these conferences will appear in 2016.   A special effort was made to include students and members of underrepresented groups in those supported by the grant to participate in the conferences.
