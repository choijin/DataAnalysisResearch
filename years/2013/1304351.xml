<AbstractNarration>This proposal will provide robust information about past, present and future glacier and climate change in the Kingdom of Bhutan, in the southeastern monsoonal Himalayas, and contribute to a more robust scientific platform for decision makers and mitigation strategists. Knowing the rate of glacier retreat in response to climate change is fundamental for any prediction of future behavior and in turn to design adaption and mitigation strategies for societies. However, this rate remains poorly constrained. Bhutan's welfare is linked to glacier dynamics because hydropower generation and agricultural irrigation are fueled by glacier melt. Melting glaciers and the steep relief have made glacial lake outburst floods a prime hazard for the societies of Bhutan and its Himalayan neighbors, and the hazard potential critically depends on current and future glacier melt.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an integrated research and education project, combining geomorphology, geochronology, paleo-thermometry, glaciology, and glacier modeling to reconstruct glacier and climate change over the last millennia, and to predict Himalayan glacier change over the next century. This is a multi-disciplinary team of experts with broad experience in Himalayan glacier and climate problems, including a female junior faculty at a primarily undergraduate institution and a special-needs MS student. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is a US-Bhutan bilateral research and educational proposal, with the Department of Hydromet Services/Ministry of Economic Affairs (DHMS) as the official Bhutanese collaborator, and with the Ugyen Wangchuck Institute for Conservation and Environment (UWICE) as the educational partner. Bhutanese students will train in geomorphic mapping (remote and field based) and tree-ring techniques. Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory will host UWICE students and DHMS and Columbia University's Earth Institute will host UWICE scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Melting land ice drives sea level rise, which is one of the biggest  challenges to Science and Society. Most work is focused on the huge  polar ice sheets, holding sea level rise potential of many meters.  However, mountain glaciers around the globe are melting as well, and  might hold more than 0.5 m of sea level rise potential, a number that is  poorly constrained however. What is often overlooked is the fact that  mountain glaciers could release the meltwater extremely rapidly, in a  matter of decades, and thus better constraints of the near-future  response of mountain glaciers to climate is important.The mountain  glaciers of the Himalayas, also refered to as 'the third pole' at times,  are key in this, as they also feed major rivers, including the Bramaputra and the Ganges, that are of critical importance to  hundreds of millions of people living down-stream in Central Asia. In turn, this project adresses a geo-scientific key problem of immediate relevance to society.</p> <p>The overarching goal of this project is to do the first steps towards  better evaluation of the sensitivity of mountain glaciers in Bhutan, an  Himalayan country influenced by the monsoon, as a test-case for the  entire Himalayas. The arguably best path to do this, is to study the response of these mountain glaciers to changing climate conditions in the past. Our multi-discplinary team has worked on these reconstructions on different time-scales, from years to centuries and millennia. We here summarize our key findings.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>1) We have produced and published the first tree Ring based temperature reconstructions for both both seasons, with the summer temperature reconstruction based on spruce, and the winter reconstruction based on juniper (Fig. 3). Thus, Bhutan offers the unique opportunity to provide seasonal temperature reconstructions based on tree rings, and thus a test for changing seasonality over the last millennium.</p> <p>2) We provide the first comprehensive glacier maps and chronologies in Bhutan (Figs. 1 and 2), as well as novel 40 year remote sensing reconstructions of glacier mass change based on spy satellite imagery. The studied mountain glaciers show very similar pattern of advance and retreat over the last centuries. In particular, patterns of glacier mass-loss throughout Bhutan and even the entire Himalaya chain over the last 40 years are strikingly similar. This can only be explained by a regional driver that dominates the mass-balance of these glaciers on these time scales, and the only candidate is temperature driving glacier melt. This result is in tune with our modeling experiments, similarly highlighting the sensitivity of these glaciers to temperature change. Together, this draws a dire picture for the glacier change scenarios of the next decades, as the regional temperature is almost guaranteed to rise at least by 3 oC until end of the century.</p> <p>3) Our forwards model prediction of glacier meltwater volume change show that glacier melt might increase another 20 - 30 years, followed by a sharp drop of meltwater by mid-century. This is crticial information for the large hydropower developments along the Himalayan flanks, as it indicates that the interval of year-round water flow might be shorter than expected.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/05/2017<br>      Modified by: Joerg&nbsp;M&nbsp;Schaefer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1304351/1304351_10279348_1512488117954_Fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1304351/1304351_10279348_1512488117954_Fig3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Juniper-based tree ring reconstruction from Bhutan"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1304351/1304351_10279348_1512488117954_Fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Juniper-based tree ring reconstruction from Bhutan"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Statistical tests show strong correlation of the juniper tree ring signal with winter temperature</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ed Cook</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Joerg&nbsp;M&nbsp;Schaefer</div> <div class="imageTitle">Juniper-based tree ring reconstruction from Bhutan</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1304351/1304351_10279348_1512487840668_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1304351/1304351_10279348_1512487840668_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Geomorphic maps and chronologies for Rinchen Zoe and Lunana Glaciers"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1304351/1304351_10279348_1512487840668_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Geomorphic maps and chronologies for Rinchen Zoe and Lunana Glaciers"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The first maps and comprehensive 10Be glacier chronologies from Bhutan show a striking consistency and a robust pattern that differs from the classic Holocene glacier pattern in the Alps and Scandinavia.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Schaefer and Putnam</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Joerg&nbsp;M&nbsp;Schaefer</div> <div class="imageTitle">Geomorphic maps and chronologies for Rinchen Zoe and Lunana Glaciers</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1304351/1304351_10279348_1512487243620_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1304351/1304351_10279348_1512487243620_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Photo of Rinchen Zoe Glacier"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1304351/1304351_10279348_1512487243620_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Photo of Rinchen Zoe Glacier"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Example of the spectacular glacial landscape in front of Bhutan's glacier.
