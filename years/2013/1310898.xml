<AbstractNarration>This action funds Jamie Smith of Ohio University to conduct a research project in Education and Human Resource Development during the summer of 2013 at the University of Southern Queensland in Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia.  The project title is "Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge Development in Science Teacher Preparation: A Mixed Methods Case Study in Queensland, Australia." The host scientist is Dr. Peter Albion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study seeks to identify key characteristics that impact the development of technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) in the science teacher preparation program at a large university in Queensland, Australia.  TPACK is a conceptual framework of a body of knowledge from which teachers draw to influence practice; it is a dynamic and emergent form of knowledge that informs the employment of technology for teaching specific subject matter.  This study employs a mixed methods case study approach, including delivery of a TPACK survey instrument, class observations, faculty and student interviews, and document analyses, to identify the key characteristics that influence the development of TPACK among preservice science teachers.  The research addresses a specific need cited in the literature, identifying TPACK impact factors, and lays a foundation for the conception of a theoretical model of TPACK development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.  These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  As our nation strives to remain competitive in a knowledge- and innovation-driven global economy, the preparation of quality teachers, specifically in STEM fields, is a critical issue.  Research conducted through this fellowship yields significant implications for this agenda.  Findings will be disseminated in the instructional technology, science education, and teacher education fields via international conferences, scholarly journal articles and practitioner publications.  This study on TPACK in development in science teacher preparation broadens the current, narrower focus of Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) in science education.  As both the host and fellow teach courses relevant to this topic for pre-service teachers and work closely with science methods faculty, the potential exists for active application and continued collaboration at both institutions.  Results of the study help inform the preparation of quality science educators on a global scale.</AbstractNarration>
