<AbstractNarration>Recombination promotes genetic diversity and the continuous adaptation of natural populations to ever-changing biotic and abiotic environments. These well-known advantages of recombination explain why most species reproduce through outcrossing. Significantly less attention has been paid to the fact that recombination rates are themselves a variable and evolving trait. Despite the profound importance of recombination in evolutionary and genetic studies, there is a significant gap in our basic knowledge of within-species natural variation in recombination. The PIs propose to take advantage of the unparalleled genetic and genomic tools available in the model system Drosophila melanogaster to conduct the first comprehensive study of intraspecific variation in recombination, from the description of where and how much recombination rates vary across genomes and among individuals of the same species, to the elucidation of the molecular causes and evolutionary consequences of this variation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will provide a new paradigm within models of adaptation under suboptimal conditions by investigating a direct mechanistic link between increased recombination and stressful conditions, the very same circumstances where recombination may be most favorable. The PIs also propose a two-pronged approach to increase the participation of women and other underrepresented groups in science and education. They will organize a series of high school seminars, focusing on Evolution as a modern scientific discipline, and create a summer hands-on workshop for future educators. The workshop will focus on evolutionary and genomic concepts, with laboratory experience and experimental activities easily transferrable to secondary education settings. These seminars will enable the participants to confidently discuss contemporary issues related with evolution and modern genomic techniques (e.g., human and primate evolution, personalized medicine, etc.) in their classrooms.</AbstractNarration>
