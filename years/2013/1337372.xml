<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program that is co-funded by the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program, Professor Debra Dolliver from Southeastern Louisiana University and colleague Jean Fotie will acquire a 400 MHz NMR spectrometer. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) development of synthetic techniques to make single geometric isomers of imine derivatives; (b) design and synthesis of biologically active molecules as potential antiprotozoan agents; (c) support of the program SEAL (Student Entrepreneurs as Active Leaders) Research in Physics; (d) modeling atomic and molecular properties, particularly those occurring under the influence of electric, magnetic, and electromagnetic perturbations; and (e) synthesis of of thiophene-based room temperature ionic liquids and the testing of such ionic liquids as media for organic synthesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research.</AbstractNarration>
