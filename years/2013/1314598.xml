<AbstractNarration>The critical role of spectrum as a catalyst for economic growth was highlighted in the 2010 National Broadband Plan (NBP).  A challenge for the NBP is realizing optimal spectrum sharing in the presence of interference caused by rogue transmissions from any source, but particularly secondary users who share the spectrum.  This complex problem straddles wireless technology, industrial economics, international standards, and regulatory policy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary, multi-university collaborative project studies the many dimensions of the problem from algorithms to law enforcement.  The investigators study (1) ex-ante spectrum rule enforcement mechanisms (i.e., preventive) such as spectrum access control via policy reasoners, (2) ex-post spectrum rule enforcement schemes (i.e., punitive) with policy conformance monitoring that employ cryptographic commitments, (3) ex-post enforcement schemes that can uniquely identify rogue transmitters, and (4) the economic viability of spectrum sharing with different enforcement schemes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project provides a broad range of education and industry outreach activities in order to rapidly insert research advances into curriculum and university-industry partnerships.  Specifically, the investigators will present short courses and tutorials at the annual Virginia Tech Wireless Symposium and Summer School, and widely disseminate findings through NSF Industry &amp; University Collaborative Research Centers (I/UCRC) at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The critical role of the spectrum as a catalyst for economic growth was highlighted in the 2010 National Broadband Plan (NBP). A challenge for the NBP is realizing optimal spectrum sharing in the presence of interference caused by rogue transmissions from any source, but particularly secondary users who share the spectrum. This complex problem straddles wireless technology, industrial economics, international standards, and regulatory policy.  This interdisciplinary, multi-university collaborative project studied many dimensions of the problem, from cryptographic algorithms to spectrum policies.  The investigators studied (1) ex-ante spectrum rule enforcement mechanisms (i.e., preventive) such as spectrum access control via policy reasoners, (2) ex-post spectrum rule enforcement schemes (i.e., punitive) with policy conformance monitoring that employ cryptographic commitments, (3) ex-post enforcement schemes that can uniquely identify rogue transmitters, and (4) the economic viability of spectrum sharing with different enforcement schemes.  The key outcomes from the research include the development of the theory and implementation of policy-based access control in spectrum sharing ecosystems, development of a theoretical framework of the rendezvous problem in distributed cognitive radio networks, analysis of the operational security problem in database-driven spectrum sharing ecosystems, development of a framework for spectrum access policy reasoning for policy-based cognitive radios, development of practical approaches for secure distributed spectrum sensing, and development of the dynamic protection zone concept, which protects incumbent users from interference while maximizing spectrum utilization efficiency in spectrum sharing ecosystems.   The project included a number of education and student outreach activities.  The project findings were leveraged to develop new course modules and enhance existing curriculum at the investigators' home institutions.  Moreover, the project provided opportunities for rigorous training and professional development to several graduate students and provided research experiences to a few undergraduate students.  The project also included a broad range of industry/government outreach activities to maximize its broader impacts.  Throughout the project duration, the investigators actively engaged with the wireless industry through the National Spectrum Consortium, the NSF Industry-University Cooperative Research Center (I-UCRC) program, and meetings and discussions at relevant conferences, such as the IEEE Symposium on Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (DySPAN).  The investigators engaged with government stakeholders (such as those at the FCC and NTIA) through discussions at meetings and workshops, a few of which were organized by the investigators.   Project findings were disseminated to communities of interest mainly through peer-reviewed journal papers and conference papers.  The investigators expect that the findings will have a significant impact on the ongoing research on shared spectrum access technologies, especially on the technologies being developed to ensure secure and efficient spectrum sharing.  The research findings are also expected to make an impact on the relevant spectrum regulatory policies that are currently being discussed or planned.
