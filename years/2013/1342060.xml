<AbstractNarration>Computational techniques are revolutionizing the way in which research is conducted in science and engineering.. This is particularly true in the domains of biology, medicine, and drug discovery. Given that these areas are of utmost importance to the society at large, it is not enough if advances are made in these areas in isolation. These communities have to work together to help each other and come up with the best possible diagnosis tools, treatment procedures, drugs for various diseases, etc.  The proposed conference has the goal of bringing together scientists in all the three areas and hence serving as a platform for bridging the research efforts in these areas. The requested funds will be used to support the travel expenses of graduate students and keynote speakers. These students will get to meet experts and listen to their research results. Not only the attending students but also their friends will benefit since when the students return to their schools they will communicate their experience with their friends. The conference proceedings will be of great use to students, researchers, and practitioners. Portions of the proceedings could be used in different courses as well.</AbstractNarration>
