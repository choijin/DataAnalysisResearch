<AbstractNarration>The main goal of this collaborative research project is to develop behaviorally enhanced mathematical models grounded in queuing theory that allow predicting human behavior in customer service environments. These models will be evaluated and tested through laboratory and field experiments. Managing congestion (waiting lines) is of primary concern for most organizations providing some sort of service to customers. Customers are typically annoyed by long waiting times and therefore tend not to join long queues. Recent empirical and experimental studies provide new evidence that, in service environments in which the service value is uncertain, long queues may impact the value perception in a positive way. As a consequence, long queues may actually attract more customers and these customers may spend more when they see that the queue behind them is longer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research, if successful, will develop a set of principles that guides service organizations to better understand and utilize this phenomenon. Applications can be found in service settings (e.g. waiting in a restaurant), as well as in health care settings (e.g. waiting for elective surgery) in which the quality of the outcome is somewhat uncertain. We expect to improve the quality of service (benefiting customers) and profit of service systems (benefiting organizations or businesses). Furthermore, the results of the research are expected to strengthen the field of behavioral queueing models: (i) by developing a set of advanced mathematical models of queues with parameters corresponding to human biases and behavior, (ii) by creating a series of lab and field experiments that captures the essence of human behavior in service environment with uncertainty in service quality, and (iii) by establishing an online queueing simulator and data base for designing behavioral queueing experiments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In many business situations, customers have to wait to obtain a product or a service.  For example, you might have to wait for a table in a restaurant.   When there is uncertainty in the customer?s mind about the value of the product or service for which the customer has to wait, a long wait might be an indication of the "popularity" of the service. This, in turn, is  an indication of service value that influences a customer?s decision of whether to buy the product or service.  In this project, we analyzed rational decision making of customers who are uninformed about the service value, in markets in which there are also other customers who are informed about the service value.  We compared rational decisions of uninformed customers with the decisions of uninformed human subjects in a laboratory.  We found that, when there are multiple options chosen by others, an arriving rational uninformed customer must choose the option with the "smallest crowd," especially when there are few informed customers in the market: The option with some wait, but, not too long.  Such option indicates a higher likelihood of having an informed customer among those who chose the smallest crowd option. This implies that the option chosen by fewer customers has a higher chance of being a higher value service than the option chosen by larger number of customers   Human subjects, however, tend to under-value the wisdom contained in small crowds as they over-join large crowds in the laboratory.   Given that on-line platforms nowadays provide abundant access to wait time (or popularity) data, our project highlights the need for providing help to human decision makers to extract useful information from such data.
