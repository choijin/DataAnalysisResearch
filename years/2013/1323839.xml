<AbstractNarration>Overview: In this project, the fellow seeks to document the cultural and ecological context of ancient marine resource management systems in Heiltsuk First Nation traditional territory, on the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada. The fellow will quantify the ecological impacts of creating a clam garden - human-made rock terraces in the intertidal. Research involves monitoring the physical environment (temperature, salinity, nutrients) and growth rates of clams within and out of extant clam gardens. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project will be concurrently hosted by Simon Fraser University (SFU) with Drs. Anne Salomon and Dana Lepofsky and at the Northwest Indian College (NWIC) with Dave Oreiro (Director of the National Indian Center for Marine Environmental Research and Education at Northwest Indian College). Northwest Indian College will be the primary host organization. These two organizations both provide unique and necessary resources. SFU is home to the Hakai network and has carefully cultivated collaborative efforts between First Nations, archaeologists, and ecologists. NWIC will provide access to new research facilities, dedicated to culturally relevant marine ecology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Ancient clam gardens have been identified from Washington to Alaska, spanning multiple cultures and oceanographic conditions. This research focuses on a geographic region of rich culture and clam garden density, Bella Bella, British Columbia, Canada. In this research project, the fellow will assess the ecological impacts of clam gardens to pursue the following research objectives: (1) test the role of clam gardens on growth rates of two species both locally and along a latitudinal gradient, (2) quantify the level of recruitment in and out of clam gardens for the same two species, and (3) quantify how clam gardens alter physical environmental variables. Concurrent with this ecological study, collaborators (Dana Lepofsky (SFU) and Elroy White (Heiltsuk)), will investigate the antiquity and cultural relevance of clam gardens in the traditional Heiltsuk territory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This research involves the participation of American Indians in marine science and combines traditional ecological knowledge and Western ways of knowing to broaden participation of American Indian students at a tribal college. Combining traditional ecological knowledge and Western ways of knowing, without placing one over the other, is an effective way to engage American Indian students. The majority of laboratory work will be carried out at the Northwest Indian College in Bellingham, Washington. This will allow American Indian students to be directly involved with all stages of research and form student-driven hypotheses nested within the larger project. Students will have access to the study material and multiple opportunities to travel to field sites to gain hands-on experience working with the PI.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This postdoctoral fellowship is supported by the Division of Ocean Sciences and by the International Science and Engineering Section of the Office of International and Integrative Activities.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong></p> <p>This project explored the connection between Indigenous management technologies and increased ecosystem productivity, specifically focused on a technology known as clam gardens. Clam gardens are monumental alterations of the intertidal to increase clam productivity by creating a rock wall at the low tide line. Using this example, the ecological foundations that support increased productivity were analyzed and related to modern management. This project found that within clam gardens, clams are more abundant. The growth rate of butter clams (<em>Saxidomus giganteus</em>) was also higher for clams living at the upper tidal height. This finding supports traditional knowledge that refers to clam gardens as a place for &ldquo;high water clams&rdquo;. &nbsp;This project also explored two new aspects of clam garden research; one was changing the concept of where clam gardens were created and the second is looking at clam gardens as structures that supported more than just clams. The highest densities of clams recorded in this study were from a clam garden constructed on intertidal bedrock. Prior to this clam gardens were primarily thought of as way to increase the productivity of low productivity clam beaches, however this project provides an example of a non-clam beach being turned into a clam garden though extensive modification. Through basing this project out of Northwest Indian College (NWIC), a tribal college in Washington State, this project increased the level of research and student engagement in research at the college. Specifically, through working with two NWIC students the larger role of clam gardens in Indigenous food systems was explored and how clam gardens alter the biodiversity of coastal systems. These projects focused specifically on the clam garden rock wall and how this structure creates a unique invertebrate community. Results from the project and other clam garden research, was shared in special double session at the 2016 Salish Sea Ecosystem Conference. The purpose of this session was to share the results of community supported research on clam gardens in the Salish Sea and beyond. This session began with a traditional opening and songs by the Cowichan Tzinqwa dancers. In the first half of the session there were four speakers who shared Hul&rsquo;q&rsquo;umi&rsquo;num and W?S&Aacute;NE? knowledge, stories and language about clam gardens. After a short break the second part of the session when scientists shared very short (5 minute) narratives about what they have learned about clam gardens and how it has changed their research. Presenters included archaeologists, geologists, marine ecologists, and social scientists. Of the ten presenters, four are Indigenous.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p> <p>Like most science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) fields, Native Americans are grossly under-represented in the geosciences &ndash; with less than 0.5% of doctoral degrees in geosciences granted in 2013 granted to persons with Native American heritage (NSF, 2013). Given the central role that the natural world plays in Native American cultures, the lack of representation has less to do with interest and more to do with the way that STEM is presented to Native Americans. One issue is that STEM is often presented in the abstract without a clear connection to the daily life of Native people. Through this project I framed western science as tool that can be used to explore the ecological mechanisms that support ecosystem management based on traditional ecological management. In this study I supported three Native American students and one Hispanic student. Two of the Native American students used this framework to create their capstone research project, resulting in fourteen conference presentations and four presentation awards, ranging from local to international conferences.&nbsp; Two community events were held to share the results of this project in Bella Bella with the Heiltsuk community. One event was held at an ancestral village site and the other was held in the village. Between both events over 100+ community members were engaged, ranging from youth to elders. Two additional events were held with Lummi youth as part of a youth camp focused on language and traditional technologies. One event was a multiday camp engaging 30+ Lummi youth and community members where the project PI and six students from NWIC camped together in the San Juan Islands at a traditional Lummi village site. During the event the PI and NWIC students shared information about clam gardens and intertidal ecology. The second event was a daylong event with 20+ Lummi community members and youth and six students from NWIC. As part of the outreach project we talked about clam gardens and where they exist in Lummi territory. We also explored the intertidal and subtidal with a remotely operated vehicle. Results of this project have also been shared through two popular press articles.</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/20/2016<br>      Modified by:
