<AbstractNarration>This SBIR project's innovation is an interactive widget that takes the knowledge of textbooks, the technology of tablet computers, and the expertise of educators and combines them together with interactive technology. The information gathered may be from in-class work, homework, tests, readings or assessments and are placed in easy-to-read graphs that can be stored and retrieved on command. The information collected can be used to help educators in the classroom, allowing them to customize learning for the classroom as well as individualized student work. School districts can use this information to see where they need to focus their concerns based on their student populations and states can compare themselves against each other so we can see our deficits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/ commercial impact of this innovation reaches out to teachers, students, parents, as well as districts, states and the nation as a whole. Potentially, all schools from pre-school through college and beyond may benefit from this innovation. Publishers of textbooks would be potential subscribers. The technology could be sold to as operating systems and computer formats both domestically and internationally.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In our Phase I SBIR Proposal, we stated several clear goals: to create a software design, do an interface study, a Graphical User Interface (GUI), design the workflow for the teacher and student tablet, and establish a plan for the server-client interaction and data base. During the project period, we performed a vigorous testing phase of the newly developed GUI for P1us 1 to study simplicity, ergonomics and usability.  An important part of the software development phase of P1us1 is a stable, flexible and scalable backbone.  We strived to develop a framework that will work equally well in a single classroom or an entire school district.   The database will provide a tremendous amount of data to the teacher as well as require input by the teacher. In order to provide the teacher with easy-to-use tools for data-mining and data input, we devised a workflow that will guide the teacher through tasks without restricting creativity.  In conclusion, the software and GUI design, and interface study was completed in Phase I, as well as the beginnings of the prototype. In addition, important commercial contacts were made that will be useful for future development of our product. Phase II will be a development of the entire framework for schools and learning centers. We will provide a classroom simulator for training and promotional purposes.
