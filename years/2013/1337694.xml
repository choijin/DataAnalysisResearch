<AbstractNarration>1337694&lt;br/&gt;Maria&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award supports North Carolina State University (NCSU) with the acquisition of a high-resolution scanning electron microscope that can produce electron beams with landing energies lower than 0.1 keV while retaining lateral resolution below 1 nm. The proposed instrument enables imaging with beam currents below 5 pA. This combination of low landing energy and low current brings three transformational capabilities to NCSU: 1) it is possible to eliminate surface charging by balancing energy dependent electron arrival and emission rates; 2) it is possible to acquire information that is highly surface specific; and 3) it is possible to minimize beam damage in materials that would otherwise deteriorate rapidly. In combination, these capabilities will propel existing research by providing structural information at dramatically higher resolution and on samples that simply could not be imaged previously. These capabilities will enhance materials research at NCSU that is increasingly interdisciplinary, with focused efforts on electronic heterostructures, nanofiber/nanoparticle composites, colloidal assemblies, and DNA-mediated organic-inorganic assemblies. &lt;br/&gt;*****&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This Major Research Instrumentation award supports North Carolina State University (NCSU) with the acquisition of an extreme-resolution scanning electron microscope that images with low energy electrons. The key benefit of this instrument is imaging with a resolving power approaching atomic dimensions without the limitations due to the accumulation of negative charges on the sample surface that severely limits image quality and resolution. Furthermore, this low energy probe allows researchers to explore organic substances like plastics, natural fibers, and in some cases cells, which would decompose rapidly if imaged in a conventional instrument. This instrument will strengthen existing interdisciplinary programs at NCSU and is the greater Research Triangle region through its ability to characterize a diverse palette of materials at extreme resolution. In addition the instrument will create new outreach opportunities to inspire future generations of students in science, technology and math disciplines.</AbstractNarration>
