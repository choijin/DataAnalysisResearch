<AbstractNarration>Recent advances in mobile technologies (e.g., smart phones, sensors) have created opportunities for applications that were not previously possible in data gathering (activity monitoring, physiological, and psychological states assessment) and intervention (just in time and context aware alerts and reminders). As such mobile technologies are poised to transform various facets of our lives especially social and health-related aspects.  Taking a full advantage of the mobile and mobile health (mHealth) technologies will require considerable multidisciplinary research at the intersection of behavioral, social sciences and clinical research fields with computer science, networking and engineering. The mHealth Summer Institute addresses the multidisciplinary challenges by bringing together scientists from diverse fields to enhance the quality of mHealth research.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  &lt;br/&gt;The mHealth Summer Training Institute is the premier venue for cross-fertilization of research in the mHealth area. By providing a structured environment for researchers from multiple disciplines to collaboratively work on a mobile health issues of common interest, the training institute provides a platform for idea generation and development that can directly lead to transformative innovations, it provides invaluable experience of working in multidisciplinary teams towards a common goal. It facilitates research, development and specially innovation in mobile health and career development of young scientists in a transdisciplinary environment with rapidly changing landscape.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The institute has several long-term impacts on the society. First, the ideas generated during the institute, are frequently developed fully into promising grant proposals, several of which (from prior year institutes) have been funded. These ideas generated at the institute can lead to scientific advancement and impact the society by improving health. Second, the participants who are selected for the institute directly benefit by developing skills and experience of working in multidisciplinary teams and acquire the basic knowledge and skills of the mobile health domain via lectures from thought leaders in mobile health across all the relevant disciplines. Third, the teams formed at the institute frequently lead to long-term collaborative relationships, which continue and flourish in the long-term. It helps seed new connections among young scientists who would not otherwise work together. Fourth, the participants often become champions of mobile health at their respective home institutions and in their respective scientific communities, and educate/train others, including the students.</AbstractNarration>
