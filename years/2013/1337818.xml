<AbstractNarration>1337818&lt;br/&gt;Simonian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With increasing interest in functional interfaces, it becomes increasingly important to characterize chemical structures and biomolecules on surfaces in a quantitative fashion, and to test their proper allocation orientation, conformation, activities, stability, etc. This proposal will enhance the power and capabilities of interface characterization sensing techniques by integrating several synergistic surface characterization spectroscopy methods such as surface plasmon,fluorescence, and electrochemical spectroscopies into one new surface analytic system. Although the reasoning for combining all of these techniques is straightforward, currently there is no such instrument available. The main objective of this proposal is to develop a multi-parametric/multimodal spectroscopy (MPMS) system for simultaneous application of surface-mediated optical and electrochemical techniques The proposed MPMS system, which combines three spectroscopic techniques, will facilitate new quantitative insights into the interactions of a broad range of chemical and biological species with rationally designed interfaces. Through the combination of synergistic sensing techniques, this new approach can overcome several  key limitations of current, widely-used surface characterization technologies.</AbstractNarration>
