<AbstractNarration>The innovation is a novel Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) science experimentation tool. This sensor-based tool is a smart and collaborative system that will offer a friendly introduction to science experiments for elementary aged children. The system will be developed as a commercial product, including a game-like application to help the child interpret and control the science experiment tool.  Additionally, an educational product line for classroom use, including grade-level appropriate curriculum, will be developed.  The innovation will engage young children in exploring the world around them and provide STEM foundational knowledge and skills. The intent is to foster long-term interest and subsequent higher level study in these subject areas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of this innovation will seek to produce a more technically adept workforce, by providing young children with a gentle and friendly introduction to modern technology for use during science labs and exploratory play.  The innovation will teach critical science, math, engineering, and elementary programming skills, providing children with foundational knowledge to help them excel in technical school subjects. The smart education and learning market in 2011 was worth upwards of a hundred billion dollars and is growing rapidly.  However, many of the electronic learning toys on the market dictate the answers to the child versus allowing the child to experiment and learn from the result. This innovation will encourage children to follow the scientific method before they even hear the term or fully understand the concept. Despite the commercial world benefitting from dramatic decreases in sensor costs, very little corresponding technological improvements have been made in science classrooms due to a lack of inexpensive, yet effective, educational technology based tools. This innovation will offer a low cost, engaging, and educational tool to encourage young children to explore the world around them, teaching them that the everyday world can be viewed through the lens of scientific literacy.</AbstractNarration>
