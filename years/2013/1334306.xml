<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks to develop a high-resolution, astronomically-tuned time series for the Eocene based on the isotopic compositions of foraminfera obtained from cores drilled during IODP exp. 342 (Newfoundland Drifts). This series will fill a gap (Eocene Gap) in the cyclostratigraphic record and enable the development of a complete orbitally-resolved Cenozoic record. This is one of the primary objectives of exp. 342. This work will also enable the examination of orbital-scale response and sensitivity of the carbon cycle during the Eocene and by comparison with data obtained in the Pacific Ocean, determine whether or not events such as the deepening of the CCD were global in extent. The Eocene is a particularly critical time for climate studies as it spans the time between the early Cenozoic greenhouse and the later Cenozoic icehouse. The Eocene is a particularly critical time for climate studies as it spans the time between the early Cenozoic greenhouse and the later Cenozoic icehouse. The information provided by this work will help to constrain and evaluate the causes of global climate change at a particularly crucial time in Earth history.</AbstractNarration>

Understanding the rate of change in different parts of the Earth system naturally requires having accurate geological clocks that tell us when and how long events happened in the past. In 'deep time', millions of years ago, we have been successful in identifying a regular cycle in Earth history produced by changes in Earth's orbit around the sun.  This 'orbital chronometer' has been calibrated to 'tell time' back to about 40 million years.  Unfortunately, the astronomers cannot uniquely determine Earth's orbital chronology before this, resulting a series of alternative time scales for Earth events. So while there is one "Earth clock" for the past 40 million years, we have a number of alternative clocks for time before 40 million years ago, only one of which is telling 'true time'.  Which clock should we pay attention to in the deep past?  Our project was designed to link the well known astronomical clock for the past 40 million years with one of the 'floating' chronologies for times older than this.  We did this by reconstructing the most highly resolved record yet of the orbital climate cycle to provide a unique 'clock' of Earth history. We used a marine sediment record from the North Atlantic which we believe has a continuous record of environmental change in the deep sea.  We extracted microfossils from the sediment and analyzed their chemistry, which gave us a detailed record of environmental change.  In turn, we compared that record to the various orbital clocks to see which ones match best.       Last Modified: 10/08/2016       Submitted by: Richard D Norris]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
