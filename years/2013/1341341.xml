<AbstractNarration>1341341&lt;br/&gt;PI: O'Hern&lt;br/&gt;This award provides partial support for a workshop on granular materials to be held in June at Yale University. The workshop will bring scientists and engineers working on dense granular materials together to share their recent work on vibrational models and nonlinear responses of dense granular materials, to explore new collaborations, and to define outstanding research questions in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Granular materials such as powder, soil, and pills in the pharmaceutical industry are commonly encountered in many natural and industrial processes. The particles exert forces on each other mostly through the enduring contacts with their neighbors. Understanding and predicting their flow behavior is important in designing equipment for handling such materials.</AbstractNarration>
