<AbstractNarration>This award will support the planning for a scientific software Institute in the area of computational chemistry.  Molecular simulation is an integral part of contemporary chemistry due to its broad adoption by academic researchers and industries that use molecular mechanics and dynamics methodology to advance their science.  The major molecular software programs have been downloaded by every major research university and biotech and pharmaceutical companies, and their wide usage is well exemplified by the ~30% of awarded cycles on the NSF XSEDE platforms.  However, development, testing, and validation of biomolecular simulation software, and the realization of high-throughput production runs made available on various hardware architectures, is something that the user community wants and requires, but is not something that has been adequately supported in a sustained way in the academic environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planning meetings  will enable invaluable graduate training by inviting local graduate students in the computational sciences and provide them an opportunity to understand the landscape of research opportunities at the interface of cyberinfrastructure and biomolecular sciences. The second workshop will examine education, outreach and training opportunities that an Institute of such scale and scope provides. The blueprint for the Institute will highlight multiple inter-disciplinary research problems and agenda; collectively, this will contribute to the training of the next-generation computational scientists and application-oriented cyberinfrastructure experts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this award was the conceptualization of a molecular simulation Software Institute that could bring to the computational chemistry community the resources to advance new software initiatives, to tackle new grand scientific challenges. In practice, the conceptualization effort was organized into workshops with multiple working groups. The purpose of these workshops was to gather community feedback and develop the design and activities of a Software Institute.  The proposal for the Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI)  was submitted together with the team from another conceptualization project in computational chemistry (led by Prof. Daniel Crawford), and MolSSI was created while this award was still active, also as a result of the conceptualization activities. After the MolSSI was funded, we continued to hold workshops to gather community input on MolSSI activities.   Several workshops were held during the duration of this award: one at Berkeley (in September 2014), two at Rice University (one in January 2015, and one in October 2016), and one at Stanford (in March 2017). These workshops brought together key representatives from different subfields of computational chemistry (biomolecular simulation, computational materials science, quantum chemistry), cyberinfrastructure experts, community code shareholders, and industry representatives.
