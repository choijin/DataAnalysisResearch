<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop a versatile, sensitive, and inexpensive carbohydrate monitoring system based on optoelectronics and biosensor technologies.  The platform allows continuous measurement of simple carbohydrates using small, disposable fiber-optic biosensors with accuracy comparable to conventional instrumentation.  This technology offers the ability to both detect carbohydrates over a large linear range and do it in a simple, automated, and online fashion.  Many different bioprocesses, including fermentations to produce biofuels, amino acids, and pharmaceuticals, are based on microbial conversions of sugars to high-value products.  Real-time monitoring of carbohydrate concentration during the biomass conversion would provide a great advantage in process control, leading to increased yields at decreased production costs and a lower environmental impact. No current technology is available for continuous, quantitative monitoring of specific sugars, and the sensor system to be developed will address this need.  The project is designed around four specific aims that will result in the development of sensors for glucose and xylose, a method for monitoring both sugar concentrations simultaneously, and comparison of methods to sterilize these sensors.  The outcome will be demonstration of a sensor for continuously monitoring glucose and xylose in bioprocesses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, is the development of carbohydrate sensors to enable bioprocess monitoring, control, and optimization.  Each of those characteristics can increase the efficiency of a bioprocess.  For example, monitoring can detect when a batch process is not performing to specification, and control and optimization allow efficient operation.  Current off-line methods to measure sugar concentrations lead to poor process control, inefficient use of capital equipment, and the wasting of expensive chemicals and energy due to over-compensation.  For example, more effective monitoring of carbohydrates for a corn stover biomass processing plant could result in a conservative estimated annual savings of $690,000/year.  Projections of the "bio-based economy" are for an increasing volume of chemicals, beyond pharmaceuticals, to be produced biologically from different biomass feedstocks.  Operation of those bioprocesses would be more environmentally and economically sustainable with the continuous, on-line monitoring provided by this sensor.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Spurred by increasing oil prices, turbulent foreign sources of oil, public concerns over global warming, and continued support from the US government, fermentation for bio-based chemicals and biofuels has grown steadily over the last 10 years.  Currently, the bio-ethanol industry generates over $40 billion toward the national gross domestic product from ethanol sales alone.  The total market for all bio-based chemicals is estimated at over $180 billion.  Growth in both the number of bio-based chemicals produced and number of production sites are anticipated to remain very strong at an approximate 25% annual growth rate.   The OptiEnz on-line monitoring device developed during this project will significantly reduce costs of bio-based chemical production through process monitoring and control, which will contribute to cheaper and more sustainable fuel prices.  Furthermore, process monitoring with OptiEnz sensors will improve industrial processing efficiency and decrease waste.  The goals for this Phase I project were to build and test biosensors for the important fermentation sugars, glucose and xylose, and demonstrate the ability of these sensors to monitor a bench-scale fermentation. OptiEnz successfully achieved all of the goals of this project, including building and testing individual sensors for glucose and xylose, testing appropriate sterilization techniques for the sensors, and monitoring a 48-hour bacterial fermentation.  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project has lead to the development of a biosensor system for on-line monitoring of sugars in biomass-based fermentations for chemical and fuel production.  The biosensors systems developed in this Phase I project allow measurements of glucose and xylose in real-time, continuously and on-line.  TodayÆs gold standard for measuring glucose and xylose is from grab samples taken periodically during the fermentation process and tested using expensive laboratory-based equipment that requires trained technicians and at least several hours; therefore, the resulting data cannot be used for real-time process control.  OptiEnz Sensors has demonstrated continuous, real-time carbohydrate monitoring using a patented enzymatic biosensor technology with results comparable to standard high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).  This technology opens the door for on-line monitoring of various carbohydrates during plant operations, which will significantly increase production and reduce costs.
