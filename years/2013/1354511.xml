<AbstractNarration>The Central America/Greater Antilles region, including Puerto Rico, has one of the most complex geological histories in the world, with extinct and current landbridges, drifting island chains and many moving parts over the last 70 million years. With over 500 species of freshwater fishes,this region can inform us about this complicated history because the fish are typically restricted to freshwater habitats on those moving landmasses (i.e., they can only move among areas that are physically connected). Thus, the history of freshwater fishes can help reveal the complex history of the islands and landmasses that currently make up the Central American landbridge and the Greater Antillean islands. This project will help researchers better understand the impact of the separation of the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean and the connection of North and South America by what is now Central America and potentially by earlier landbridges. Researchers will gain a better understanding of how unique historical events can result in mass species diversification or mass extinction, and how the formation of dispersal corridors can degrade biotic provincialism. Working with local Caribbean and Latin American colleagues as well as student members of their own labs, researchers will use this evolutionary, taxonomic and geographic knowledge to determine the conservation status of these poorly understood and potentially threatened lineages of fish species. The conservation status will be used by local and national governments to prioritize conservation actions for added societal benefit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this study, researchers will collect specimens of the regions freshwater fishes in order to obtain DNA and morphological specimens for museums.  Phylogenetic relationships will be estimated using a next-generation sequencing approach applied to several hundred species. These analyses will include species tree estimation, divergence date estimations and historical biogeographical analyses.  This synthetic analysis will determine the relationships and historical processes leading to present patterns of diversity.  The results will be distributed through scientific publications, databases and Encyclopedia of Life species pages. Thousands of museum specimens, next-generation genomic markers, and newly developed phylogenetic and biogeographic programs will be made available as the products of this work.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual merit</strong>:&nbsp;NSF 1354511 contributed to the transformation of research in biodiversity and biogeography by: 1) documenting the mechanisms by which landscape evolution contributes to the formation of high species richness in continental freshwater ecosystems, 2) developing several new and publicly-available software programs to model the effects of river capture on the biogeographic history of riverine organisms, and 3) advancing a probabilistic and statistical view of evolutionary processes over geological time scales with a focuses on entire biotas rather than individual taxonomic groups. The conceptual design of these modeling approaches treats the formation of the target biota, the Central America Greater Antilles or CAGA ichthyofauna, as representative of tropical aquatic ecosystems as a whole. The CAGA is both ancient and composed of multiple independent lineages, and not the result of a geographically localized and evolutionarily recent adaptive radiations. The project generated phylogenies using next-gen phylogenomic sequencing for the main groups of CAGA freshwater fishes, and developed methods for testing alternative models of Earth history using biogeographic and phylogenetic data within a formal probabilistic framework. The project contributed to the development of new methods for increasing the precision and accuracy of species delimitation in the diverse tropical ecosystems. The project also helped extend several existing collaborations with colleagues in Brazil, Peru, France and Sweden, and led to new collaborations with geomorphologists at Tulane University and UC San Diego, and with biologists at INPA Manaus (Brazil).&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Broader impacts</strong>:&nbsp;The project supported the doctoral dissertations of seven graduate students and five senior honors projects. These students presented a total of 49 oral and poster presentations at international professional society meetings, and who published 20 original journal papers and six peer-reviewed book chapters. The project supported 14 expeditions in five countries (Brazil, Peru, Panama, Paraguay, and Venezuela) in tropical South and Central America, produced 622 museum lots containing 4,220 specimens with 627 tissue samples for DNA analysis. All these materials are publicly available to the user community. These materials contributed to the discovery and publication of two new genera, eight new species, and seven new subspecies of tropical fishes. The project supported PI Albert in organizing a symposium at the 2015 Society for Systematic Biology (SSB) meetings in Brazil, results of which were subsequently published in the journal&nbsp;<em>Systematic Biology</em>&nbsp;with PI Albert serving as Associate Editor. PI Albert also coordinated phylogenomic activities with the electric eel genome project in collaboration with Dr. Michael Sussman (University of Wisconsin), and taxonomic activities with production of the first ever published field guide to all Amazonian fishes in collaboration with Dr. Peter van der Sleen (Princeton University Press, 2018). Project results to date have been presented as invited talks at several international conferences (Brazil x3, Colombia, France, Peru x2, and Sweden) and departmental seminars (Cornell Univ., Univ. Florida, Univ. Wisconsin). A complete list of presentations and publications is available in the CV of PI Albert.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/03/2018<br>      Modified by: James&nbsp;S&nbsp;Albert</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354511/1354511_10318254_1536012171614_AlbertNSFreport5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354511/1354511_10318254_1536012171614_AlbertNSFreport5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Albert NSF report 5.jpg"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1354511/1354511_10318254_1536012171614_AlbertNSFreport5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Albert NSF report 5.jpg"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Conceptual illustration of Seamless 2.0. software, that generates clade diversification by moving geographic barriers on a continuous landscape.
