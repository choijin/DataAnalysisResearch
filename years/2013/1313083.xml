<AbstractNarration>The goal of this proposal is to investigate the magnetocentrifugal mechanism for producing jets and outflows in the star formation process.  The proposal will attack this problem, first, by strengthening the observational foundation of the magnetocentfiugal outflow theory by quantifying the Doppler gradient expected in realistic outflows from young stellar objects (YSOs) using 3-D magnetohydronamic (MHD) simulations.  The second part of the proposal aims to strengthen the theoretical foundation of these YSO outflows by treating non-ideal MHD effects by using newly-developed Zeus-based MHD code. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will advance our understanding of the jets and outflows associated with young stellar objects through state-of-the-art numerical simulations and will make valuable predictions regarding jet rotation that will be testable by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA).  The project outlines 5 areas in which it will make a broader impact including:  animated movies of jet formation, training a PhD student, public outreach through the University of Virginia?s observatories, developing a mobile planetarium for use in science education in rural Virginia counties, and release of the non-ideal MHD code that is developed.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Intellectual Merits: The researchers have made significant contributions to the understanding of star formation in general and disks and outflows around young stars in particular.

Highlights of the findings include (1) wind-launching disks spontaneously develop prominent substructures, such as rings and gaps, which are important for the dynamics and growth of dust grains, the first step towards the formation of planetesimals and ultimately planets; (2) the young protostar HH212 is inferred, based on radio observations, to have a fast, collimated, rotating jet launched from its disk at a distance of 0.05 au (astronomical unit or the distance between the Earth and Sun) from the central star and a slower, less collimated, rotating wind launched at a much larger distance; (3) polarization of dust emission from disks is observed at millimeter/submillimeter wavelengths and shown to be more consistent with scattering by large dust grains than emission by magnetically aligned grains (as was commonly believed), and is therefore a powerful new tool for probing grain growth; (4) disks are observed to be rather common around young protostars, indicating that magnetic fields do not suppress the formation of large, observable circumstellar disks through magnetic braking (the disk suppression was suggested by idealized theoretical calculations), possibly because of grain growth, which removes the small grains that are responsible for coupling the magnetic field to the disk-forming material and causing the magnetic braking.&nbsp;</p> <p><br />Broad Impacts: Ph.D. student Scott Suriano was supported by this grant; he earned his degree from the University of Virginia under the supervision of the PI in Summer 2018.
