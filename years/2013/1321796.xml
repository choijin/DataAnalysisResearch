<AbstractNarration>This project is aimed at determining the spatial and temporal (mainly in the case of earthquake and volcanic processes) distribution of crustal strain throughout the full extent of the Arabia-Eurasia continental collision zone. These investigations of the 2011, magnitude 7.2, Van, Turkey earthquake that occurred in the collision zone are particularly important in regard to understanding the earthquake cycle and the role of earthquake deformation in accommodating continental convergence. This project uses GPS observations developed over the past 20 years in direct cooperation with host-country partners, including Turkish, Armenian, Georgian, Azeri, Saudi Arabian, and Russian research institutions, and InSAR observations to constrain active deformation. In addition, partner institutions will extend and enhance geodetic observations throughout the region. Seismic, neotectonic, and other geophysical data are incorporated in the analysis and interpretations, and kinematic modeling strategies are used to investigate alternative hypotheses regarding the principal active structures throughout the collision zone. These kinematic constraints are used to investigate and constrain dynamic processes (i.e., the principal forces) driving continental collision and deformations in the collision zone, and the response of the lithosphere to these forces (i.e., lithospheric rheology).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this study have direct implications for earthquake and volcanic hazards throughout the collision zone. This is particularly important because historically the most destructive earthquakes in terms of the loss of life and property have occurred along continental collision zones and associated zones of lithospheric translation. Improved understanding of earthquake hazards is a major concern to our partners and a primary motivation for them to contribute resources to the study. Furthermore, capacity building for the host-country partners provides geodetic tools that have a broad range of applications in cartography, navigation, surveying (land management and infrastructure development), and weather forecasting among others.</AbstractNarration>

We confirm that the EAF is pure strike-slip with no evidence of compression, supporting geodynamic models that ascribe the westward motion of Anatolia (Turkey) to "pull" by the foundering African subducting slab along the Hellenic Trench rather than "pushing" from the Arabia plate collision.  Our deformation models also provide an opportunity to investigate the nature of faulting on the major faults throughout the collision zone. We find that the SW segment of the EAF and the entire extent of the Dead Sea Fault, are presently locked and accumulating strain, and as such are expected to produce significant (M~6-7) earthquakes in the future.
