<AbstractNarration>PARTICIPATING INSTITUTIONS: &lt;br/&gt;Arizona State University (ASU - Lead)&lt;br/&gt;University of Virginia (UVA)&lt;br/&gt;University of Notre Dame (ND)&lt;br/&gt;University of the Pacific (UOP)&lt;br/&gt;Colorado State University (CSU)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT DESCRIPTION &lt;br/&gt;This project is developing and evaluating a computer-aided tutoring system to support the teaching of elementary linear circuit analysis. It is expanding a prototype system to cover topics in a traditional two-semester linear circuits course. The system can generate circuit problems with random topologies and element values for DC, steady-state AC, and transient circuits; allowing students to study concepts related to Fourier analysis, Laplace transforms, Bode plots, and three-phase circuits. Problem solutions are produced using a variety of special pedagogical features, including exercises designed to correct common student misconceptions. The system accepts a rich variety of inputs such as equations, re-drawn circuit diagrams, waveform sketches, matrix equations, as well as conventional numerical and multiple-choice answers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The web-based system is being employed and evaluated in a variety of ways in linear circuit classes at ASU, UVA, ND, and UOP. Dr. Daniel Robinson (at CSU) is conducting rigorous evaluation and analysis of the resulting qualitative and quantitative student learning data collected at these institutions. Through testing the software system in a variety of public and private schools, the team is demonstrating that the system can provide rapid feedback to instructors and enhance student learning - in areas that students have the most difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER SIGNIFICANCE &lt;br/&gt;The project is directly impacting more than 4300 students and having a significant effect on engineering education, since many engineering students in various disciplines take circuits courses. It is also expected that the system will be highly suitable for incorporation into massive open on-line courses (MOOCs) addressing this subject area. Student engagement is being increased through the use of interactive exercises that provide rapid feedback to students at each step of a problem. The team is also developing a tutorial authoring interface and execution engine that allows tutorial writers (e.g., instructors) to design more effective tutoring sequences by using the features of the circuit generation and solution modules. The approach is adaptable to other subject areas in electrical engineering, as well as other engineering disciplines. Some of the simpler tutorials and modules on basic circuit properties are being made available to high school students and the general public via a website designed for that purpose.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Linear circuit analysis is a foundational and "gateway" course for electrical engineers and is studied by many other engineering majors as well.  However, success rates can be lower than desired.  To improve this situation, a step-based tutoring system was developed to teach introductory linear circuit analysis in engineering.  The system accepts and immediately evaluates a variety of inputs such as re-drawn circuit diagrams, equations, simplified and matrix equations, interactively sketched waveforms and Bode plots, and numerical and short answers.  Over 17 interactive tutorials are now available with many more in development.  Uniquely, the system automatically generates an unlimited supply of error-free problems and isomorphic fully worked examples that differ in both circuit topology and element values, so that students can practice as long as needed.  If a student cannot finish a problem, they are given a fully explained and worked solution, followed by a new problem of the same type with no penalty.  This feature helps build student confidence and motivation.  Controlled, randomized laboratory and classroom-based trials found  advantages ranging from 0.72 to 1.21 standard deviations for this system  compared to paper and publisher-based electronic homework.  The system has been used by over 2300 students in 54 class sections at eight different colleges and universities of various types, with ~92-97% of students rating them as "very useful" or "somewhat useful."  Student comments were also collected and were generally quite positive. Breaking this data down by institution showed consistent responses in every case, with 92% favorable at Arizona State University, 94% at Notre Dame, 95% at University of the Pacific, 97% at Morgan State University (an HBCU), and 95% at Messiah College (with at least ~150 responses for each institution).  The software is therefore well received at institutions of widely differing types and student populations, showing it can be useful for many diverse groups.  By adding a more sophisticated student model in the future, we can make the system more adaptive to the needs of various underrepresented populations.
