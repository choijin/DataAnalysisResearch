<AbstractNarration>The annual IEEE International Symposium on Safety Security and Rescue Robotics (SSRR),&lt;br/&gt;sponsored by the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society, International Rescue System Institute,&lt;br/&gt;and the Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue, has a tradition of attracting cutting-edge&lt;br/&gt;papers in the theory and practice of robots for rapid and secure inspection of critical&lt;br/&gt;infrastructure, disaster response and recovery, disaster mitigation and recovery, detection of&lt;br/&gt;chemical, biological and radiological risks, and operations in these dangerous sites.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the past it has served as a forum gathering international researchers together for the&lt;br/&gt;exchange of ideas on technical problems and their solutions in these domains. The 10th&lt;br/&gt;anniversary SSRR 2012 will be hosted this year at Texas A&amp;M, College Station, Texas, while the&lt;br/&gt;11th will be hosted in Linkoping, Sweden. This proposal requests travel funds from NSF to assist&lt;br/&gt;students to participate in SSRR 2012 &amp; 2013 to participate in field trials with actual responders.&lt;br/&gt;This represents both the intellectgual merit and the broader impacts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Funds provided by the National Science Foundation will make it possible for 14 student researchers to attend the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society's flagship conference and is a premier international forum for robotics researchers to be held in Seattle, Washington. The domestic doctoral students, spanning the country from Georgia to Michigan, from New York to California, were selected from authors of papers specializing in robots with potential in safety, security and rescue response.  As attendees they'll have the access to a host of networking, and future career opportunities.  For the first time, the conference this year incorporates mentoring and a special Ph.D forum reflecting a growing priority in strengthening the process by which future research leaders are shaped and established.  It's not just in hollywood that robotics is capturing attention: the area of robotics is continues to grow in significance and impact. This year's conference had a record number of paper submissions.  Details on the conference and a video trailer showing the latest and greatest research in robotics -- to which these fourteen students are actively contributing -- can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM_1F33fcWk  Additional information and social media highlighting all aspects of this event can be seen, followed, and subscribed to here: http://icra2015.org/general-information/social-media          Last Modified: 02/15/2016       Submitted by: Dylan A Shell]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
