<AbstractNarration>This RCN-UBE project seeks to create a network of educational specialists (who study how students learn) and scientists (who are active researchers) to develop assessment tools that directly measure what students learn about experimental design in biology through undergraduate research and classroom experiences. Collaboratively, these two groups will develop common learning standards about the concepts underlying an experiment and the nature of representations students should apply in reasoning about experiments and visualizing data.  They also will evaluate existing assessments and create and validate new assessments based on the standards to reveal areas of student difficulties, leading to new instructional and mentoring approaches targeting those areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While an increasing number of studies focus on helping students decipher the experimental research process in general, most assessment tools only indirectly measure what undergraduates learn from performing biology experiments. The intellectual merit of this project is that it addresses the need to develop assessments that directly measure what students learn about biology research to strengthen their research skills. It is envisaged that these assessments will have both summative and formative applications as activities for promoting learning about experimental research competencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project lie in the fact that faculty involved in the project come from a variety of biology sub-disciplines at different career levels and from a wide range of institutions, providing an opportunity for liberal arts colleges and master's-degree-granting institutions, in particular, to provide input to the development of assessments that can positively impact their students. As a key outcome, the common standards and assessments will be used across multiple institutions and disciplines of biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is funded jointly by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate of Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education in support of efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Education: A Call to Action http://visionandchange.org/finalreport/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major outcomes for this project focus on community standards for collaboration between educational specialists (who study how students learn) and scientists (who are active researchers and educators) to advance biology and STEM education by teaching undergraduate biology students to do more rigorous and competent experimentation. Collaboratively, these two groups developed a set of Basic Competencies of Biological Experimentation (see http://docs.lib.purdue.edu/pibergiim/4) about the concepts underlying an experiment and the nature of representations students should apply in reasoning about experiments and visualizing data for use as evidence. By focusing on revealing areas of student difficulties, network members developed new instructional and mentoring approaches targeting those areas. The broader impacts of the project lie in the fact that faculty participants in this network come from a variety of biology sub-disciplines, are at different career levels, and come from a wide range of institutions including minority serving institutions and those that serve students from rural communities.  In addition to the Basic Competencies of Biological Experimentation in a format that is easy for instructors to edit for their own purposes, three products remain beyond our funding period:  A community-building framework for collaborative research coordination across the education and biology research disciplines was published in CBE-Life Sciences Education 17(2), 2018;  An online social media community for the ACE-Bio Network was established at https://www.researchgate.net/project/Advancing-Competencies-In-Experimentation-Biology-ACE-Bio-Network, making it possible for anyone to join and to share questions, updates, and research accomplishments of relevance to project members;  A book with 24 chapters written by different project members, Trends in Teaching Experimentation in the Life Sciences: Putting Research into Practice to Drive Institutional Change, is being submitted on January 3, 2021, for publication next year by Springer Nature Switzerland AG as a volume in the Contributions from Biology Education Research (CBER) international book series of the European Researchers in Didactics of Biology (ERIDOB).    As intellectual merit, the peer review interactions across the network and the facilitation of sharing among project members established new collaborations and promoted the quality of the research done by these investigators who are publishing high quality educational research about studies to advance biological experimentation education in undergraduate courses and departments at institutions of higher education both within and beyond our nation.
