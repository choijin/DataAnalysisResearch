<AbstractNarration>The Research and Education (R&amp;E) communities of the U.S. and Mexico have a long history of cross-border collaborations.  Given the proximity and the breadth of research taking place at R&amp;E institutions in California and Mexico, the opportunity for enhancing network-dependent cross-border science research and education collaborations holds great promise.  An important cross-border collaboration involves Mexico's Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education (CICESE) and the University of California San Diego (UCSD).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In 2010, the NSF International Research Networks Connections (IRNC) program funded FIU's Americas Lightpaths (AmLight ) proposal, which included upgrading the network connection between Los Angeles, San Diego, and Tijuana to 10Gbps.  With support from Mexico's National Council for Science and Technology (CONACYT), Corporaci√≥n Universitaria para el Desarrollo de Internet (CUDI), and other institutions in Mexico, the 10Gbps network connection was extended from Tijuana to Ensenada to connect CICESE.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are continuing challenges in cross-border science research and education collaborations benefiting from the use of the enhanced network infrastructure between Mexico and California, and the U.S.  Researchers, both in the U.S. and Mexico, must be better informed of the network capability the AmLight project has made available, and explore how to leverage the network?s capability to dramatically enhance cross-border research and education activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In an effort to stimulate growth in cross-border science research and education, FIU and CENIC (stakeholders of the AmLight project), with support from UCSD, CUDI, and CICESE, a Big Data, Big Networks workshop explores how to enhance existing or to form new cross-border networks of collaboration between researchers and students connected by the AmLight West 10G link.  The broader impacts of the Big Data, Big Networks workshop are aimed at identifying opportunities to underpin with the AmLight cross-border network infrastructure the current and planned cross-border Big Data projects, and at linking into U.S.-Mexico inter-governmental activities aimed at fostering cross-border science research and education collaborations, such as initiatives fostering innovation and education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Big Data, Big Networks (BDBN) workshops were organized to raise awareness of the Research and Education (R&amp;E) networks that are aimed at supporting the cross-border science research and education collaborations between the U.S. and Mexico.  With support by the NSF under the AmLight project, FIU, CalIT2 at UCSD, CENIC, CUDI, and CICESE organized the first of two workshops.  The Big Data, Big Network: Big Opportunities for Collaboration between Mexico and the United States workshop was held October 10-11, 2013 at the Centro de Investigaci&oacute;n Cient&iacute;fica y Educaci&oacute;n Superior de Ensenada (Ensenada Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education, CICESE).  A second workshop was held February 10-11, 2014 at CalIT2.  Both workshops brought together domain researchers from the U.S. and Mexico, both physically and virtually, to discuss their research and explore ways in which to enhance international collaboration.  The main question the workshops explored was:  How to enhance existing or to create new cross-border networks of collaboration between researchers and students connected by the AmLight West 10G link?  Findings:   Data on the challenges conducting cross-border collaborations was dispersed.  They were generalized into the following four categories: Lack of Funding; Network throughput/performance constraints; Computation and storage CI capacity constraints; and Lack of metadata standards.  All of the science research and education themes recognized network capacity as a CI requirement.  Digital Media, in addition to network capacity, identified CI for faster processing, storage and visualization. Several themes explicitly identified last mile connectivity in Mexico as the primary constraint that required a solution to enable science research and education to advance to the next level.  Actionable objectives were identified for each of the science research and education themes.  Education and outreach, training, workshops, and improving network connectivity where there are known constraints, were actionable objectives across several themes.  Finally, conclusions and recommendations from the workshops are organized as short-term goals (six months to two years) and long-term goals (three to five years):   The short-term goals are:  Increasing access to existing research networks and CI. Increasing access to super computing and cloud computing resources. Increasing adoption of new methodologies and technologies. Linking BDBN community objectives and outcomes to synergistic communities of interest.   The long-term goals are:  Leveraging resources to reach out to a broader community of interest. Exploring opportunities to demonstrate advanced collaboration tools. Positioning campuses to enable transformative technologies.
