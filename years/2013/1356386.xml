<AbstractNarration>The objective of this study is to use observations of the developing global warming signal to better understand sensitivity and resilience within the climate system to climate forcing. The study will focus on the tropical and subtropical climate system's response to tropical/subtropical forcing, and on regional-scale climate processes. Are some regions more resilient to change under greenhouse gas forcing, while other regions more vulnerable to the same forcing? If so, why? What regional physical processes operate to produce or resist change? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research activity combines an analysis of observed climate change during the satellite era with regional climate modeling to improve fundamental understanding of how the tropical/subtropical climate responds to tropical forcing over a range of time scales. The focus is on the tropics and subtropics (35°S to 35°N), and the analysis begins with an in-depth investigation of changes in the surface heat budget. Multiple datasets, including atmospheric and ocean reanalyses and satellite observations, will be included to evaluate confidence. Simulations using regional climate models, with and without coupling between the atmosphere and oceans, are used in process studies to simulate and further evaluate the role of various climate processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This effort will shed insights into sensitivity and resilience in the climate system, emphasizing the tropical and subtropical region. This has substantial broader impacts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project improved our understanding about what regions are more sensitive to increasing atmospheric greenhouse gas levels, and what regions are more resilient to that forcing.  The focus of the analysis was the tropics and subtropics, within 30 degrees of latitude of the equator.  We found that, for continental surfaces, both exceptionally dry and exceptionally wet regions are more sensitive.  Large dry regions, such as the Sahara Desert, are warming quickly without surface evaporation to modulate the warming.  Wet regions, such as the Amazon, are also sensitive to the greenhouse gas forcing, as enhanced warming and evaporation intensifies and deepens convective towers, providing a positive feedback due to enhanced trapping on longwave radiation.  We also analysed projected and observed changes in seasonality of the southeast Asia and Amazon monsoon systems, and investigated the mechanisms of change for the little-studied Congo Basin.  Over the tropical oceans, we found that the pattern of surface warming is sensitive to changes in the low-level circulation, For example, observed cooling in the equatorial eastern Pacific is associated with a strengthening of the surface easterly trade winds.  With strong concern about the impacts of intensifying storms and droughts over Africa, we performed an all-continent evaluation of projections of how these intense events will be distributed using our relatively high resolution simulations of the mid- and late 21st century.  We found that the greatest change of intense rainfall events can be expected for the Sahel, and a weaker intensification for East Africa.  In contrast, increased dry periods are projected for southern Africa          Last Modified: 05/03/2019       Submitted by: Kerry H Cook]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
