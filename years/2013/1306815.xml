<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Organic hyperbranched polymers are now promising candidates for a number of electronic and optical applications.  In this project a hypothesis of the mechanism of the enhanced dielectric effects in phthalocyanine hyperbranched polymers is investigated. The proposed studies are to be carried out in two phases.  The first phase consists of a detailed investigation of the polaron dynamics in organic branched macromolecules. The second phase is related to the development of a hybrid capacitor/fuel cell design for increased energy and power density energy storage devices.  The PI's research group will design, synthesize, and investigate in detail hyperbranched phthalocyanine polymers and probe their structure-function relationships. The scope of this work thus involves: a) detailed mechanistic studies of the polaron hopping rate and delocalization length in hyperbranched polymers; b) the design and fabrication of a capacitor/battery hybrid system which will deliver reliably increased energy and power. In the proposed studies, the PI's group will investigate different factors affecting the hopping length and rate and thus contributing to the dielectric response of the proposed hyperbranched systems. Both optical and electronic experiments will be conducted to probe structure-function relationships as they relate to the dielectric response in hyperbranched systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project concerns the understanding of the electronic properties of new materials useful for electronic applications.  In particular, research is to be carried out on certain organic polymer materials which have unusual properties that are beneficial for energy storage devices.  Research will be conducted to understand the fundamental properties of these materials and to calibrate their energy storage characteristics based on their structure.  This planned research allows for the mentoring of younger (high school) scientists in the surrounding areas in the field of materials and enriching their scientific and mathematical backgrounds.  Also, with industrial collaborations, this research project will provide opportunities for mentoring women and minority scientists to further their careers in graduate school and in academic professions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During this research project the PI and his team have investigated a) organic high dielectric materials for energy storage applications, b) novel solar organic polymeric materials for solar applications, and c) novel spectroscopic techniques to probe the interaction of small cancer drugs with biopolymers such as DNA.  Below is a brief summary of this work (accompanied by a figure in each case).  The use of inorganic materials for high energy density storage applications has several limitations which ultimately make it difficult to utilize these materials for high freuqency applicaitons.  One possible solution is a hybrid inorganic-organic material where it is possible to have a material with a high dielectric constant of an inorganic ceramic with the small dispersion curve of an organic material. Likewise, dielectric loss would not be compromised due to contributions from the organic material. During the investigations of this research grant, a HBCuPc hyperbranched polymer system has been optimized in it's performance. The PI's laboratory has optimized the synthetic procedure in order to get consistent materials in terms of purity and solubility. Very high dielectric properties were obtained from this material and structure-function relationships were found to connect the structure of the hyperbranched polymer with its performance.              Figure 1. Structures of HBCuPc (top), HBCuPc-TPA-CN (middle), and HBCuPC-CN (bottom) polymers.     With support from the NSF we have continued our investigations of singlet exciton fission for enhanced solar performance in organic materials.  Tetracyanoquinodimethane bithiophene (QOT2) has a long-lived (57 &mu;s) photo-induced excited state that may correspond to triplets resulting from intramolecular singlet fission. Since singlet fission usually occurs through intermolecular processes, a detailed description of the excited states involved and their evolution is needed to verify this hypothesis. The photo response of QOT2 is investigated using high-level electronic structure methods and quantum dynamics simulations, which show ultrafast passage through a conical intersection from the bright 11Bu state to the dark 21Ag surface. The 21Ag wave function is found to be composed of strongly coupled triplets whose decoupling into independent triplets can only be accomplished through conformational changes. However, reaching the appropriate geometry for triplet separation appears unlikely given an energy cost of 1.76 eV. Consequently, the hypothesis that the long-lived excited state corresponds to 21Ag, a spin singlet, strongly interacting double triplet, was explored. Transition moment calculations to assign excited-state absorption signals and investigations into internal conversion and intersystem crossing decay pathways indicate that a long-lived 21Ag is consistent with the available experimental data.
