<AbstractNarration>This action funds Joshua Stepanek of the University of Colorado Boulder to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at Tokyo Gakugei University in Koganei, Tokyo. The project title is "Taxonomic and Phylogenetic Investigation of the Diatom Genus Amphora." The host scientist is Dr. Shigeki Mayama.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Diatoms are an important and diverse group of microalgae found in virtually all aquatic environments. Within diatoms, members of the genus Amphora have been singled out as a potentially important biofuels source due to their ability to naturally produce large amounts of cellular oil. Although shown to be promising, the diversity and evolutionary history of the group continues to be poorly understood, undermining its potential usefulness. Preliminary data has shown Amphora to be a collection of distantly related subgroups, widely distributed throughout the diatom tree of life. This project continues an investigation into the taxonomy and evolutionary history of the genus Amphora, utilizing both the unique flora of Japan, as well as the expertise of Japanese diatom researchers. These goals are being met through the targeted collection of known Amphora populations, followed by the isolation and culturing of Amphora taxa present. From these collections, an evolutionary tree is being constructed using morphological and molecular techniques. Collaborative outcomes include: the description and publication of new species encountered during collections; the most extensively sampled phylogeny to date for the genus Amphora; and insights into the evolution of important lineages and characteristics within diatoms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. The unique experience of conducting research in Japan will be disseminated through departmental seminars at the University of Colorado. These will highlight the research conducted, as well as the cultural experience obtained through an EAPSI fellowship to a broad group of young researchers who could benefit from a similar experience. Furthermore outcomes from this study provide an ideal example of "real world" applications of evolutionary research and will have broader impacts outside the scientific community. Through public outreach programs of the Evolution Outreach Committee at the University of Colorado, this research will provide an opportunity to bring evolution out of the laboratory and demonstrate its practical importance in an accessible way to a general public audience. Relating how ongoing evolutionary research effects people?s everyday lives and is closely tied to practical problems and decision marking is an important component of this evolutionary study.</AbstractNarration>
