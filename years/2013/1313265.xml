<AbstractNarration>Reliable quantitative modeling of opacities and spectra of neutral and singly ionized Fe-like species (Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) is of paramount importance for 21st century astrophysics owing to various fundamental research areas that depend on these models. The PI will extend his recent work on metastable levels to treat photoexcitation and photoabsorption processes that occur in a variety of astronomical sources. He will concentrate on two related problems: (1) photoexcitation of Fe II and other singly ionized species in emission spectra of AGN, and (2) photoabsorption and non-LTE opacities of neutral and singly ionized species in atmospheres of late-type stars.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI and his collaborators will make all atomic data and models widely available through numerous databases and codes, and through a new data server and spectral analysis tool. They will also create a hybrid course on Atomic Physics for Astrophysics to offer to graduate students across the US and abroad. The course will be made freely available online in the form of videos of lectures, simulations, and written materials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project has been centered around atomic data and spectral models for neutral, singly, and doubly ionized iron peak species. The spectral models included electron impact excitation and Lyman alpha fluorescent excitation under nebular conditions and non-LTE absorption spectra in stellar atmospheres.  Another scientific goal of the project was to investigate the propagation of uncertainties in atomic data through spectral models.  In terms of the study of uncertainties, we published the first analytic study of propagation of atomic data uncertainties through spectral models (Bautista et al. 2013). This approach has received significant attention without astrophysics as well as in fusion plasma research.  On atomic data for Fe II, we published in Bautista (2015) the most detailed and accurate atomic data set for infrared and optical forbidden emission spectra for this ion. Our model was benchmarked with various astronomical spectra. The new atomic data has been incorporated into widely available photoionization modeling codes, such as CLOUDY and XSTAR. Regarding other low charge iron peak species, we published A-values for forbidden transitions of all twice ionized species (Fivet, Quinet, Bautista 2016) and collision strengths and transitions probabilities for neutral Fe (Bautista, Lind, Bergemann 2017).  We have done a very extensive study of Ly alpha fluorescence excitation of Fe II. The model includes atomic energy levels, transitions probabilities, and collision strengths for 900 levels of Fe II. Atomic data uncertainties were quantified and analyzed. This work is currently in preparation (Bautista et al. 2018, in preparation).
