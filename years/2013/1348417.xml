<AbstractNarration>The University of Wisconsin-Madison proposes to organize a workshop for NSF BIO REU Sites that will bring Principal Investigators (PIs) together to discus evidence-based approaches in REU program development and implementation. The overarching theme of the meeting will be to use Evidence-Based Approaches to Enhance and Strengthen the REU Experience. The structure of the workshop will align with the goals of the NSF REU program and will be designed to develop community among the PIs through presentations, discussions, networking panels and poster sessions about strategies for delivering high quality meaningful research experiences to undergraduate students in the biological sciences. A pre-workshop on-line survey will be sent to the PIs to assess their needs and expectations for the workshop and to gather information that will inform workshop planning. PIs will be asked to identify their interests regarding networking opportunities in the pre-survey and this information will be used to define topics for discussion. Informal mechanisms will be used to collect feedback during the workshop which will then be used to make mid- point adjustments to the workshop agenda. Members of the Bio REU LC (Leadership Council) will meet at the end of the first full day to check-in, review the comments box feedback, share their informal feedback from participating in the activities and, if necessary, make adjustments to the final day's agenda. A post-workshop on-line evaluation survey will be administered immediately following the workshop to assess the effectiveness of the workshop logistics, the workshop activities and to gather suggestions for future workshops. The results of this evaluation will be included in the final report submitted to NSF. More information is available by contacting the PI, Dr. Janet Branchaw at branchaw@wisc.edu.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     A workshop for the Principle Investigators (PIs) of the Biology Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site programs was held in April of 2014. The theme of the 2014 Bio REU PI workshop, "Using Evidence-Based Approaches to Enhance and Strengthen the REU Experience." The major goal of the workshop was to help Principle Investigators learn to translate educational research findings on undergraduate research experiences into effective practices in their REU programs that would benefit the students participating in their programs.   During the workshop there were structured networking activities and panels, including orientation activities for new PIs that cultivated and engaged the experiences of long-time PIs, plenary presentations given by experts, small breakout group discussions where PIs engaged the plenary topic and generated recommendations, and poster presentations that highlighted best practices in REU programming.  Overall the workshop served to build community among the BIO REU PIs, enhance diversity across the BIO REU programs, support excellence in mentorship across the BIO REU programs, and train PIs to use existing tools and resources to enhance their programs. Nearly all Bio REU sites were represented at the workshop, with 145 attendees.  Key recommendations from the Bio REU community were generated at the completion of the workshop. These were: 1) pursue opportunities to better understand the impact and value of undergraduate research learning experiences, including understanding the effectiveness of varying strategies within and across different demographic groups of students, 2) identify and disseminate effective strategies to reduce the costs and increase the efficiency of administering REU Site programs, and 3) develop a collection of resources that enable REU Program Directors to improve their programs.
