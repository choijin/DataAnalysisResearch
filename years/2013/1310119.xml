<AbstractNarration>The central goals of this  proposal are:&lt;br/&gt;(a)  To provide sharp finite sample  bounds, in various matrix norms, on the accuracy of the sample covariance estimator of high dimensional covariance matrices of  reduced effective rank;&lt;br/&gt;(b)  To extend these results to functional data and characterize classes of covariance operators of reduced effective rank. To use these results  to develop fully data driven methods, with strong theoretical justification,  for eigenvalue and eigenvector selection,  in finite samples. To apply these results to modeling vehicle emissions exhaust;   &lt;br/&gt;(c) To  study factor models  of  high dimensional  correlation matrices of elliptical copulas. To obtain minimax  estimators of these matrices and to use these results in classification problems in breast cancer data. &lt;br/&gt;There are interesting connections between our proposed research and existing results on estimation of  covariance or correlation matrices under sparsity constrains. However, estimation  under the existing sparsity types (entry-wise, row-wise, off-diagonal decay) cannot be used for modeling general types of dependency. The proposed work bridges this gap,  and  poses  different mathematical and computational challenges. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Modeling high dimensional data  and evaluating their variability  presents  increasing challenges  in many scientific disciplines.  For instance,  such challenges occur in modeling network data  in genetics and molecular biology; high dimensional portfolios in economics; and samples of curves in psychology, public health, transportation and urban planning. Substantially better solutions   can be provided  whenever  the data is  generated by a model with low dimensional structure. In the statistical problem of high dimensional covariance and correlation matrix estimation, this proposal will formulate the relevant  notion of  low dimensional structure (for instance, low effective rank or approximate low dimensional factor models). The need for  a systematic investigation of  various  classes of covariance matrices in high dimensional  models, especially in functional data settings, only begun to be recognized in recent years. This proposal is therefore a timely addition to the currently limited battery of methods and theoretical results in this important area.  The usefulness of these techniques will be demonstrated by applications to data from genomics, proteomics  and environmental engineering. Free software that implements the developed  methodology will be made available on the web in a readily implementable form.</AbstractNarration>
