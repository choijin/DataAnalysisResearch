<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2013 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Robin Tucker-Drob is "Global Ergodic Theory and Representation Theory of Groups." The host institution for the fellowship is Rutgers University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Simon Thomas.</AbstractNarration>

In recent years, mathematicians in these fields have come to realize that problems concerning algebraic, dynamical, and descriptive structural complexity of countable group and equivalence relations can be fruitfully studied via descriptive combinatorial and graph theoretic means.
