<AbstractNarration>Intellectual merit of the awarded scientific project is the development and characterization of practical aspects of quantum computing with ultracold polar molecules and highly-magnetic atoms. Exquisite control over their internal and external degrees of freedom should enable regular arrays of these atoms or molecules to form a scalable quantum information processor. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact is that ultracold atoms and molecules open opportunities for the development of new tools for precision measurement such as optical atomic and molecular clocks, enabling to search for new theories of physics beyond the Standard Model, and improved understanding of condensed matter phenomena such as colossal magnetoresistance (for improved data storage and processing) and superconductivity (for perfectly efficient electric power transmission).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    We have developed theoretical and practical aspects of quantum computing with ultracold polar molecules and highly-magnetic atoms. Interest in these systems relies on the fact that they can have sizable magnetic or electric dipole moments and thus interact anisotropically over large regions of inter-particle separations. Moreover, exquisite control over their internal and external degrees of freedom should enable regular arrays of these atoms or molecules that can form scalable quantum information processors. Our research on controlling ultracold polar molecules and magnetic atoms had three components.    Firstly, we performed a theoretical study of the internal ro-vibronic and hyperfine quantum states of polar KRb molecules when static magnetic, static electric, and trapping laser fields are simultaneously applied. Understanding the effect of changing the relative  orientation or polarization of these three fields is of crucial importance for the creation of decoherence-free subspaces built from two or more ro-vibronic and hyperfine states (i.e. qubits).  For many applications of ultracold polar molecules it is advantageous or even required that two or more molecular rotational-hyperfine states have the same spatial trapping potentials (see Figure 1). Adding resonant microwave fields leads to quantum coherent control of the qubit states of the molecule.      Secondly, our research on highly magnetic dysprosium and erbium atoms provided a means to create anisotropic correlated matter. Here, the interest lies in simulating quantum many-body Hamiltonians with long-range magnetic dipole-dipole interactions. These two rare-earth atoms have an unfilled  4f electron shell shielded by a closed 6s2 outer shell.  This leads to anisotropic dispersion forces, a second source of long-range  anisotropy, which dramatically affects the formation of Fano-Feshbach resonances in the presence of a magnetic field. In fact, based on calculations with a coupled-channel model for bosonic Dy and Er atoms, the anisotropic dispersion forces lead to a dense and chaotic spectrum of resonances, which explained observations by experimental groups at leading US and European universities. If we just include the anisotropy from the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction our coupled-channel calculations indicate that there is no chaos in the level distribution.   Finally, there is growing interest in alkali-rare-earth polar molecules trapped in an optical lattice, where the qubit is determined by the magnetic moment of the single valence electron outside the otherwise closed electron shells of the molecule. In addition, a permanent dipole moment generates strong coupling between qubits. Unlike alkali-metal molecules these molecules hold promise for topological quantum computing applications and realization of quantum spin models.  Here, we studied magnetic Feshbach association of a new class of ultracold polar molecules created from an alkali-metal Li atom and a rare-earth Yb atom in the long-lived metastable 3P2  state. These molecules can be manipulated with both electric and magnetic fields.  It is therefore possible to engineer unusual forms of interaction dynamics. This research was performed in collaboration with a group at the University of Washington.        Last Modified: 09/11/2016       Submitted by: Svetlana Kotochigova]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
