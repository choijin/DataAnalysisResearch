<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Liming Zhang of Department of Chemistry at the University of California, Santa Barbara, aims to study the reactivities of two novel and reactive gold intermediates, gold vinylidene and gold aryne complex, and develop versatile reactions based on them that would be operationally simple, high yielding, and robust and offer unique/unprecedented access to important new skeletons. These procedures will be used in the synthesis of highly complex natural and unnatural products such as polycyclic hydrocarbons and heterocycles. Successful implementation of these strategies will provide for the rapid assembly of a variety of polycyclic systems, including some less commonly found in the chemical literature. Ready access to privileged ligand frameworks may also be achieved. &lt;br/&gt;Successful outcomes should have an impact on any area of chemical activity where the syntheses of novel molecules are needed, such as in the pharmaceutical, agricultural and chemical industries. Moreover, the project promises to provide excellent training vehicles of students at all levels, including those from historically underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual meerts:        Homogeneous gold catalysis has experienced exponential development over the past dozen years and become a highly competitive area of contemporary organic synthesis. Our research program has been an integral part of this modern day ?gold rush?. With the support of the expired grant, we published 15 papers, including one in Nature Commun., one in Acc. Chem. Res., one in Chem. Soc. Rev., four communications at J. Am. Chem. Soc., and three communications at Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. Via these publications, our group has made important and/or pioneer contributions in several areas in homogeneous gold catalysis, some of high impacts are:       a) Novel gold-aryne chemistry (Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2013, 52, 7795, see Figure 1). In this work, the concept of ?gold aryne? complex is first probed via experiments, which reveal its transition state nature and highlight the C-H insertion reactivities of its carbene mesomeric isomer.      b) Novel enolate umpolung reactivity leading to rapid access to benzene-fused medium-ring ketones (JACS 2016, 138, 5515). We discovered in this work that N-alkenoxypyridinium salts (e.g., 1-1, Scheme 1), generated readily upon gold-catalyzed additions of protonated pyridine N-oxide to C-C triple bonds of unactivated terminal alkynes, display versatile enolate umpolung chemistry upon heating and react with tethered arene nucleophiles in an SN2? manner. In a synthetically efficient one-pot, two-step process, this chemistry enables expedient preparation of valuable benzo-fused medium-ring ketones.      c) The application of gold vinylidenes in streamlining synthesis of &alpha;-bromocyclopentenones (JACS 2015, 137, 5316, see Figure 2).     d) Insertions into unactivated C(sp3)-H bonds by EWG-substituted &alpha;-oxo gold carbenes generated via gold-catalyzed alkyne oxidation (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2015, 137, 5316, see Figure 3).  Broader impact:     During the supported period, we have maintained a web site (https://labs.chem.ucsb.edu/zhang/liming/advance%20in%20AuPt%20catalysis.html) that updates weekly the latest developments in Au, Ag and Pt catalysis. It serves as a convenient one-shop stop for researchers around the world interested in these metal catalysis to stay informed with the state of the art of this area.      I has given &gt;10 lectures for the past two and a half years in various Universities and conferences, including lectures at the 8th Singapore International Chemical Conference (2014) and the 25th International Conference of Heterocyclic Chemistry (2015).    I offer vigorous training to students and scholars and maintains daily one-on-one discussions of research progress with them. Graduate students have constantly excelled in the lab, and my first two graduated Ph. D. students, Dr. Guozhu Zhang and Dr. Yanzhao Wang, had 13 and 12 papers published with me, respectively.

Chem., Int. Ed (2014, 53, 9302) paper. I have also worked with 2 postdocs and 8 visiting scholars, most of whom have (re)assumed professorship positions.     I has also served as scientific advisor to two high school students (Ana Avalos from San Marcos High and Lucas Eilbacher from La Colina Junior High) on their science projects and met students in the Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation program to discuss their career options as chemists.     I organized a gold symposium at Pacifichem in Dec., 2015 to convene experts around the world to discuss the latest development in gold catalysis and educate interested researchers and students.
