<AbstractNarration>The U.S. mathematical and physical sciences communities are represented by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) in six international scientific unions: the International Astronomical Union (IAU), the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP), the International Commission for Optics (ICO), the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr), and the International Mathematical Union (IMU). U.S. National Committees (USNCs), staffed by the NAS, coordinate U.S. preparations for meetings of the corresponding international unions and for scientific conferences, symposia, and workshops organized by these unions to identify research topics, issues, and programs of interest to their specific disciplines; identify and support U.S. scientists to participate in union activities; and arrange for payment of U.S. dues to the six unions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project is demonstrated through activities related to the utilization of knowledge for the achievement of social goals, establishing nomenclature and standards, participating in the governance of the six international unions, and advancing knowledge and understanding across the research community. The activities encourage cooperative research and education efforts that reach across international boundaries and are designed to further develop and enhance each discipline nationally and internationally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project manifest themselves through activities that promote teaching, training, and learning, that promote the growth of and diversity in the national and international workforce, and that help shape the international dialogue in the respective disciplinary areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ U.S. representation in international scientific organizations has been a responsibility of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) for many years, and the organizations regard it as a service to the global scientific community. Through involvement with the international unions, the U.S. scientific community is able to participate in standard-setting, nomenclature decisions, research, education, and other activities that advance national interests and global priorities.  This grant furthered the U.S. participation in six international scientific unions:  the International Astronomical Union (IAU), the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr), the International Union of Mathematics (IMU), the International Commission for Optics (ICO), and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP).  The NAS is the adhering member for the United States to these unions, and membership responsibilities are carried out through the U.S. National Committees (USNCs).     INTELLECTUAL MERIT  During the grant period, each of the six U.S. national committees completed a strategic planning process for the 2015-2017 time period.  USNC goals are tied both to U.S. interests and to union priorities, and include:  USNC/Astronomy:  Host a successful IAU General Assembly in Hawaii in 2015; and improve interactions between the USNC and U.S.-based IAU Division and Commission leaders USNC/Chemistry:  Develop and provide U.S. input into the IUPAC strategic review and planning process; develop programs to highlight and further fundamental chemical research to meet societal needs; and support the development of a diverse chemical workforce USNC/Crystallography:  Provide a coordinated program for the International Year of Crystallography 2014; develop cohesiveness among crystallographers in the Americas; and provide a voice for the U.S. crystallographic community in the management of the nation's user facilities and international crystallographic databases  USNC/Mathematics:  Support the IMUÆs workforce development programs; and support the IMUÆs work in electronic publishing  USNC/Optics:  Support the International Year of Light 2015; and identify best practices in promoting diversity in optics and photonics   USNC/Physics:  Address national barriers to the hosting of international physics meetings; and strengthen U.S. participation and generate input for IUPAP Working Groups      In addition, each of the USNCs prepared for its related union governance meeting, referred to as a General Assembly (GA).  Tasks included identifying ways to achieve U.S. priorities in the union; drafting and submitting resolutions and nominations; organizing U.S. events; building coalitions with other delegations; developing positions on other countriesÆ resolutions; selecting and preparing delegates; and organizing and hosting U.S. events and activities.      BROADER IMPACT  The U.S. benefits from scientific exchanges with other countries.  For example, the USNC/Astronomy, working closely with the American Astronomical Society, is serving as the National Organizing Member for the IAU General Assembly in 2015.  This event will bring worldwide astronomy to the United States and to the general public.  The USNC/Mathematics work with developing countries creates opportunities and bridges that ultimately help the United States in developing mathematical talent worldwide through science diplomacy.  U.S. participation in the international scientific union governance meetings contributes to positive international respect for, and collaboration with U.S. scientists and mathematicians; educational opportunities in the international arena for U.S. early career scientists and mathematicians; and enhanced U.S. awareness of international perspectives and policies.
