<AbstractNarration>This project - jointly funded with the Chinese National Science Foundation (NSFC) - will study the relationships among ecological/evolutionary measures of biodiversity, and ecosystem functions. In particular, the investigators will investigate the hypothesis that succession drives changes in biodiversity, which in turn causes altered ecosystem function. Researchers will study the biodiversity of plant and insect assemblages on islands in the Thousand-Island Lake in China. This man-made lake was created in 1959 as the result of dam construction. As the water level rose, previously continuous terrestrial habitats were fragmented into islands. The project will investigate three dimensions of biodiversity on islands of different successional stages, their interrelationships, and linkages to ecosystem function. Field surveys of plant and insect communities will be combined with experimental manipulations of biodiversity, and laboratory-based functional and genetic analyses of plant and insect samples to examine biodiversity and ecosystem function patterns in this unusual habitat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will allow this international team to gain a better understanding of linkages among the multiple dimensions of biodiversity, ecosystem function, and habitat fragmentation, by taking advantage of the highly replicated, natural, insular environment of Thousand-Island Lake. This project will serve as a long-term platform for collaborations between US and Chinese scientists and students.  Results of this study will be disseminated through publications in peer-reviewed journals, conference presentations, and teaching/training activities. The project will provide high-quality research opportunities for young scientists and students through hands-on research and via organized workshops. It will emphasize the involvement of underrepresented groups in science via existing student outreach programs at the researchers' home institutions.  The researchers will work with local managers and tourist groups on the Thousand-Island Lake islands to promote public education about biodiversity in the face of habitat fragmentation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PROJECT OUTCOMES REPORT  Project Title: Dimensions US-China: Collaborative Research: Phylogenetic, Functional, and Genetic Diversity and Ecosystem Functions in a Fragmented Landscape     Report Period ? Start Date: 01-01-2014 | End Date: 08-31-2019  Awardee: Arizona State University  Award Number: DEB-1342757  PI/PD: Jianguo Wu     Habitat loss and fragmentation has been the primary cause for the rapid decline of the world?s biodiversity, which has several dimensions.  However, existing studies have focused mainly on one dimension of biodiversity ? species diversity.  As a result, there is comparatively little knowledge on the ecological causes and consequences of other biodiversity dimensions, particularly in highly fragmented environments.  Using the Thousand Island Lake (TIL) of southern China as a model system, which includes more than 1000 mountain top islands formed after damming a river in 1959, this project was designed to study how landscape fragmentation would impact the multiple dimensions of biodiversity (species, phylogenetic, functional, and genetic diversity) of woody plants and insects.       The project established a comprehensive geospatial database of geographical and environmental attributes of the islands and surrounding landscapes, using both remote sensing data and field survey data.  Based on this database we systematically assessed the impacts of landscape fragmentation on species and functional diversity at multiple scales in the Thousand Island Lake region.  Our study shows that, during the past several decades, the composition of the Thousand Island Lake landscape has changed little, but landscape configuration has changed dramatically.  The impacts of habitat loss had much greater impacts on species diversity measures than habitat fragmentation per se (or habitat isolation).  Habitat fragmentation resulted in hierarchically nested selective pressures across plot-, patch-, and landscape-scales.  The scale multiplicity of species diversity in the archipelago of land-bridge islands of the TIL region was evident.  At the plot-scale, edge effects slightly reduced species richness.  The landscape surrounding each island had an effect on island species richness, but that the effects of landscape configuration were not significant.  Overall, we found that groups of small islands had significantly more species than groups of large islands with the same total habitat area.      Our results also show that interior plots had higher proportions of shade-tolerant trees and lower proportions of shade-intolerant trees when measured using either richness or abundance metrics.  In contrast, the proportion of the community consisting of shrubs were not related to plot type in general.  Island size also affected the species composition at both the plot and island levels.  But no effects of island size on the proportion of shade-intolerant shrubs were found.  In addition, we found that habitat fragmentation influences &beta;-diversity of plants primarily by modifying local &alpha;-diversity, not spatial turnover in the Thousand Island Lake system.  Area-dependent environmental filtering and differential plant responses across functional types were the most likely underlying driving mechanisms. These results highlight the importance of hierarchical linkages between components of biodiversity across scales in fragmented landscapes, and have important implications for biodiversity conservation and ecological restoration.     An important component of this collaborative research program was to provide training for postdocs and graduate students in research design, fieldwork, data analysis, and manuscript preparation.  This project supported two doctoral students and a Research Associate at Arizona State University.  Several visiting students and researchers also benefited from the project through interactions in the PI?s research lab.  In addition, our research project of the Thousand Island Lake has been used as a quintessential example of how habitat fragmentation affects biodiversity in the Landscape Ecology class taught by the PI at Arizona State University during the past five years.  The project?s results have been disseminated in peer-reviewed journals, presentations at conferences, and invited seminars at universities and research institutes (see Products).  The key findings of the project, especially on the negative ecological consequences of landscape fragmentation and river damming have been presented in 16 peer-reviewed journal articles and at 31 invited presentations at national and international conferences by PI?s group.
