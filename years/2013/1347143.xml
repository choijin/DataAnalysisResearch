<AbstractNarration>Astronomy is a fully international endeavor; we all share the same sky. To participate in the international scientific community, American researchers must meet and collaborate with researchers from around the world.  Every three years, the International Astronomical Union has a General Assembly accompanied by topical symposia, joint discussions, working groups, and business meetings.  The next such meeting, in August 2015, will be held in Hawaii and hosted by the US (the last US-hosted meeting was in 1988).  In order to ensure a vigorous participation by the US astronomical community, this award will fund small travel grants to approximately 200 US astronomers.  Preference will be given to early-career astronomers, astronomers from less-endowed institutions, and astronomers playing an active role in the governance of the IAU and the conduct of the associated symposia.  Scientists supported by this program will come from a wide range of educational institutions, museums, planetariums, etc.  The experiences they gain from this meeting will be shared with a broad segment of the US population, exposing them to the global nature of astronomy and the importance of international collaboration to the advancement of science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The small travel grant program will be administered by the American Astronomical Society (AAS), the principal professional organization for US astronomers.  They have very successfully and economically administered similar programs in the past, and the proposed procedures ensure that these funds will provide the maximum benefit to the astronomical community at minimal cost.  The AAS will solicit proposals, select awardees, issue funds to be used for airfare only, collect receipts and meeting reports from the grantees, and prepare a final assessment and report on the entire program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The American Astronomical Society, the largest professional membership organization for research astronomers and scientists working in closely aligned disciplines like planetary science and heliophysics, regularly seeks funding from the National Science Foundation for funds to enable scientists to attend international conferences.  Our International Travel Grant Program, supported with funding from the NSF, helps enable early-career US-based astronomers, astronomers from institutions without access to significant resources, and astronomers performing special or important roles in an international conference to pay the cost of international airfare on a US flag carrier to the meeting location from their home institution.  Applicants must be active astronomers in the United States and complete applications that describe why they need to attend and the benefit that attending will have on their research career and the scientific discipline itself. We have two deadlines for applications each year and typically fund 35-55 people for travel at each deadline.  We work with the applicants to ensure they utilize the lowest possible airfare and are compliant with all NSF travel regulations.  Further, we try and ensure that travellers are sent to a range of meetings instead of just one or two.  We have run the program for many decades.  Usually, every three years, the International Astronomical Union holds its General Assembly somewhere in the world, and we support travel to a larger number of scientists, using the same criteria as described above, to attend this special conference.  However, in 2015, the IAU General Assembly was, for the first time in nearly 30 years, held in the United States.  To ensure the largest number of US astronomers could attend, we sought special funding from the NSF under this grant to facilitate astronomers attendance at this conference, which was held over a two week period in August of 2015 in Honolulu, Hawaii.  The meeting, attended in the end by more than 2500 astronomers from around the world, was deemed a great success by the attendees, who felt it suffered from only one problem, too many interesting science sessions happening at one time!    For this meeting, we funded 121 individuals from more than 50 different institutions in the United States to attend the conference.  Thirty (30) were Graduate Students, 31 were postdoctoral researchers and 38 were professors, with more than half of these early-career professors.  The remainder of the awardees were either undergraduate students or some other kind of researcher.   We feel a strong showing by US Astronomers at the IAU General Assembly is important for the reputation of our Nation and benefits the scientists working in our country as well, by allowing them to keep aware of what is happening internationally, form new collaborations and partnerships and build long-term partnerships, which help maintain US leadership in our discipline.  We gratefully acknowledge the taxpayers of the United States of America for enabling this program, the members of Congress for funding the NSF and supporting its activities and the dedicated civil servants and other workers at the NSF for their efforts.
