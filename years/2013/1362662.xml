<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic &amp; Mechanism B Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry, Professor Jason Shearer of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Nevada, Reno will pursue research aimed at understanding how thiolate ligated transition metal centers facilitate proton coupled electron transfer (PCET) reactions. PCET reactions involve the net transfer of a hydrogen atom, and are of fundamental importance in chemistry and biology. Despite their importance, the details of such reactions are still a subject of intense debate and study. This project focuses on understanding the role of protonated thiolate ligands coordinated to reduced late first-row transition metal centers (R-S(H+)-M) in such reactions. Reactions supported by the R-S(H+)-M moiety have potential importance in many biological systems ranging from those that facilitate hydrogen production to long-range electron transfer to substrate reduction. As such, this subset of PCET reactions have potential applications in the development of new bioinspired technologies with relevance to the hydrogen economy and industrial catalysis (substrate redox chemistry). In addition to the design and production of small molecule systems that can facilitate R-S(H+)-M mediated PCET reactions, the project will also examine how the fundamental physical properties of these systems contribute to the overall PCET reaction. Student training and the development of new scientific techniques that will be applicable beyond the specific research pursued under this initiative are fundamental aspects of this project.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The near simultaneous transfer of a proton and an electron is a fundamentally important chemical process. There is strong evidence that protonated thiolate ligands coordinated to late first-row transition metals in low oxidation states (R-S(H+)-M; M = Fe - Ni) can reduce substrates through PCET processes. The overall goals of this project are to a) understand how general such reactions are, and b) explore their applicability to important biological and chemical processes (i.e. hydrogen production, long range electron transfer, and substrate reduction). Specifically, this research seeks to understand the fundamental aspects of R-S(H+)-Ni mediated reduction reactions using reduced thiolate ligated Ni(II) and Ni(I) containing complexes and metallopeptides. Special emphasis will be given to understanding the metalloenzyme nickel superoxide dismutase, which likely utilizes a Cys-S(H+)-Ni moiety to facilitate oxygen anion reduction. The geometric structure, physical properties (R-S(H+)-Ni acidity, redox potentials), and electronic structure of protonated nickel-thiolate complexes with their ability to perform PCET reactions will be correlated.  Attention will also be given to the fundamental details of the overall PCET process (i.e. distinguishing between concerted vs. sequential PCET vs. hydrogen atom transfer reactions).</AbstractNarration>

This process will generate a sulfur-protonated thiolate-ligated metal-center (the M-S(H+)-R moiety). This moiety has been speculated as being an important feature in biological transformations for many years, and recently has been observed in the H2 producing metalloenzyme nickel-iron hydrogenase ([Ni,Fe]H2ase) and the superoxide detoxification enzyme nickel superoxide dismutase (NiSOD). We have speculated that protonation of the M-S-R group, forming the M-S(H+)-R moiety, could be important in modulating the electronic structure of the metal-site such that it is poised for reactivity, participate in acid/base chemistry, and facilitate hydrogen atom transfer reactions (i.e. Mn-S(H+)-R &agrave; Mn+1-S-R + H&bull;). To gain insight into these processes, we have prepared a number of nickel and iron containing metallopeptide and small molecule based systems.     Major intellectual merit of our work includes:  1) The M-S-R moiety in late first row transition metal compounds can readily become protonated under mild, physiologically relevant conditions. This is important as it demonstrates that such moieties should be widely encountered in biology, and need to be considered when thinking about the structure and functions of cysteine-containing metalloprotein systems.  2) By exploring a number of metallopeptide and small molecule thiolate containing compounds, we have found that the M-S(H+)-R moiety is reasonably basic in solutions, suggesting that it is capable of participating in biological acid/base chemistry.  3) Using an active NiSOD metallopeptide-based mimic, we have discovered that the NiII-S(H+)-R moiety is capable of participating in hydrogen atom transfer chemistry. Such a reaction had not previously been proposed as capable of originating from the M-S(H+)-R moiety. Considering the ease at which these moieties can be formed under physiological conditions, we suggest that such reactions may be occurring in other systems.     The broader impacts of the science performed concerns the fact that we are exploring the chemistry of systems that can facilitate proton and electron movement. Such reactions are of fundamental importance in economically valuable processes ranging from hydrocarbon oxidations to H2 production. For example, [Ni,Fe]H2ase is capable of producing H2, an environmentally benign alternative fuel source, under environmentally friendly conditions. This enzyme contains a Ni-S(H+)-R moiety, the role of which is unknown. Our work has suggested it may be important in tuning the electronic structure of the active-site, poising the enzyme for H2 production. This suggests that any industrially viable catalysts based on this active-site will need to consider the inclusion of this moiety in their catalytic design.
