<AbstractNarration>1055949&lt;br/&gt;Dong&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Changes in the dynamic morphology of the wings directly affect the instantaneous aerodynamic forces and therefore flight behavior. As most natural fliers (e.g. dragonflies, hummingbirds and etc.) are equipped with flexible or deformable wings, it is widely believed that mechanism of wing flexibility and wing deformation can provide new mechanisms of aerodynamic force production over completely rigid wings. This proposed research intends to advance the knowledge of biological fluid dynamics in freely flying animals through an integrated computational and experimental approach. As of today, few works have been done on detailed measurements of 3D wing deformation during flapping and the associated aerodynamic benefits in the study of animal free flight. This is mainly due to the small wing size, fast motion of the wings, and unpredictable motion of flying insects/birds which makes it very hard to perform high-speed visual tracking of the details of wing flexions. To make this study possible, two sets of techniques composed of experimental measurement and computational flow simulation/analysis are currently being developed. Equipped with such tools and advancements, it is now possible to reveal the mysteries surrounding complex flight dynamics and the fundamental physics behind insect flight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: Most previous studies were limited to near-field vortex formation mechanisms of a single rigid flapping wing. The PI's current research explores freely flying animals on full-field vortex structures and associated aerodynamics of deformable flapping wings together with bodies.  The fundamental mechanism of correlation between vortex structures and aerodynamic force is being explored through a state-of-the-art immersed boundary computational fluid dynamics solver and fluid-field analysis tools. Teamed up with biologists and experimentalists, this proposed research will conduct comparative studies on wing morphology and kinematics for two-winged flyers such as hummingbirds and hawk moths, as well as four-winged flyers such as dragonflies and damselflies. A better understanding of how animal wing deformation impacts the efficiency of flight and how moving wings affect their ambient fluid environment will be developed across the animal sizes and species. This work intends to finally advance the development of a comprehensive theory of animal flight aerodynamics in the aspect of low speed low Reynolds number flow physics and dynamic force generation associated with vortex dynamics of deformable control surfaces. Methods and findings from this work could be used by scientists in different areas to study the biological aspects of animal flight in ways previously not possible, and therefore significantly advance the design of current flapping-wing micro air vehicles with superior performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: This proposed research will enhance the infrastructure for research and education through the interactions between the PI and collaborators' expertise in biology, applied mathematics, and engineering, both nationally and internationally. The research effort fully integrates with an education and outreach program to meet the ever-increasing educational demands of bio-engineering. New courses and hands-on senior capstone projects will be developed to attract students of all backgrounds at Wright State University and be utilized by collaborators from other institutes. A more aggressive goal of this research project is to build a web-based interactive platform for biological fluid dynamics related activities, which is accessible to not only the engineering research community but also to the biological research community, as well as teachers and students at many levels. The tools built in this proposed work have the potential to be used to study other low speed low Reynolds number fluid dynamic problems such as swimming, efficient wind energy conversion, damage prevention from gusts, internal biomedical fluid dynamics applications and more.</AbstractNarration>

A few examples of projects undertaken were as follows:     Experimental work.  High speed motion reconstruction  We developed a template-based subdivision surface reconstruction method that is capable of reconstructing the wing deformations and kinematics of free-flying insects based on the output of a high-speed camera system.     Computational work.  Computational Solver  We developed a Parallel Low Speed Flow Computation Tool by using an immersed boundary method based Navier-Stokes Equation solver for deformable attaching bodies (IBM-DAB) to handle direct numerical simulations (DNS) in situations which commonly exist in nature such as solid bodies with sharp edges and with deformable attaching membrane bodies. We used the flow solver to study real-time force production, wake structures, and induced ambient flows due to the motion of flapping wings.

Tradeoff between olfaction and aerodynamics  We showed the tradeoffs between using the flapping wings to actively draw odorants to the antenna to enhance olfactory sensitivity and its aerodynamic performance.     Backward flight of a dragonfly and the role of the upstroke  We identified a flight mode in dragonflies where the upstroke instead of the downstroke is dominant in force production and unraveled the associated kinematics and aerodynamics and flow features. A strong leading edge vortex was responsible for the increase in force of the upstroke in addition to the effect of body motion.     Hummingbird Maneuver.  We developed a skeleton based reconstruction approach to extract kinematics from high speed images of a hummingbird in a yaw maneuver. Then we simulated the flow features of the wings together with the solid body without any gaps, mimicking the real hummingbird.     Wing-Body Interaction of Cicada  We clarified the effect of a flapping wing near a body and showed that wing body interaction could enhance the flight of an insect by increasing the lift substantially. The presence of the wing strong vortices on the body which increase lift.     Passive wing pitching  We developed a physics-based model of the insect wing and the mechanical properties of its hinge, and combined it with a model of the unsteady aerodynamics of flapping flight to study actuation of the wing pitch. Body rotations were shown to affect the wing pitch angles.     Ultimately, these works have advanced the understanding of flight aerodynamics in the aspect of low speed low Reynolds number flow physics and dynamic force generation associated with vortex dynamics of deformable control surfaces with applications in micro-aerial vehicle development and biology.
