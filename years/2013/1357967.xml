<AbstractNarration>The project will take closer to implementation fundamental research results in the technology of actively controlled membranes. By leveraging structures, materials, sensing and feedback control into membrane technology the project could advance fundamental as well as applied knowledge in all these areas. Via the envisioned controlled membrane devices, which will embed very recent theoretical and technological advances, this project will bring research much faster out of University Labs into the applications area and to the market. Dedicated software tools for integrated modeling and design of controlled membrane structures enhance this technology. These tools can enable certain software developers to move away from the traditional sequential approach in which each step of the modeling and design process is rather separated from other steps. The control design step is in general particularly isolated, since control design is performed after all the previous modeling and design steps have been completed. Integrated software tools will enable the multidisciplinary design approach that is nowadays facilitated by growing computational capabilities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project may impact the field of optics by providing lightweight, adaptive solutions to replace existing technology that uses heavy, glassy reflectors. Since reflectors are widely used, from space telescopes to light amplifiers in surgery rooms, the societal impact may also be multi-faceted, ranging from improved science data gathering (e.g. via space telescopes) which will enhance scientific understanding of the general public, defense capabilities (in aerospace applications), to health care equipment and conditions. Software for controlled membranes may also impact software developers by providing new, dedicated tools to address the emerging technology of lightweight controlled membrane structures. The project also has the potential to impact biology/medicine because researchers in these areas may use the software to analyze membrane behavior in biological contexts.</AbstractNarration>
