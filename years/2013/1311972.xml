<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating science and technology in nanoscale optical antenna to fill the gap for Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR). The translated science and technology in nanoscale optical antenna has the following unique features: the nanoscale optical antenna focuses light into nanoscale size with high efficiency, and moreover, can be manufactured using industrial standard technology for mass production.  HAMR has been identified as the next generation data storage technology. The key component in HAMR is a near field transducer (NFT) for producing a light spot of tens of nanometers in size for localized heating. The proposed nanoscale optical antenna is an ideal candidate for being used as the NFT to provide high efficiency and a small light spot when compared to the other NFT designs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project accomplishes this goal by proof-of concept design and analysis, prototype development, and demonstration of a fully functional NFT. Our partnership engages Advanced Storage Technology Consortium (ASTC), the consortium of the data storage companies, to provide guidance in the prototype development and commercialization as they pertain to the potential to translate the technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. The potential economic impact is expected to affect the next generation hard disk drives which currently have a market of 600 million units per year, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the data storage industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The societal impact, long term, will be on science and engineering and human resource development. The outcome of this project will have direct impact on the development of the next generation data storage technology. The project will also advance the relevant science and engineering. The ability to concentrate light into a nanoscale spot with high efficiency has significant impact not only on the HAMR technology development but also many other areas, from biological/chemical sensing to nano-photonics devices. Results of fundamental research will be broadly disseminated by journal publications, conference presentations, and websites, including Purdue's nanoHUB web portal. The proposed research will also contribute to human resource development, including providing graduate and undergraduate students with trainings in interdisciplinary areas and experience in technology transfer, integrating research outcomes with curriculum, outreaching to high school students, and recruiting and educating students from under-represented groups.</AbstractNarration>
