<AbstractNarration>The mathematical field of complex analysis has found diverse application in applied and pure sciences such as engineering and theoretical physics; complex analysis is also of foundational importance in certain subfields of mathematics. For example, physical phenomena can often be modeled with differential equations, and certain of these equations are best understood using techniques issuing from the study of complex numbers. Another example is provided by string theory in theoretical physics. Aspects of this model of high energy physics require a deep understanding of the geometry of complex numbers. This project is focussed on the geometry of spaces where complex and real variables interact.  The spaces studied with this geometry have a certain complexity that is not yet well understood but is of great interest in the mathematical community.  The PI will study this complexity and work towards building proper foundations for the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will study the CR complexity of holomorphic mappings and real submanifolds or real singular subvarieties.  The key method is to study the Hermitian matrix of coefficients of the defining equations.  This approach links the complexity of a real submanifold to a CR mapping to a hyperquadric, that is a hypersurface defined by a Hermitian form.  Hyperquadrics are the model submanifolds in CR geometry.  The greater the complexity of a submanifold, the greater the dimension that the target hyperquadric must live in, and the greater the complexity of the CR mapping involved. In particular the PI is interested in further refining the results on the singular set of Levi-flat hypersurfaces, that is sets which have in some sense the smallest CR complexity.  The proposed method is to refine the Segre variety approach that was successfully used in the PI's previous work on the subject.  To study the complexity of the set of the mappings involved, it is necessary to also understand the complexity of mappings between hyperquadrics themselves.  The PI will work to refine the quantitative results in previous work by applying a mix of techniques from commutative algebra and analysis that has proved successful before.  This work will then be applied to more general domains.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The motivation of this proposal was to study the so-called CR (Cauchy-Riemann) complexity, a relatively new subfield of CR geometry.  In many applications of mathematics to the physical sciences, one naturally finds the use of complex numbers and quantities (functions) depending on one or several complex variables.  For example, in classical physics complex numbers can represent dynamic phenomena for example signals which have a magnitude and phase shift.  In quantum mechanics, we find the state of the world can be expressed as a complex valued function.  A holomorphic function is a complex-valued function that is constructed naturally using algebraic operations (possibly infinitely many) with the complex variable inputs.  For example, essentially all commonly seen functions such as polynomials, the exponential, logarithm, sine and cosine, and their various combinations, are holomorphic functions.  Another way to view such function is as a solution to the so-called Cauchy-Riemann differential equations.  A holomorphic function is not defined for all possible values of the variables, and therefore it is the domain of its definition must be understood.  The geometry of the boundary of these domains (or in general the geometry of arbitrary objects in the space of several complex variables) is called CR geometry.  CR complexity is the study of the complexity of such boundaries or objects usually in terms of certain mappings to model surfaces of CR geometry, that is, spheres and hyperquadrics.  The objects with the lowest complexity, so-called Levi-flat hypersurfaces, can naturally be boundaries for holomorphic functions from either side, as opposed to say a sphere which is naturally only a boundary from one side (the inside).  Among the several major outcomes of the PIs investigations, we highlight the following, which fulfill the intellectual merit of the award.  1) Singular Levi-flat hypersurfaces in a projective space (a natural extension of the space of several complex variables) that are defined in a natural way via a path in the so-called Grassmanian were investigated and classified in this project.  These hypersurfaces can arise when considering the set of complex directions as we are traveling along another surface.  2) The PI together with Xianghong Gong has classified and normalized Levi-flat surfaces (of codimension 2, that is, 2 dimensions less than the ambient space) with a singularity in its CR geometry.  In particular, we found that even though at a generic point, these surfaces cannot be distinguished (all nonsingular Levi-flat surfaces are indistinguishable as far as CR geometry is concerned), at the singular point there exist infinitely many distinct such surfaces.  This work builds upon the pioneering work of Bishop, Moser, Webster, and others in two complex dimensions, where we studied the case of 3 and higher dimensions.  3) The PI and John P. D'Angelo have begun the investigation of homotopies (continuous deformations) of CR mappings between spheres.  We proved that given any source and target dimension there exist only finitely many map classes which cannot be deformed into one another.  Furthermore, when going from 2 to 3 dimensions we used the classical result of Faran to show that there exist exactly 4 such classes.  4) The PI together with Alan Noell and Sivaguru Ravisankar investigated extension properties of CR functions in the space of several complex variables together with one real variable (which is, in fact, the model Levi-flat hypersurface).  We have obtained several of the classical theorems of several complex variables in this setting, for example, the CR extension in the nondegenerate CR singularity case, and even global results such as the Hartogs-Bochner theorem.  Furthermore, we produced a certain solution to the Levi-flat Plateau problem, that is, given a boundary produce a "minimal energy" surface with a given boundary (in the classical setting in physics, this surface is the soap bubble caught in a wire boundary).  In the Levi-flat setting a nonsingular solution does not always exist, and in general, it is not always known if and when even a singular solution exists.  The PI has also worked on several only tangentially related projects, such as work in quantum computing with Wallach and Shakeel, or harmonic analysis with Gallagher and Ramachandran.  The broader impact of this work includes training Masters and Ph.D. students.  The PI has one Ph.D. student currently working on related projects.  One Masters student has completed a thesis on CR complexity, and one Masters student is currently working on a thesis.  The work also served as training for postdoctoral students.  Ravisankar and Ramachandran were postdoctoral researchers at OSU for part of this work.  During the project, the PI has also written a textbook on several complex variables, which is available freely online, and the PI has also updated his other free online textbooks.
