<AbstractNarration>Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) is an essential tool for cell and molecular biology research in the Biology, Neuroscience and Health and Exercise Sciences programs at Skidmore College. Training and hands-on experience with state-of-the-art CLSM is an essential facet of undergraduate training at Skidmore College. This shared instrument supports faculty and faculty-student collaborative projects in diverse areas, such as plant biology, neuroscience, mammalian physiology and microbiology. Furthermore, it directly contributes to active research collaborations between Skidmore scientists and researchers from around the world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The Olympus Fluoview 1200 confocal laser system attached to a BX-61 light microscope is being used in multiple research projects, including a comprehensive investigation of cell wall dynamics in green algae, an elucidation of various dynamic processes in model animal systems, including zebrafish and C. elegans, a study of muscle atrophy, a study of cellular mechanisms involved in cerebellar ataxin-1 function, and an analysis of biofilm formation in bacteria under metal stress. The instrument enables current users and new faculty to implement more sophisticated experiments via its advanced optical and software attributes (e.g., spectral imaging, SIM scanner). This microscope is also a core resource supporting multiple collaborative research projects involving Skidmore faculty and researchers from institutions, including Cornell University, Albany Medical College, University of Copenhagen, and National University of Ireland. Furthermore, the Fluoview 1200 provides superb opportunities for students of Skidmore to gain hands-on CLSM experience in the classroom/laboratory and in a collaborative setting with their faculty mentors in independent research and summer collaborative research, better preparing them for employment or advanced study opportunities after graduation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    The Fluoview 1200 Confocal laser system serves several outreach objectives. First, data obtained and protocols devised in this project are being used in several courses, including Advanced Light Microscopy, Plant Biotechnology and Cell Biology and the S3M Summer Transitional Program (focused on STEM underrepresented groups) as well as for independent student based research. Second, the microscope is also used for community outreach programs, including the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth, the Skidmore Scholars in Science and Mathematics, Camp Northwoods, the Skidmore Science and Math Open House, and SMIC Day. These programs provide opportunities for students from grades 1-12 to engage in hands-on science and include schools with large numbers of underrepresented groups. Furthermore, notice of the availability of this instrumentation and news regarding the research facilitated by it will be distributed throughout the greater Capital Region's academic and biotechnology community through the College's membership affiliation with Bioconnex.</AbstractNarration>
