<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemistry Major Research Instrumentation Program, Professor William Yu from Lousiana State University - Shreveport and colleagues Kui Che, M. Cran Lucas and Thomas Ticich will acquire a high resolution electron microscope (EM) with TEM (transmission), SEM (scanning), STEM and ED (electron difraction) functions. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) glycosaminoglycans and podocyte behavior, (b) study of anti-cancer agents based on fusarochromanone (FC101a), (c) magnetic nanocrystals for cancer detection and treatment, (d) inhibiting lymphatogenous tumor metastasis by nanoshell-mediated hyperthermia, (e) TEM analysis of carbon nanostructures synthesized in an ethanol burner, (f) porous stainless steel supported iron oxide nanoparticle membranes for arsenic removal from water, and (g) disruption of crystalline cellulose for efficient enzymatic adsorption and hydrolysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An electron microscope uses high energy electrons in the characterization of materials. In the transmission mode, a beam of electrons penetrates a thin layer of sample resulting in an image of the sample while in the scanning mode the electrons are used to probe the material. The electron microscope can provide higher resolution and magnification than a microscope using light to probe the material. It can provide useful details of the material down to near atomic size levels. This instrumentation will provide microscopy training and research opportunities to large numbers of students across many fields including chemistry, biology, physics, materials and engineering.</AbstractNarration>
