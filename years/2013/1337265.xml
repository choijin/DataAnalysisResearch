<AbstractNarration>1337265&lt;br/&gt;Jin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal seeks to acquire a new fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS), FACSAria III,to upgrade a multiuser-shared FACS that has been serving the entire campus of the University of Arkansas (UA) for more than 18 years. The requested new generation FACSAria III is capable of sorting four different types of cells and analyzing nine fluorescence markers simultaneously. Its rates of analysis and sorting are 75,000 events/second and 25,000 cells/second, respectively, with 98% of purity. This rapid sorting capability will significantly improve cell survival rate and reduce the chances of cell contamination. Access to this state-of-the-art flow cytometer and cell sorter will have an immediate and tremendous impact on UA researchers and students. Since flow cytometric analysis of cell types and further sorting them based on their properties are absolute pre-requisites for performing high-quality life science and biomedical research, FACSAria will propel UA?s recent health research initiative, boost faculty research capabilities in the newly-formed biomedical engineering department, and help more individuals on campus obtain preliminary results to seek NSF or NIH funding.</AbstractNarration>

After its installation, the instrument has been continuously maintained in operational condition and running on a regular basis. All research/training needs and service requests have been successfully accommodated since the installation of the instrument.     Intellectual Merit:    The instrument has served 17 research groups from 7 Departments (Biological Sciences, Chemistry &amp; Biochemistry, Physics, Poultry Science, Animal Science, Food Science, and Biomedical Engineering) in 3 Colleges (Agriculture, Arts and Sciences, and Engineering) with cell sorting and analysis in the past years. The research fields of the faculty members who used this facility are well diversified ranging from bacteria biology through human cancer to biophysics. The experience in the past several years demonstrates that the facility is indispensable for the research programs of many laboratories. Thus, the cell sorting facility has become an essential component of important research infrastructure at the University of Arkansas and plays vital roles in supporting many cutting-edge biomedical and interdisciplinary fundamental research on this campus.  The instrument has allowed several new professors without tenure to obtain preliminary data necessary for successful grant funding.  Several student Ph.D. dissertations have benefitted from the acquisition of this instrument.      Broader Impacts:    The FACSAria Fusion instrument has been vital to developing the infrastructure related to life science research on the University of Arkansas campus.  The majority of users impacted by this instrument were either graduate or undergraduate students learning the necessary skills for their research.  Courses that include training components regarding this instrumentation and its critical role for solving different problems in cellular sorting and analysis have been implemented to provide more theoretical background and training for students.  The hands-on experiences with this high end instrument enable those students to fully understand the capabilities of this powerful instrument and use it as a powerful tool to address their scientific research needs.  Therefore, this flow cytometry facility also contributes significantly to training students in doing cutting-edge research and career development of students. After the NSF grant support ends, this flow cytometry facility will continue serving the scientific community at the University of Arkansas for research and training in the area of cell/particle sorting and analysis for many years to come.
