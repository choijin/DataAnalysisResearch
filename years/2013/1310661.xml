<AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Two-dimensional (2D) crystals are a fascinating new class of materials that exhibit novel electronic, spintronic, and optical properties. In this project, we will use optical techniques to investigate the spin-dependent properties of two types of 2D crystals: MoS2 (and related metal dichalcogenides) and graphene. Monolayer MoS2 is a direct gap semiconductor with a giant spin splitting of the valence band at the K/K' valleys. Interestingly, this is predicted to suppress most types of spin relaxation and generate long spin lifetimes for holes. Further, the giant spin splitting makes MoS2 a promising candidate for realizing the intrinsic spin Hall effect. Our aim is to observe these novel properties using time-resolved Kerr microscopy to directly measure the spin polarization and spin dynamics in MoS2. Graphene is a promising material for spintronics due to its long spin diffusion length at room temperature. The forefront of the field of graphene spintronics concerns the nature of spin relaxation and induced magnetism.  Nearly all studies are based on spin transport, but this approach has its limitations such as spin relaxation induced by ferromagnetic contacts and reliance on Hanle analysis. We will utilize time-resolved optical techniques to overcome these limitations. Together, these studies on MoS2 and graphene lie at the forefront of spin-dependent physics in 2D crystals. This project will support the education of two PhD students, who will receive excellent training for careers in industry and academia.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Two-dimensional (2D) crystals are a remarkable class of materials that exhibit fascinating new properties and have the potential to revolutionize electronics beyond conventional silicon technologies. In particular for spintronic devices, 2D crystals are exhibiting much better performance than their three-dimensional counterparts and special spin-dependent properties related to their 2D structure are predicted. Why does 2D perform better, can it be further improved, and can the predicted new properties be demonstrated? To answer such key questions, we will use powerful imaging techniques combining ultrafast pulsed lasers and optical microscopes to directly visualize the motion and rotation of electron spins in 2D crystals. The spin can be thought of as a tiny magnet that is attached to an electron as is flows through a device. In a spintronic device, the direction of an electron's magnetic poles ("north" and "south") is used to carry information throughout the device, and this information can be manipulated by rotating the direction of the poles. By using lasers and optics to image the motion and rotation of these magnetic poles (i.e. spin), we can investigate how they hold information, how they lose information, and how the direction of the poles is related to the electron's motion. Understanding these issues will enable the development of advanced spintronic devices for electronics beyond silicon. This project will support the education of two PhD students, who will receive excellent training for careers in industry and academia.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Progress in modern electronics has occurred by the continued reduction in the size of devices following a trend known as Moore&rsquo;s Law &ndash; the number of transistors doubles every 18 months for the same size of computer chip.&nbsp; Taken to new extremes, new types of metals and semiconductors have reduced the size down to atomically thin membranes, and these two-dimensional (2D) materials can be stacked to combine their properties in unique ways. Notably, these new 2D materials are especially promising for spintronics, an advanced approach to information storage and logic operations that offers energy efficient solutions for computers and electronics of the future. For spintronics, the main difference from conventional electronics is that the information is encoded in the electron&rsquo;s &ldquo;spin&rdquo; instead of its charge. One can view each electron as a tiny magnet with north and south poles, where the spin is an arrow pointing from the north to south pole. When a group of electrons have their magnetic poles aligned it is said to be &ldquo;spin polarized,&rdquo; and creating, controlling, and detecting this spin polarization is crucial for spintronic devices. Because the electron spin is intimately connected to magnetism, it can take advantage of &ldquo;nonvolatile,&rdquo; or zero-energy, magnetic information storage for low power electronics. In addition, there are potential new opportunities for coupling spins to photons for optoelectronic and quantum information technologies.</p> <p>But before any applications can be developed, the immediate challenge is to understand the fundamental physics. What makes 2D materials exceptionally good for spintronics? What new types of spintronic phenomena could be observed in these materials? How can one manipulate the information stored in the electron&rsquo;s spin? What is the ultimate limit for spintronics technology based on 2D materials? Investigating these types of scientific questions has been the primary goal of this project.</p> <p>To tackle such questions, the Kawakami group has developed advanced optical microscopies combined with sensitive electrical measurements to investigate the motion and dynamics of the electron spin polarization within individual sheets of 2D materials as well as layered stacks. This has led to several important advances including the following three breakthroughs.</p> <p>First, the Kawakami group developed a high-speed scanning optical imaging technique to capture the dynamics of spin polarization in a 2D semiconductor known as a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD). As shown in the figure titled &ldquo;Imaging Spin Dynamics in Monolayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMD)&rdquo;, spin polarization is optically generated in a triangular TMD island. By taking sequential snapshots of the spin polarization at various later times, the images reveal a complex pattern and a gradual decay over several thousand picoseconds. This movie-making capability provides a direct measure of spin dynamics in TMDs with high spatial resolution.</p> <p>Second, the Kawakami group has demonstrated magnetic quantum control of spin currents in graphene, a 2D conductor consisting of atomic sheets of carbon. As shown in the figure titled &ldquo;Magnetic Quantum Control of Spin Currents in Graphene&rdquo;, graphene sits on a ferrimagnetic insulator (FMI) film and is contacted by ferromagnetic electrodes that electrically inject and detect spin polarization in the graphene. When the magnetic dipoles (red arrow) of the FMI are parallel to the spin polarization (blue arrows), the electron spins are able to transmit from the injector to the detector (&ldquo;On&rdquo; State). But when the magnetic dipoles of the FMI are perpendicular to the spin polarization, the electron spins dephase and do not reach the detector (&ldquo;Off&rdquo; State). This long sought after control of spin currents is the magnetic analog of a transistor and is based on the quantum mechanical interaction between electron spins in graphene and the magnetic dipoles of the FMI.</p> <p>Third, using a combination of scanning optical imaging and electrical detection of spin, a new type of multifunctional 2D spintronic device was demonstrated. Using a TMD/graphene stacked structure, the Kawakami group has shown, for the first time, the successful optical injection and lateral transport of spin polarization within a single 2D spintronic device. As shown in the figure titled &ldquo;Optical Spin Injection and Transport in TMD/Graphene&rdquo;, circularly-polarized light generates spin polarization within the TMD, which travels through the graphene and is measured electrically by the ferromagnetic (FM) detector. Notably, this device operates successfully at room temperature, which lays the foundation for multifunctional 2D spintronics.</p> <p>This cutting edge research program is integrated with an educational outreach program to provide broader impact beyond the research results. This includes extensive involvement of undergraduate researchers and international visiting scholars, as well as special programs for high school summer internships and visits to secondary schools. The Kawakami group has developed and delivered nanoscience/nanotechnology presentations for the elementary and middle school levels. In addition, the five week high school internship program provides full-time interaction with graduate students and a structure for efficient teaching of modern scientific research topics and experimental techniques at an introductory level.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 04/10/2017<br>      Modified by: Roland&nbsp;K&nbsp;Kawakami</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1310661/1310661_10259145_1491788500013_imagingspin--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1310661/1310661_10259145_1491788500013_imagingspin--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Imaging Spin Dynamics in Monolayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMD)"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1310661/1310661_10259145_1491788500013_imagingspin--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Imaging Spin Dynamics in Monolayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMD)"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">High speed optical imaging is used to capture the dynamics of spin polarized electrons in a triangular sheet of a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD).
