<AbstractNarration>Overview:&lt;br/&gt;The 2014 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on the Origins of Life will bring together researchers from diverse backgrounds to discuss topics aimed at understanding the origin of life on Earth and its potential distribution throughout the universe. It brings together biologists, geologists, chemists, physicists, astronomers and practitioners of numerous other disciplines from a wide variety of geographical locations. Speakers include a wide spectrum of individuals from universities, research institutes, and government organizations. The meeting will be held January 12-17th at the Hotel Galvez in Galveston, Texas. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The 2014 meeting is organized by Dr. Steven A. Benner (The Foundation for Applied Molecular Evolution, Gainesville, FL) and Dr. Stephen Freeland (Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawaii, HI). Both organizers are well respected in the Origins of Life community and represent several disciplines included in the meeting's scientific agenda. Topics of discussion will include: the nature and experimental reconstitution of the earliest cells; the study of organic compounds in extraterrestrial environments and their possible contribution to the prebiotic inventory, the nature of the early Earth and other planetary environments, self-replicating chemical systems, the origin and evolution of the translation apparatus and the search for life beyond Earth. The Gordon Research Conferences have a long history of providing a venue for scientific exchange among junior investigators and senior scientists in small, intimate meetings. The format of the GRC itself will follow an established pattern that includes formal talks, posters, and ample time for informal discussion. These meetings foster an atmosphere of intense scientific interaction and many opportunities for building scientific networks. Compared to other meetings on the origin of life, this meeting fills a unique niche in two respects: it has a narrower scientific focus than many larger meetings (International Conference on the Origin of Life, Bioastronomy, Astrobiology), and the U.S. location allows facile participation by young scientists who frequently cannot afford to attend international meetings abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the scientific discourse, the 2014 GRC will also explore the role of philanthropy in Big Science and how private entrepreneurs can better interact with scientists. Improving science literacy among the public will also be discussed including methods of how to effectively transfer science into science fiction in popular culture. A large effort is being made to increase the participation of women and minority groups at the meeting, including serving as discussion leaders and speakers. A concerted effort is being made to advertise the meeting to national and international organizations, including former attendees of GRC and Gordon Research Seminars (GRS) series in this and other disciplines, and members of the major international astrobiological societies.</AbstractNarration>
