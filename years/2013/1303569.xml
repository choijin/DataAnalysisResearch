<AbstractNarration>This proposal will provide partial support to U.S. graduate students, postdocs and young scientists to attend the workshop "Properties and Processes of Crustal Fault Zones" to be held in the Erice, Sicily (Italy), from May 18 to May 24, 2013. No tenured faculty will be supported with these funds, and priority will be given to underrepresented groups. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the workshop is to bring together the leading experts from various sub-disciplines of earth sciences, material science, and physics to facilitate the exchange and integration of ideas, methods and results across the typical disciplinary boundaries in an attempt to provide a holistic examination of the structure and evolution of fault zones in relation to earthquakes properties and generated ground motion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed funding provides an important opportunity for U.S. students and early career scientists to meet and interact with their peers and with the leaders in the various fields in an informal setting, gaining a deeper and broader understanding, and forming the basis for future international cross-disciplinary collaborations.</AbstractNarration>
