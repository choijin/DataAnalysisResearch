<AbstractNarration>1347992&lt;br/&gt;Sonder&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports development of an experimental capability to control influencing parameters and study the behavior of phreatomagmatic events.  Specifically, the PIs will develop a significantly and, as of yet unexplored, up-scaled device for controlling and observing the behavior of triggered explosive phreatomagmatic volcanism by: 1) assembling and developing a tiltable furnace for melting natural igneous rock; 2) developing a 25-50 L insulated crucible into which the melt would be poured and through the base of which water can be injected at various isolated points throughout the melt to create a phreatomagmatic ?premix? in which a quasi-stable water vapor phase separates the liquid water from the melt; 3) developing a trigger system (e.g., an air gun directed into the crucible containing the premix or a hammer device) to induce breakdown of separating water vapor phase such that direct interaction of hot magma and liquid water causes rapid cooling and leads to explosive volcanism; and 4) instrumenting the crucible with observation methodologies to study the mechanical and dynamical behavior of the system (e.g., high-speed force transducers mounted on the bottom of the crucible to measure the vertical forces of explosion, thermocouples within the crucible to measure melt temperatures, high speed cameras to observe ejecta).  The development of the device will involve consultation with scientists at Wurzburg University in Germany and engage a Ph.D. student in instrument system engineering and experimentation.  Initial experiments will varying the pre-mix parameters (injected water geometry and volumes and preloading of water down the crucible supply ramp ? dynamic premix), testing differing triggering mechanisms and subsequent study of ejecta (e.g., grain size analysis, spatial distribution, textural and mineralogical study of ash minerals).  Melt composition will be maintained as a constant for experiments.   The explosive experiments will be carried out at an extant outdoor facility (the GeoHazards Field Station leased by SUNY-Buffalo that is already permitted for explosives.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed scale of the device represents the potential for a two order of magnitude increase in the volume of magma premix that has hitherto been experimentally controlled to study phreatomagmatism and presents an interesting mid-scale parameter space to study of phreatomagmatic behavior and the conditions that favor hazardous ash clouds and pyroclastic density current formation.   This scale of experiment is far from the scale of natural systems, but should offer new insights into questions surrounding the nature of phreatomagmatism including: 1) what is the influence of many water domains entrapped in the melt on explosion intensity when they are homogeneously and inhomogeneously distributed? and 2) is there a minimum trigger energy necessary to start the explosion, or can a premix effectively explode by itself?  Experimental results will feed into models that attempt to scale laboratory observations to natural system behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***</AbstractNarration>

Previous field-based research already had shown the high hazard potential of this phenomenon, and lab-scale experiments had revealed basic mechanisms for conditions of high interaction intensities (explosivities). The limits in our understanding concerned the scaling of that mechanism to systems larger than lab-scale.</span></p> <p class="md-end-block" style="box-sizing: border-box; orphans: 4; margin: 0.8em 0px; white-space: pre-wrap; width: inherit; position: relative; color: #333333;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">For this project an experimental facility was built that allows to conduct experiments on a scale of meters, involving about 60 kg of re-melted rock material, in contrast to 0.3?0.5 kg of melt that were used in previous decimeter-scale laboratory explosive magma-water interaction experiments. </span></p> <h6 class="md-end-block md-heading" style="box-sizing: border-box; break-after: avoid-page; break-inside: avoid; orphans: 2; font-size: 1em; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; position: relative; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.4; cursor: text; color: #777777; white-space: pre-wrap; width: inherit;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">Rock Melting Facility</span></h6> <p class="md-end-block" style="box-sizing: border-box; orphans: 4; margin: 0.8em 0px; white-space: pre-wrap; width: inherit; position: relative; color: #333333;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">Today the Rock Melting Facility consists of an induction furnace that is mounted on a hydraulically operated tilting stand. While the furnace is protected from weather, experiments are conducted outside. Once melted, the basaltic rock material typically has temperatures between 1300 and 1350?C, and can be poured from the furnace either into insulated containers, or onto prepared flow channels. The facility provides custom tools (e.g. a rail system) and equipment necessary for melt handling and experimentation at these melt volumes and temperatures.</span></p> <p class="md-end-block" style="box-sizing: border-box; orphans: 4; margin: 0.8em 0px; white-space: pre-wrap; width: inherit; position: relative; color: #333333;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">[2 images]</span></p> <h6 class="md-end-block md-heading" style="box-sizing: border-box; break-after: avoid-page; break-inside: avoid; orphans: 2; font-size: 1em; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; position: relative; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.4; cursor: text; color: #777777; white-space: pre-wrap; width: inherit;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">Magma-Water Interaction Experiments</span></h6> <p class="md-end-block" style="box-sizing: border-box; orphans: 4; margin: 0.8em 0px; white-space: pre-wrap; width: inherit; position: relative; color: #333333;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">Two series of initial experiments were successfully conducted, and results were published in the Journal of Geophysical Research (Sonder et al., 2018). Our experimental results show intense magma-water interaction. We think that there is room to increase the overall intensity of the process by optimizing the water-melt mixing system. However, the current experimental state already showed that intense magma-water interaction can  start spontaneously without an external trigger event. This was a major question for the application of the laboratory-scale experiments to field scale considerations. The initial experiments also revealed a geometry dependency: higher melt columns above the melt-water mixing location produce higher interaction intensities.</span></p> <p class="md-end-block" style="box-sizing: border-box; orphans: 4; margin: 0.8em 0px; white-space: pre-wrap; width: inherit; position: relative; color: #333333;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">[2 images]</span></p> <h6 class="md-end-block md-heading" style="box-sizing: border-box; break-after: avoid-page; break-inside: avoid; orphans: 2; font-size: 1em; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; position: relative; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.4; cursor: text; color: #777777; white-space: pre-wrap; width: inherit;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">Heat Transfer Model Investigations</span></h6> <p class="md-end-block" style="box-sizing: border-box; orphans: 4; margin: 0.8em 0px; white-space: pre-wrap; width: inherit; position: relative; color: #333333;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">Parts of our problems in applying our knowledge on magma-water interaction to field-scale scenarios are caused by the difficult estimates of heat transfer rates across the &gt;1000 K temperature difference at the magma-water interface. To improve our understanding of this interface Prostdoctoral Researcher Pranabendu Moitra together with PI Sonder set up a laboratory-scale magma to water and magma to air experiment that focuses on measurement and reverse modeling of heat transfer rates over the many different temperature regimes in the process. The initial results on magma to air heat transfer were  published in Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems (Moitra et al., 2018). Publication of the results for the magma to water heat transfer rates and models is in preparation and will be submitted in the first quarter of 2019.</span></p> <h6 class="md-end-block md-heading" style="box-sizing: border-box; break-after: avoid-page; break-inside: avoid; orphans: 2; font-size: 1em; margin-top: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; position: relative; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1.4; cursor: text; color: #777777; white-space: pre-wrap; width: inherit;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">Open Experimental Facility</span></h6> <p class="md-end-block" style="box-sizing: border-box; orphans: 4; margin: 0.8em 0px; white-space: pre-wrap; width: inherit; position: relative; color: #333333;"><span style="box-sizing: border-box;">The rock melting facility offers rock melting-, melt handling- and experimental expertise to interested external researchers.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Intellectual Merit The project focused on a better understanding of explosive magma-water interaction, as it occurs in many volcanic eruption settings. Previous field-based research already had shown the high hazard potential of this phenomenon, and lab-scale experiments had revealed basic mechanisms for conditions of high interaction intensities (explosivities). The limits in our understanding concerned the scaling of that mechanism to systems larger than lab-scale. For this project an experimental facility was built that allows to conduct experiments on a scale of meters, involving about 60 kg of re-melted rock material, in contrast to 0.3?0.5 kg of melt that were used in previous decimeter-scale laboratory explosive magma-water interaction experiments.  Rock Melting Facility Today the Rock Melting Facility consists of an induction furnace that is mounted on a hydraulically operated tilting stand. While the furnace is protected from weather, experiments are conducted outside. Once melted, the basaltic rock material typically has temperatures between 1300 and 1350?C, and can be poured from the furnace either into insulated containers, or onto prepared flow channels. The facility provides custom tools (e.g. a rail system) and equipment necessary for melt handling and experimentation at these melt volumes and temperatures. [2 images] Magma-Water Interaction Experiments Two series of initial experiments were successfully conducted, and results were published in the Journal of Geophysical Research (Sonder et al., 2018). Our experimental results show intense magma-water interaction. We think that there is room to increase the overall intensity of the process by optimizing the water-melt mixing system. However, the current experimental state already showed that intense magma-water interaction can  start spontaneously without an external trigger event. This was a major question for the application of the laboratory-scale experiments to field scale considerations. The initial experiments also revealed a geometry dependency: higher melt columns above the melt-water mixing location produce higher interaction intensities. [2 images] Heat Transfer Model Investigations Parts of our problems in applying our knowledge on magma-water interaction to field-scale scenarios are caused by the difficult estimates of heat transfer rates across the &gt;1000 K temperature difference at the magma-water interface. To improve our understanding of this interface Prostdoctoral Researcher Pranabendu Moitra together with PI Sonder set up a laboratory-scale magma to water and magma to air experiment that focuses on measurement and reverse modeling of heat transfer rates over the many different temperature regimes in the process. The initial results on magma to air heat transfer were  published in Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems (Moitra et al., 2018). Publication of the results for the magma to water heat transfer rates and models is in preparation and will be submitted in the first quarter of 2019. Open Experimental Facility The rock melting facility offers rock melting-, melt handling- and experimental expertise to interested external researchers. A fee structure was developed, together with University at Buffalo's Research Foundation, that is compatible with most national and international funding agencies. Broader Impacts Student involvement The project trained graduate student Andrew Harp (now with a PhD) who learned hands-on techniques of rock melting and experimental procedures with high temperature materials. Other graduate and undergraduate students (currently between 20 and 30) observed some of the experiments. Video materials and some first quick results were presented in UBs weekly Volcanology seminar. Outreach The experiments provide rich visual material. It is easy for the public to understand the hazards that come with processes involving magmatic melts. Together with the UB press team the PI reached out to several news outlets that then visited the experimental site and reported on our activities. News outlets that reported on the experiments  include (but are not limited to) The Buffalo News, BBC Scottland, The Washington Post, Popular Science, Seeker, Popular Mechanics, Der Spiegel (major German news outlet), NBC News and others. NSF also showed some pictures in their weekly video show for kids. The Sonder et al., 2018 article is currently rated by altmetric (a web service that tracks the online attention generated by research articles) with 196 points, which is in the top 99th percentile of all research output that is tracked by that service.
