<AbstractNarration>A fundamental issue in cognitive science is understanding how people attribute a causal relationship to events.  People sometimes sense causal connections where they do not exist, as in superstitious behavior or pseudoscientific beliefs.   They also factor into serious psychological conditions, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder or pathological gambling, conditions characterized by unrealistically high beliefs of causal control.  Despite their pervasiveness, causal illusions are neglected by most theories of causation because these theories are intended to explain how people infer causal relations that actually exist in the world, not causation that exists only in the mind of the perceiver. The proposed research seeks to address this gap. In particular, the investigator explores the idea that causal illusions arise because people's causal representations are based on the feeling of force, and people make mistakes about causation because they often rely on cross-modal information to infer forces. Forces are understood though the sense of touch (or haptics), suggesting that haptics play a foundational role in higher-order cognition by providing a perceptual basis for the notion of causation. Much recent research indicates that the sense of touch can be triggered not only through direct physical contact with the body, but also indirectly through other modalities, such as sight. Such cross-modal interactions might explain people's vulnerability to causal illusions: because forces cannot be directly felt though vision, people may make mistakes when they use visual information to infer forces. The proposed research will also investigate the hypothesis that people's judgments of causation are based on two sources of information, one based on the impression of force and a second, based on spatial relations, which determines whether a mechanism exists for the transmission of the force. Causal illusions are proposed to occur when the impression of force suggests causation but lack of appropriate spatial relations implies that the impression of force is not substantiated. The hypothesis is tested by examining not only people's sensitivity to physical forces, but also their sensitivity to spatial cues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The proposed research reframes the discussion in the causation literature from an analysis of how the cognitive system achieves accurate representations of the world to an analysis of how and why the system can make mistakes and fall prey to superstitions, quackery, and illusions.  Results of the behavioral work will also  offer strong suggestions about how the notion of causation might be realized in the brain and help guide research examining the neural basis of causal thought.  The work may also lead to better treatment of psychological conditions associated with unrealistic beliefs about causal control (for example, in gambling addiction). The animations and haptic controller programs developed for this research will be freely available for researchers in the wider scientific community.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Causal Illusions and Forces</strong></p> <p>The perception of causation is sometimes at odds with reasoning. This was demonstrated&nbsp;<em>en masse</em>&nbsp;during the 1977 New York City blackout. Many thought that they themselves were to blame: an opera singer who touched a door knob at the exact instant the lights turned off; a child who accidentally hit a ceiling light fixture with her paddle ball. One man plugged in a toaster and thought that he had blown out the entire neighborhood. Clearly, touching a knob, hitting a ceiling light or plugging in an appliance cannot cause a massive blackout, but when the conditions are exactly right, a perception of causation may emerge nonetheless. People can experience feelings of causation while at the same time realizing that such feelings are unwarranted. At such times, they experience a&nbsp;<em>causal illusion</em>.</p> <p>Causal illusions are theoretically interesting because they highlight how people can have an impression of causation without the presence of a legitimate mechanism. This sort of impression occurs regularly, as demonstrated by people&rsquo;s beliefs in superstition and magic. It also is likely a part of certain psychological conditions, such as obsessive-compulsive disorder and pathological gambling. The funded research investigated 1) the degree to which people are predisposed to perceive causal illusions in everyday situations, 2) the theory that causal illusions imply that the perception of causation involves at least two processes, a fast and a slow process, and 3) the degree to which the perception of causation involves the perception of force.</p> <p>According to what we have called the Dual-Process Hypothesis of Causal Identification, identifying a cause involves two cognitive processes: 1) an automatic, intuitive process that identifies possible causes on the basis of perceptual cues (spatial and temporal) and 2) a slow, reflective process that identifies possible causes on the basis of causal inference, in particular, a consideration of possible mechanism. From a dual-process perspective, reasoning errors often result from an over-reliance on intuitive processes over deliberative processes (e.g., Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1974).</p> <p>We provided an initial test of this hypothesis in an experiment creating a causal illusion in a real-world setting. In this study, participants entered an elevator with a person already present. When the elevator doors began to close, the person raised has hands and moved them outward, as if he were opening the elevator doors with &ldquo;the force.&rdquo; The person was several feet away from the elevator doors, but the doors stopped closing and opened again. Unbeknownst to the participants, there was a confederate outside of the elevator who caused the elevator doors to open by pressing the outside elevator button. After opening the doors several times, the participants were asked to describe what they saw and to rate the extent to which it appeared that the person caused the elevator doors to open. Participants&rsquo; descriptions and ratings indicated that they felt the person had caused the doors to open, even though that person never touched the doors (see Figure 1).</p> <p>In a second experiment, we investigated the hypothesis that the perception of causation involves more than one process. Three types of animations were created. One type of animation depicted a common causal interaction, such as causing the trunk of a car to open by direct physical contact. Another type of animation depicted a causal illusion, such as a person appearing to open the trunk of a car by gesturing in an upward direction. A third type of animation depicted a non-causal event, such as a person watching a car trunk open spontaneously. Participants indicated their real-time impressions of causation by turning a dial on special kind of computer controller. Of central interest, when people saw animations of causal illusions, they first turned the dial to the left--indicating an initial impression of causation--and then turned the dial to the right&mdash;indicating a subsequent impression of non-causation (see Figure 2).</p> <p>In a third series of experiments, we investigated whether the perception of causation was associated with a feeling of force. If causal impressions are associated with forces, then seeing a causal interaction should affect people&rsquo;s ability to sense an actual force applied against their body. This was test in an experiment in which people saw animations of simple causal events, such as a ball colliding into another ball or a glass cup, and animations of non-causal events, such as a ball simply rolling across a table (see Figure 3). Across several experiments, we found people were faster to detect a force after they watched causal than non-causal events.</p> <p>An improved understanding of causation could aid in the development of computational tools for its automatic extraction. Accurate extraction of causation from these sources could be important because it could make the vast bodies of causal knowledge present in text and video more accessible to scientists, engineers and policy makers.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/08/2017<br>      Modified by: Phillip&nbsp;M&nbsp;Wolff</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1354088/1354088_10307381_1486576268874_Figure1_Jedi_experiment--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1354088/1354088_10307381_1486576268874_Figure1_Jedi_experiment--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1: &quot;Jedi&quot; Experiment"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1354088/1354088_10307381_1486576268874_Figure1_Jedi_experiment--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1: &quot;Jedi&quot; Experiment"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Participants felt that a person in the elevator caused an elevator door to open, seemingly by magic.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Phillip Wolff</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Phillip&nbsp;M&nbsp;Wolff</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1: "Jedi" Experiment</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1354088/1354088_10307381_1486576650424_Figure2_Dial_study--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1354088/1354088_10307381_1486576650424_Figure2_Dial_study--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2: Dual-processing in the perception of causation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1354088/1354088_10307381_1486576650424_Figure2_Dial_study--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2: Dual-processing in the perception of causation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Participants turned a dial to indicate their causal impressions.
