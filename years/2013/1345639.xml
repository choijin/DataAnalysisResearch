<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a system that, based on data analysis of past crimes, forecasts the type, location and timing of probable future crimes and automatically suggests appropriate police unit deployment.  The proposed research is innovative in two fundamental ways: First, the system will view crime occurrences and police unit deployment as a holistic problem and create both a crime forecast and the appropriate resource allocation for maximum efficiency. Second, recent advances in Robust Optimization will be used to handle any uncertainties during the resource allocation process and produce a deployment plan that yields good results under scenarios that deviate from the forecast or the allocation plan. The system will use state-of-the-art Predictive Analytics and Robust Optimization in combination or embedded within each other in order to achieve a much higher degree of effectiveness in crime prevention and to design optimal unit deployment for time horizons between one and thirty days. The proposed approach is a substantial improvement over currently available systems, which forecast crime using predictive analytics and then pass the results to either a different scheduling system or a human to design the unit deployment without any consideration for uncertainty or forecast error. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this project is to lower the crime index of police departments (PDs) by determining a series of locations and times where crimes of specific types are probable, with an acceptable degree of certainty, and suggesting deployment of appropriate units. Most PDs do not have enough resources to deploy in the vicinity of every probable crime; they need tools to help them select unit deployment by responding to the set of crimes that will have the most effect on the crime index on aggregate. They are few such tools available in the market today; most of them concentrate on creating weekly or monthly predictions, or on tracking known criminals. Some of the more advanced systems require expensive hardware and well-trained personnel to operate, putting them beyond the reach of smaller Police Departments. The proposed system will be highly customizable and capable of connecting with almost any type of data repository, while being affordable through on site or hosted access.  Therefore, it will improve crime prevention rates, decrease response time and increase the effectiveness of budget-constrained Police Departments. In the long term it will also enable strategic unit deployment, and efficient personnel planning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The aim of our Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project was to design and implement a system that will predict when and where crimes will occur, with a certain accuracy, based on historical crime data and to use these predictions in order to design a police unit deployment schedule that will allow police to prevent and/or quickly respond to crimes.  We contacted several police departments utilizing our relationship with the Boston Police Department, presented our ideas and the expected outcome of the project and asked for historical crime data, as well as any other information that would help us during the design and implementation of the algorithms. During our communications with police departments we placed a lot of effort in educating the police officers on the advantages of predictive policing and predictive analytics and optimization, as well as in understanding what specific problems they have in their day-to-day operations as well as any restrictions imposed by external factors.  We received several years of historical crime data from each police department, that include the date and time of the crime, the location, the "sector" of the town where the crime occurred and of course the type of the crime. We decided to ignore "white collar" crimes, like fraud, for which police presence has no effect, as well as minor crimes (jaywalking) and highly specialized but rare crimes like piracy.  We successfully implemented and tested several predictive analytics approaches, ranging from simple statistical methods to complex CART and regression-based algorithms and compared their predictions with real crime data. We evaluated all approaches for monthly and weekly prediction horizon.  After discussions with Police Department officials we established the parameters for the unit allocation optimization algorithm and implemented what we believe is a very flexible approach that will allow maximum control to Police Chiefs, while allowing for optimal unit placement. The algorithm takes into account "crime displacement" due to extra police presence in specific areas. The unit allocation algorithm is based on mixed integer linear optimization techniques, and utilizes slowly-moving parameters in order to avoid sudden changes in unit allocation and "flip-flop" decisions where police patrols and routes change drastically only to return to their previous status quo during to the next period We have incorporated "fairness" constraints into the algorithm, to ensure that different sectors of a town are having similar allocation changes.

During discussions with police officers and chiefs, and especially discussions with the ex-Boston Police Commissioner, we realized that while many police officers are convinced about the importance of preventative policing and even about predictive policing, they are uncertain of how to obtain this type of operation, beyond the traditional scope of applying socioeconomic experience-based decision making.
