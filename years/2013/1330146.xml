<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on developing a one-piece functionally graded hybrid (fiber/particle) reinforced aluminum alloy matrix automobile brake rotor. Composite brake rotors offer increased weight savings, higher braking performance, and increased component life. Current composite rotors on the market have a cost barrier, which limits mass production on high-production vehicle platforms. This project will assist in the deployment of a one-piece, hybrid reinforced rotor.  These rotors will utilize functional reinforcement gradient (FRG) technology across the braking surface and macro-interfaces. The technology development work requires addressing challenges related to the development of our squeeze casting process, die and preform design, and controlling the microstructure/properties of the aforementioned surfaces and interfaces. The proposed work will extend the current state of the art one-dimensional FRG technology to a higher-order gradient, specific to a vented one-piece rotor for a vehicle application.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes increased mass efficiency in all transportation vehicles. The project findings will address a multi-billion dollar automotive brake market but also can be leveraged across multiple other vehicle platforms.  The technology can be also used in both structural and drivetrain applications further increasing fuel efficiency, reducing fuel emissions, and reducing lifecycle costs of vehicular components. Composite components in ancillary markets such as the military and trucking will also benefit from the customizability of material properties with the FRG technology. Increasing the agility of military vehicles for the Warfighter, reduction of in-theatre operating/maintenance costs, and rolling weight reduction in class 8 vehicles are examples of realized project benefits.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ REL, Inc. of Calumet, Michigan, successfully developed a Selectively Reinforced Aluminum Composite Brake Rotor through this National Science Foundation Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project.  The project focused on developing a cost effective lightweight rotor by tailoring specific material properties in selective areas of the brake rotor.  The development was a one-piece functionally graded, hybrid (fiber/particle) reinforced, aluminum alloy metal matrix composite (MMC) automobile brake rotor.  This brake rotor offers higher braking performance, 50% weight savings and a 3-4x increase in component life.  Utilizing REL's patented Functional Reinforced Gradient (FRG) technology, the aluminum metal matrix composite brake rotor was cast as a one-piece MMC solution.  The project result was the development and deployment of a one-piece, hybrid reinforced rotor, with FRG technology across the braking surface and macro-interfaces.  The technology development work addressed challenges in the development of squeeze casting processes, venting design and optimization, die and preform design, and the tailoring of the microstructure/properties of the aforementioned surfaces and interfaces.  Understanding the structure-property correlation is paramount to deploying this technology throughout a broad spectrum of lightweight braking and other structural applications.  The work extended the previous state of the art one-dimensional FRG technology to a higher order specific to a multi-dimensional, internally vented, one-piece rotor for a vehicle application.  The developed metal matrix composite rotor technology has tailored materials and is designed to address real braking problems.  The FRG in the radial and axial directions reduces the propensity of damaging interfacial thermal stresses that cause brake jutter and warping.  The implementation of salt core techniques facilitated the casting of advanced internal venting designs to improve brake cooling thereby minimizing brake fade.  The FRG MMC rotors weigh 50% of typical cast iron rotors and this technology will now be available to markets that were beyond the boundaries of what was previously possible for MMCs.  Research was performed on compatible friction materials for MMC braking solutions and applying the developed 2-D FRG MMC to brake drum applications.  The mating of the corrosion resistant MMC brake with the proper brake pads will increase braking performance and reduce the noise during the braking event.  REL simultaneously evaluated designs for metal matrix composite brake drums for heavy commercial and military trucks (Classes 5-8).  The advancement of the 2-D FRG technology to a drum application highlights the far reaching implications and positive consequences of the Phase II effort for vehicle segments across the broader market.  The research into these other applications broadened and strengthened the on-going study into the automobile rotor and allows for the synergistic advancement of the technology and its application.  Current composite rotors on the market have a cost barrier which limit mass production on high production vehicle platforms.  Composite rotors are making inroads into high-end markets but technological advancements are needed to make these components more robust and cost effective.  Previously, no selectively reinforced, one-piece, composite brake rotor existed in the market.  The scale-up of this developed technology into mass manufacturing allows for the production of the FRG MMC rotor at a lower lifecycle cost that exceeds anything available today.  REL is working with key OEM suppliers in the braking market and has generated significant interest in this new rotor technology.  The successful development and deployment of this innovative product will result in weight savings and performance enhancement in automobiles, which reduces emissions and increases gas mileage.  The longer life (3-4x) and safer operations of these rotors will also redu...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
