<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Electronics provide powerful capabilities when interfaced with the body. Their miniaturization over the past few decades has paved way for tiny devices capable of biological sensing or stimulation, and hold promise for restoring physiological functions in patients. Although electronics can be made extremely small, existing methods for powering them involve large batteries or energy harvesting modules. The size of these powering components severely constrains the integration of electronics in living systems. The research in this proposal aims to overcome these challenges and enable arrays of optoelectronic probes small enough to be directly injected into the body. Routes to miniaturization are provided by the midfield wireless powering approaches recently established in the PI's lab. These approaches allow the transfer of power to nearly any location in the body at performance levels far exceeding requirements for both complex electronics and physiological stimulation. The research combines a fundamental understanding of power transfer physics with advances in low-power integrated circuits to demonstrate tiny yet fully operational sensors, electrodes, light sources, RF transceivers, and other classes of injectable electronics. Such capabilities represent a considerable advance in applying physics, wireless technology, and integrated circuits towards addressing challenges in biology and medicines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research enables the integration of electronics into the body through tiny devices, providing previously unavailable diagnostic and therapeutic options such as minimally invasive surgery and continuous monitoring. These capabilities will accelerate scientific discovery and improve overall healthcare cost. To maximize research benefits, results will be synthesized in formats understandable to the general public, including clinicians, patients, and policy makers; and widely disseminated through online platforms. The popular appeal of robotic microsystems, will be leveraged to motivate and inspire high school students over the grant period to strengthen the STEM pipeline in the U.S.  This is done through the internship of local K-12 teachers to multiply impact, mentoring of underrepresented students, and an annual summer workshop on robotics with biomedical applications for local high school students. The PI will also leverage her experience in mentoring female students at the high school level to encourage them to pursue higher degrees in engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The emerging field of bioelectronic medicine aims at using electronics to treat diseases.  It provides an alternate way that might possibly be having less side effects.  Towards this goal, significant progress has been made in the development of miniaturized electronics, and high resolution and mechanically flexible neural interfaces for both research and clinical systems.  Their long-term access to neural structures, however, remains constrained by technological challenges in powering the device.  Recent work in the PI?s group establishes methods for transferring power in the electromagnetic midfield region that enables device miniaturization at centimeter-scale operating depths in tissue.  Bridging this gap between the micro-scale capabilities of semiconductor technology and bulky wireless powering interfaces leads to immediate applications.  In this CAREER project, the PI demonstrated three such applications including a pacemaker that is smaller than a grain of rice, a conformal vagus nerve stimulator, and a fully internalized neuromodulation platform.  These devices can act as bioelectronic medicines, capable of precisely modulating local activity, that may be more effective treatments than drugs which act globally throughout the body.  These research results might provide tools to advance diagnosis and treatment of diseases, potentially improving overall healthcare costs in the U.S. and global competitiveness of the U.S. healthcare industry. To maximize the benefits from the research, the research results have been synthesized in formats understandable to the general public and widely disseminated through online platforms. In addition, this CAREER project has supported the internship of a local K-12 teacher and a 1-week workshop for local high school students focusing on the area of wireless electronics.
