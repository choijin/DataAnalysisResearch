<AbstractNarration>The negative effects of individual species of parasites on animals have been intensively studied and can be very strong.  Many animals are infested by multiple species of parasites, some of which have symbiotic microorganisms, but we know relatively little about how the interactions between parasites and their symbionts within a host may reduce or exacerbate the effects of parasitism.  This project will investigate the interactions between two species of nematodes that parasitize insects and a bacterial symbiont of one of these species.  Researchers will infect an insect host with nematodes, bacteria, or both to test the effect of the bacteria on the ability of the nematodes to reproduce.  To investigate the underlying mechanisms, chemicals produced within the host in the different treatments will be compared for ability to induce responses in the bacteria and to inhibit the growth of the parasites. The results will broaden our knowledge of the role of parasites in natural systems and how they affect the health of animals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous studies have shown that bacteria within a host can influence the performance of parasites and even prevent them from successfully reproducing. This project will add to this promising new avenue for preventing or controlling parasitism. Research will also develop the parasite-bacteria system as a tool for teaching K-12 students, and train a Ph.D. student.</AbstractNarration>
