<AbstractNarration>This research concerns three broad projects, each with several subproblems of varying difficulty. The first project aims to prove the equivalence of three regularity properties for separable simple nuclear C*-algebras:  one topological, one homological, and one algebraic. The proof of this fact, which has recently seen rapid progress toward a solution under some restrictions on traces, would represent a deep generalization of Kirchberg's characterization of purely infinite simple nuclear C*-algebras.  The second project concerns the interplay between descriptive set theory and C*-algebras, and specifically the use of the notion of Borel reducibility to answer, for various classes of functional analytic objects, the question: How complicated is isomorphism? The objects that the principal investigator will consider include nuclear, exact, and locally reflexive C*-algebras, and operator spaces and systems.  The third project examines uniform perturbations of C*-algebras and the degree to which they preserve structure and invariants.  Important questions here include whether or not Z-stability and stability are preserved by such perturbations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many fields of scientific inquiry require analyzing infinite-dimensional systems and the ways in which they can be transformed.  Examples include models for quantum physics, signal analysis, and weather patterns.  Infinite-dimensional systems are, of course, complicated.  Understanding them often proceeds by approximating them with simpler finite-dimensional systems.  This project uses this approach in an effort to understand infinite-dimensional systems called C*-algebras.  The finite-dimensional approximating objects are square arrays with complex number entries.  Our aim is to identify conditions under which one can approximate the infinite-dimensional system arbitrarily closely using only a fixed finite number of overlapping arrays.  This last property is known to have powerful consequences for the original system, consequences that reveal a great deal of detail about its structure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We all have some intuitive understanding of 2- and 3-dimensional space.  We also know that there are some basic ways to transform it.  You can stretch it, you can rotate it, and so on.  There is an infinite-dimensional version of such spaces, known as Hilbert space, and one can also stretch, rotate, and otherwise transform this space.  The different ways of transforming this space are known as operators, and in this project we study some specific collections of such operators.    Outcomes regarding Intellectual Merit:  Collections of operators can be assigned objects called invariants, a sort of identification tag.  Not all tags are created equal, and one wants to understand when such a tag is enough to completely identify the original collection.  This led the PI and Wilhelm Winter to a conjecture regarding the possible equivalence of three such identification tags.  Over the course of the project the PI, White and Winter were able to confirm this equivalence under a mild technical hypothesis.  We were also able to determine when certain tags are the same for collections of operators that are in some sense close.  Outcomes regarding Broader Impacts:  The PI supervised the graduation of three Ph.D. candidates during this project, in addition to supervising a postdoctoral fellow.  The PI also co-organized the 2015 Great Plains Operator Theory Symposium.       Last Modified: 08/16/2016       Submitted by: Andrew Toms]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
