<AbstractNarration>SES-1335217&lt;br/&gt;Adam Gamoran&lt;br/&gt;Rachel E. Fish&lt;br/&gt;University of Wisconsin-Madiso&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;U.S. school data has revealed extreme racial and ethnic inequality in exceptionalities, with students of color up to three times more likely to be identified with disabilities as their white peers, and white students up to three times more likely to be identified as gifted as their peers of color. Presumably, parents and teachers intend to support students' academic and social outcomes when they intervene by referring students to be tested for exceptionalities. How do these benevolent micro-level interactions connect to macro-level racial and ethnic inequalities? Existing research explains racial and ethnic disproportionality in special and gifted education by arguing either 1) that schools make biased decisions or 2) that co-factors, such as poverty, explain racial and ethnic differences. This literature is limited by its treatment of exceptionality as a natural category. This research treats exceptionality as a social construction, and the meaning of this construct changes with there are with a student's race and ethnicity. The major research question is how do schools shape this construction of exceptionalities based on race and ethnicity? To address this question, the research uses a mixed-methods approach to 1) examine school-level variation in the effects of students' race and ethnicity on teachers' decisions to refer students to special education through an experimental audit design; and 2) identify the mechanisms creating the  construction of exceptionality through observations and interviews with teachers and parents. The central hypothesis of the study is that under sufficient racial and ethnic diversity, exceptionalities are constructed in ways that reproduce racial and ethnic inequalities. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has clear implications for policy and practice, as scholars, policy-makers, and practitioners have demonstrated the need for further understanding of the causes of disproportionality in special education and gifted services. Federal and state law has prioritized the documentation and amelioration of racial ethnic inequality in education, yet we do not yet understand why the disproportionality exists. Research findings will illuminate the role of school context, with potential implications for school desegregation policy, teacher training, and exceptionality identification processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  In this project, I examined several mechanisms of racial disparities in special and gifted education, a topic of great importance not only to scholars in sociology, education, and policy, but also to policy-makers and practitioners in education. The research has great implications not only for disparities in special and gifted education, but also for how the race/ethnicity of students affects their educational experiences more broadly.     I conducted a factorial vignette experiment in which I randomized the perception of race/ethnicity, linguistic background, gender, and "symptoms" of disability and giftedness. I distributed the survey to teachers that volunteered to participate from schools selected for their variation in racial/ethnic composition. I analyzed this data and wrote two dissertation chapters, one examining the effect of the randomized factors, and another examining the moderation of those effects by the school racial/ethnic composition. One of these chapters was used for a paper that has been accepted for publication at Social Science Research.     I conducted an observational data analysis using state-wide data, aiming to describe the relation between school-level racial/ethnic composition and racial disparities in special education. I cleaned and analyzed the data, and I wrote one chapter of my dissertation using this set of analyses. This chapter has been edited into a manuscript that received a revise &amp; resubmit from a sociology journal. I am currently preparing the resubmission.    For the final component of the project, interviews with teachers and parents on their perceptions of disability, ability, and giftedness, as well as their perceptions of services for these needs, I am continuing to collect data.    This project not only informs the current debate on whether and how students of color are represented in special and gifted education relative to white students, but also contributes to our understanding of how students of different racial/ethnic backgrounds are perceived by teachers and treated in schools.
