<AbstractNarration>Use of natural resources and lands by humans is decreasing biological diversity with unknown but potentially large effects on the future availability of resources to humans.  This project will investigate the feedback loop between biodiversity and the usefulness of natural areas for people.  The study area in the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia is a good example of an area where biodiversity is high but decreasing. It is an area where humans use natural species for food, medicine, and fuel and also use lands for settlement, agriculture, and grazing.  Researchers will interview local residents to learn how they use and value wild species of plants and animals and where they gather and hunt them, and survey the area to map the distribution and abundance of these and other native species.  From these data, together with likely scenarios of local human population growth and climate change, it will be possible to assess the risks of further loss of species and the consequent risks of loss of usefulness of the area for people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has immediate importance for society -- it will improve understanding of how human well-being depends on nature, and enhance our ability to predict the future societal costs of various present uses of natural resources.  The research also has specific importance for the conservation of both nature and culture in an area that is rich in both.  As part of an ongoing collaboration between scientists and educators in the U.S. and Ethiopia, the work will strengthen international scientific cooperation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Our research highlighted the importance of biodiversity in providing ecosystem services that support traditional and non-traditional livelihoods for rural communities in the Bale Mountains of Ethiopia. Plant diversity in particular, was shown to have a wide range of uses in the daily lives of men and women, including healthcare, subsistence and traditional livelihoods. Of more than 100 commonly found plants used in interviews with focus groups, only 4% did not have some identified use for either men or women. Our study found that men and women often identified the provisioning services of plants differently, and valued them for their uses along traditional gender roles in the household. This study not only highlighted the importance that plants play in rural societies, but also the reliance that people have on natural landscapes, particularly the upper montane forests of Ethiopian&rsquo;s southern highlands. The unique montane landscapes of the Bale Mountains also provide for non-traditional livelihoods, such as wildlife-based tourism. Both wildlife viewing in Bale Mountains National Park and trophy hunting in nearby Controlled Hunting Areas generate income for local communities.</p> <p>In addition to identifying the provisioning services of plants by the local communities, our research evaluated how these plant species and uses are distributed across the landscape. We integrated information from our interviews and field plot data with several species distribution models to spatially evaluate &lsquo;hotspots&rsquo; of provisioning services and species richness. A combination of topographic, remotely sensed (satellite), land cover and climate environmental variables were used to model biodiversity. Our results suggest that biodiversity and ecosystem services have parallel spatial patterns across the Bale Mountains. Specifically, areas with higher biodiversity were found in montane forests at higher elevations, and along river corridors.</p> <p>The growing human population, demand for resources and governance systems have been implicated as major threats to the biodiversity and provisioning services in the Bale Mountains. A a temporal analyses of forest cover change using Landsat satellite imagery acquired from 1987 to 2015 showed a significant loss in forest cover occurred after the fall of the Derg government in 1991. However, two Controlled Hunting Areas established in 2001 are showing to be more effective in protecting the montane forest from new settlements, exploitation and clearing than Bale Mountains National Park. Additional remote sensing analyses going back to 1973 showed that human-caused fire has increased in size and frequency in the sub-alpine and Afro-alpine systems of the park. Although burning is illegal, people set fires to increase grasses and forbs for their livestock. We found that 35% of the sub-alpine vegetation zone in the park burned between 1995 and 2015. The montane forest is rarely burned, though clearing for new settlements and agriculture are an increasing problem. Our investigation of the population structure of tree species in the upper montane forests found thirteen widespread montane tree species had a relatively stable population structure. However, six other species had size-frequency distributions that indicate episodic recruitment and/or removal of certain size classes. Specific causes of these patterns are uncertain: they could involve timber harvesting, herbivory, fire, or natural disturbances, but patterns were inconsistent and locality dependent. A species of particular conservation concern that emerged from this analysis was <em>Hagenia abyssinica</em>, which was found in all areas to consist only of larger individuals with no recent recruitment. This tree species is reported to have numerous and important provisioning services for the local people, which were confirmed in our interviews with local men and women in the study area.</p> <p>These analyses indicated conservation priorities vary among protected area management regimes, and that the montane system is vulnerable to a number of threats related to land use and governance. Our research provides a foundation for future research that can address how institutional changes impact processes that support provisioning services in montane ecosystems. Data from our research was made publically available through multiple online repositories. Through research collaborations with universities, Federal organizations, and NGOs in the United States and Ethiopia, a diverse group of scientists, research associates, graduate and undergraduate students and natural resource practitioners benefited from the experience of networking across continents during this project. We accommodated trainings in forest management and geospatial science for these collaborators, hosted research seminars, and published our research in peer-reviewed journals. Robust geospatial modeling methods using remotely sensed data were tested and refined in this research. These methods provided the basis for the development of new geospatial tutorials, which were included in our new open-access website; <em>Geospatial Lessons and Applications in Natural Resources: On-line Resources for Ethiopian Practitioners.</em> This website facilitates the transfer of new technological knowledge and methods in global positioning systems (GPS), geographic information systems (GIS), satellite remote sensing, and geospatial modeling that can be adopted by users across university, business, and government enterprises, as well as the general public.<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/09/2017<br>      Modified by: Paul&nbsp;Evangelista</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1313728/1313728_10277261_1483991641870_InterviewwithWomenFocusGroups--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1313728/1313728_10277261_1483991641870_InterviewwithWomenFocusGroups--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Interviews with women allowed the research team to identify traditional plant uses"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1313728/1313728_10277261_1483991641870_InterviewwithWomenFocusGroups--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Interviews with women allowed the research team to identify traditional plant uses"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Women from the local village discuss the importance of local floral for healthcare, food and traditional livelihoods.
