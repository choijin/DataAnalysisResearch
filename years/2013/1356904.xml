<AbstractNarration>University of Kentucky doctoral student Megan Maurer, under the supervision of Dr. Kristin Monroe, will conduct this study of redevelopment. By understanding and assessing the efforts of community members, civic organizations, and local governments to transform their urban environments, this research will help identify strategies for more inclusive urban redevelopment. The research takes place in Southeast Michigan, an area characterized by crumbling urban infrastructures and bankrupt municipalities. Social scientists find socioeconomically devastated areas of the U.S. such as this particularly useful for studying the social and cultural impediments to redevelopment efforts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The purpose of this project is to investigate the strategies used by individuals from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds to improve their food security. This project also asks how community efforts to transform urban space for productive ends are shaped by different socioeconomic experiences. This research will be conducted in a small city in Southeast Michigan. Using data from semi-structured interviews with local community stewards the researcher will explore four community food production efforts for case study. These case studies will use surveys, maps, in-depth interviews, and participant observations, to identify the connections between ideas about urban land use and their civic engagements. These methods will also be used to determine the role demographics and relationships to others play in shaping these connections. A group of individuals from the four case study neighborhoods that are not part of the organized food production efforts will be included as a comparison group. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project also advances scholarship on the ways working people and socially disadvantaged individuals engage with food security and other challenges in their daily lives. Finally, this study furthers anthropological and other scientific research on the connections between urban space, citizenship, and social change.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The purpose of this research project was to investigate the ways community gardening reorganizes urban space and contributes to food security and redevelopment efforts. According to survey results, gardeners include people of all ages, genders, races, income-levels, occupations, and education levels. When asked in surveys, interviews, and informal conversations about their reasons for gardening most participants said it was primarily to grow fresh vegetables. Participants also gave a variety of secondary reasons that can be summarized as wanting to care for something. Three types of care were identified: care for self and family, such as providing healthy food and taking control over one&rsquo;s diet; care for community, which ranges from producing something others can enjoy to passing on traditional gardening practices; and care for the environment, which includes a desire to produce food that requires fewer resources, demonstrate urban land uses that preserve and nurture local ecosystems, and to reconnect with one&rsquo;s place in these ecosystems.</p> <p>Participants&rsquo; race and class did affect the ways they thought urban space should look and how it should be used. Gardeners in historically white, affluent neighborhoods more frequently thought how their gardens impacted the environment was more important than how they looked. These gardeners found front-yard vegetable gardens, grass-free lawns, and a &ldquo;wild&rdquo; look to be aesthetically acceptable, and in some cases, even desireable. In historically African-American and/or working class neighborhoods, gardeners&rsquo; were more focused on keeping public spaces clean and private properties visibly maintained. They preferred mown grass lawns and traditional landscaping, and stressed the importance of keeping vegetable gardens looking &ldquo;neat.&rdquo;</p> <p>All participants recognized that there was a large and active population of gardeners in their city and considered themselves to be a part of this group. They were also all aware of at least some of the collective projects organized by or associated with gardeners in the city, such as farmers&rsquo; markets, growers&rsquo; cooperatives, collective bee-keeping, and meet-up groups. However, the majority of gardeners did not actively participate in any of these activities. Those that did were motivated by a desire to share their interests with other people. While they enjoyed working with others to better their lives and communities, these gardeners did not become involved in other civic activities. Thus while community gardening is a way for people to work together and improve their communities, it does not lead them to participate in other types of civic improvement efforts.</p> <p>These findings contribute to anthropological knowledge in four ways. First, anthropologists are interested in what people care for and the ways they find to show that care.
