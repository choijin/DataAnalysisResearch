<AbstractNarration>Galactic winds transfer plasma, magnetic fields, and energetic particles from galaxies into their surrounding halos and to the intergalactic medium, and influence the star formation rate in galaxies. Hot gas, cool gas, cosmic rays, and magnetic fields are observed components that are circulated. In some galaxies with relatively high star-formation rates, hot gas seems to be pushing the cool gas outward over scales many times the size of the host galaxy. However, it is not clear how much matter in the halo will escape the galaxy's gravity, and how much matter will fall back to impact the galaxy. Analytic models for the hot-gas component of outflows usually consider only a free-streaming, constant velocity outflow, or perhaps radiation pressure, but gas-driving effects from large-scale thermal-pressure, cosmic-ray pressure and magnetic fields, or galactic rotation are not always included. This project aims to better understand how the presence of cool gas influences the thermal and ram-pressure driven winds from galaxies. This work builds a semi-analytic model for the outflow dynamics of components that includes cool gas, hot gas, cosmic rays, and magnetic fields. The model predictions are then compared to observations of cool gas kinematics in the halos of galaxies. Overall, this will improve our understanding of wind dynamics, and provide an estimate for the fraction of gas that escapes a variety of galaxies. &lt;br/&gt;The results have applications in the interpretation of observations and theoretical simulations in other astrophysical fields where knowledge about mass- and energy loss rates of galactic winds is important to understand other galactic properties such as the energy balance within galaxies and in the intergalactic medium. This project offers two different theoretical studies for student participation, one concentrating on predicting cool-cloud kinematics, and one predicting the observable absorption patterns stemming from variety of wind models.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Looking at the night sky, you may wonder how or why the Milky Way has the number of stars that it has.  Why not many more, or many fewer?  This is a question that astronomers are grappling with as well; it seems that galaxies are somewhat well organized and regulated: that they sometimes rapidly form stars, but other times, form stars at a quite sedate pace.  Why?  This project sought to help answer that by developing some of the most comprehensive models of galactic-scale winds: huge, extremely hot outflows of gas that can emerge from a large fraction of a galaxy, all at once.   In addition, the project aimed to test those wind models by comparing predictions from the models to observations of cool "clouds" within those winds.  This is important to astronomers, since it's much more straightforward to observe those cool clouds, and track them: there has been a hope that those clouds can therefore be used as tracers, which can help us understand the winds, and by extension, help us understand how galaxies form, grow, and age.  Understanding these winds is becoming a central component of understanding the galaxies throughout our Universe.  Working with two advanced undergraduate students, the study team found that those cool clouds are, very often, quickly destroyed by the winds that are trying to push them out of their host galaxy.  This means that such clouds cannot be so easily used as tracers, and as astronomers, we need to realize that they may be rather transient phenomena; perhaps those "clouds" are actually large bits of gas that the wind runs into, and envelopes, as the wind moves out into intergalactic space.  Or, perhaps the winds cool as they expand out, and create the clouds?  Either way, those clouds can no longer be assumed to be simple tracers that we earlier thought them to be.  This is important for more than just tracing winds: if those clouds of gas are not coming from the galaxy itself, it means that our estimates of how much mass the wind is pushing out of the galaxy are too large, and our understanding of the evolution of galaxies could be called into question.  The above result was uncovered with very simple wind models, and is believed to be quite general.  This study also included the study of advanced wind models: adding in the effects of relativistic particles in the galaxy, the role of the rotation of the galaxy, magnetic fields, and other effects, to ensure that all of the possible ways that gas may be driven from a galaxy were included.  This was important, since our key goal is to understand how much mass galaxies lose, and if we don't understand the processes which drive that gas, we will fail to calculate that mass loss correctly.  Moving back to this project, these more detailed wind models were then applied to small galaxies, with the curious finding that the models did not successfully drive gas from the galaxies, as the galaxies were not large enough to hold on to their gas strongly enough, for these models to apply.  Work is still ongoing on this, but it implies that the physics of how winds are launched from galaxies changes drastically, as galaxies grow, and as they form stars more or less quickly.  The PI will continue to investigate this "boundary" in how wind physics may change, and will continue to work to apply these models to the Milky Way's wind (where they were first developed), as a kind of "Rosetta Stone", to test these limits further.
