<AbstractNarration>This study investigates youth participation in the Maker Movement ? a community of engineers, hobbyists, artists, and tinkerers who design, build, and repurpose material objects ? as a pathway to adaptive expertise in engineering and design. The study looks across formal (schools) and informal (community organizations) learning environments to examine how youth learn through ?making? in these contexts. Drawing from these cross-setting contrasts, learning environments centered on ?making? will be designed, studied through mixed methods research, and progressively refined in an iterative fashion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research addresses important gaps in the literature by investigating the development of adaptive expertise over an extended time period and the development of engineering identity through ?making? and participation in the Maker Movement. This study will provide research-based recommendations for practice, cognitive tools to support learning, and novel assessments of learning. Findings will be widely disseminated to both researchers and practitioners through conference papers, journal articles, and through partnerships with leading organizations within the Maker Movement. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

We employed design research methodologies &ndash; constantly refining the design of learning environments as well as the analytic and theoretical basis for our research.   Results from research on making and learning include the following:  a)       There are many forms of participation available to youth within maker communities &ndash; some youth move through a trajectory from exploration, to bi-directional exchange, to true collaboration with peers.  b)      Analysis of small group work in a high school maker space showed that "moments of uncertainty" acted as pivot points that learners used to position themselves and others, to control problem-solving discourse, and ultimately to direct projects toward features and resources that served their interests. While these moments could benefit some students by shifting work toward their interests and skills, they could also marginalize other students, moving them to the periphery of project work and learning. This work has helped us understand how inequities arise and how to better design for equity.  c)       Analysis of several years of design-based research in a high school maker space showed that students and teachers negotiate conflicting "frames" for making activity, and the resulting, contested definitions of "what counts as making" have profound influence on who participates and how, with important equity implications.  d)      A study of a girls-only maker program found that personally meaningful projects allow girls to make connections between their gender, becoming a young adult, and STEM-based identities.
