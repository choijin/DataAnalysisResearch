<AbstractNarration>Natural gas is becoming increasingly important as a transitional fuel, less carbon-intensive and polluting than coal, to meet growing energy demands worldwide.  Approximately 20% of natural gas resources are generated by microbes that degrade organic matter in geologic formations, such as coal seams, and produce methane.  Recent laboratory and field studies have shown that these microorganisms can be stimulated to generate new gas resources.  However, little is known about how microbes naturally convert organic matter into methane, the rates new methane can be generated, and the rate limiting steps.  In addition, large quantities of groundwater are extracted from coal seams to produce natural gas, which may alter the in situ environmental conditions with unknown consequences for the microbial communities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study aims to determine the structure and function of microbial communities in coal seams under different hydrologic and geochemical conditions, and how they may change with groundwater pumping and dewatering of coal beds.  Specifically, we will investigate the spatial, depth and temporal variability of microbial communities in coals; how this distribution is controlled by aqueous environmental conditions and recharge rates that may be reflected in water and gas isotopic signatures; how microbial communities may respond to perturbations, such as groundwater extraction; and how observations of in situ microbial activity can be incorporated into a predictive model of coal bioconversion to methane.  The study is focused in the Powder River Basin in Wyoming/Montana, one of the first large basins to undergo intensive development of microbial coalbed methane (CBM), and an important model for future CBM development in other basins.  Results from this study will be made available to the public via the NSF-funded CUAHSI Hydroserver and Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology Ground Water Information Center.  New data will be incorporated into the web-based Biofilms: the Hypertextbook.  And, a video on the research will be on display at the University of Arizona Flandrau Science Center and Biosphere2.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The acquisition of subsurface microbial samples associated with coal was achieved and tested using a new diffusive microbial sampling device.  At one field site, we have characterized four different coal seams and correlated the bacterial and archaeal populations to the ability to make natural gas or not within the constraints of associated geochemical parameters (e.g., sulfate).  Two of the coal seams have more gas production than the other two, and the interphase boundary of sandstone has also been sampled.  We continue to compare coal-associated communities to the groundwater and core material to better understand the population dynamics between microorganisms that live in the coal and microorganisms that live in the groundwater and how those populations contribute to methane production.  In addition, the improved sampling allows better cultivation of the microorganisms in the laboratory.  The microorganisms (bacteria and archaea) can be grown from the field samples in order to estimate rates of natural gas production from coal.  Moreover, different additives that promote (i.e., low level nutrients) or deter (i.e., sulfate) can be tested for impacts on coal-dependent natural gas production.  For the enrichments from a natural gas-producing coal seam (low sulfate) compared to a high-sulfate/low natural-gas coal seam, the low-sulfate enrichment produced significant methane while the high-sulfate enrichment produced small amounts of natural gas.  When the enrichments were switched:  respective inoculums incubated with the other coal and/or water, unexpectedly, the coal from the high-sulfate zone had more of an impact than the high-sulfate water on the ability of different inocula to produce natural gas. Taken together, consortia and conditions from a low-sulfate/high-natural gas well could tolerate sulfate perturbation as determined by the ability to produce natural gas.  At other wells, we investigated the impacts of sulfate levels on microbial diversity and methanogenic activity for subsurface coal seams.  Coal seams can contain a natural gradient of high sulfate water that can impact coal-dependent natural gas. The natural sulfate gradient creates a model environment to study community interactions and cycling of fossil carbon and natural gas generation in transition zones.  Wells with intermediate to high sulfate levels had bacterial sequences indicative of populations that likely contribute to overall sulfate reduction. Under low sulfate conditions, bacterial sequences were predominated by populations indicative of coal degradation. Archaeal sequences were predominated by novel unclassified members in the intermediate to high sulfate wells and hydrogenotrophic and acetoclastic methanogens in low sulfate wells. Sequences indicative of Methanomoassilicoccales, a methylotrophic methanogen, were present throughout all tested well.  Analysis of carbon isotopes of produced gases agreed with presumptive metabolic pathway predictions, and results suggest high natural gas levels may be a result of hydrogenotrophic methanogens. "Clumped" isotopologues of methane confirm that gas is microbial in origin and was generated at 35 to 52oC. Archaeal diversity showed a decline as sulfate levels increased with drastic decreases in OTUs of known methanogens that correlate to lower natural gas levels. The results have implication for the intrusion of high sulfate waters into coal seams that can be de-watered during gas production.  The concentration of nutrients and trace metals in coal waters were investigated across the sulfate gradient to understand the source and transport of essential elements for microbial activity in the subsurface. Nutrients and trace metals were higher in recharge waters at basin margins, suggesting they may be transported into microbial communities at depth, however they are quickly scavenged. Coal leachate experiments showed that nitrogen, phosphorous, and trace metals were readily available (i.e., water soluble) and a potential in-situ source for microbial communities.  Microbial gas production may be enhanced by introduction of limiting nutrients to stimulate microbial communities to generate "new" methane. We synthesized the processes and conditions essential for microbial coalbed methane (CBM) generation, the progress of efforts to stimulate microbial CBM generation, and critical knowledge gaps.  We also tested deuterated water in the laboratory as a tracer to quantify the amount of "new" methane generated, the methanogenic pathways, and the effectiveness of stimulation approaches. We hypothesized, and demonstrated in our proof of concept experiments, that as methanogenesis progresses, methanogens will incorporate the heavy water into new methane produced, as methanogens naturally uptake hydrogen during methanogenesis.  The amount of hydrogen incorporated into methane from water is dependent on the methanogenic pathway, and can be used to distinguish the "new" methane from any "old" background methane existing prior to stimulation.  Coalbed methane production requires extraction of significant volumes of water, thus it?s important to determine the relative age and quality of the groundwater. Using noble gases and strontium isotopes coupled to numerical hydrologic modeling, we determined the ?age? of water in the Powder River Basin. Surprisingly, we discovered that groundwater travels mostly through non-coal aquifers (e.g., siliclastic aquifers) before entering the coal seams local to the wells.
