<AbstractNarration>The quantum world is very different from the classical, everyday, world. The mere act of measuring affects a quantum object so that applying feedback to control such object is rather delicate. The researchers will investigate quantum feedback on an experimental&lt;br/&gt;apparatus, Cavity QED, which has been center to the development of quantum information science. The object of study is the spontaneously generated coherence observed in a cavity QED system with two polarization modes. We will look into ways to shield and protect the coherence from disturbances while applying feedback, while we will also develop post-selection protocols that help understand the disturbances affecting the system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One full time graduate student will be trained in the area of Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics with special focus on quantum optics. The student will have ample exposure to leaders in the field that visit the Joint Quantum Institute of the University of Maryland. There will be undergraduates participating in the research effort during the academic year, and in the summer. In conjunction with the Sociedad Mexicana de FÃ­sica, two Mexican undergraduates will spend ten weeks in the laboratory. The results of the group will be available on the web page of the JQI as well as in the one of the group, with explanations for the general public. The students will give lab tours to prospective undergraduate students as well as to the undergraduates that take courses with the PI.</AbstractNarration>

Control systems are ubiquitous, and as essential as they are easy to overlook. For instance, turning the dial on a thermostat feels as trivial as moving a piece on a board game, but this control system is actually quite complex. The goal is an equilibrium state: once the temperature settles, the heat is pumping out as fast as it leaks in.   Take, for example, Cavity Quantum ElectroDynamics (CQED) research, which at its heart is a high-finesse optical cavity.
