<AbstractNarration>Recent aging and forecasting literature gives plausibility to the idea that changes in goal orientation, as well as errors in affective forecasting, may differ across the lifespan. Yet despite these important suggestions from the literature, little empirical research has directly compared experienced affect and affective forecasting in older and younger adults, and none has examined underlying mechanisms that may account for age differences in this domain. This project clarifies the relationship between goal orientation, emotional regulation, and affective forecasting, and explore whether this relationship is consistent with the positivity effect found in elders' retention and memory for emotional information. Specifically, three studies assess mediation of age-related affective forecasting ability by emotional regulation and goal orientation in adults between 18-90 years of age. The first two studies identify the processes in which forecasts are constructed, and test the hypothesis that if older adults tend to be more prevention-oriented than young or middle-aged adults, their forecasts may be based on the motivation to avoid incurring losses versus an orientation towards achieving gains. The third study builds upon the findings from the first two studies by examining the role of age-differences in affective criteria in the domain of temporal discounting, and will employ a query order intervention, with the purpose of reducing the influence of forecasting biases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Affective variables play a major role in decision processes, and age differences in emotional aspects of decision making have important implications for choice outcomes. By understanding what components of affect dynamics lead adults across the lifespan to make better decisions, results will provide directions for the development of interventions that can improve the welfare of older adults.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Decisions involving long time horizons often involve making predictions about future outcomes and preferences, which in turn may or may not coincide with experienced outcomes. However, relatively little research has explored how individual and situational differences might affect the match or mismatch between the two.  Affective forecasting examines the accuracy of peopleÃ†s expectations regarding their future emotional states, and may differ across the lifespan.  Indeed, affective forecasting ability may have particular practical relevance in advanced age. In the domain of financial decision-making, in particular, older adults must often make predictions about their future preferences and affective reactions to potential outcomes, including investment of savings and retirement income, health care planning, insurance purchases and anticipating long-term care needs. However, there has been relatively little empirical research on affective forecasting ability in older adults, and the few studies that have examined this topic lack consensus. This project investigates lifespan differences in affective forecasting and experienced affect, and examines whether age-differences in affective forecasting influence the tendency to discount the future. By understanding what components of affect dynamics lead adults across the lifespan to make better decisions, this work provides directions for the development of interventions that can aid decisions and improve the welfare of older adults. Results from three studies reveal that affective forecasting errors decreased with age, with seniors being less likely to mistakenly believe that they would experience less intense affect when a reward happened in the future than in the present. These findings also provide support for the hypothesized influence of increased patience on improved affective forecasting ability among older adults. Finally, results demonstrated that older adults were less likely to make the typical affective forecasting errors of overestimating positive affect. Results from this project make theoretical contributions on several fronts. First, given age-related cognitive losses and declines in physical health, it is critical to investigate whether other forms of knowledge, such as affect, may help to compensate for and mitigate declines in decision-making. Taken together, our findings add to the literature on age-related differences in decision-making by suggesting that affective forecasting is a skill that does not decrease across the life span, and thus may tap cognitive and affective abilities that increase with the experience that comes with age. Despite a body of research that suggests that older adults are impaired on simple judgment tasks, results from the present experiments are consistent with literature demonstrating that emotion-related abilities are relatively spared or even enhanced in advancing age. Our findings are also consistent with an emerging body of research which suggests that experience and accumulated knowledge may help compensate for declining cognitive function in decision-making among older adults and that emotional knowledge, in particular, may help to compensate for the declines in decision-making that come with advanced age. Finally, these results offer an interesting extension to the temporal discounting literature, as we find that increased patience in older adults may underlie age-related improvements in affective forecasting.         0 0 1 518 2958 Columbia University 24 6 3470 14.0        Normal 0     false false false  EN-US JA X-NONE                                                                                                                                                                                  Last Modified: 09/01/2015       Submitted by: Elke U Weber]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
