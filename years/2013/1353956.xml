<AbstractNarration>Understanding how the brain efficiently extracts relevant information from a complex visual scene, and uses these cues to guide behavior represents a fundamental problem in neuroscience.  Despite considerable effort, even compact circuits that implement the elementary visual computations that are the building blocks of brain function remain poorly understood.  This project will combine genetic analysis, behavioral studies and microscopy to dissect such circuits. These studies will shed light on the computational mechanisms of the brain.  More broadly, this study will engage underrepresented high school students in neuroscience research by developing a new educational program that combines the physics of light with animal behavior in the local environment, developing quantitative analysis skills.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Linear polarization represents a fundamental quality of light that arises naturally from atmospheric scattering, and surface reflections. Many animals orient their movements using these signals, and studies in a variety of insects have developed computational models for how neural circuits might guide behavioral responses to polarized light, models that share key elements with models of color perception.  Thus, understanding these circuits provides insight into many important visual processing tasks. This project will investigate the neural circuits that compute responses to polarized light.   The first objective of this project is to identify neurons that respond to polarized light signals presented to the ventral retina of the fruit fly Drosophila, using a combination of advanced genetic tools for manipulating neural activity and behavioral studies.  The second objective will use in vivo two photon microscopy to measure changes in neural activity induced by polarized light in order to describe the response properties of individual neuron types.  The third objective will map the functional connections between neurons in these circuits by simultaneously increasing and decreasing the activities of specific circuit components, while imaging the responses of downstream neuronal targets.  This work will determine how the brain processes information about polarized light.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our eyes and brains collect and analyze a remarkably rich set of visual cues that play central roles in shaping our thoughts and actions. However, understanding how the brain processes visual information remains an elusive goal to the field of neuroscience.  Part of the challenge lies in the significant complexity of the human brain, where billions of neurons make trillions of connections, many of which are associated with processing visual information.  Remarkably, at least some of the computational strategies that human brains use have been shown to be identical to those found in some invertebrate brains, where the number of neurons and their connections is greatly reduced.      This project has used a powerful genetic model, the fruit fly Drosophila, to understand visual processing algorithms.  To do this, we used an imaging technique, two photon microscopy, that is widely used to measure changes in neural activity in single cells, at high speed, as the brain computes, and developed new methods to extract and analyze these signals.  In one thread of this work, we developed a computational method to identify regions of the brain that respond in the same way to visual input, allowing us to identify signals from single cells.  In another thread, we measured neural signals across the entire brain, and examined how these signals are organized between brain regions.  Both of these studies revealed new parallels between the circuit mechanisms that allow fly and human brains to compute, and set the stage for future work that take advantage of the unique strengths of the small, comparatively simple fly model to understand how visual information is processed in all brains, including our own.     In addition to the publication of these new techniques and data in publically available scientific journals, these studies also led to a new international educational effort to encourage undergraduates from diverse backgrounds to engage in STEM disciplines by creating a new course in quantitative approaches to neuroscience.  A number of trainees who participated in this class, and in this research program, have gone on to independent careers in STEM fields, both in academia and in industry.
