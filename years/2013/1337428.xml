<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program that is co-funded by the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) Program, Professor Christopher Bradley from Mount St Mary's University and colleagues Daesung Chong (Ball State University), Tomothy Brunker (Towson University), Peter Craig (McDaniel College) and Timothy Funk (Gettysburg College) will acquire a single crystal X-ray diffractometer for use by a consortium of primarily undergraduate institutions that include Mount St Mary's University, Ball State University, Towson University, McDaniel College, Gettysburg College and Loyola University Maryland. The award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) arene effects on cobalt catalysts for activated alkane dehydrogenation; (b) redox-induced linkage isomerism in chiral ruthenium sulfoxide complexes; (c) investigation of the stabilization of boron-containing cations by azametallocenes; (d) studies of model enzyme complexes; (e) coordination chemistry studies; (f) development of transition metal catalysts for organic transformations; (g) synthesis, reactivity, and crystallographic characterization of transition metal carbonyl complexes containing oxygen-donating ligands; and (h) catalysts for proton reduction.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training not only at Mount St Mary's University but also at the neighboring institutions included in the consortium.</AbstractNarration>
