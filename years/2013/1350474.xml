<AbstractNarration>CAREER: Phylogenetic tools for studying phenotypic diversification in the tree of life&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The history of life unfolds through a single, enormous, tree of life. The twigs are individual species (both living and extinct), while the limbs and branches represent the long-passed ancestors of species that exist today. Considerable effort has been dedicated to elucidating the coarse and fine structure of this tree in many major plant, animal, fungi, and microbial groups over the past fifty years. Phylogenetic comparative methods use these genealogical trees, combined with trait data for species, to make statistically based inferences about the nature of evolution over the geological time. Phylogenetic comparative biology is a computer-intensive field, and this award will support research to develop a new computational toolkit to address several of the biggest challenges within this field. Specifically, this award supports the development of new computer-based approaches for visualizing trait evolution on trees; new methods to integrate tree estimation and comparative inference; and new approaches to link micro-scale processes and macro-scale (phylogenetic) patterns on a tree. All of these tools will serve the ultimate goal of better understanding the process and history of life's evolution on Earth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phylogenetic comparative analyses have become central in evolutionary biology over the past thirty years. This research will expand the methodological toolkit of comparative biology in critical areas, including addressing some of the new challenges of big data, and better linking micro- and macroevolution. This award will also support the training of postdoctoral fellows and graduate students, and the development of two different educational programs. The first is an annual macroevolutionary methods workshop targeting students from Latin America. The second is a workshop for young phylogeny-method developers. Both programs will target students from groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Phylogenies, the evolutionary trees representing the ancestor-descendant relationships among species, have become pervasive throughout the biological sciences and beyond. The field of phylogenetic biology consists of two main endeavors. The first involves the <em>estimation of phylogenies</em> from data, which normally uses DNA sequences from one or many genes and sophisticated statistical methods developed specifically for this purpose. The second principal endeavor of phylogenetic biology consists of making evolutionary inferences from the phylogeny after it has already been estimated. This might involve, for instance, using the information contained within the phylogeny to estimate the rates of speciation (whereby ancestral species subdivide into two or more descendants) and extinction (in which species are lost). Alternatively, it could involve combining the phylogeny with data for phenotypic traits (the observable characteristics of organisms) to make an inference about how evolution proceeds. For example, we might combine environmental and life history data for reptiles with a phylogeny of their relationships to ask whether cold climates predispose a lineage to evolve live-birth as opposed to egg-laying. Alternatively, we could examine the set of species in a group that occur at tropical and temperate latitudes, and then use their evolutionary history, as represented by a phylogeny, to ask whether any observed difference in species diversity between regions is due to a difference in speciation rate, extinction rate, both, or neither (if, for instance, tropical lineages have more species simply by being older). The methodologies that we use to answer this type of question with evolutionary trees are called <em>phylogenetic comparative methods</em>, and the development and implementation of phylogenetic comparative methods in scientific software was the major purpose of this award.</p> <p>Phylogenetic comparative biology is a computer-intensive discipline. Over about the past dozen years, the overwhelming majority of phylogenetic comparative biologists have progressively adopted a common computing framework: the R statistical environment. R, for the uninitiated, is simultaneously a software, a computing environment, and a programming language that can be used to develop new functionality for R. Although R itself provides numerous tools in its base function libraries, discipline-specific scientific computing capabilities in R derive entirely from what are called <em>contributed R packages</em>. A contributed package is merely a library of related functions, normally distributed from a set of free, public repositories. R contributed packages are developed by programmers, computational scientists, and independent developers separate from the core R team. In phylogenetic biology a rich ecosystem of packages has been developed, and my package <em>phytools</em> is (with a small number of other similarly important libraries) at the center of this ecosystem. The major objectives of this award were to: (i) extend the <em>phytools</em> package as well as the toolkit for all types of phylogenetic analysis in R; (ii) add a key set of new functionality to R phylogenetic analysis; (iii) disseminate training to communities of interest via an accessible traveling workshop; and (iv) build capacity for the next generation of phylogenetic software development in R.</p> <p>This award permitted <em>phytools</em> to be built into one of the foremost R packages for phylogenetics. <em>phytools</em> has been used and cited in over 4,000 distinct studies to date, which ranks it second among all R phylogenetic packages (behind only the core phylogenetics package <em>ape</em>). <em>phytools</em> now consists of thousands of lines of code, hundreds of functions, and a user-manual that is over 200 pages long. With the support of this award, <em>phytools</em> has been made to offer a diverse array of functionality to the user: from the estimation of ancestral states, to sophisticated model-fitting, to graphing phylogenies and comparative data. In addition to <em>phytools</em>, this award also supported the continued development of both the aforementioned <em>ape</em> and the phylogenetic inference package <em>phangorn</em>, thus generally enriching the toolkit of phylogenetic methods available in R. In addition to these primary aims, this award also supported the application of phylogeny methods to multiple empirical studies, along with the development of a separate R package (<em>learnPopGen</em>) and set of web applications for teaching population genetics and evolutionary theory in the classroom.</p> <p>Along with these substantial scientific accomplishments, the project has resulted in a number of important broader impacts relevant to science and society at large. The award supported the development of critical scientific software, which is distributed free of charge and used by scientists worldwide. The project has resulted in significant student mentorship and training: three different graduate students were trained with the support of this award, including women and minorities underrepresented in the sciences. The award was used to create and execute a traveling R phylogenetics workshop, which has in turn led to the training of over 140 students originating from 13 different countries. Finally, the award sponsored an immersive R method developers bootcamp and in so doing has helped to train the next generation of computational scientists in evolutionary research.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/27/2020<br>      Modified by: Liam&nbsp;J&nbsp;Revell</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1350474/1350474_10296363_1606514294486_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1350474/1350474_10296363_1606514294486_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Neighborhood connectivity of the phytools package."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1350474/1350474_10296363_1606514294486_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Neighborhood connectivity of the phytools package."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Neighborhood connectivity of the phytools package, showing the ecosystem of R phylogenetics packages on CRAN.
