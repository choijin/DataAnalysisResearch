<AbstractNarration>Research and advances in Big Data is a high priority for the society.  A week-long workshop on the applications of succinct data representations to Big Data analysis  will bring together about forty mathematicians and computer scientists to exchange ideas about, and share current work on, succinct representations of data enabling sophisticated analysis, as in compressed sensing and streaming, sparsification, distributed sensing and data fusion, machine learning, optimization and complex query processing.Â  The workshop will be in cooperation with the Simons Institute on the Theory of Computing at UC Berkeley, and will take place on September 16-20 2013, during the Institute's semester-long program on algorithmic foundations of big data analysis, thus also engaging in its work the (more than thirty) participants of that program.  The workshop will be open to all potential participants and the findings and video tapes of presentations will be distributed to the public for comments and engagements.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Workshop on "Succinct Data Representations and Applications" Outcomes   The workshop was the second in a series of five week-long  workshops held under the auspices of the semester-long program on  "Theoretical Foundations of Big Data Analysis" at the Simons Institute.  It was the only one of the four supported by NSF.  It brought together a distinguished group of researchers from Computer Science, Statistics, Optimization, Databases, and Applied Mathematics to exchange ideas, views, and results on techniques for representing Big Data succintly and how they facilitate its analysis.  The single most important outcome of the workshop was the interaction between researchers from theoretical computer science, statistics, applied mathematics and engineering. Most conventional conferences do not offer venues that would attract researchers from such diverse, yet complementary, expertise to address problems in Big Data analysis. Throughout the duration of the workshop, groups of researchers would constantly get together in the Simons Institute building to exchange ideas, work on open problems, or simply discuss the talk they had just attended.  We expect that the meeting will help fertilize joint work at the interface of the above disciplines; this will be further facilitated by the presence of a diverse body of researchers at various career stages (from graduate students and postdoctoral researchers, to mid-career and senior scientists) at the Simons Institute Big Data program this semester.
