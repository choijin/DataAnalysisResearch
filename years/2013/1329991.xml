<AbstractNarration>Cyber-physical systems are found in nearly every area of daily life:  transportation, energy, medical systems, and food production.  Life and safety frequently depend upon their correct operation.  This project develops a novel systematic framework and methods for understanding, designing, and controlling complex coupled cyber and physical systems based on large-scale computation. This is achieved by explicitly developing the connection between the abstraction, modeling and verification frameworks of physics-based models and those of discrete-transition systems.  The approach is fundamentally new, based on the unification of two recent developments:  (1) new probabilistic tools for simulating and analyzing high-fidelity physics-based models; and (2) statistical model checking methods.  In addition to analytical research, the project produces methods and computational tools that can be used on a wide range of cyber-physical systems, particularly those that are safety and performance critical.&lt;br/&gt;There have been dramatic recent advances in probabilistic computational techniques for purely physics-based models, treating them computationally as Markov chains, and enabling efficient computation even for high-dimensional systems. Simultaneously with these purely physics-based model approaches, state-of-the-art methods for the verification of purely discrete-state systems have been developed based on stochastic computational tools also using Markov chains as the basis.  This project connects these two independent branches to yield a radically new approach for complex, high-dimensional cyber-physical systems, based on the unifying concept of Markov models as an interface between the cyber and physical domains.  &lt;br/&gt;An integral part of the project is a unified educational program aimed at addressing key bottlenecks in the recruitment and development of female and minority students into engineering and computer science. The educational program is developed around a new robotic vehicle with complex fluid-structure dynamics, that is used in:  (i) a week-long residential summer camp for female high-school students on "Mechanics &amp; Dynamics";  (ii)undergraduate research experiences for female and minority students to facilitate the transition to graduate education; and (iii) an experimental graduate course on verification of embedded systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    INTELLECTUAL MERIT  This project addressed the major engineering challenge of verifying or guaranteeing safe performance of cyber-physical systems with logical performance specifications.  An example of such a system is the combined software and physical vehicle that together constitute a self-driving car, with a safety criterion specifying performance.  Using a combination of statistical methods, dynamical systems theory and formal verification techniques, the project developed a sophisticated analytical and computational approach and produced implementable algorithms which can be used to systematically check the aforementioned safety requirements.  In particular these methods provide guarantees in terms of statistically defined confidence.  Software and practical algorithms were developed which implemented the theory resuls of the project, and these were explicitly applied to industrial benchmark problems to illustrate the use of the techniques and demostrate their efficacy.  The project also developed more general simulation algorithms for large-scale numerical modeling of stochastic systems.       BROADER IMPACTS  The project trained several graduate students for research and development oriented activity in this important technological space.  Also, during the project there were opportunities for engineering undergraduate students to get involved with research through laboratory experiences in the robotics lab of the investigators.  The project activiity also had impact on high school students through summer camps.  More specifically,  thoughout the project  two high-school camps (all-female "GAMES camp" and mixed-gender "Exploring Camp") were run, and had attendence of approximately 50 students (most recently, 31 girls and 17 boys).  The camps were residential, one week in duration, and consist of activelearning activities and design projects. Example activities were in basic control theory for 3D printing (open-loop versus closed-loop concepts, implementation with Arduinos as controllers) and mechanical design, focusing on rotary-tolinear motion conversion and implementation in hardware for 3D printer stage actuation. Of the students attending these camps, 90% indicated after the camp that they intented on pursuing a STEM education and career.
