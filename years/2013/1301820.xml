<AbstractNarration>The tree of life links all biodiversity through a shared evolutionary history. This project will produce the first online, comprehensive first-draft tree of all 1.8 million named species, accessible to both the public and scientific communities. Assembly of the tree will incorporate previously published results, with strong collaborations between computational and empirical biologists to develop, test and improve methods of data synthesis. This initial tree of life will not be static; instead, we will develop tools for scientists to update and revise the tree as new data come in. Early release of the tree and tools will motivate data sharing and facilitate ongoing synthesis of knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biological research of all kinds, including studies of ecological health, environmental change, and human disease, increasingly depends on knowing how species are related to each other. Yet there is no single resource that unites knowledge of the tree of life.  Instead, only small parts of the tree are individually available, generally as printed figures in journal articles. This project will provide the global community of scientists who study the tree of life with a means to share and combine their results, and will enable large-scale studies of Earth's biodiversity. It will also create a resource where students, educators and citizens can go to explore and learn about life's evolutionary history.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The OpenTree project developed software tools that allow researchers to integrate individual estimates of branches and twigs of the tree of life into a single estimate of the entire tree of life.  We accomplish this by mapping phylogenetic estimates on established taxonomy across the diversity of life.  We developed novel algorithms to accomplish this mapping and implemented them in open source software that allows anyone to add and modify both tools for phylogenetic synthesis and phylogeny exploration as well as educational tools for engaging students and educators in core concepts of evolution, natural selection, taxonomy, classification, and biodiversity.  Our project fundamentally changed the way the systematics community thinks about phylogenies.  Before our project, phylogenies were treated as static images in a pdf file in the context of a publication.  Now, we encourage the research community to treat our phylogenetic estimates as data.  We further encourage the community to make these data available to the broader research community through the opentreeoflife.org portal and thereby integrate their phylogenetic estimates into a synthetic and comprehensive tree of life.  Our project resulted in the first synthetic tree of life that contained every known species on Earth!  We integrated over 1000 phylogenetic studies into our synthesis phylogeny and produced the most comprehensive taxonomy currently available.  Our work is all publically open and available.  Our software is freely distributed through GitHub http://opentreeoflife.github.io/ and we encourage collaboration and extension through our open API.  We continue to engage the phylogenetic community to upload and update their estimates into a synthetic tree of life and to engage other communities (e.g., ecology, physiology, molecular biology, genomics, and education) to take advantage of this resource for comparative studies.
