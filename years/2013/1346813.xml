<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to understand the causes of precipitation variability in the US Southern Plains (roughly equivalent to Nebraska, Missouri, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Texas, and Louisiana).  This area is among the most drought-prone in the US, and droughts in the region have substantial economic impacts.  This project examines the hypothesis that Spring subsurface soil temperature anomalies in the Western US in produce rainfall changes in the Southern Plains in the subsequent summer. The hypothesized relationship is such that warm subsurface soil temperature in the West, through its manifestation in warm land surface temperature, generates a cyclonic circulation in the overlying atmosphere, which propagates eastward to produce enhanced June rainfall to the east and  south of the soil temperature anomaly, with the opposite result (i.e. drought) for cold subsurface soil temperature. A further issue to be examined in the project is the effect of frozen soil on the precipitation response to soil temperature.  The project tests the extent to which a better representation of frozen soil in regional climate models (RCMs) can lead to a stronger relationship between Western soil temperature and Southern Plains precipitation simulated by the model.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary work for the proposal has shown evidence for the effect of subsurface soil temperature, and work performed under the project will follow up with a set of model simulation experiments. The experiments will be conducted with a model configuration in which a global atmospheric model (the NOAA/NCEP Global Forecast System model, or GFS) will be combined with an RCM known as the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, in which land surface processes are simulated by the Simplified Simple Biosphere (SSiB) model.  Experiments typically use imposed sea surface temperatures and sea ice to produce a global simulation for a particular year using the GFS model, which is in turn used to specify lateral boundary conditions for WRF simulations.  The experiments test the influence of all local and remote effects on Southern Plains precipitation, including soil conditions in the Western states and also sea surface temperature (SST) fluctuations.  SSTs, including those associated with El Nino can affect Southern Plains precipitation both directly and indirectly, through their influence on soil temperature to the West.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work has broader impacts due to the economic and societal impact of drought in the Southern Plains and the desirability of better methods to predict the extent and duration of droughts. The project will also support a post-doctoral researcher, thereby supporting the next generation of scientists in this research area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Episodes of extreme events such as droughts and floods are important features of Earth?s climate and can have serious societal, agricultural, economic, and ecological impacts. During the past four decades, the mean duration of prolonged dry episodes has increased significantly. The causes and mechanisms of these extreme events are still largely unknown so far.  While studies have showed connections between sea surface temperature (SST) variability and land precipitation, these studies, however, suggest that SST are unable to predict these extreme events fully. The prediction skill for precipitation anomalies in spring and summer months has remained stubbornly low for many years.  During 2015-2016 one of the strongest El Nino events since 1950 was associated with an extraordinary Californian drought, while a 2016-2017 La Nina event has been associated with record rainfall that effectively ended the 5-year Californian drought, contrary to the expected SST - drought/flood relations. While atmospheric internal variability undoubtedly contributes, the sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S) prediction problem underscores the need to seek explanations beyond SST?s influence alone, to pursue the identification of new mechanisms contributing to droughts/floods and add value for intraseasonal prediction.      Our study identifies the spring land surface temperature (LST) anomaly over the western high elevation areas in two continents, North America and East Asia, as a factor in creating respective late spring/summer droughts or floods in downstream regions &ndash; a concept that has been largely ignored by previous extreme hydroclimate events studies.  Our study proposes a new direction for the drought/flood study in addition to well-known SST effect and internal variability.  Using the worldwide available 2-meter temperature (T2m), which has relatively reliable quality, and maximum covariance analysis method, we have identified that the warm (cold) spring T2m anomaly in western U.S. is associated with the summer wet (dry) conditions in Southern Great Plains and adjacent regions (SGP) and opposite anomaly to the north; it also suggests that warm (cold) spring T2m anomaly in Tibetan Plateau is associated with the summer wet (dry) conditions to the south of the Yangzi River and opposite anomaly to the north.      To conform the causal relationship between spring LST anomaly and summer precipitation downstream in these two continents, we have conducted several modeling studies using both the General Circulation Model and the regional climate model, to investigate three high signal drought/flood events, which included the 2011 SGP drought, 2015 SGP flood, 2003 East Asian drought to the south of the Yangzi River and flood to the north.  The spring T2m temperatures in 2011 and 2015 were very cold and warm respectively, and the Tibetan Plateau spring temperature was very cold in 2003.  In these studies, observed T2m anomalies were used as constrain to assess the effect of spring warm (cold) land surface temperature on the summer downstream flood (drought).  Meanwhile, for comparison, the SST effects were also tested.  Our modeling studies demonstrate that the spring upstream land surface temperature anomalies contributed to the 2011 SGP drought and 2015 SGP flood, as well as 2003 East Asian drought/flood events.  The LST contribution is the first order effect and comparable with the SST effect in North America and its effect seems even larger than SST in 2003 East Asian Case.  The sum of LST and SST effects contains about 2/3 of the observed North American anomaly.  As such, it is essential to include both factors (SST and LST) to produce reliable flood/drought prediction.       Based on this study, a Global Energy and Water cycle Exchanges Project/Global Atmospheric System Study Project (GEWEX/GASS) Initiative "Impact of initialized land temperature and snowpack on sub-seasonal to seasonal prediction (ILSTSS2S)" has been developed and many institutions worldwide have participated to test the impact of the initialization of large scale land surface temperature on the S2S prediction over different regions (http://ilstss2s.geog.ucla.edu). Although this study focuses on two regions, it will motivate testing those relationships and general physical principles and mechanisms in other regions with similar geographic settings.  This research will also stimulate studies on the effect of low elevation land subsurface temperature memory.       Last Modified: 08/11/2018       Submitted by: Yongkang Xue]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
