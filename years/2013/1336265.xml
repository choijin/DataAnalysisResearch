<AbstractNarration>Value-Added Models (VAMs) in education are increasingly being used to attempt to measure the impact of a teacher on student achievement in a way that takes into account students? and peers? prior performance and demographics. Data that typically inform a VAM rely largely on student achievement data from state testing systems. The RealVAMs project tests a multi-dimensional mechanism to include other measures of student success such as scores from different assessment instruments (SAT, ACT) and categorical responses such as whether or not a student graduated or persisted in a STEM field. The real world model using multi-dimensional data is being tested using a longitudinal database from a large school district. The project is creating an open source accessible program to facilitate the expanded measurement of VAMS across a larger scale. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has national significance as the use of VAMs for teacher evaluation is expanding rapidly across the country in schools and districts. A major objection to the use of VAMs in teacher evaluation has been the over-reliance on the use of state testing data. Opponents of the use of VAMs argue that this reliance contributes to a narrowing of curriculum and instruction to only what can be tested on state tests. Not all subjects are tested, so the use of VAMs does not support the evidence that can be used in the evaluation of teachers in non-tested subjects or grade levels. This project informs the educational practice community of schools and districts and provides for more nuanced and richer information about the impact of teachers for policy decision making.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With growing recognition that standardized test scores provide a limited view of teachers' broader effects on student success, the project "Collaborative Research: RealVAMS Getting Real-World Value from Value Added Models (VAMs)" developed a more holistic approach for measuring teacher effectiveness. The RealVAMS project developed a multidimensional model to estimate multiple measures of teacher effectiveness as teachers may contribute to different aspects of student achievement. Accounting for a teacher?s effects on multiple aspects of student success, not just standardized test scores, better reflects the complexity of real-life educational contexts and allows educational systems to answer more nuanced questions about educational effectiveness. These multidimensional value-added estimates will go beyond the traditional estimates and provide insight into a teacher's contribution to both test scores and real-world measures of student success, such as college entry or STEM persistence.  The methods developed through the RealVAMS project can identify teachers that not only contribute to higher than expected test scores, but also impact real change in STEM career readiness and other appropriate indicators of success. In fact, when applied to data from a large public school district, the RealVAMS model revealed a teacher who would have been classified as "below average" or "low performing" based on standardized test scores alone, but was well above average on the likelihood of their students entering college.  Although no model can capture the full complexity of student success, the RealVAMS methodology provides a broader picture of teacher effectiveness than traditional value-added estimates based on test scores alone. To take full advantage of the RealVAMS model and its capabilities, districts and other researchers should carefully design and implement data systems that allow them to collect information about multiple aspects of student success and learning, not just standardized test scores.  The RealVAMS project developed both the model and a corresponding statistical software package to execute the model.
