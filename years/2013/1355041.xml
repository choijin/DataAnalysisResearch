<AbstractNarration>The unPAK project (undergraduates Phenotyping Arabidopsis Knockouts) uses the plant Arabidopsis thaliana to examine how and when differences in DNA sequences lead to differences in traits related to survival, growth, and reproduction.  It will detect effects, if any, of mutation in a comprehensive collection of mutants generated by the SALK Institute, and will then compile results in a comprehensive database. To examine the interaction of genetic and environmental effects, unPAK's experiments are replicated within and across multiple growth facilities and labs, and a subset of experiments deliberately manipulate soil factors, moisture, and temperature to see how these important ecological factors interact with genetics. unPAK will survey enough mutant lines to reach coverage of a third of the A. thaliana genome (approximately 9,000 genes). All data are uploaded into a public database at arabidopsisunpak.org, and the unPAK project links its database of observed traits to existing genomic databases. Evidence produced by unPAK will enable testing central hypotheses about the relationship between genomic features and important plant characteristics. For example, the data can be used to test whether the effects of mutation are predicted by gene attributes such as molecular signatures of selection in the past, gene function, gene family size, or by patterns of variability in natural populations.unPAK is centered around participation of undergraduate researchers in the lab and the classroom, educating and training undergraduates integratively in genetics, ecology, evolution, and bioinformatics. The network extends across diverse post-secondary institutions, with over 100 undergraduate apprentices participating across 13 laboratories in 3 years.  Greater than 20 course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) will be supported by the program, reaching over 600 students. Any discoveries about the influence of particular genes on fruit production, survival, or life history will have significant broader impacts in potential application to crop species. As a final part of the project the unPAK research network itself is being studied. Using mixed-methods approaches from the social sciences, researchers are documenting interactions among network participants to analyze changes in network structure over time, and to investigate factors that influence student participation and outcomes, including students' accrual of human, cultural, and social capital.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Intellectual Merits&nbsp;</strong>In the 21st century, the rapidity and low cost of analyzing or manipulating DNA in plants has greatly benefited plant science. A major emphasis has been experimentally creating plant strains known as knockout mutants, with the technique being especially advanced in the model species&nbsp;<em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em>, a non-crop species with a growth habit and geographic range that allow it to serve as a model for basic and applied science. Research with&nbsp;<em>Arabidopsis</em>&nbsp;is akin to studies of mouse models in biomedicine. Thanks to previous research, thousands of knockout strains have been assembled into collections referred to as knockout libraries. Our UnPAK project tapped an existing knockout library and has used it to conduct experiments and amass new data to complement what is already known from DNA sequence data -- namely, data quantifying physical characteristics of knockout strains. Also, rather than focusing on one or a few genes that are partially understood, UnPAK focused more broadly and included thousands of diverse knockout strains, including many that were&nbsp;uncharacterized or poorly characterized. Another main emphasis in UnPAK was physical traits relevant to how plants function in natural or agricultural ecosystems. After how many days does a plant start producing flowers? How large are its leaves? What is its height? How many fruits does it produce? How large or small are its fruits? On Barnard's campus, we have grown and measured thousands of plants for these traits in hundreds of natural and mutant strains. Data from Barnard and from UnPAK's multiple collaborating campuses have been combined and used to address basic and important questions in genetics and ecology. For example, we asked whether mutations more frequently harm than benefit an organism's performance, finding that effects of mutations tend to be distrubuted rather symmetrically. In other words, many mutations are deleterious, but there are also many that improve one or more traits. Even more basically, we asked how frequently mutations alter plant traits, a key question for understanding why a simple and short-lived organism like Arabidopsis maintains a genome with nearly 30,000 genes. The answer to this question is also essential for predicting how organisms might respond to artificial selection or novel natural selection. Previous studies tentatively concluded that knockout mutations have infrequent or undetectable effects. In contrast, UnPAK's voluminous data set is detecting significant effects much more frequently, most likely because of our emphasis on measuring many different traits and on conducting experiments not only in standard growing environments but also across a set of more stressful conditions. Lastly, in addition to using UnPAK data to address our own questions and aims, we make it freely available to those outside of the UnPAK network who frequently conduct research with this same knockout library.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong>&nbsp;Educational research has established that undergraduate students learn better by participating in individual and classroom-based projects and experiments. This finding strongly motivated the multi-campus UnPAK project, including efforts here at Barnard College. UnPaK has invigorated our urban campus by supporting a faculty laboratory specializing in plant biology, and by increasing usage of research facilities in the college's long-established Ross greenhouse. Student participants in UnPAK have been enthusiastic about focusing on a single model plant species, grasping that it is akin to the use of fruit fly or mouse models in biomedical research. Involvement in UnPAK has been important for students interested in the plant biology, including natural and agricultural ecosystems and crops. UnPAK also nicely balances Barnard's already strong focus on premedical courses and biomedical research. The principal investigator, a woman and a senior member of the faculty, has recruited and mentored students in individual projects during summers and academic years. Of the 19 total undergraduate students supported by this three-year grant, 18 experienced one or more major STEM opportunities at Barnard: (i) the college's annual 10-week Summer Research Institute (twelve students), (ii) academic course credit for research, in the biology department (nine students), or (iii) a year-long senior thesis research seminar (two students). Several students have also attended and presented research at national professional meetings and one was a lead co-author on a professional publication. Across the full three-year period,100% of the students involved are women, at least 15% of them from groups underrepresented in STEM (e.g., three Latinas). At the time of this report, about 80% of these students remain in STEM fields as graduate students or employees. The project's full-time technician also secured another laboratory technician position in plant ecology in New York City. The PI of the project has actively developed new or updated courses to further broaden the number of undergraduate students who are gaining experience in working directly with living plants, managing data, engaging with powerful plant science databases, learning statistics and programming skills, and engaging in writing and speaking that enhances communication about STEM to diverse stakeholders.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/03/2019<br>      Modified by: Hilary&nbsp;S&nbsp;Callahan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1355041/1355041_10304350_1546541520321_JericaAndRhea--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1355041/1355041_10304350_1546541520321_JericaAndRhea--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Greenhouse Experiment"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1355041/1355041_10304350_1546541520321_JericaAndRhea--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Greenhouse Experiment"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Research bench space in Barnard College's Ross Greenhouse allows simultanously growing about 2000 plants, representing hundreds of natural and knockout strains of Arabidopsis thaliana.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jerica Tan</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Hilary&nbsp;S&nbsp;Callahan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Greenhouse Experiment</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1355041/1355041_10304350_1546541093909_LabAtPosterSession--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1355041/1355041_10304350_1546541093909_LabAtPosterSession--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Poster Session at 2016 Barnard Summer Research Institute"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1355041/1355041_10304350_1546541093909_LabAtPosterSession--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Poster Session at 2016 Barnard Summer Research Institute"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">(L-R) Lumanola Gomezdelatorre Clavel, Viviana Varon, Rhea Nagpal, Jerica Tan, Hilary Callahan</div> <div class="imageCredit">Clare Kohler</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Hilary&nbsp;S&nbsp;Callahan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Poster Session at 2016 Barnard Summer Research Institute</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
