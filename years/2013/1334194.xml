<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to study a service provider facing an arrival stream of delay-sensitive, strategic customers. The "type" of a customer consists of her valuation for service and her delay sensitivity (waiting cost). While the distribution of customer types may be known, or partially known, an individual's customer type is not known. The research approach is to study a continuum of customer valuations (rather than a finite number), enabling the analysis of infinitely many price/delay combinations.  The deliverables of this research will include a revenue-maximizing incentive-compatible menu of prices, where a customer pays a higher price to receive higher queuing priority, and hence lower delay. Additionally the research will deliver modeling and analysis tools and revenue and welfare comparisons under different customer types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this research will solve a timely problem: how to allocate and price service priority to customers, where the customers are heterogeneous in their valuations (available funds)and in their delay sensitivities and are willing to lie about these.  The award will produce simple closed-form optimal price menus that charge different prices for different priority levels, so as to optimize profit for the service provider.  The research is made possible by a combination of two very different research areas: incentive-compatible pricing and queuing theory and contributes to a long-term ongoing international collaboration in pricing and queuing between Carnegie Mellon and the TUE/EURANDOM Institute in the Netherlands. The mathematics developed will also help train graduate and undergraduate students as well as Math Olympiad K-12 students in the Western PA ARML team and will contribute to the SWAN program on optimal adoption placement.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overall goal of our project is to maximize profit by exploiting the fact that disparate users have different delay sensitivities and also different abilities to pay for reducing their delay.  We exploit this by offering different users the ability to pay to receive priority in a queue, thereby reducing their delay in the queue. Our results are extremely general.  They affect the internet, banks, healthcare, airports and any other situation where people can pay to achieve lower delay.  The first thrust of our project deals with the situation where people with higher valuations (more money) are also more delay sensitive. Our idea for maximizing profit under this setting is to offer users a menu of priority/price options.  We find that we can increase profit by almost 20% by offering high valuation users higher priorities via our optimal priority/price menu.  We also conduct a numerical study to understand effect of increasing the number of price options on the menu.  We find that even a small number of menu options goes a long way towards maximizing profit.  Finally we consider the case where a customer's value (money) is not proportional to their delay cost.  It turns out that this case is far more difficult, and we are unable to determine a profit-maximizing menu of options for customers.  In a second thrust of our work, we are motivated by the case where the service provider is a health-care provider trying to decide how to prioritize his/her patients.  We again consider the problem where people with higher valuations (more money) are also more delay sensitive, and will pay for less waiting time.  However we assume that all customers value "face-time" with the doctor, although they dislike waiting time.  Specifically, we assume that the service provider (the doctor) can control his/her speed.  If a service provider chooses to serve a customer quickly, that is viewed as degrading the quality of service for that customer because the provider is spending less "face-time" with the customer.  Our results on this problem are very counter-intuitive.  We find that it is best to serve the less-valuable customers first, but serve them quickly.  The more valuable customers should be served later, but be granted much longer service times.  Even in the case where there is only a single customer class, under the profit maximizing policy, not all customers should be treated the same.  Some customers should randomly be given faster (low-quality) service with high priority, while others should be given slower (high-quality) service with low priority.  There are many implications for this result in healthcare and other discretionary service settings.  In a third thrust of our project, we consider how dispatching policies for multi-server systems are affected by the fact that customers can have different valuations (money).  We produce the first analysis of dispatching policies in multi-server systems where customers have different values.  We find that policies based on the c-mu rule are actually much worse that expected, and we develop a new suite of policies that route jobs so as to isolate high-value customers from others.  We also evaluate dispatching policies which allow higher-value customers to replicate themselves onto multiple queues.  A fourth thrust of our project deals with the reverse case where the servers, rather than the customers, behave strategically.  Here we find that optimal staffing decisions are greatly impacted by the presence of strategic behavior.  In fact, the number of servers needed for optimal capacity provisioning is an order of magnitude higher when servers are strategic than is needed when servers are not strategic.  This project has several Broader Impact outcomes. The PI, Mor Harchol-Balter, runs the Western PA ARML team, which trains 20 high school students for the Math Olympiad.  Funding for the ARML team is provided through Jump Trading.  The PI and her students are also involved in Women@SCS events.  These include: CMU Tech nights to teach technology to middle school girls, Road Shows to attract high school students to computer science, and Women@SCS Creative Technology Nights, to talk to high school girls about research in computer science.  Co-PI Mustafa Akan is heavily involved in the SWAN program, Pennsylvania's Statewide Adoption and Permanency Network, where he applies research from the grant to help pace children.  The project contributed to the training of several PhD students and undergraduates.  PhD student Sherwin Doroudi was partially funded on this grant.  He graduated last year and accepted a tenure-track faculty position in the ISYE department at University of Minnesota. PhD students Kristy Gardner and Timothy Zhu also received a small amount of funding on this grant.  Kristy and Timothy graduated this year.  Kristy accepted a tenure-track faculty position in the Computer Science department at Amherst College, while Timothy accepted a tenure-track faculty position in the Computer Science department at Penn State University.
