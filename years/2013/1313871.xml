<AbstractNarration>Confined ultracold atoms provide the unique capability to create designer systems that can be tailored to provide direct access to quantum mechanical properties that may be otherwise obscured.  An important class of such properties is topological in nature in the sense that they are primarily defined by the structure of the abstract space of their defining parameters.  Since topology is the most general description of any structure, real or abstract, such features can be used to find connections among phenomena that may seem unrelated, and thereby provide powerful insights into them all. The goal of this research is to analyze several such phenomena, some newly proposed here and some well-known but not well-understood, comparatively from a topological perspective. The method will be to recast them as generalized transport problems, tracking how the system and its parameters evolve in time, which will then be related to dynamical experiments with cold atoms.  The study will involve the intrinsic quantum characteristic of phase in the context of creating gauge fields associated with varying local phase, and coherence effects associated with quantum systems.  Whether the topological properties survive the loss of phase coherence in the presence of nonlinearity or in taking the classical physics limit is an essential fundamental physics question that will be examined for all mechanisms studied.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcome of this study has potential for applications in creating novel materials and devices that take advantage of the newly available topological and phase properties, as well as, for significantly broadening our understanding of fundamental physics, since many of these issues have relevance across all areas of physics.  Some aspects of the research have technological applications potential for improved sensors and gyroscopes, and in the emerging field of atomtronics, the atomic analog of electronics. A high priority of the research will be to engage multiple undergraduate students at a public university attended by many first generation and at-risk students who often do not get the opportunity to participate in scientific research.  The goal is to continue and expand on the success of a prior grant to attract and channel such domestic students into careers in science and technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ultracold atoms at temperatures near absolute zero have become the system of choice for examining nuances of quantum physics, because they can be made, by deliberate design, to be manifest at the relatively macroscopic scale of collective states of atoms and proportionately longer time scales, compared to what is typical in nature.  This research has explored some of the most intriguing quantum mechanical features in this context: The intrinsic phase or the complex nature of quantum states that allows matter to interfere like light; the invariance under a local phase rotation and its generalization, known as gauge invariance from which all the fundamental forces except gravity can be derived; and how topology, whether it be of the physical system or of the abstract space of its parameters, can fundamentally define quantum states.  A relevant recent development has been the synthetic creation of gauge structures with cold atoms. In this research, a new mechanism was designed that allowed both Abelian and non-Abelian kinds within the same configuration. Criteria in use to distinguish the two kinds were shown to be flawed, and an unambiguous generally applicable test was identified based on using a nonlocal gauge invariant entity called the Wilson loop associated with parametrically evolving the relevant system in a sequence of closed loops and noting the dependence on their order. Furthermore, a method was devised to measure the full matrix associated with Wilson loops.  Whether in nature or in synthetic creations, gauge freedom has always been associated with internal degrees of freedom, but this research has developed a way to create gauge structures in external degrees of freedom of quantum states in real physical space, with dynamics possible on macroscopic size and time scales.  The quantum phase has a practical utility in creating interference effects, which for counter-propagating beams in a closed loop, can serve to detect rotation. It was shown here that such rotation sensing in cold atoms can be enhanced by using nonlinearity induced by interactions among atoms, to generate spin squeezing to bypass the limitations of the Uncertainty Principle. The associated nonlinear dynamics is interesting in its own right as occurring between circulating modes that occupy the same physical space.    The closed topology of the ring that allows the sensitivity to rotation also creates a periodic boundary condition that leads to specific quantization of allowed states.  When an appropriate one-dimensional lattice structure is introduced, along the azimuth, the eigenenergies can be made to form a fractal structure known as the Hofstadter butterfly associated with electrons on two-dimensional lattices subject to a magnetic field.  In this research, this was proposed with optimal conditions along with demonstration of a transition from extended to localized quantum states.  Temporal evolution of a double-well lattice along the ring was found to create a counter-intuitive circuital flow induced by topological constraints, whereby states would migrate oppositely to the direction of lattice motion sensitive to rotation.  Such motion by time-varying potentials is of broader interest in mesoscopic electronics as a means of controlled generation of current with no bias. Usually localized barrier potentials are favored to create such quantum pumps. It was shown here that use of attractive potentials can actually enhance the quantum features, with deep resonances and stepped current, arising from the entrapment of particles.  The rich dynamics was examined semiclassically, the quantum features emulated by including interference among classical trajectories, the momentum space action serving as phase. Other pump mechanisms were similarly analyzed comparatively with quantum, classical and semiclassical approaches.  A result generally relevant for any quantum dynamics was derived to yield an analytical relation for the trade-off between duration of a quantum dynamical process and the fidelity of achieving the desired target state.  Broader Impact: Creation of gauge fields in real space will further our general understanding of the fundamental forces and symmetries. Likewise, the relation between fidelity and duration in quantum evolution is relevant for all of quantum physics. Enhanced rotation sensing and controlled flow by attractive pumps can be find use in mesoscopic electronics and atomtronics, and results pertaining to nonlinear dynamics of spatially co-existing modes and the semiclassical studies are directly relevant for nonlinear physics and studies of quantum-classical crossover and quantum chaos.  This project directly trained and involved fourteen undergraduate students, with several of them accepted into excellent physics Ph.D. programs or preparing to do so.  Impact can be gauged from eight student co-authorships involving five undergraduate students on peer-reviewed scientific papers published or developed during the term of this project, along with multiple student presentations at international conferences.  All are domestic students and most from rural demographics wherein careers in scientific research is atypical.  The funding for this project has helped create an environment where more such students continue to be recruited and exposed to research and channeled into careers in science and engineering.
