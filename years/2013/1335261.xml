<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks to develop a high-resolution, astronomically-tuned time series for the Eocene based on the isotopic compositions of foraminfera obtained from cores drilled during IODP exp. 342 (Newfoundland Drifts). This series will fill a gap (Eocene Gap) in the cyclostratigraphic record and enable the development of a complete orbitally-resolved Cenozoic record. This is one of the primary objectives of exp. 342. This work will also enable the examination of orbital-scale response and sensitivity of the carbon cycle during the Eocene and by comparison with data obtained in the Pacific Ocean, determine whether or not events such as the deepening of the CCD were global in extent. The Eocene is a particularly critical time for climate studies as it spans the time between the early Cenozoic greenhouse and the later Cenozoic icehouse. The Eocene is a particularly critical time for climate studies as it spans the time between the early Cenozoic greenhouse and the later Cenozoic icehouse. The information provided by this work will help to constrain and evaluate the causes of global climate change at a particularly crucial time in Earth history.</AbstractNarration>

A hurricane can grow in strength for few days and impact the coast of one country whereas an ice sheet can take many millennia to grow and will alter the global climate. Understanding the rate of change in different parts of the Earth system requires having accurate clocks that tell us when and how long events happened, even in the far distant past. These geological chronometers are particularly important for working out the likely mechanisms (or effects) of past events like ice sheet growth or abrupt global warming because different feedbacks are important on different time scales. For instance, on short times scales (years to centuries) forest growth and loss is an important regulator of atmospheric pCO2, but on long time scales it is the weathering of rocks that really matters. In the fossil record, we have been successful in using the regular cycle in Earth?s orbit and Earth?s orbit around the sun to tell time.
