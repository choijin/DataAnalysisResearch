<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Marjorie Langell of the University of Nebraska at Lincoln is investigating methods of tailoring nanometer-sized, heterogeneous catalysts by their chemical composition and crystallite size.  The project targets the improvement of catalytic efficiency and selectivity, which would be important for the chemical manufacturing sector and sustainable growth.  The catalysts are suitable for use in the energy sector in natural gas power generators, solid-state fuel cells, and petrochemical cracking.  There are also applications in pollution abatement and in photochemical (solar) chemistry. For broader impacts on human capital, the project trains graduate and undergraduate students, and includes national laboratory experience for these researchers.  The project also involves outreach to encourage high school students to pursue undergraduate chemistry degrees and to increase understanding of catalysis and nanoscience by demonstrations and activities readily available to the general public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The bimetallic oxide catalysts are being synthesized in nanoscale form by combinatorial hydrothermal-solvothermal methods and characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS).  The materials are being evaluated for reactivity in the water gas shift reaction, carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of methanol.   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) measure possible surface segregation and identify adsorbate species, and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) determines the activation energies and helps in identifying reaction mechanisms.  Atmospheric pressure studies, performed in a catalyst characterization system, follow the catalytic reactions with products detected by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Heterogeneous catalysts, which have great industrial and environmental importance, are solid materials that regulate chemical reactions in gas or liquid phases to lower the energy required to carry out the reaction, improve the rate at which the reaction occurs and/or reduce the amount of unwanted co-products that form. In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Marjorie Langell and her group at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln have tailored heterogeneous oxidation catalysts by composition and crystallite size.  The bicomponent oxide catalysts she and her group have studied were synthesized in macroscale form by thermal diffusion methods and in nanoscale form by combinatorial hydrothermal-solvothermal methods, and were characterized by x-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and x-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS).  The materials were then evaluated for reactivity in a number of commercially important chemical processes including the water gas shift reaction, CO oxidation, and the oxidative dehydrogenation of methanol.   X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) were used to measure possible surface segregation and identify adsorbate species, and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) determined the activation energies and helped to tease out the reaction mechanisms.   The findings of the project have intellectual merit in contributing to the fundamental chemical understanding of the reactivity of bicomponent oxides, M&prime;xM1-xO with M &acute;; M = Mn2+, Fe2+, Cu2+, Zn2+ and Ce4+.  Their wide and continuously variable concentration ranges allowed their electronic structure, magnetic properties and chemical reactivity to be studied over a wide range, and their ability to be synthesized in nanocrystalline and macrocrystalline size helped determine the effect of very small particle size on chemical reactivity.  New coordination sites and chemical environments were created, allowing chemistry not previously seen before in solid state chemistry.  Finally, the project unequivocally demonstrated that the binary oxides could be used to improve chemical catalysis and remain stable under reaction conditions when the catalyst applications and reaction conditions were well-matched.  Broader impacts of the research resulted from the improvement of oxidation catalysis efficiency and selectivity, important in the world’s economy and sustainable growth.  The oxidation catalysts are suitable for use in the energy sector in natural gas power generators, solid-state fuel cells, and petrochemical cracking.  There are also applications in pollution abatement and in photochemical (solar) chemistry.  Broader impacts on human capital were created in the training of graduate, undergraduate and high school students.  The project also involves outreach in Chemistry Days, an on-site workshop to encourage high school students to pursue undergraduate chemistry degrees, and in Nanoscience Days, undertaken at a large local shopping mall with hands-on demonstrations formulated to increase understanding of catalysis and nanoscience for the general public.
