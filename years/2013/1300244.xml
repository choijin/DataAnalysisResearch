<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this research is to improve our understanding of how current warning systems work and provide an opportunity to make improvements.  Many weather events affect the United States each year and some of them lead to loss of life, injuries, and damaged property. These problems call for better warning systems.  Such warnings systems are difficult to create since so many different people, processes, and resources are involved in detecting, predicting, and communicating the risks. Understanding how these warning systems work is important if we want to know how to make them better.  This research will look at the differences between warning systems in different regions of the US. The study will include in-depth qualitative interviews with warning system members in three different areas.  The interviews will address tasks and activities associated with the warning system, communication within and between organizations involved, roles and responsibilities, and the use of resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will not only improve our understanding of how the current warning systems work, but it will present an opportunity to explore the storm spotter network and their modern role in the warning system.  In addition, it will provide the basic information we need in order to improve warning organizations and improve severe weather communications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research explored a conceptual model of the weather warning system in an effort to extend our understanding of the organizations and tasks involved. In addition, this analysis examined the inter- and intra-organizational variations that may arise among warning systems in different regions.  A multiple case study design was utilized and in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with representatives from relevant organizations such as emergency personnel, forecasters, and media.  These interviews addressed tasks and activities associated with the warning system, communication within and across organizations, roles and responsibilities, and the use of resources.     A final conceptual model is presented detailing four tasks associated with assessment (gathering, preparing, coordinating, and analyzing) and three tasks associated with dissemination (disseminating to the public, coworkers, and other organizations).  A communication structure also developed around key methods and tools such as conference calls, National Weather Service (NWS) chat, and the Emergency Operations Center.  In addition, a general role structure was present across all cases.  NWS provided scientific information, the emergency managers acted as a collaboration conduit, the media focused on public dissemination, and the fire and police departments focused on response and response preparation.     While there were multiple unexpected similarities across cases, several aspects of the culture within areas experiencing frequent hazards stood out as unique.  Communications between organizations during a weather event were predominantly two-way and collaborative.  Additionally, even during normal times interactions remained numerous.  While relationships were an important theme across all cases, frequent hazard areas were more outspoken about positive feelings and connections with other organizations.  These results suggest that more established relationships and an interactive communication structure evolved due to hazard frequency.  These cases also exhibited noticeably greater use of NWS chat and a more extensive storm spotter network.  Both resources were well integrated into the communication structure and tended to foster and enhance collaboration.     Ultimately, this analysis led to three broad conclusions that contribute to our understanding of organizational culture as it can be applied to a warning system subculture.  1) Similarities between the cases were more prevalent than expected suggesting that many aspects of organizational culture within warning systems remain the same across different regions.  2) On the other hand, results did indicate some evolution of culture due to frequent hazard impacts.  These areas developed deeper, more established relationships and exhibited collaborations rooted in exchange of opinions and ideas rather than just information.  3) There is evidence to suggest a continuum of culture rather than a discrete æfrequent hazard vs. no frequent hazardÆ difference.  In other words, warning systems likely evolve continually and organically rather than in a step-wise manner.
