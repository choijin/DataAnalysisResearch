<AbstractNarration>We propose a research program on several intertwined geometric themes of complex and real low-dimensional dynamics, primarily on the polynomial dynamics on the Riemann sphere and the dynamics in the dissipative real and complex Henon family. Most of these themes are unified by the idea of renormalization as a powerful tool of penetrating into small-scale structure of dynamical objects, aimed towards their complete classification. We particularly emphasize the following themes: the problem of local connectivity of the Mandelbrot set, Feigenbaum Julia sets of positive area and Siegel Renormalization Theory, the Palis Conjecture on finiteness of attractors for strongly dissipative real Henon maps, and stability and bifurcations for moderately dissipative complex Henon maps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed activity will result in deeper insights into small scale structure of dynamical systems, in training of highly qualified graduate students and postdocs who will apply their skills in academia and industry, in broader interactions between experts in various branches of real and complex dynamics, in promotion of communication between the field of dynamics and related areas of physics and applied mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview:This research program has been devoted to several intertwined geometric themes of complex low-dimensional dynamics, making a gradual transition from the one-dimensional (D1)  to the two-dimensional (D2)  world.In 1D,  it led to  developing a new ``Pacman Renormalization Theory'' that gives control of the scaling properties of the celebrated Mandelbrot set M near the main cardioid. It resulted in advances in the problem of local connectivity of M (``MLC'') and in the area problem for the corresponding Julia sets.Another direction that has been explored is the  structure of the group of quasisymmetries of various classes of Julia sets.In  2D, this program led to a classification of periodic Fatou components for dissipative complex Henon map and a description of the structure of such maps with dominated splitting. It also resulted in a better understanding of the local dynamics near neutral periodic points.The PI is  finishing  the first two volumes of a book ``Conformal Geometry and Dynamics of Quadratic  Polynomials''that would serve as an introduction to some of the above themes.Intellectual merit of the proposed activity:Advances in the MLC Conjecture and the area problem for Julia setsalways provide holomorphic dynamics with new powerful tools. It isintimately related to the renormalization theory that gives us invaluableinsights into universality features of dynamical and parameter regions. The dissipative  Henon family  is a basic model for two-dimensionaldynamics, providing us with a natural transit from the  well developed one-dimensional theory to much less understood  dimension two.Advances in these themes would become illuminating pieces of contemporary Holomorphic  Dynamics. Broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity:The proposed activity will result in deeper insights into small scalestructure of dynamical systems, in training of highly qualified postdocs and graduate students  who will apply their skills in academia and industry, in broader interactions between experts in various branches of real and complex dynamics, in publishing a book that would help a broad student and research community to acquire background in the area, in promotion of communication in the field by organizing conferences and scientific programs, giving mini-courses, and  maintaining a dynamics web site (http//www.math.stonybrook/dynamics).
