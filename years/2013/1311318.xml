<AbstractNarration>The Stony Brook-Brookhaven AGEP Frontiers of Research and Academic Models of Excellence (FRAME) Alliance for Transformation was created in response to the NSF's Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program solicitation (NSF 12-554) for the AGEP-Transformation (AGEP-T) track.  The AGEP-T track targets strategic alliances of institutions and organizations to develop, implement, and study innovative evidence-based models and standards for STEM graduate education, postdoctoral training, and academic STEM career preparation that eliminate or mitigate negative factors and promote positive practices for URMs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is an alliance between SUNY at Stony Brook (SBU) and Brookhaven National Laboratory's Office of Educational Programs (BNL) that is partnering with eight organizations who are members of the Brookhaven Science Associates (BSA), the company that was formed to operate BNL for the U.S. Department of Energy: Battelle, SBU, Columbia University, Cornell University, Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University and Yale University. The Stony Brook-Brookhaven AGEP FRAME Alliance is engaging Historically Black Colleges and Universities, as well as other minority service institutions, through collaborations with the Interdisciplinary Consortium for Research and Educational Access in Science and Engineering (INCREASE).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The FRAME Alliance is working on a goal to help U.S. citizens who are underrepresented minority (URM) graduate students and postdoctoral trainees develop the essential skills to succeed in the competitive professional environment of the professoriate.  An Alliance participant is defined as a URM U.S. citizen who is a graduate student or postdoctoral fellow in STEM.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objectives for this project are:&lt;br/&gt;Objective 1: Double the number of URM U.S. citizens who are postdoctoral trainees at SBU and BNL, from the current baseline of 18, to 36.&lt;br/&gt;Objective 2: Establish a postdoctoral fellow training regimen for U.S. URM citizens with formal pedagogical and professional competencies. &lt;br/&gt;Objective 3: Provide targeted support and intensive training for U.S. citizens who are URM STEM doctoral students at SBU/BNL to become productive and independent researchers who receive offers, and accept postdoctoral positions, at BSA member institutions (Columbia University, Cornell University, Harvard University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton University and Yale University) or other top tier research institutions.&lt;br/&gt;Objective 4: Develop and sustain a mutually beneficial relationship between INCREASE institutions and SBU in order to strengthen the research training, mentoring and networking opportunities across a broad community of URM students, who are U.S. citizens, whereby there is an increase from 30% to 60% in the number of INCREASE institutions that provide pathways for their undergraduates to pursue graduate study at SBU.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The activities that contribute to the model for the SBU/BNL AGEP FRAME Alliance are very specific and they include: &lt;br/&gt;1. Building a mutually beneficial partnership between SBU, BNL, BSA, and INCREASE whereby an increase in joint publications, diversity centered collaborations and appointments of the postdoctoral fellows in positions within the consortium will be measures of success. &lt;br/&gt;2. Providing high level training to U.S. citizens who are URM graduate students and postdoctoral trainees about professional and research skills whereby an increase in their research productivity, engagement in mentoring activities, improved science writing, and science communication skills will be measures of success. &lt;br/&gt;3. Transitioning U.S. citizens who are URM graduate students and postdoctoral trainees into professoriate positions at research intensive universities with change measured by an increase in the number of students applying to, receiving offers from, and entering postdoctoral and faculty positions at BSA institutions or other top tier institutions, and postdoctoral fellows applying to, receiving offers, and entering faculty positions at BSA institutions or other top tier institutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposal includes a social science research study that explores whether the level and stability of STEM identity among graduate and postdoctoral fellows is enhanced by increasing levels of self-efficacy over time, and predicts STEM success and persistence outcomes among URMs who are U.S. citizens. The research is testing the psychosocial processes underlying this goal. The research team is assessing two key psychosocial factors, and their corresponding processes, theorized to impact STEM success and persistence among URM graduate students and postdoctoral trainees: the level and stability of STEM specific self-efficacy and STEM identity among URM graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, compared to non-URM graduate students and postdoctoral trainees. A primary vehicle for expected changes in STEM self-efficacy and STEM identity among URM students and postdoctoral fellows should be exposure to the SBU/BNL AGEP FRAME Alliance programming interventions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Overview The Stony Brook-Brookhaven AGEP Frontiers of Research and Academic Models of Excellence (FRAME) Alliance for Transformation formed a partnership between a research intensive doctoral institution (Stony Brook University)  and a national research laboratory (Brookhaven National Laboratory) with the goal of providing underrepresented minority, U.S. citizen, doctoral  STEM PhD students and postdoctoral trainees with professional development interventions to develop skills essential for success in the competitive environment of the professoriate.  In addition to this programmatic project goal, the FRAME Alliance conducted a social science research study that sought to understand if and how the level and stability of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) identity of underrepresented minority PhD students and postdoctoral fellows is enhanced by increasing levels of self-efficacy over time. The research looked to see if STEM identity and self-efficacy predicts STEM success, degree persistence and graduation and career outcomes among underrepresented minority STEM PhD students and postdoctoral trainees.  Key outcomes from the FRAME project include:    Doubling the number of underrepresented minority US citizens who are postdoctoral trainees at alliance institutions, from the current baseline of 10 to a total of 20. This was accomplished through a combination of increased recruitment efforts to identify underrepresented minority postdoctoral candidates alongside the provision of fellowship supplements to convert candidates into postdoctoral trainees.   Establishing a postdoctoral fellow training regimen for underrepresented minority US citizens that combines pedagogical and professional competencies. This formal training regimen was developed so participants would experience a structured training program with greater oversight to increase satisfaction and in turn, research productivity   Providing targeted support and intensive training for underrepresented minority STEM PhD participants to achieve a 100% graduation rate. This was accomplished through engaging PhD participants in a comprehensive set of professional development workshops aimed at increasing participant?s sense of STEM identity and Self-efficacy. PhD participants were also given the opportunity to compete for grants to develop new research collaborations and directions.   Discovering that graduate STEM scholars, particularly those from underrepresented groups, who perceived their department faculty, advisors, and peers to hold a fixed mindset report a lower sense of STEM identity and STEM self-efficacy.    Intellectual Merit AGEP-T FRAME focused on both growing the number of URM PhD scholars produced in STEM, and on improving the quality of early career training and interaction opportunities that allowed URM graduate and postdoctoral scholars to succeed in the competitive professional environment of research intensive institutions. Highly productive, intellectually stimulating training environments, combined with professional development and career readiness activities, were developed and administered to ensure a competitive advantage for underrepresented minority STEM PhD scholars as they sought positions at research intensive institutions.  The AGEP-T FRAME social science research project tested whether, in the areas of STEM identity and self-efficacy, underrepresented minorities differ from non-underrepresented minority STEM graduate students. It also examined and whether participation in AGEP-T programmatic activities contributed to positive changes in those variables. The project found that underrepresented minority graduate and postdoctoral scholars showed lower levels of STEM identity and efficacy than their majority peers but that, as predicted, participation in AGEP-T activities led to significant increases in both general self-efficacy and STEM-specific self-efficacy.
