<AbstractNarration>Mobile computing increasingly pervades our lives in forms ranging from smartphones, GPS navigators, and entertainment devices to the many subsystems embedded in our automobiles, trains, and airplanes. The power and security requirements for these platforms present unique challenges.  This International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project will enable the Principal Investigator and  Florida State University (FSU)students and faculty to visit Chalmers University of Technology (CTH) to conduct computer research on efficient and secure mobile systems. Over the three years of this project, 15 U.S. graduate students (in cohorts of five) will visit CTH, in Gothenburg, Sweden, for a period of 10 weeks each summer. While in residence, the U.S. students will work closely with CTH faculty and students on joint projects.  The combined expertise of the FSU and CTH researchers uniquely qualifies this team to provide IRES student participants with a rewarding and productive research experience, not only during their time abroad, but in the context of the broader, ongoing international faculty collaborations to which their summer projects contribute.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Energy and security have become key design constraints for mobile computing devices, and the intellectual merit of this IRES project lies in the cooperative efforts to develop novel approaches to addressing these constraints. The US-Swedish IRES will do this in part through projects that focus on the design and analysis of combined compiler, architecture, and hardware techniques for making mobile computer processors more energy efficient. Furthermore, the objectives include contributing to future support of secure file deletion by developing new methods to track copies of keys throughout a system.  Both technical and societal broader impacts are expected.  If successful, results may lead to future technology that creates more efficient and secure systems to support ubiquitous computing which continues to pervade our daily lives. Not only will participating FSU students increase their research knowledge; they also will become more globally engaged and better prepared to work in a diverse and expanding international computer and information science research environment. Reciprocally, the CTH partners intend to send Swedish students to FSU for similar, well-planned cooperative research visits.  Overall, this balanced approach is expected to reinforce and extend the early career international research experience for FSU students by providing a valuable international cultural and research experience to U.S. students who do not have the opportunity to visit Sweden as IRES participants.</AbstractNarration>
