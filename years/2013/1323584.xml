<AbstractNarration>Making Connections, a three-year design-based research study conducted by the Science Museum of Minnesota in partnership with Twin Cities' communities, is developing and studying new ways to engage a broader audience in meaningful Maker experiences. This study draws and builds on existing theoretical frameworks to examine how community engagement techniques can be used to co-design and implement culturally-relevant marketing, activities, and events focused on Making that attract families from underrepresented audiences and ultimately engage them in meaningful informal STEM learning. The research is being done in three phases: Sharing and Listening - co-design with targeted communities; Making Activities Design and Implementation; Final Analysis, Synthesis and Dissemination. The project is also exploring new approaches in museums? cross-institutional practices that can strengthen the quality of their community-engagement. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, Making - a do-it-yourself, grassroots approach to designing and constructing real things through creativity, problem-solving, and tool use - has received increasing attention as a fruitful vehicle for introducing young people to the excitement of science and engineering and to career skills in these fields. Maker Faires attract hundreds and thousands of people to engage in Making activities every year, and the popularity of these events, as well as the number of museums and libraries that are beginning to provide opportunities for the public to regularly engage in these types of activities, are skyrocketing. However, Maker programs tend to draw audiences that are predominantly white, middle class, male, well educated, and strongly interested in science, despite the fact that the practices of Making  are as common in more diverse communities. Making Connections has the potential to transform how children begin to cultivate a lifelong interest in engineering at a young age, which may ultimately encourage more young people of color to pursue engineering careers in the future.</AbstractNarration>

Ten community members were recruited as project partners.

They recruited over a hundred families who came to the museum multiple times over the course of the project and participated in the research as infomants.  Working together with families and community advisors, we built new activities for Saturday events at the museum that were developed or inspired by what families valued about making. We also changed strategies within the museum for how we welcome and engage with families of color.  Over the course of the project, SMM's audience shifted from one that was proportionately whiter than our surrounding communities, to an audience that is generally representative of our surrounding communities, at least when we consider race and ethnicity. We consider this change to be due in part to the work of this project.  We have also observed and participated in conversations among researchers on making that increasingly acknowledge the role of multiple cultures in making practices, and that push the field to consider the inclusiveness of the more prominent forms of making currently offered.  Over the course of the project, we have shared results extensively with other museums, as well as with researchers in education, engineering education, and museums, through conferences, written reports, and person-to-person discussions.
