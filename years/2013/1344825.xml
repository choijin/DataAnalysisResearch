<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to develop a fully-passive intra cranial sensing system. This novel electronic brain-machine interface utilizes an implantable miniaturized neurosensor based on microwave back-scattering, a miniature textile antenna, and RF circuits on flexible polymer substrate. It has the unique properties of only minor heating, thus, minimizing injury and trauma to the brain, eliminating the need for wires through the cranium, and preserving natural lifestyle and comfort. The acquired neurosignals are collected by a self-powered wearable body area network for continuous real-time monitoring and subsequent physiological interpretation. The project includes physiological studies of the acquired brain signals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While conceived initially as a tool for long-term monitoring of brain signals, this sensing technology has a very wide range of potential applications in health, including control of prosthetics and early detection of seizures. Overcoming the challenges in safety and long-term reliability presented by conventional neurosensor technology could transform healthcare for people suffering from severe chronic neurological disorders. Results of the physiological studies are disseminated through a data repository for understanding brain disorders. Research is integrated with education through several activities, including hands-on experience for students in this new area, summer camps, and a variety of outreach activities to attract women and minorities in engineering.</AbstractNarration>
