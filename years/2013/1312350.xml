<AbstractNarration>The goal of this proposal is to provide a comprehensive catalog of nearby young stellar objects fully accessible to the astronomical community.  At present, data regarding the approximately 10,000 - 30,000 young stellar objects within ~800pc of the Sun are scattered throughout various archives and the published literature.  These include stars in young clusters, associations, and molecular clouds, with photometric/spectroscopic data in one or more of the following wavelengths:  x-ray, optical, near-infrared, mid-infrared, and sub-millimeter/millimeter.  In addition, derived quantities such as stellar parameters, angular momentum indicators, activity measures, circumstellar disk diagnostics, etc. are also available through various resources. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide targeted and flexible access to basic data products, as well as higher level data products that are relevant to young stars through a relational database populated with data from all known or suspected members of the population.  The database will also have broad educational value useful to a wide spectrum of users from teachers in the classroom to experienced scientific researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ As data availability grows in the field of astronomy and astrophysics, so too does the challenge in collating important information on specific targets of interest that is relevant for new studies.  We have built, partially populated, and made generally available, a database of young stars -- those less than about 10 million years old -- that are nearby the Sun -- located within a few hundred light years.    The database is fully searchable by criteria on the properties of the stars, or their surrounding proto-planetary disks.  It can produce plots and figures, as well as fully referenced data for download and more sophisticated analysis by a user.  An example query might be a search for all stars in the Upper Scorpius region with measured rotation periods and projected rotational velocities, in order to calculate the projected radii and determine whether their distribution is consistent with the radii inferred from luminosities and temperatures via the HR diagram.  The true radius spread of stars at a common age is a new way of probing the age distributions in young clusters.  Another query might be to search for all stars younger than a given age, closer than a certain distance, and brighter than a certain magnitude limit - in order to optimize direct imaging searches for young planets.  In addition to its significantly broad scientific impact, our young stars database -- the "corral" -- has broad educational value. It could be used by those in advanced undergraduate or graduate classrooms to learn the vocabulary of young stars science as well as the relevant metrics.  A primary use will be for research students as a tool to generate novel research projects.            Last Modified: 10/10/2017       Submitted by: Lynne A Hillenbrand]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
