<AbstractNarration>The nature of Dark matter is one of the most compelling mysteries in fundamental science today.  While there is convincing evidence that Dark Matter pervades the Universe, it has not been detected directly and its nature remains unknown.  One possibility is that dark matter is composed of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs).  The Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment is a highly sensitive two-phase (liquid/gas) xenon experiment designed to detect WIMPs.  At a WIMP mass of 100 GeV, LUX will be the most sensitive operating experiment.  This award will support the group at Yale University.  This group is responsible for several crucial subsystems, including the xenon purification and gas handling system, the 100 kilovolt cathode high voltage delivery system, the xenon recovery system, and radioactive sources and source manipulators for detector calibration.  The Yale group has also developed a method of calibrating liquid xenon detectors using metastable krypton atoms dissolved in the liquid xenon, and has performed a new measurement of the scintillation efficiency and charge yield for nuclear recoils.  The Yale group is highly engaged in LUX data processing and analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Technology developments related to liquid xenon can be used in an increasing number of experiments worldwide that use noble liquids as detection materials. These projects will result in technical training in radiation detection, cryogenics, and gas purification for graduate and undergraduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The nature of dark matter is one of the most profound questions being pursued today, and goes to the heart of our existence and the fundamental makeup of the universe. The direct detection of such a particle through its interactions in a terrestrial particle detector would have a profound impact on cosmology and fundamental interactions, while also giving rise to a new type of observational astrophysics. A very successful method for searching for such interactions is the  liquid xenon time projection chamber technology. This uses readout of primary and secondary scintillation signals for particle identification, together with 3-D position reconstruction to exploit the self-shielding of the liquid xenon, removal of surface artifacts, and calibration of position-dependent response functions.  The Large Underground Xenon (LUX) experiment is one of the more recently operated two-phase Xe dark-matter detectors, and has achieved world-leading sensitivity for WIMP masses above 4 GeV/c2.  The Yale LUX group designed and built a large fraction of the detector systems, including the Xe gas purification system, LXe level measurement electronics, the Xe automatic recovery system, and cathode HV systems, as well as fast neutron source, gamma ray source, and 83mKr gas source calibration systems. Over the operation of LUX, the Yale group was responsible for these systems and often travelled to SURF for system maintenance and on-site shifts. As hardware responsibilities became less time-consuming, the Yale group devoted substantially more effort to LUX analysis, playing a central role in both calibrations and WIMP search analysis. The Yale group played a central and successful role on  LUX analyses,  including the main WIMP search, analyses on monoenergetic  calibrations,  monoenergetic electron recoil signals, and searches for dark matter  interactions under  the effective field theory formulation.  After successful low-background operation, on September 28, 2016 LUX was removed from its water tank shielding at the 4850? level of the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF). The final LUX search for spin-independent dark matter interactions is complete, setting a cross-section upper limit of 1.1 x 10-46 cm2 for a 50 GeV/c2 Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP).  However, the LUX data set  is very rich and many other areas of data analysis will continue for the  next few years.  Development of technology related to liquid xenon will find use in the increasing number of experiments worldwide using noble liquids as detection materials.  The LUX project also resulted in technical training in radiation detection, cryogenics, and gas purification for graduate and undergraduate students. Liquid xenon has practical applications to gamma ray imaging for astrophysics, Homeland Security, and medical imaging.
