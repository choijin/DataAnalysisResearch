<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, J. Fraser Stoddart of Northwestern University will develop the chemistry of artificial molecular machines (AMMs) that (1) are capable of moving away from thermal equilibrium under the influence of a stimulus and (2) can perform work. Initial investigations will focus on devising a prototypical supramolecular system that can consume fuel, resulting in the relative unidirectional motion of its constituent parts. Some of the energy output of such a system may be captured by developing a way to trap the components in a high energy state. The approach to this objective involves capturing a ring component around a molecular thread and then using the stimulus to move the ring along the thread. By embedding such a "molecular pump" into a membrane, an artificial transmembrane ion pump potentially could be developed, which would perform a function reminiscent of the cellular membrane transport of nature's molecular machines. The broader impacts involve giving the project participants an opportunity to work on highly interdisciplinary research that enables the pursuit of grand scientific challenges. Undergraduate students will benefit from exposure to the interdisciplinary science under the tutelage of experienced researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research aims to produce molecular scale systems that can perform work on their surroundings, or rather, "artificial molecular machines."  Outside of biological systems, which can perform very sophisticated functions, there are presently few examples of such molecular machinery.  This project will increase our knowledge about how to design complex molecules that can use chemical energy to perform useful functions.  Such research holds the key to devising new types of molecules that can behave like muscle fibers or enzymes, addressable nanomaterials, nanorobots, and possibly more.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching objective of this research program was to design and synthesize non-equilibrium systems, all the way from small molecules to larger polymers and up to vesicles that mimic cell membranes. We have realized our initial goal of chemically synthesizing a ?molecular pump? capable of threading nanoscale rings onto a rod-like carbon-based segment in a repetitive fashion. This system can be said to operate away from equilibrium because the dynamics of the rod and rings interacting with one another allows for an energy input to ?pump? one component (ring) over a molecular ?speed bump? (slight barrier) onto another component (rod), thereby resulting in a higher overall energy state. This energy state can be compared to a higher point on a roller coaster at an amusement park.   The success of our fundamental research program represents an important step towards the longer-term goal of harnessing an energy input, such as light or a chemical stimulus, to perform repetitive work at the molecular level. Our results have implications for molecular electronics and switching devices ON and OFF. It is widely recognized that molecular nanotechnology has tremendous social and economic importance for all industrialized nations. Future applications of nanotechnology will help reduce demand for materials, accelerate and improve drug discovery, reduce power requirements, facilitate recycling, reduce life-cycle costs and increase miniaturization.
