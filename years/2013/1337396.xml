<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemistry Major Research Instrumentation Program, Professor Warren De Bruyn from Chapman University and colleague Catherine Clark will acquire a benchtop spectrofluorometer with a built-in UV-VIS spectrophotometer which makes simultaneous fluorescence and absorbance measurements. The proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as studies of rates and mechanisms of photochemically driven processes and carbon cycling related to chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in marsh, coastal and marine waters, e.g., processing and optical properties of CDOM in surface and pore waters in salt marshes, photochemical production of hydrogen peroxide in coastal waters and impacts on microbial water quality, production and decomposition of volatile organic carbon gases like acetone and photolysis of polyaromatic hydrocarbons in urban runoff.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A spectrofluorometer allows fluorescence parameters. In general, fluorescence is a form of luminescence in which light is emitted by a substance that has absorbed light or other electromagnetic radiation. Often the light that is emitted has a longer wavelength and thus less energy than the absorbed radiation. This phenomenon has many useful applications in chemical sensors, fluorescence labeling, dyes and biological detectors.  This instrument will be used for research and also in educational activities.</AbstractNarration>

Given their unique landscape position in transitional zones, salt marshes are key transformers of carbon as it moves between adjacent terrestrial and marine ecosystems.  Salt marshes are known to sequester significant amounts of organic carbon in their soils as a result of an imbalance between carbon inputs from allochthonous sedimentation and net primary production by plants and algae and carbon outputs through microbial decomposition and carbon export.

Chemical degradation of acetone, acetaldehyde, and ethanol is negligible relative to biological degradation and in all cases biological degradation appears to follow first order kinetics.  Acetone, acetaldehyde and ethanol biological degradation rate constants ranged from 0.0002 min-1 to 0.0037, 0.0003 min-1 to 0.0054 min-1 , and 0.00043 min-1 to 0.021 min-1 respectively.  Ethanol is converted biologically to acetaldehyde with an effective branching ratio of 0.14&plusmn;0.063.  For all species degradation rate constants were correlated with bacteria levels and increased in the wet rainy season.
