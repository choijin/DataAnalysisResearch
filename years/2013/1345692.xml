<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project describes a structured polymer material with the potential to significantly increase density and capacity of optical data storage and its  translation to market solution, disrupting and opening new markets based on its low cost, portability, low latency, low energy consumption, and long lifetime. The innovation is a multilayer film, fabricated in a continuous roll-to-roll co-extrusion process to produce hundreds of meters of material that can be cut and assembled in to common disc format.   The scope of work in this proposal complements significant scientific progress that has already been made to translate the innovation into commercially viable product.   The proposal outlines detailed examination of the film uniformity, stability and longevity as well as optimization of the writing process, and creation of disc prototypes for characterization and customer evaluation.  We anticipate making technical breakthroughs that show outstanding lifetime and storage capacity in a first-generation device.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project addresses the need for inexpensive, long-lasting archival data storage is increasing exponentially in the ?Big Data? age. Magnetic tape has been a widely used archival medium due to its low energy usage and large capacity, but suffers from limited lifetime, high cost, and slow access speeds. Magnetic hard drives, while fast and high capacity, are considerably more expensive, consume large amounts of energy, and still suffer from limited lifetime. A one terabyte (1TB) optical disc would be a compelling solution, combining low cost with high density, long life, and low energy consumption, and would disruptive to the archival storage market.   The fast access time of optical data storage relative to magnetic tape could open new markets by bringing passive archiving into nearline access. Applications in healthcare, security, personal data storage, and media distribution suggest a considerably larger potential. This innovation also enables a reduction in energy usage, and can be the key to unlock increasingly important green storage technologies as data generation continues to grow.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The market for digital data storage is growing by 20% year over year and is unable to keep up with the production of data.  Current solutions for archival data storage consume too much energy, are too short-lived and too expensive.  Optical data storage is faster than magnetic tape and longer-lived than any magnetic media, but the low capacity per disc makes it much too expensive per gigabyte and too inconvenient to use.  The Folio Photonics product is a high capacity multilayer optical disc fabricated from a multilayer co-extruded polymer film for applications in disc library enterprise data storage systems.  These discs are partnered with optical drives for nearline and archival storage and will be incorporated into complete enterprise data storage appliances offered by the companyÆs customers.   The low-cost, co-extrusion process is highly scalable both in area and number of layers allowing up to dozens of layers and terabyte capacity on a single disc.  The data is written using a fluorescence bleaching process that is compatible with current Blu-rayTM  laser technology.   The focus of our SBIR programs is the parallel development of media and hardware.   As is appropriate in early development, tasks were set to clear key questions that address the feasibility of the technology and provide data to guide the development of our commercial product.  The main areas of research that were addressed in this project include the photophysics of writing, multilayer film uniformity, shelf life validation, and lamination methods for a disc product.  We also report on the demonstration of writing to 14 layers near the diffraction limit with low cross-talk using a commercial Blu-rayTM  optical pickup.  This breakthrough indicates a shorter path to commercialization and possible backward compatibility with Blu-rayTM  and earlier optical disc technology.              Our results indicate a green light for our technology. In all cases, technical feasibility was demonstrated and future directions were identified.  To summarize our findings:     Experiments on our multilayer polymer films indicate that high speed read and write operations will be feasible in our future products.  These operations will have timescales similar to current commercial devices.       We have identified a figure of merit for the performance of the active dye.  This will help to accelerate the development process as we consider new materials for the future generations of our product.  The threshold writing process imparts very little cross-talk when it is used in our many-layered discs as they are read many times.     We have demonstrated a high degree of regularity in the manufacturing process which we employ.  This serves as a proof of principle of our storage media and points to higher than expected data storage densities.     Shelf-life testing indicated that the photostability of our data storage material lasts over long time periods. Accelerate lifetime testing indicates that the dye is stable for decades under indoor environmental conditions, and this is consistent with our market for enterprise data storage.      Our exploration of assembly methods reveals that FolioÆs storage media can be laminated with low optical losses by using common film adhesives.  This opens widely used fabrication methods to produce our storage media.      Our work suggests that optics which are used in current commercial products are appropriate for use in our media readers.  This demonstration illuminates a simple path to drive development and poises us to begin seeking partnerships with drive manufacturers.      We determined that our multilayer films have a very low defect density.  This is consistent with a high capacity terabyte scale disc.  The defect density suggests that the reserved area for writing corrupted data should be similar to or smaller than that used in current commercial analogs of our device.      These fundamental questions being cleared, Folio stands poised t...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
