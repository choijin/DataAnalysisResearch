<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to demonstrate proof-of-concept for a new method that removes abundant proteins from human fluid samples.  If it is successful, the proposed method potentially could transform the search for and development of new protein biomarkers.  Identifying dilute protein biomarkers in human fluids is difficult.  There can be hundreds of thousands of unique proteins that can vary in concentration over 10 orders of magnitude.  The proposed method, comprising a general-purpose instrument and allied reagents, is intended to perform sample pretreatment steps to remove abundant proteins while retaining dilute proteins, and thereby compress the dynamic range of the sample.  It can be scaled from sample volumes used routinely today, to many orders of magnitude larger, which is important to uncover dilute protein biomarkers.   Finally, the method concentrates and purifies proteins as a front end to prepare samples for the traditional methods used to discover new biomarkers: 2D gel electrophoresis (Difference Gel Electrophoresis) and bottom-up proteomics methods.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to increase the successful use of protein diagnostics in personalized medicine, which is assuming a major role in drug development, targeting and deployment.  The potential power of proteomics is diluted by the complexity of human fluid samples.  Once effective pretreatment methods are developed that remove abundant proteins selectively, one can delve more deeply into the proteome to see the more dilute species which may be disease biomarkers.  This has the potential to increase substantially the quality of proteomics data upon biomarker discovery data rely.  In turn, this will help to speed new pharmaceuticals to the market, target proper clinical populations, and help to monitor disease progression.  These all may have a profound effect on personalized medicine and public health.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF Phase I SBIR award sought to develop new methods to simplify the proteomics of complex human fluid samples useful for de novo discovery of new potential biomarkers.  It is our contention that the slowing pace of protein biomarker commercialization arises largely because of an insufficient pool of biomarker candidates.  We sought to exand that pool, so that further targeted methods could be used to create new protein diagnostic panels that could be used for disease diagnosis, patient stratification and companion diagnostics.     We developed two different chemical methods to delve deeper into the proteome.  Key to both was a reduction of protein-protein interactions that often compromise the performance of state-of-the-art methods.  We have compared the ones we have developed to two: Agilent's Top 14 MARS column, and Bio-Rad's Proteominer beads.  Analysis of unique proteins was performed both by Difference Gel Electrophoresis and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.     While the two SOTA methods identify more unique protein species than the methods we developed, our methods skew the molecular weight distribution heavily to peptides and small proteins.  Many believe that this potentially is a rich vein that can be mined for new potential biomarkers, owing to the importance of enzymatic activity on proteins altered by a change in regulation or type by disease pathways.  It appears that the MARS and Proteominer columns and the methods we developed are complementary, and may each find a useful role in the discovery of potential new biomarkers.
