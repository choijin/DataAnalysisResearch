<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Award: DMS 1309228, Principal Investigator: Dennis Sullivan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One knows the algebra of differential forms up to an equivalence  relation from algebraic topology contains much more information  than the usual cohomology. Define the deRham coHomotopy to  be the cohomology of the linearized deRham complex defined as  follows: first construct a resolution of the deRham algebra (A,d).  This is a differential algebra map of a free differential graded   commutative algebra (T,d) to the deRham algebra (A,d)   inducing a bijection on cohomology.The  linearized complex  is that induced on the generators [or indecomposables] of T by its  differential. This deRham Cohomotopy can be related to ordinary  homotopy for simply connected spaces and to algebraic K theory  of associative algebras using spaces with contractible universal  covers. The  concrete proof that this recipe is meaningful is the key  non-trivial point of  deRham Topology and to the applications  of this proposal. It is based on developing  explicitly the nonlinear  notion of homotopy between maps of differential algebras. One obtains  an illuminated picture of algebraic structures and maps between them  that closely resembles that of maps between cell complexes and  fibrations in usual topology. Thus one may analyze the theory of  algebraic objects defined by any number of multilinear operations with  j inputs and k outputs for j and k positive.In one envisaged set of  applications mathematical models in geometry and analysis that  involve infinitely many degrees of freedom and nonlinear structures,  finite dimensional approximating models  are constructed with  coherent mappings between the different levels of approximations.  The Hodge star operator [which associates to a linear subspace its  orthogonal complement] is not immediately amenable to this method. Thus the proposal also focuses on several  algebraic structures like  string theories and geometric structures like singularities in open and  closed strings particular to manifolds in order to finesse the  Hodge Star difficulty.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some questions are linear problems. The quantitative answer depends  linearly on the data of the  problem. There are good techniques for these  problems. Nonlinear problems like the mathematical  models of ocean currents, flows of oil in a reservoir  and the weather  are   much more difficult to  get a grip on mathematically and computationally. The proposal claims that a technique of nonlinear topology holds some  promise to give a new  technique for treating quite general nonlinear  mathematical models of physical processes. The technique will be easy  to apply by offering finite models approximating nonlinear problems. The  likelihood these models will fit with reality and have predictive value is  enhanced because their derivation is based on the underlying  mathematical structure of the nonlinearities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ From a  user's point of view the project failed.  The idea to create practical algorithms for non linear problems like flluid motion or more general PDEs which are related at different scales by "appropriate correspondences" was not realized.  There are two difficulties that were not resolve in time to get a testable proposal.  The first difficulty was how to connect the abstract theory being developed with actual data like weather to which the machinery would be applied.  The second was in the abstract theory itself if the concerned phenomenom depended on a background geometry.  In the latest stage an answer to the first difficulty was conceived via an indirect connection between theory and actual data arose in  the Ph.D. thesis [2017] of Nissim Ranade as part of the project.  It connected cumulants to the potential data to the components of the "appropriate correspondences between scales" for problems not requiring background geometries.  The second difficulty was also treated abstractly and in the Ph.D. thesis [2016] of another student who left the project for personal reason and so the idea was not developed as far towards application as was anticipated.  The concepts in these two works are very interesting and precise mathematically and I am thinking resolution is possible in the near future leading to a testable proposal with a positive chance of success.
