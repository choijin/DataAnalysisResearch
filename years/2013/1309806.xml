<AbstractNarration>With support from the Division of Chemistry - Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program, David Hage from the Department of Chemistry and Tino Hofmann from the Department of Electrical Engineering and their students at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln will develop instrumentation for label-free and rapid detection in ultrathin-layer imaging chromatography by using highly-oriented 3D nanostructure ultrathin-layer supports in combination with transmission birefringence imaging detection schemes. This approach, which is based on ellipsometric measurements, will use the detection of spatial and time-resolved microscopic images of linear birefringence variations in nanoengineered supports upon the interactions of these supports with analytes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chromatography methods analyze mixtures by separating them into their components.  Ultrathin-layer liquid chromatography (UTLC) methods separate components using their interactions with very thin, specially engineered (nanostructured) films.  Often these methods require that the mixture components be labeled or tagged so that they can be detected.  This work is expected to reduce the limit of detection of UTLC by two orders of magnitude when compared to current state-of-the-art label-free UTLC systems; this will be a groundbreaking advancement in this technology. The application of this separation and imaging system, which will have essentially universal applicability to small chemical targets, will benefit chemical analysis in many fields, including biochemical, environmental, and pharmaceutical testing. In addition to the significant advantages of the new measurement scheme compared to current UTLC systems, the increased sensitivity to minute amounts of chemicals that are adsorbed to nanostructured surfaces will also provide crucial information about the separation and flow-based properties of the nanostructured surfaces.   This project provides a unique opportunity for students to participate in the development of new instrumentation and interdisciplinary research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The chemical separation method of planar chromatography, in which separations are carried out across a plane or two-dimensional surface, is widely used in clinical, biochemical, environmental and pharmaceutical testing. Recent advances in this field have used nanomaterials as supports, giving a new method known as ultrathin-layer chromatography (UTLC).  This project explored the development and use of instrumentation that could be used in a novel universal and label-free method for detecting low levels of small chemicals in UTLC. This instrumentation was also considered for use in other applications that can employ nanomaterial-based supports, such as flow-based sensors or devices for imaging chemical or biological systems. This research made use of supports that contained ultrathin layers of highly-oriented and three-dimensional nanostructures that could both bind to chemicals and be used to provide a signal for detecting these chemicals. This approach to detection was based on a specialized form of ellipsometry and allowed images to be obtained with respect to both the location of chemicals on a support?s surface and with respect to time, such as could be used to follow the separation of chemicals by UTLC.  The instrumentation and methods that were created in this project are innovative in that they represent a new label-free approach to chemical detection and imaging that can be applied to a broad range of small chemicals. The instrumentation and the underlying detection principles that were developed and explored in this project have also lead to a greater range of options that can be used for chemical detection in small-scale separation methods such as UTLC.  The experience that has been acquired in making the nanomaterial-based supports for this work has provided crucial information about the properties and behavior of these supports when they are used in these applications.  This work has also added to the base of knowledge and the range of mathematical, engineering and chemical tools that are available for working with and using such detection schemes and separation methods.  The small-scale imaging and separation methods that were developed in this work have the potential to impact a broad range of areas which can or may make use of imaging/rapid separations for various samples.  Examples could include the use of these methods in environmental science to measure or screen for chemicals or contaminants in water; the analysis of biological compounds in food or in biochemical research samples; and methods for screening forensic samples for illicit drugs or explosive residues.   This project has also had a direct and broad impact on human resource development through the undergraduate and graduate students who were mentored and conducted research under this project.  A unique feature of this work has been its combined training of students in chemical analysis and chemical separations methods with work in nanomaterials and electrical engineering as related to the design of instruments for chemical detection and imaging.   Outreach efforts involving workshops for high school students and middle school students were also held as part of this effort to train these students in the basics of nanomaterials and chemical analysis or separation methods. Their involvement in these workshops and training experiences should serve all of these students well in fulfilling national areas of need for future scientists and professionals in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
