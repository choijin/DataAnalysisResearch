<AbstractNarration>Dr. Kate Allstadt has been awarded an NSF Earth Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a research and outreach plan at the U.S. Geological Survey Cascades Volcano Observatory.  This study will work towards developing new techniques and improving existing near real-time systems to detect, locate, and estimate the volume and speed of mass movements such as landslides and lahars, focusing on well-instrumented and prodigious producers of these events: the Cascade and Alaskan volcanoes. Mass wasting events such as rockslides, debris avalanches, ice avalanches, and particularly lahars/debris flows pose significant hazards at stratovolcanoes worldwide. However, unlike for eruptive activity, there is very little infrastructure in place to detect and analyze mass wasting events in near real-time, despite the hazard they pose and the availability of real-time seismic data. The aim of this work is to fill this gap by advancing our understanding of the physics of seismic wave generation by mass movements and the best techniques for characterizing them by these waves. If events can be detected quickly and reliably, there is time to warn downstream populations and reduce losses. Furthermore, to foster an enthusiasm and understanding of natural hazards and our dynamic planet in the next generation, the outreach component of this project consists of a summer program developed in collaboration with the Mount St. Helens Institute aimed at middle school girls, an age where interest in science typically drops. The summer program will combine classroom and field activities at the volcano to demonstrate how seismology and geophysics are used to detect earthquakes and landslides, monitor volcanoes, and see inside the earth - and how this is done in their backyard: the Cascade volcanoes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will combine analysis of seismic recordings of historical mass movements with 3D numerical modeling of future events and controlled laboratory experiments at the U.S. Geological Survey debris flume. This combination of empirical, numerical and field experiments will provide an ideal testing ground for improving our understanding of the physics of how mass movements of a wide range of sizes generate seismic waves and for improving existing methods and developing new detection and characterization techniques. The ultimate goal is to apply the improved physical understanding and techniques developed in this research to 1) work towards improving and expanding near real-time systems using existing monitoring networks and investigate strategic upgrades where existing networks are found insufficient, and 2) characterize past and present landsliding activity at Cascade and Alaskan volcanoes that can lead to a better understanding of the surficial dynamics of these hazardous environments.</AbstractNarration>

Cascades Volcano Observatory in Vancouver, WA under this award. The primary scientific goal was to work towards developing new techniques and improving existing near real-time methods of detecting, locating, and characterizing mass movements such as landslides and debris flows/lahars using seismic methods. Allstadt started on this goal over the ten months of the fellowship by compiling a database of historical landslide and debris flow events that were well-recorded by seismic instruments as well as accompanying information about each event to use as a basis for developing and testing new techniques. This diverse database allows for a characterization of the range of general characteristics of the seismic signals of different types of mass movements. A set of open-source codes was developed to interact with this database as well as process and analyze the data efficiently to extract information about the events in the database. These newly developed methods make complicated analyses of seismic signals much simpler by automating many tedious processing steps and were used to analyze the seismic signals from the recent West Salt Creek landslide in Colorado to estimate the sequence of events, to extract timing, and to estimate velocities for inclusion in a multidisciplinary paper on this event. Another ongoing effort includes working with collaborators to adapt numerical landslide modeling codes to output an estimate of the forces the landslide exerted on the earth over time which can be used to estimate the seismic waves generated by a modeled event. One use of this is to be able to model large landslide events in places of concern (e.g. Mount Rainier) to determine if we can detect and characterize such events rapidly enough with existing networks, and if not, to determine what kind of instrumentation would be required. An ongoing effort stemming from this award is a set of large-scale experiments at the U.S.G.S debris flume that allows us to simulate debris flows in a controlled environment. In this case, we will seismically instrument these controlled debris flows with a goal of better understanding the physics of how debris flows generate seismic waves and to determine what information we can get out of the seismic waves and what we cannot.
