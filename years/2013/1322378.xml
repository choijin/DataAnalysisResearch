<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund new and replacement instrumentation on the R/V Atlantic Explorer, a 168 foot general purpose research vessel operated by Bermuda Institute of Ocean Science (BIOS) as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; The R/V Atlantic Explorer is a general-purpose research ship owned and operated by the&lt;br/&gt;Bermuda Institute of Ocean Sciences (BIOS). BIOS is a U.S. 501 (c) 3 and 509 (a) not-for profit research and educational institution incorporated in the state of New York, and geographically located on the island of Bermuda. The mission of the ship is to support funded science research. The RV Atlantic Explorer has 149 days funded in 2013, all of which are for NSF. With this proposal, BIOS provides technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following Oceanographic Instrumentation:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; Fume Hood  $20,075&lt;br/&gt; Transmissometer $7,600&lt;br/&gt; Van Veen Grab $5,525&lt;br/&gt;  $33,200&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two of the Proposal Guidelines. They provide infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

This package of instruments is the workhorse of oceanographic research. The CTD instrument package is regularly lowered to the bottom of the ocean, providing real-time physical, chemical, biological, and optical properties of the subsea environment to researchers aboard the vessel. This data and real-time interaction allows the researchers to visualize and quantify the dynamics of the ocean and to precisely extract sea-water samples from specific depths of interest. The transmissometer is a critical component which provides calibrated information about the optical properties of the water, including turbidity and light transmissivity. The WetLabs Deep C-Star Transmissometer purchased through this award has a depth rating of 6,000m below the ocean&rsquo;s surface, which means it can remain on the CTD package and provide this critical data on each deployment. This particular transmissometer entered into service in July 2013 and has performed extremely well in this role during the previous 3 years. This robust transmissometer works half the year, traversing the depths of the ocean, while sharing the duty with another transmissometer.
