<AbstractNarration>The investigators study multivariate methods for assessing the quality and ensuring the reliability of a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) experiment.  This work is strongly motivated by research in Bayesian methods for functional neuroimaging experiments, but will be applicable in any MCMC simulation.  Usually, Markov chain output is used to estimate a vector of parameters that contains multiple mean and variance parameters along with quantiles.  A fundamental question is when to terminate such a simulation.  The investigators study sequential fixed-volume stopping rules that allow construction of confidence regions for estimating the target vector, which describe the reliability of the resulting estimates.  Using these methods requires that the Markov chain converges at a geometric rate, which in turn yields a limiting distribution for the Monte Carlo error with an associated covariance matrix.  Estimating this matrix forms a major component of the research-a long standing open question in MCMC output analysis.  The investigators improve on existing methods, which enable effective estimation in the case where the target vector is moderately large. Moreover, the investigators study several methods for handling the setting in truly high-dimensional settings, i.e. when there are many more parameters than iterations in the Markov chain.  The investigators also formally study the convergence rates of component-wise MCMC samplers often encountered in the functional neuroimaging settings.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complex probability models are commonly used to help gain understanding of phenomenon in a range of fields including science, engineering, medicine, education, and law.  An example that motivates the investigators work is that of applied cognitive scientists modeling brain activity.  Inference from such probability models is usually obtained from computational approximations.  For a widely used computational technique, the investigators study the convergence properties and develop formal stopping rules focusing on high-dimensional practically relevant settings.  The statistical methodology developed here will provide scientists with sophisticated output analysis techniques, leading to greater confidence and reliability for their computational results.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In statistics, Bayesian inference is an inferential method that utilizes Bayes' rule to update probability estimates as additional evidence is obtained.  Bayesian methods begin with existing 'prior' beliefs that are updated based on data to form 'posterior' beliefs.  These posterior beliefs take the form of probability distributions, which are used as the basis for inferential decisions.    Bayesian inference has proved extremely useful in a range of fields including science, engineering, medicine, education, and law.  Behind virtually all modern Bayesian analyses, there are complex computer simulations.  This research developed methodology and theoretically results for output analysis from such a simulation.  This work was strongly motivated by ongoing work developing Bayesian models and computational methods in modern high-dimensional experiments.  A significant contribution of this research was developing a framework for multivariate output analysis.  This is truly groundbreaking since the multivariate nature had largely been ignored in the literature. We also developed sequential stopping rules that theoretically justified ad-hoc rules routinely used by practitioners and developed software implementing our methods.  As a result, practitioners now have additional tools for assessing the quality and reliability of Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations.  The main interdisciplinary contribution developed a novel Bayesian model selection technique to compare multiple treatments with a control. A fully Bayesian approach was implemented to estimate the marginal inclusion probabilities that provide a direct measure of the difference between treatments and the control.  We demonstrated the proposed method on an experimental dataset from a longitudinal study of mouse lifespan and weight trajectories.
