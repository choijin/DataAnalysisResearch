<AbstractNarration>This action funds Kenneth Gene Yancey of Cornell University to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at The National University of Singapore in Singapore.  The project title is "Simultaneous Detection of Cancer and TB using DNA-based Nanobarcodes in a Portable Device for In-home Diagnostics." The host scientist is Dr. Jackie Ying.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Every year, the World Health Organization reports that 1 in 4 people in the United States will die of cancer and that one third of the world population has tuberculosis (TB). Early detection reduces the incidence and fatal potential of cancer and highly transmittable diseases like TB. To address this, we are developing tree-like DNA nanobarcodes which use a unique ratio of fluorescent tags to detect multiple disease simultaneously. Already these barcodes are demonstrating multiplexed attomole detection using the specificity of DNA hybridization and the sensitivity of fluorescence. In the course of this EAPSI project, this system is being improved by applying it to real DNA samples and integrating it in a microfluidic device for the detection of disease anywhere in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, this EAPSI project is not only potentially developing better methods for the DNA-based detection of new diseases, but also promoting outreach to students of all ages and disciplines. Several undergraduate students are involved with this project and results will be disseminate using a series of Youtube videos and apps designed to engage the community. The host location is ideal for accomplishing EAPSI's goal of fostering international exposure of U.S. graduate students due to the NUS' highly collaborative environment consisting of numerous academic, industrial and clinical collaborations.</AbstractNarration>

Every year, the World Health Organization reports that 1 in 4 people in the United States will die of cancer and that one third of the world population has tuberculosis (TB). By coupling LUOLABS' expertise in DNA based materials with the Institute of Bioengineering and NanotechnologyÃ†s (IBN) experience in drug delivery and diagnostics, we strove to do novel interdisciplinary research which reduces the incidence and fatal potential of diseases like tuberculosis. As a result, our objectives were to develop a point of care device enabling early detection and investigate several novel polymers for their antimicrobial activity. Additional goals of this project included the dissemination of results through conferences and publication, and promoting outreach by involving undergraduates and the IBN Youth Research Program in the project.  The specific objective for this project was to address diseases like tuberculosis (TB) by enabling earlier detection, or by creating more effective treatments. As a result, this project progressed in two directions which included the development of a point of care device enabling point of care detection of TB and the development of polymers exhibiting broad spectrum antimicrobial activity.  Intellectual merit Outcomes. In an effort to reduce the fatal potential of tuberculosis by detecting the diseases earlier, we integrated our novel "Nanobarcode" diagnostic system with a point of care device. Our goal was to demonstrate the detection of several different pathogens simultaneously in resource poor settings. To date, we have successfully conducted DNA-based detection of several pathogens and continue to improve the multiplexing capability of our sensor. This project has also generated a large amount of data on the broad spectrum antimicrobial activity of several novel polymers. Specifically, we have synthesized various polymers with different molecular weights and side chains in order to evaluate the effects on bacterial and fungal growth. The result was that the polymers exhibited inhibition of gram positive and negative bacteria as well as fungi at very low concentrations.

We also strove to have a broader impact by providing opportunities for professional development for not only the LUOLABS participant, but the rest of the research groups. In the course of this project, the participant was trained in many of the techniques used by the host lab through one on one training with group members and the host PI.

During this project, the visiting student also participated in the Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology's Youth Research Program (YRP). The goal of the YRP was to allow the participant to engage k-12 students and undergrads so that they could learn about exciting research as well as what it's like being a scientific researcher. By being able to ask questions and hear about new areas of research, it is hoped that these students will be more inclined to pursue science related careers in the future. Furthe...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
