<AbstractNarration>Joint use and development of facilities with international partners is desirable for all parties.  This award is to support researcher participation on a joint workshop between airborne scientist from the U.S. and Germany.    The award will provide support for up to nine university scientists to attend an international workshop to foster collaboration between scientist that utilize the U.S. High performance Instrumented Airborne Platform for Environmental Research (HIAPER) and that might potentially utilize the German High Altitude and Long Range Research Aircraft (HALO).  In addition to the university participants, the U.S. contingent will include relevant staff from the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).  There will be similar participants from the German research community.  The goals of this workshop are to:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Educate each group about planned and on-going research programs.&lt;br/&gt;2. Exchange information as to the procedures of each country for developing field projects and explore ways that each country&lt;br/&gt;            might be involve the partner country's research.&lt;br/&gt;3. For common instrumentation, explore ways to develop common formats, calibration procedures, mission flight planning tools and&lt;br/&gt;            data management procedures in order to develop common data products.  &lt;br/&gt;4. Discuss unique research instrumentation on the two platforms and discuss opportunities for sharing existing instrumentation and&lt;br/&gt;             developing new instrumentation that cans be shared across the two aircraft.&lt;br/&gt;5. Discuss developing joint research campaigns.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful outcomes from this workshop will include joint use/development of instrumentation and the potential for joint scientific projects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Scientists studying the earth must access large areas of the globe to collect samples or to take measurements.  Research directed at improving our ability to forecast severe weather events or research to understand the origin and fate of pollutants are two examples of research with these requirements.   These types of studies have a high potential for improving public health and safety.  Many students and faculty are involved in this data collection through national and international field expeditions.  Conducting this type of research in the atmosphere requires research aircraft with capabilities to sample over many altitudes and in remote parts of the world while carrying sophisticated instruments.   Ground-based measurements are also major components of field expeditions.    Among the national airborne capabilities of the US and Germany are two similar, highly-modified and instrumented facilities, the US National Science Foundation HIPAER aircraft, operated by the National Center for Atmospheric ResearchÃ†s Earth Observing Laboratory, and the German HALO aircraft, operated by the German Aerospace Center (DLR).    Two workshops were held to facilitate better coordination of joint field campaigns and to discuss the sharing of data and expertise in conducting these field expeditions.  In the first workshop scientists and research managers learned about the capabilities of the two airborne facilities and how the planning and scheduling of airborne field expeditions is accomplished.   Technical details, such as instrument performance were also discussed.   Methods to compare performance and data processing techniques, such as flights aimed at comparing data from the two platforms will be valuable additions to future expeditions.    A second workshop, the Next Practices Workshop, was held to bring both ground and airborne field expedition specialists together to share lessons learned and country-specific experiences from field expeditions in various parts of the world.   A major outcome of this workshop was an agreement by the participants that the efficiency and success of future expeditions will benefit from regular meetings of this type and from developing a forum where lessons learned from operating in various locations could be shared and updated regularly.   These activities are now being planned to follow-up the two workshops.            Last Modified: 07/02/2015       Submitted by: Jeffrey Stith]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
