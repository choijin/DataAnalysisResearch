<AbstractNarration>Multicore systems-on-a-chip have permeated every segment of the&lt;br/&gt;digital market, from servers and supercomputers, to desktops and smart&lt;br/&gt;phone/mobile devices.  Innovative applications continue to emerge that&lt;br/&gt;integrate user interactivity via mobile devices with the power of&lt;br/&gt;high-end computation and large-scale storage.  These applications tend&lt;br/&gt;to demonstrate dynamic and diverse execution behaviors, requiring&lt;br/&gt;close tracking in order to manage resource consumption.  Inherent&lt;br/&gt;application behavior variations and resource requirements, coupled&lt;br/&gt;with complex interactions due to contention for shared resources,&lt;br/&gt;present new challenges for efficient, dependable, and sustainable&lt;br/&gt;advances in computing and information technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop foundational system mechanisms to manage&lt;br/&gt;individual cores, memory, and power/energy consumption on&lt;br/&gt;multicore-based systems, and explore resource allocation policies that&lt;br/&gt;use these mechanisms.  A new online multicore power model will allow&lt;br/&gt;power and energy tracking at a fine-grain level, combining available&lt;br/&gt;hardware-based power measurements with event-based modeling and&lt;br/&gt;attribution of power for shared resources. Accuracy will be improved&lt;br/&gt;via coarse-grain measurement-triggered online model recalibration.  A&lt;br/&gt;new operating system mechanism, power containers, will be developed to&lt;br/&gt;allow application-defined boundaries for resource tracking, breaking&lt;br/&gt;from the traditional thread and process boundary resource tracking in&lt;br/&gt;state-of-the-art operating systems.  Further optimizations will be&lt;br/&gt;explored to lower the overhead of resource tracking, allowing online&lt;br/&gt;power accounting to scale to large core and resource counts.  Finally,&lt;br/&gt;new techniques will be developed to enable use of the power containers&lt;br/&gt;to control and isolate power usage in an application-defined manner.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will enhance the power protection, energy efficiency, and&lt;br/&gt;dependability of multicore-based computer systems.  The techniques&lt;br/&gt;developed can be broadly applied to emerging dynamic applications in&lt;br/&gt;data centers, desktops, and mobile devices.  In particular, power&lt;br/&gt;containers will identify and mitigate (either malicious or&lt;br/&gt;unintentional) power anomalies (execution that results in unusually&lt;br/&gt;high power consumption), in both high-end servers and multi-core and&lt;br/&gt;multi-accelerator smart phones.  The success of this project will&lt;br/&gt;contribute to the long-term sustainability of the world's fast&lt;br/&gt;evolving digital economy and society.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
