<AbstractNarration>Lattice polytopes and convex polytopes form a natural habitat for a major part of the contemporary combinatorics. The first research direction, proposed in this project, involves a radically new idea of using analogies with quantum probabilistic physics. It introduces a new topological context for normal lattice polytopes. The second direction develops essentially new techniques for studying general convex polytopes. It is based on advanced categorial and homological machinery. The first line of research aims at shedding new light and making substantial progress on several outstanding open problems, such as unimodular triangulations and covers, Caratheodory rank, higher syzygies of the corresponding toric rings. The new idea of attacking these challenges draws from a physical interpretation of special discrete point configurations. Concrete suggestions in this direction to the PI were made by theoretical physicists and further connections to the physical context will be paid special attention. The second direction focuses on the category of convex polytopes and their affine maps. The goal is to devise a universal technique, providing a general context for various recent important constructions and results in polytope theory. The categorial approach leads to very concrete problems in classical polytopal combinatorics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Combinatorics is the science of organizing, arranging and analyzing discrete data. An illustrative example is the set of integer points in a convex polygon in the plane or in a convex polytope in the space. Combinatorics of lattice polytopes studies such point configurations to encode important constructions in algebra, geometry, and topology, while combinatorial methods are well suited for related computations. The interaction of combinatorics and abstract mathematical techniques, central to the proposed research, over the last decades has resulted in a number of fundamental theorems in a variety of disciplines. The proposal explores some of the deepest problems in polytopal combinatorics, employs ideas from a variety of disciplines and unexpected links between them, and offers concrete strategies for attacking central open questions. Applications range from algebraic geometry (the science of solution sets to systems of multidimensional polynomial equations) to integer programming/computer science, probability theory, and physics. The progress would have been unimaginable without computer assisted investigation and experimentation, the increased importance of which is related to the demand for algorithmic understanding of discrete structures. Both proposed research lines incorporate a strong - sometimes, crucial - computational element. Developing and implementing related algorithms is an excellent possibility for involving beginning graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project evolves around two major research directions: (i) a novel approach to certain important point configurations in discrete convex geometry, based on analogies with quantum probabilistic methods and leading to a new continuous framework for the mentioned discrete objects, and (ii) use of advanced algebraic machinery in the study of classical convex shapes.  As concrete results: the first examples of certain extremal lattice polytopes were detected, indicating the limitations of the analogy between the continuum of convex shapes and the family of lattice polytopes; another space, defined in terms of rational cones, was introduced which provides a controlled passage from the discrete universe of normal lattice polytopes to the continuum of all convex shapes; an algebraic framework was developed for various classical polytopal constructions, leading to new geometric objects which encode important geometric relations; new examples of lattice polytopes were discovered, exhibiting extremal behavior from the perspective of combinatorial commutative algebra.  Among the new challenges this work has led to is an affine version of the classical Cauchy-Alexandrov rigidity theorem.  The obtained theorems and developed techniques represent a new kind of synthesis of methods and concepts from algebraic combinatorics and algebraic topology. The new synthesis of ideas from algebraic combinatorics and algebraic topology is expected to lead to new kind of higher dimensional zeta functions and, therefore, to yet unexplored connections to analytic number theory.  The results were presented on national and international conferences, seminars. Research papers were published. A seminar course was given at Tbilisi University (Republic of Georgia) for beginning graduate students. Several Masters theses were supervised at San Francisco State University. New video lectures were recorded for recruiting prospective graduate students to work on research topics in algebraic combinatorics.
