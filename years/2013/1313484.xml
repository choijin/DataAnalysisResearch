<AbstractNarration>This proposal will exploit a capability never before available in astronomy: a pair of robotic spectrographs on 2m telescopes specifically designed to study supernovae, capable of routinely observing targets within minutes to hours of discovery. The average lag between discovery and spectroscopic typing for supernovae is a week to 10 days, making their early behavior largely a mystery.  FLOYDS will reduce this lag by an order of magnitude and make some currently exotic probes of supernova progenitors routine.  The core effort is to (1) determine an immediate spectroscopic type and redshift of every new supernova discovered with a nondetection within the past week, and (2) obtain high signal-to-noise spectra of supernovae every few days for a subset of  the most interesting 150 (100 SNe Ia / 50 core-collapse) targets.  With this data we will statistically limit the progenitor channels of SNe Ia but studying unburned material, study shock breakout in core-collapse supernovae, and target faint-fast transients whose origin remains unknown.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The entire supernova community will benefit from this proposal, as all supernovae with a nondetection within a week will be typed within a day or two, and the redshifts and types will be announced immediately for public SNe.  This will allow earlier lightcurves, spectra, and follow-up from the X-ray to the IR.  Most spectra will be made public after one year, but some data will be made public immediately.  We will advertise the more photogenic supernovae to our schools program to encourage students to image the supernovae with the LCOGT network (providing real science data), and we will provide associated curricula and textbook materials through SpaceBook, the online textbook at LCOGT.net.   LCOGT software and telescope and instrument plans will be made public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This grant allowed us to obtain robotic lightcurves and spectra for more than 700 SNe.  It allowed us to start the Supernova Key Project, and Global Supernova Project, a worldwide collaboration of more than 200 astronomers.  We worked in partnership with other collaborations, such as PESSTO, the Palomar Transient Factory, and the successor iPTF, La Silla-Quest, the Distance Less Than 40 Megaparsecs search, and others. We also helped calibrate and improve the FLOYDS spectrographs at Las Cumbres Observatory.   100 peer reviewed publications have arisen from this grant, and more are planned for the future.  We published approximately 250 Astronomers' Telegrams, CBETs, and Transient Name Server classifications of more than 300 supernovae.   We also built the Supernova Exchange, which was instrumental in the development of the TOM Toolkit, an open source set of toolas allowing any user to set up a database connected to a web page, which provides communicaiton tools for astronomers, connects to pipelines, and allows users to submit observations to telescopes.    We started spin-off projects, such as SEATiDE, a search for Tidal Disruption Events, and an LCO search for counterparts of Gravitational Waves.   We were either first authors or contributed to a half dozen papers on early bumps in SN Ia lightcurves that help reveal their progenitor, as it may be evidence of the supernova being shocked by a companion star.   We found new classes of faint/fast supernovae and helped to characterize them. We found new types of transients, such as iPTF14hls, which has a multi-peaked lightcurve that lasts for years, and may be the first pulational pair instability supernova.   We increased the number of supernovae with progenitors measured from shock cooling by an order of magnitude.   We developed a new photometric pipeline for Las Cumbres Observatory called BANZAI. We oontributed heavily to a major breakthrough in core collapse supernovae, finding that most massive stars undergo significant, explosive mass loss in the months or years before they explode.   We studied stripped envelope supernovae and helped determine their progenitors and links to broad-lined SNe Ic. We significantly increased the number of superluminous supernovae with well observed lightcurves and spectra and helped determine their origins.  We helped inprove SNe Ia as standard candles.   PI Howell has given many public talks.  One of these involved doing science demonstrations in Saudi Arabia to engage students in science there.  Those had a majority female audience (some audiences were exclusively female).  The path for women to become scientists is particularly difficult in Saudi Arabia, so there was a real sense that this was making a difference in people's lives. Many print articles, radio programs, and TV programs featured the work from this grant. The people funded under this grant have given public talks on their research.  Howell also talks about his research on television series such as History's The Universe and History's The End, and created a YouTube show on Science Vs. Cinema. He also created a segment on the Physics of Angry Birds: the Movie for Amazon.         Last Modified: 02/16/2020       Submitted by: Dale A Howell]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
