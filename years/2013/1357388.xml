<AbstractNarration>University of California at Irvine doctoral student, Elizabeth Reddy, supervised by Dr. William M. Maurer, will undertake research in Mexico City on the relationship between science and public safety. Mexico City,  subject to frequent and  powerful earthquakes, is host to an innovative earthquake early alert system.  The Sistema Alerta Sismica (SAS) is comprised of a coordinated set of sensory devices and radio transmitters.  These are connected to alert machines in hospitals, schools, media outlets, and sometimes even private homes. Beginning in 1991, when SAS sensory devices register significant earth motion, they automatically send signals to alert machines in Mexico City that, in turn, issue a loud warning, sometimes up to sixty seconds before an earthquake reaches the city.  This warning, which depends on the relative speeds at which earthquakes and radio waves move, provides a valuable opportunity for people to take shelter.  However, the sensory network and its alert system are severely limited in scope.  Because the SAS can only provide alerts for certain earthquakes, it has been subject to a great deal of scientific and public debate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the process of developing the SAS, maintaining it, and advocating for it, engineers and scientists must mobilize ideas about the social world as well as their technical expertise.  This research is designed to explore how these groups navigate the rigorous and possibly conflicting demands of their expertise and imperatives of public safety: particularly how they engage  with concepts relating to risk, how they account for particularly Mexican social and technical factors, and ways that institutional imperatives and policy mandates affect their work. As they knit together cutting-edge geophysical and engineering knowledge with public risk management, they undertake work that they themselves describe as challenging in the extreme. To gather the data necessary for this investigation, the researcher utilizes archival resources, participant observation, surveys, social network analysis, interviews, and oral histories. Her findings will speak to production of social politics of seismic risk in Mexico, and has implications for ongoing research on science in the public sphere.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Elizabeth Reddy has completed research for her dissertation "Seismic Politics: an Ethnography of Mexican Earth and Expertise" supported by the NSF Dissertation Improvement Grant.  During her funding period, she spent twelve months in Mexico studying an earthquake early warning system, its developers, its critics, and its users. As an anthropologist of science and technology, Reddy was interested in understanding how experts develop both scientific knowledge and public risk mitigation policies in the face of ongoing, threatening, and still poorly-understood seismic phenomena.  Reddy accomplished the established goals of her NSF-supported research.  She used quantitative, qualitative, and archival methods to study history of the development, maintenance, and use of one earthquake risk management technology: a public earthquake early warning system capable of giving users over a minute of warning in advance of significant earth motion.  The Mexican technology was first of its kind and is the oldest in existance today. The data she collected on the scientific development of earthquake risk mitigation and a technology that is becoming increasingly popular around the world is the foundation for an argument she is constructing about the human and nonhuman factors which together come to define seismic landscapes.  While much of the existing social science scholarship on earthquakes focuses on disastrous effects they can have, in this research she has considered the development of sensory technology and policy around ongoing seismicity, much of which does not cause the kind of damage and injury that have marked Mexico CityÆs past, and loomed in its future. Nonetheless, this reserarch has revealed how expert work around ordinary ground motion has informed the ongoing development of earthquake early warning technology.   Reddy's research in Mexico, California, and earlier research at the University of California at Irvine form the basis of her dissertation (to be finished in Spring 2016), scientific articles (under review), talks, public outreach efforts, and course plans.
