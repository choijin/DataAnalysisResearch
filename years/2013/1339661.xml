<AbstractNarration>The NSF Division of Chemistry and Environmental Protection Agency support Professors Brian B. Laird, Raghunath V. Chaudhari, Bala Subramaniam, Ward H. Thompson and Jon A. Tunge of the University of Kansas for a collaborative effort on Networks for Sustainable Molecular Design and Synthesis.  One challenge facing the chemical industry is the development of sustainable manufacturing processes that eliminate the use of hazardous materials, minimize waste, conserve resources, and improve safety.  In this project, Professor Laird and his team of chemists and chemical engineers use an integrated approach to address this challenge.  This research effort uses molecular modeling, synthesis, reactor engineering, kinetic studies and life-cycle assessments to develop and optimize the design of industrial catalytic processes for minimal environmental impact. This framework is being applied to two examples of high-volume chemical processes. One is a safer, phosgene-free route to dimethyl carbonate, which is used to manufacture polycarbonates and polyurethanes. The other process is a cleaner, more efficient route from butadiene to adipic acid, a commodity chemical used to make nylon.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phosgene, although a common industrial chemical, is toxic and detrimental to the environment.  The development of green chemistry which bypasses toxic intermediates is an important goal.  The discoveries and methodologies developed for the chemicals studied here find broader applications for other major chemical processes.  In addition, the next generation of scientists and engineers are being trained to work in multidisciplinary teams and become skilled communicators. By translating project results into educational laboratory activities, which include high school students and/or college freshmen, a broad cross-section of the nascent workforce benefits.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project brought together expertise in computational chemistry, catalyst synthesis, and reaction engineering to create a new integrated design approach for new chemical catalysts. This paradigm revealed new ways to characterize and predict catalyst properties and behaviors that are not readily observable by traditional experimental methods alone. These discoveries bring us closer to new processes for chemical manufacturing that are both safer and less-polluting than currently practiced methods.
