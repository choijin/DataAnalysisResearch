<AbstractNarration>The main theme of the proposed research will be the linear and asymptotic stability of special solutions (waves) of a wide class of partial differential equations. In a series of recent works, the PI and collaborators  have characterized the linear stability of travelling and standing waves for second order in time equations and  systems.  Such results provide necessary information for the asymptotic stability of the same waves. The PI and collaborators will build on their previous work to show asymptotic stability of standing waves for the following models: the Klein-Gordon equation, the sine Gordon equation and the Dirac equation. A second goal of the proposal is to study the existence and stability of coherent structures, arising in  spatially discrete models. More concretely, the project will deal, among other things,  with Hertzian granular chains/crystals  and the discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project deals with nonlinear dispersive equations, which model wavelike behavior of important physical processes. Important class of problems under consideration include the propagation of light in optical waveguides, motion of quantum particles, the mechanics of fluids to mention a few. The overarching theme of the investigation will be the stability of coherent configuration - that is, if one is initially close to such coherent structure, does it stay close to it forever? The mathematical formulation of such problems, as well as their analysis and predictions about their long time behavior will greatly enhance our understanding of these and related processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Partial differential equations are mathematical tool that give  reliable  mathematical models that describe many phenomena in a variety of actual engineering applications, such as optics, fluid dynamics to mention a few.  The research objective in this proposal is to study the   solution solutions, which represent a single wave or  train of   waves traveling through the medium. Such objects are instrumental for predicting behavior and designing engineering devices for the wide range of physically unrelated phenomena, such as water wave dynamics, in particular, gigantic ocean waves, magnetization issues, propagation of light in optical fibers or in quantum mechanical dynamics. In particular, understanding the dynamics of these (and nearby) objects provides  important clues about the global dynamics/behavior of the system. In addition, a feedback mechansim of sorts applies, as singular behavior signals a breakdown of the model itself or some pathological behavior of the system, which are both important to understand.
