<AbstractNarration>The goals of this project are to estimate the ranges of plausible changes in radiatively-active species in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) in the zonal average, particularly water vapor, ozone, and volcanic aerosols, and conduct an initial analysis of the potential contributions of each to the radiative budget of this region using a line-by-line radiative transfer code embedded in a radiative-convective model. After consideration of zonally averaged changes, regional changes in radiatively active species in the TTL will also be explored, as preparation for a more detailed analysis of the implications of radiative forcing for the coupling of TTL thermal structure changes to tropical cyclone activity in all ocean basins. Understanding and being able to predict TTL temperature changes have the potential to improve predictions of climate change, as well as increase our ability to project changes in tropical cyclone activity. This project thus has substantial broader impacts for society.</AbstractNarration>

While interest has been mostly focused on the intensity and frequency of storms, we looked at trends in where these storms reach their peak intensity.

Much previous work has looked at how the temperature of tropical oceans affects the intensity of tropical cyclones. But these storms are giant heat engines, whose efficiency depends, among other things, on how low the temperature is at the top of the storm, where the heat extracted from the ocean is exported to the stormsÃ† environment. The colder the storm top is, the stronger the storm (all other things being equal). This is predicted by theory and confirmed using computer models. The storm top temperature is closely related to the temperature of the tropopause&hellip;the boundary between the troposphere (where most weather happens) and the dry stratosphere above it.

We found that the temperature of the tropopause over the North Atlantic, where hurricanes form, has been decreasing over the past few decades; yet elsewhere we could find no significant trends. The downward trend in tropopause temperature over the North Atlantic has made an important contribution to the increasing "potential intensity" of hurricanes. The "potential intensity" is a theoretical upper limit on hurricane wind speeds, given the temperature of the atmosphere and the underlying ocean. Although we could find no significant trends in potential intensity outside the North Atlantic, we did find that much of the year-to-year changes in potential intensity all through the tropics can be traced to fluctuations in the tropopause temperature.  Finally, we tried to discover why the tropopause has been cooling over the North Atlantic, and what has been causing the year-to-year fluctuations of tropopause temperature there and elsewhere in the tropics.
