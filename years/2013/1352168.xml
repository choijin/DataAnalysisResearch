<AbstractNarration>This CAREER award supports the study and application of massive entanglement and spin-squeezing in quantum information science, in part by implementing the first precise magnetometer with micron spatial resolution and femto-tesla field sensitivity, as well as the development of an efficient scheme to detect and characterize the entanglement. This work is targeted towards applying a sodium spinor Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to generate massive entanglement in the vicinity of Dicke states through adiabatic evolution across a quantum phase transition, and to create spin-squeezing via collectively coupling atoms to a light field with a quantum non-demolition measurement. The goals of this research are both of fundamental interest for advancing our understanding of quantum physics, and of technological significance. Its interdisciplinary character envelops a broad spectrum of fields in physics and quantum information theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Magnetometers, devices constructed to measure the strength and spatial distribution of magnetic fields, are among the most essential and versatile measurement tools available.  They are used in a wide variety of applications in all areas of science and industry, such as searching for mineral resources, biomedical imaging for early detection and diagnostics, and the exploration of environmental hazards.  As with all measurement techniques, the goals of a magnetometry measurement are to reach a sensitivity that will allow the detection of smaller and smaller quantities and a resolution that will allow pinpointing location to smaller and smaller sizes.  The research supported under this CAREER award will incorporate ultracold BECs into proven optical measurement methods for atom magnetometry, which relies on atomic signals for detection,  that were previously based on techniques using hot atomic vapors.  The new cold atom approach will make it possible to develop magnetometers with enhanced magnetic field sensitivity and spatial resolution. Beyond the important research goals, this CAREER award will provide excellent opportunities to introduce students to modern developments in quantum physics, to involve them in research projects, and to prepare them for a career in science and technology. Two new laboratory courses in physics will be developed to better prepare the students for advanced research. Active efforts will be undertaken to broaden the participation of under-represented groups in this project by involving Native American students, women in physics, and potential ?first-generation? college students in research and educational activities. This CAREER award will enhance the infrastructure for science education in the region and encourage more talented students to pursue a career in science.</AbstractNarration>
