<AbstractNarration>The Gaseous Electronics Conference (GEC) is the leading international conference in the science and technology of LTP (Low Temperature Plasmas) combined with collision physics (CP). The conference has been the venue of the first presentations on world leading developments in investigations of LTP and CP topics including lighting and lasers, plasma materials processing of relevance to the semiconductor and photovoltaics industry, and plasma application in biomedicine. The invited speakers represent the world's leading scientists in these fields. The future of any field depends upon attracting bright young people. The GEC has a strong tradition of encouraging and promoting student participation. The GEC has an enviable reputation of being the first conference that many of the leading members of the community presented their first research results as graduate students. This award pays partial travel support for PhD students to attend and present the results of their work at the meeting. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this proposal include the opportunity for young scientists to attend one of the most important conferences in their field. They will have the opportunity to observe first-hand the scientific and cultural diversity of the field, and establish what will hopefully be career long collaborations with their international counterparts. The GEC makes a special effort to support graduate students who are women and underrepresented minorities.</AbstractNarration>

The GEC has a strong tradition of encouraging and promoting student participation.  The GEC has an enviable reputation of being the first conference that many of the leading members of the community presented their first research results as graduate students.  Student participation in the GEC is particularly important to the professional development of young scientists and engineers.  With this proposal, the funds were requested to help support the travel of US graduate students to attend the 2013 GEC.  At the 2013 GEC the special events was included:  &bull; Workshop on Scaling and Application of Atmospheric Pressure High E/n Discharges  &bull;  Workshop on fundamental processes in plasma-surface interaction in plasma processing and fusion applications  &bull;  Workshop on Plasma Data Exchange  &bull;  Workshop on physics of negative ion sources  Preconference plasma school  was held for two days before the conference, which included lectures covering basics of discharge theory and plasma diagnostics for plasma processing systems.   Intellectual Merit: The GEC is the leading international conference in the science and technology of low temperature plasmas (LTPs) and relevant atomic and optical physics. The GEC is the only conference that combines aspects of atomic, molecular, and optical physics with low temperature plasma physics, electric discharges and plasma chemistry, as well as their technological applications.

NSF Travel Grant  To encourage student participation in the meeting, the GEC Executive Committee has a long standing practice of providing partial financial assistance for students presenting oral or poster papers at the Conference.
