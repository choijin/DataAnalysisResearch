<AbstractNarration>The primary objective of this research project is to advance understanding of the effects of Saharan mineral dust on the African easterly Jet, African easterly waves, and tropical cyclones. A unified work plan is designed that combines theory, numerical experiments, data assimilation, and model verification. Standard analytical, numerical, and diagnostic methods will be used to execute the plan. A new theoretical framework will be developed whose goal is to illuminate causal relationships between Saharan dust, the African easterly jet, and African easterly waves. The theoretical framework will serve as a tool for interpreting results obtained from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, which will be used to carry out comprehensive simulations involving dust-radiative-microphysical interactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the research includes advancing understanding of how Saharan mineral dust operates over the synoptic scale environment to the tropical cyclone scale to affect the path and intensification of tropical cyclones.  This research will assess the relative importance dust-radiation and dust-microphysical interactions on tropical cyclone activity, which will lead to improved prediction of TCs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the research include model validation results with various data sets, which is critical to assessing model performance and forecasts.  This award will develop a new understanding of the effects of dust on tropical cyclones, which can be used to help improve existing diagnostic and statistical tools for tropical cyclone forecasts.  Additionally, this award will provide research training for both undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>North Africa is home to the African easterly jet, a current of strong easterly winds located in the lower atmosphere. The African easterly jet often gives birth to weather systems known as African easterly waves. Together the jet and the waves form a complex system whose influence on weather can extend to the United States. That influence often manifests as tropical cyclones (TCs), whose genesis has been linked to the easterly waves. Consequently, to understand the connection between the weather over North Africa and the development of TCs, it is important to understand the processes that affect the African easterly jet?African easterly wave (AEJ-AEW) system. Of those processes, the heating effects of Saharan dust storms are among the least understood, yet potentially among the most important.</p> <p>The central objective of the project was to advance understanding of the effects of Saharan dust storms on the AEJ-AEW system and TC development over the Eastern Atlantic Ocean.

To guide the numerical experiments and to aid in the interpretation of the results, a theoretical framework was developed that exposes the dust-modified physics operating within the system.</p> <p>The project has resulted in several major outcomes, among which are the following: Saharan dust increases the growth rate of easterly waves and increases the peak amplitude of the most rapidly growing waves. A new theoretical framework was developed that can serve as a predictive tool for determining the Saharan dust distributions that are most apt to lead to the birth of easterly waves.
