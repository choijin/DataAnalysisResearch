<AbstractNarration>The mouth connects the digestive system with the external environment.  Without this connection animals cannot eat.  Remarkably, despite its obvious importance, there have been few studies that address how this initial connection is established. It is also not often considered in studies of orofacial evolution, development and birth defects, and is rarely mentioned in developmental or anatomical textbooks. In this project, a series of experiments will define how the first connection to the digestive system is formed, and how its development is intimately tied to the formation of surrounding facial structures. Specifically, the hypothesis is that growth and tension within the face pulls the mouth open. Molecular, cellular, embryological and biomechanical approaches in Xenopus will be combined to test this hypothesis. Based on preliminary data it is expected that novel connections between molecular signals, cellular junctions, such as desmosomes, and mitosis will be uncovered. This work is potentially high impact in that it is the first to study: 1) the role of tension in orofacial development and 2) the molecular mechanisms governing how the connection to the digestive system is established. Additionally, this work is integrated into an innovative educational plan. Graduate and undergraduate level laboratory courses will be created where students will perform experiments contributing to the project. In addition, undergraduate independent study and summer research projects are planned for VCU's minority programs. On the opposite end of the educational spectrum is a preschool component where children will be exposed to living frogs at various life stages combined with art, math and reading activities. Together, this work will provide students at several levels with the opportunity to contribute to a better understanding of vertebrate mouth development.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: The aquatic frog, Xenopus laevis, has become a unique and effective model to dissect the mechanisms governing craniofacial development.  Early development in Xenopus is highly conserved with mammals and experiments can be performed in free-living embryos that develop rapidly, can be obtained in great numbers at relatively low cost.  Many craniofacial developmental biologists focus on neural crest and palate development with the aim to better understand a common craniofacial disorder, cleft palate.  However, this leaves a major knowledge gap in our understanding of the other craniofacial structures.  One such understudied structure is the embryonic mouth. This is the first opening between the digestive system and the environment and is central to jaw and adult mouth formation. The final step in embryonic mouth development is the perforation of a thin layer of tissue covering the digestive tube called the buccopharyngeal membrane. When this tissue does not perforate it can cause rare craniofacial disorders in humans, some of which can go undiagnosed and pose serious health risks for newborns. The work generated from this grant unveils new fundamental processes and regulators of buccopharyngeal membrane perforation.  We have shown that forces generated from the surrounding jaw muscles combined with loss of cell adhesion within the buccopharyngeal membrane itself is critical for its perforation.  Changes in cell adhesion are regulated molecularly by c-Jun N-terminal kinase, a signal that is known to modulate the cell’s response to stress. Such stress appears to be created, at least in part, by forces generated by the developing jaw muscles which are connected to the embryonic mouth via the extracellular matrix. We have also determined that signals and transcription factors required for jaw muscle development are critical for buccopharyngeal membrane perforation. Such factors and signals are also associated with rare craniofacial birth defects in humans associated with a persistent buccopharyngeal membrane. This grant has allowed us to fill in an important puzzle piece to explain how the embryonic mouth is formed and thereby creating a more complete picture of craniofacial development.  Broader Impacts:  This grant has provided resources to integrate my research with education across various levels with the aim to stimulate an appreciation for biology especially for girls.  My Tadpoles to Tots and Elementary Science programs introduced the youngest students to developmental life stages of frogs and encouraged girls to be resistant to the common "eww yuck" responses to amphibians. Middle and high school outreach activities and visits to my lab focused on an introduction to research using model organisms and hands on activities with embryos.  In higher education I developed a 12-student lab course, integrated lab modules into a lecture-based courses and developed projects where students performed experiments that contributed to my research goals.  Further, this grant has enabled independent research experiences for over 20 undergraduates and several graduate students.
