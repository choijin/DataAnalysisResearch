<AbstractNarration>This action funds Nicholas Yoshio Sakamoto of Purdue University to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 at Kansai University in Osaka.  The project title is "Modeling Tensioned Membranes Using an Electromagnetic Numerical Method." The host scientists are Professor Yasuhito Kawai and Professor Masahiro Toyoda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tire-pavement noise and vibration have a significant impact on motor vehicle pass-by noise, passenger comfort, and manufacturer design constraints.  Previously, modal models of tire vibration have been developed, but they are not appropriate in the high frequency region (above 1 kHz) in which most tire noise is generated.  Modal models are inappropriate both because of the number of modes involved and the heavy damping of the tire structure (so that waves generated in the contact patch area are fully attenuated by the time they propagate half way around the tire).  This project applies the Finite-Difference Time-Domain method, which has an established history in the field of electromagnetics, to acoustics and vibroacoustic problems which could be instrumental in developing a model to computationally determine the behavior of noise and vibrations within tires and other tensioned membranes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Upon returning, a seminar will be set-up to convey personal research experiences and to encourage other U.S. born researchers at the Ray W. Herrick Laboratories to explore the advantages of NSF international fellowships and direct contact with international labs performing similar research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Heavy damping associated with the structure of a tire limits previous modal models in the high frequency region (near 1 kHz).  The application of the finite difference time-domain method to a tensioned membrane would provide an additional tool for modeling a tireÆs dynamic characteristics in that frequency range.  Because of the exceptional guidance by the host professor, the primary goal was accomplished quickly.  The results were validated by deriving the maximum response analytically.  Then, they were compared with current tire research to analyze the effectiveness of the method.  The successful pace and outcomes of the research encouraged further investigation into more complicated mechanical systems.  The next step involved simulating the response of a traditional tire model consisting of a tensioned beam with springs.  Upon completion, the tension within the beam was varied to demonstrate its inherent effect on the vibrations.  The final task consisted of coupling sound fields and mechanical systems, which provides a more representative model of a tire.  By applying signal processing methods associated with current research, the resulting data reinforces theoretical concepts of structural and acoustic modes that exist within a tire.  Concurrent tire research showed strong correlation to these predicted modes.  Furthering the research by applying the finite difference time-domain method to more complex models will help to understand a tireÆs dynamic characteristics more completely.   The success of the method when applied to simple mechanical systems promotes further investigation into application to any spatially periodic system.  The coupling of fluid layers and mechanical systems with a wide range of boundary conditions allows for modeling system response and fluid surroundings to a variety of inputs over a range of time.
