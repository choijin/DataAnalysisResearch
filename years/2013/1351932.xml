<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on developing a better understanding of the sources of nitrogen oxide emissions to the atmosphere. Samples will be collected from several key sources such as vehicles, biomass burning, and emissions generated from soils. The fraction of isotopic nitrogen (15N) will be measured in each sample. This will enable ?fingerprints? to be developed for each of the important sources to the atmosphere. Being able to identify the contribution of major sources of nitrogen oxides to the atmosphere has broad implications for addressing environmental issues, such as the formation of smog and acid rain, and for air quality modeling and decision making associated with source reduction strategies. This research will be integrated with a multi-faceted education program to increase the participation of minorities in science research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A new method has been developed to enable the measurement of nitrogen oxides (NOx) without having the samples subject to fractionation upon collection.  The method uses a solution of NaOH with KMnO4 that reacts with both NO and NO2 in the gas phase yielding nitrate in solution. The method has been tested in the PI?s laboratory and found to have a good level of reproducibility based upon repeated measures of standards and samples. A field deployable system is being developed by pairing this technique with a method to determine the fraction of isotopic 15N of the NOx.  The resulting characterization of NOx sources will enable tracing the sources of NOx for studies ranging from urban pollution to nitrogen fertilization in ecosystems.</AbstractNarration>

While the original goals of this work focused on NOx, collaborations leveraged our novel approaches allowing us to also explore the utility of isotopes for detailing the influence of other reactive N species such as nitrous acid (HONO), nitric acid (HNO3) and ammonium/ammonium (NH3/NH4) in different environments. Ultimately, we have found that the isotopic signatures can indeed distinguish sources of NOx, HONO and NH3. However, our work also revealed a critical need to understand the changes in isotopic composition of these species that occur with chemical interactions in the atmosphere. Overall, this work produced twelve peer-reviewed publications (with more to come!), covering a range of studies including: new methodologies that were laboratory and field-verified to accurately collect environmental samples that do not modify their in situ compositions; isotopic signatures associated with reactive N emissions in vehicle plumes, agricultural soil emissions under different fertilizer management practices, and wildfires (both direct emissions and in smoke-impacted plumes); new frameworks for tracking the influence of reactive N in the environment through study of the isotopic composition of nitrate and ammonium from urban areas where the deposition of these products affects water quality and ecosystem health - to remote alpine ecosystems where nitrate levels in lake waters are surprisingly high and the influence of atmospheric sources was able to be quantified - to ice cores from the Tibetan Plateau where it was shown that emissions associated with fertilizer use in Asia have been the major driver of nitrate deposition since the pre-industrial period impacting a critical water resource for millions of people.
