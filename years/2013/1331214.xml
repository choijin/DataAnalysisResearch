<AbstractNarration>The focus of this work is on developing a better understanding of the biogeochemical cycle of the trace gas carbonyl sulfide (COS) in the atmosphere. The goal is to investigate the use of COS measurements as a proxy for gross primary productivity. COS and carbon dioxide are taken up at the same rate by the same plant photosynthetic enzymes and are coupled at the leaf scale via the key enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA). The Principal Investigator will identify the class of CA involved in atmospheric COS consumption, determine the diversity of COS-consuming microorganisms in the soil, and identify the metabolic pathways associated with COS consumption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The use of COS as a tracer for the global carbon cycle has the potential to enable partitioning of large global carbon sources and sinks for the assessment of ecosystem carbon fluxes and process-level responses to climate forcing.</AbstractNarration>

Atmospheric concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub> are important for regulating global climate at levels facilitating life as we know it. In addition, CO<sub>2</sub> is the key building block for life and the biosphere drives massive annual fluxes of CO<sub>2</sub> in and out of the terrestrial and oceanic ecosystems driven by large-scale photosynthesis (removes CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere) and respiration (releases CO<sub>2</sub> to the atmosphere). Photosynthesis and respiration are the largest components of the carbon cycle. Even small differences in the balance between terrestrial photosynthesis and respiration will affect the build up of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere and the storage of large amounts of carbon in soil, which can feed back on climate. The ability to separately measure photosynthetic and respiratory fluxes of CO<sub>2</sub> is critical to our ability to model and thus predict the carbon cycle feedbacks to climate change.</p> <p><strong>Challenges to carbon cycle studies.</strong> A challenge in studying and predicting carbon cycle processes is the inability to separately and directly measure terrestrial photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration. Traditional methods measure the sum of these two processes, and models must be used to partition photosynthesis from respiration. In this study, we focus on two potential carbon cycle tracers, carbonyl sulfide (COS or OCS) and the oxygen isotopes of CO<sub>2</sub> (the ratio of <sup>16</sup>O to <sup>18</sup>O) that can be used as proxies for photosynthesis because of shared leaf-level pathways (diffusion through leaf stomata) and biochemical reactions (enzyme carbonic anhydrase) as photosynthetic CO<sub>2</sub> uptake. In this project, we focused on processes in the soil that affect both carbon cycle tracers, and if not accounted for could create problems for their use to infer photosynthesis.</p> <p><strong>Soil fluxes of carbon cycle tracers.</strong> Soils were found to also react with carbon cycle tracers COS and <sup>18</sup>O-CO<sub>2</sub>, though these fluxes were at first overlooked. Carbonic anhydrase enzymes derived from soil microorganisms were thought to catalyze these reactions in soils as is the case in leaves. In this study, we aimed to improve the understanding of the factors that were causing carbon cycle tracer fluxes between the soil and atmosphere. We collected 20 different soils from a wide variety of biomes and soils that were relatively undisturbed versus those used for agriculture. We measured the trace gas fluxes of COS and <sup>18</sup>O-CO<sub>2</sub> between these soils and the atmosphere and at the same time characterized soil chemistry, physical structure, and microbial communities. We found that soils did indeed drive strong fluxes of these carbon cycle tracers, and we found similar, but not identical trends across the soils. Soils used for agriculture had relatively weaker fluxes of COS than <sup>18</sup>O-CO<sub>2</sub>. We hypothesized that this could be due to differences in microbial community and the carbonic anhydrase enzymes they encode for between agricultural and non-agricultural soils. Microbial communities were affected by agriculture, but the total microbial community diversity did not predict the carbon cycle tracer fluxes. We sequenced soil RNA, which reflects the genes that the microbial community express in soils. From this data, we find that different classes of carbonic anhydrase may be important for COS fluxes than those driving <sup>18</sup>O-CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes. While these results are still being analyzed, they suggest that we could develop genomic tools to predict the levels of COS and <sup>18</sup>O-CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes or perhaps we could predict these fluxes from biome, land use, or other soil characteristics.</p> <p><strong>Going forward.</strong> We will propose predictive models for soil fluxes of carbon cycle tracers in order to account for the effect of soil fluxes. This will allow researchers to continue to utilize carbon cycle tracers for their intended purpose, as proxies for local or global photosynthesis. This is a critical capability for studying the global carbon cycle and its changing balance. This study has revealed new information about the role of carbonic anhydrase in soil microorganisms, and we continue to study the role of these enzymes in sustaining life in soil and their distribution in different environments. In addition, soils have been observed to release COS and we are using advanced soil chemical characterization techniques to link these COS emissions to the sulfur chemistry in soils. The progress made in this study can serve as an example of leveraging capabilities in sequencing and bioinformatics to build genome-informed models of biogeochemical cycles.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/10/2017<br>      Modified by: Laura&nbsp;K&nbsp;Meredith</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1331214/1331214_10269028_1486759579774_Fig1_CCT_Infographic--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1331214/1331214_10269028_1486759579774_Fig1_CCT_Infographic--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Carbon Cycle Tracers"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1331214/1331214_10269028_1486759579774_Fig1_CCT_Infographic--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Carbon Cycle Tracers"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">COS and the oxygen isotopes (18O) of CO2 are potential Carbon Cycle Tracers.
