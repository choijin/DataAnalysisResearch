<AbstractNarration>This interdisciplinary research project focuses on the institutional conditions that shape the performance of local health systems in developing countries.  The problem motivating the project is the inability of health systems in many countries to prevent extreme health disparities and human suffering.  Decentralization reforms that operate on the premise that local institutional arrangements can provide public services better than central government agencies are a ubiquitous response to these disparities.  The problem is that theoretical arguments for health-sector decentralization are underdeveloped, and empirical results assessing whether reformed systems produce healthier communities are mixed.  The project will focus on explaining why some local health systems perform better than others.   The researchers will address this question by developing and testing specific hypotheses about the ways governance structure affects the performance of local health systems.  The project has three components.  The researchers will draw on work in new institutionalism and polycentric governance to develop a theory linking decentralization, behavior patterns, and the performance of local health systems.  They will collect time-series, cross-sectional, and social network data for 250 local health systems in Honduras, half of which have been decentralized to local organizations and the remainder managed by the central government.  The researchers will combine existing longitudinal health data with socioeconomic and institutional data, and they will implement original social network mapping, survey data collection, and behavioral experiments with health system actors in the field.  They will use these data to test several hypotheses about the ways governance structure affects health-system performance through changes in the behavior of local organizations and individuals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will generate evidence about the local and institutional factors that affect disparities in the performance of health systems in developing countries.  The questions examined are of theoretical significance, because they address how public policies affect societal outcomes through human institutions, as well as organizational and individual behavior.  By building theory, implementing an innovative research design, constructing an original dataset, and employing quantitative and qualitative analyses to test theory, the researchers will contribute robust findings about the institutional conditions that drive differences in local health-system performance as well as the effectiveness of health-sector decentralization.  The project will have immediate practical value as countries around the world struggle to create policies for effectively administering health systems and improving community health.  Project findings will provide policy makers, analysts, and donors with a deeper understanding of the factors influencing health system performance, specific recommendations for improving that performance, and an innovative set of methods to evaluate the effectiveness of governance reforms.  The results of this work will be relevant to numerous other sectors, such as education, agriculture, and the environment, where central governments have also transferred policy-making power to lower levels of government.  This project is supported by the NSF Interdisciplinary Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (IBSS) competition.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Why do some local health systems perform better than others in developing countries? To answer this question, the project investigated the social and institutional factors that can increase the likelihood of improved performance of local health systems in developing countries, particularly in Honduras.  With substantial involvement from the Honduran Ministry of Health, we designed an in-depth study of health sector decentralization reform in that country. One of the project?s contributions is the creation of an exceptionally detailed database on municipal governance and community health that has allowed researchers to generate new knowledge on the health impacts of the reform, as well as well on the conditions that make decentralization more likely to improve health outcomes not only in Honduras, but also in other countries that have implemented similar governance reforms.    Specifically, we have completed five major data collection efforts.  First, we compiled observational and administrative data on health services, municipal government, social support, and socio-economic conditions for all 298 Honduran municipalities between 2006 and 2016.  Next, we implemented three original surveys in a matched sample of 65 municipalities, some of which had received the decentralization reform while others remained under traditional administration:  a household survey on access to and uptake of healthcare, as well as socio-demographic, economic, and political information for 9,000 families; a health center survey on facility conditions in 300 clinics and attitudes and behaviors of 600 health workers; and an inter-organizational network survey on key relationships among 860 organizations comprising these municipal health systems.  Finally, we implemented in-the-field behavioral experiments on motivation, cooperation, and teamwork with 240 health workers and municipal officials across 30 municipalities.  These data collection efforts, together with a research design leveraging the partial and staggered rollout of decentralization reform in a single country, have produced one of the most detailed, comprehensive, and innovative data sets for answering questions about how institutional reforms are targeted, their effects on policy outcomes, and the social mechanisms through which changes in administration and governance may affect these outcomes.  Initial analyses from four working papers have produced new evidence on (1) the political economy of reform implementation, (2) the effects of decentralization, and (3) the institutional and contextual conditions shaping those effects.  Reform Implementation: Counter to many existing expectations our work shows that the decentralization reform was targeted predominantly to impoverished municipalities as external donors and elite bureaucrats worked together to limit the influence of local politicians (Zarychta 2016).   Decentralization?s Effects: Our evidence on the impact of decentralization on health services substantially improves on the current literature in terms of empirical robustness and causal inference. We employ a natural experiment in one state and quasi-experimental data from all of Honduras to show that decentralization increases preventive care for women and that improved accountability and greater resilience to shocks are important causal mechanisms driving these positive outcomes (Zarychta 2016).   Local Conditions Moderate Effectiveness:  Moving beyond simple binary views of decentralization, we show that while Honduras as a whole improved greatly on several key health outcomes between 2006 and 2016, both the local institutional setting and the design of the reform matter significantly for effectiveness:  decentralization works better in settings with greater political competition, and systems led by NGOs and Associations of Municipalities outperform those led by traditional municipal governments (Zarychta et al. 2017, Root et al. 2017).   This research was motivated by the failures of many local governments in rural areas of developing countries to provide adequate social services for their communities, and it was a response to the overwhelming popularity of public sector decentralization reforms as solution to these failures.  Our sustained and ongoing collaboration with the Honduran Ministry of Health is thus also the basis of our most pronounced broader impact:  supporting the Ministry?s evaluation, planning, and strategic decision-making around health sector reform.  In addition to in-country engagement, we convened a meeting of our project team and Honduran collaborators at University of Chicago?s School of Social Service Administration to share preliminary results of our work, review ongoing analyses, and discuss future research.   The project has so-far produced one peer-reviewed publication (Zarychta 2015); one award-winning dissertation (Zarychta 2016, winner of the American Political Science Association?s 2017 Leonard D. White Award for Best Dissertation in Public Administration, Honorable Mention 2017 APPAM Award, Finalist 2017 SIOE Coase Award); one master?s thesis (Bailey 2016); five working papers that have constituted the basis for 27 research presentations; one award-winning conference presentation (Bailey 2017, Poster Session Award, 2017 Population Association of America meetings); training and research opportunities for six PhD students and one postdoctoral researcher (six of seven female, three from under-represented groups); and tenure-track faculty positions for two of those team members (Alan Zarychta, University of Chicago, and Tara Grillos, Purdue University).  The full list of references for these and other accomplishments are available in the project?s FINAL REPORT.
