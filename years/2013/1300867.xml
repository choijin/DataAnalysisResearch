<AbstractNarration>This mathematics research project by Yuan Yuan concerns a number of problems in several complex variables and complex differential geometry, consisting of the rigidity and classification of holomorphic structures, canonical metrics in Kahler geometry, and complex Monge-Ampere equations. These are fundamental problems  closely related to many other fields in mathematics and physics, such as, algebraic geometry, mathematical physics, number theory, partial differential equations. In particular, Yuan will  study  the uniqueness of complex structure on Hermitian symmetric spaces and mapping rigidity between bounded symmetric domains; and the deep relation between the (finite and infinite time) limit behavior of the (parabolic) complex Monge-Ampere equations and canonical Kahler metrics as well as the formation of singularities on Kahler manifolds.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mathematics field of complex analysis took center stage starting with the nineteenth century, when its applications became crucial to other sciences and engineering, including electronic engineering and mechanic engineering. Over the years, this trend has continued and in fact has been taken to the next level:  the geometric spaces studied in this mathematics research project by Yuan Yuan  can serve as the most basic models in cosmology and general relativity. Clarifying the geometric structure of these models is extremely important in understanding the physical laws that relate to them and can help further our understanding of the shape of the universe. In addition to this work, Yuan will continue to participate in, and organize seminars and workshops for undergraduate and graduate students and young researchers.  Yuan will also mentor undergraduate and graduate students, and in this way  the project will effectively integrate  research and education.</AbstractNarration>
