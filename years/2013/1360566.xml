<AbstractNarration>This project develops an integrated framework to perform simultaneous object discovery and detector training in an unsupervised setting. It takes advantages of large amount (millions or even billions) of well-organized internet images to automatically learn rich image representations for a wide range of objects. The main activities in this project include the following. (1) The central component of this project is a formulation to turn unsupervised data into weakly-supervised "noisy input" through which commonalities are explored for rich object representation using a new learning method. (2) A large dictionary of mid-level image representations will be learned on a large scale number of images retrieved using thousands of object words through the internet search engine. (3) A new flexible object representation is developed to deal with articulated/non-rigid objects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project advances computer vision and machine learning fields by developing an unsupervised paradigm to explore a large scale of internet images. The learned mid-level and high-level representations from images retrieved using thousands of words can significantly enhance the object representation power and benefit researchers in the object recognition field. The formulations, algorithms, and methods resulted from this project are also helpful to researchers in other fields such as medical imaging and data mining. The project dissemination plan includes the source code and learned mid-level and high-level representations.</AbstractNarration>

The proposed activities have strengthened the educational and research program in the Department of Cognitive Science and Department of Computer Science and Engineering at University of California San Diego (UCSD).   At UCSD, a number of courses are being taught in the Cognitive Science department including  COGS 118A "Natural Computation I" (undergraduate), COGS 185 "Advanced Machine Learning Methods" (undergraduate), and "Image Recognition" (graduate), in 2014, 2015, and 2016.  The PI was also on the organization committee of a 2013 computer vision summer school at the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM) to promote  the integration of research themes in computer vision and machine learning. In addition, the PI has provided educational services to audience outside the affiliated institutions mainly in three forms of invited talks, lecture and tutorials at multiple conferences.  The PI's main professional services also include being Action Editor (2013-present) for Journal of Machine Learning Research, Area Chair for CVPR 2012, CVPR 2014, ICCV 2015, and ECCV 2016, in addition to being a reviewer for the leading journals and conferences in computer vision and machine learning.  We briefly describe below new findings due to the support of this award.  Fixed-Point Model for Structured Labeling: we found that our new structrual prediction framework, as a flat model, can achieve significant efficiency gain in training and testing compared with the deep-layer structure, while not losing performance in accuracy.  Sparse Subspace Denoising for Image Manifolds: we found that high-dimensional data often lies on interesting manifolds where sparse subspace structures are observed.  Max-Margin Multiple Instance Dictionary Learning: we found that a new weakly-supervised strategy for codebook/dictionary learning has a clear advantage over the unsupervised and supervised strategies.  Harvesting Mid-level Visual Concepts from Large-scale Internet Images: we found that mid-level visual concepts can be explored from a large-scale internet images. We have proposed a fully automatic algorithm which harvests visual concepts from a large number of Internet images using text-based queries.  Harvesting Motion Patterns in Still Images from the Internet: we found that image patterns in still images contain rich motion information. In this project, we investigate the use of still images instead of videos in motion understanding.  Robust Subspace Discovery via Relaxed Rank Minimization: we found that a robust subspace discovery problem can be formulated into a convex optimization task.  Action Recognition with Actons: we found that rich gesture interations can be represented by actons learned in a weakly-supervised manner.  Learning to Predict from Crowdsourced Data: we found that explicitly studying the user intention in crowdsourcing leads to significant gain in obtaining robust classification.  Deeply-Supervised Nets: we found that deep supervision provides particular advantages to deep learning by adding a strong regularization and making the network easier to train.  Holistically-Nested Edge Detection. We found that image-to-image prediction, equipped with deep supervision in training leads to significant advance in edge detection.  Top-down Learning for Structured Labeling with Convolutional Pseudoprior: we found that current practice in convolutional neural networks (CNN) remains largely bottom-up and we propose a new method for structured labeling by developing convolutional pseudoprior (ConvPP) on the ground-truth labels.   Generalizing Pooling Functions in Convolutional Neural Networks: Mixed, Gated, and Tree: we found that deep neural networks can be greatly improved by generalizing the pooling operations that play a central role in current architectures.  Dense Volume-to-Volume Vascular Boundary Detection: we found that 3D-based convolution offers significant improvement over 2D-based convolution in volumetric segmentation.
