<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating ion exchange fundamentals to fill the gap in brackish water desalination through a Reversible Ion Exchange-Membrane (RIX-M) process. The translated technology has the following unique features: increased product water recovery due to reduction in scaling from sulfate and carbonate salts of calcium on the surface of Reverse Osmosis (RO) membranes without requiring addition of any anti-scaling chemicals. Threats of barium sulfate scaling and consequent fouling of membranes, wherever present, may also be avoided. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project accomplishes this goal by integrating a self-regenerated ion exchange system along with the RO process. An appropriately designed mixed bed of anion exchange resins significantly reduce sulfate concentration at the membrane inlet, thus avoiding sulfate precipitation. The reject of the RO membrane process is used to regenerate the anion exchange resins without needing addition of external chemicals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential economic impact is expected to be a significant reduction in operating expenses of the desalination plants due to elimination of anti-scaling chemicals. The partnership engages an ion exchange resin manufacturer and an engineering firm to move into the growing brackish water desalination market space globally through validation of the technology under representative conditions. From a business viewpoint, the innovation can also be retrofitted for existing RO plants, thus expanding the market for the proposed technology. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From a broader perspective, the proposed work will also lay the basis for an in-land desalination technology which does not create a reject stream containing environmentally objectionable anti-scaling chemicals requiring post treatment. With higher product water recovery, the reject brine will be smaller in volume, thus reducing the land requirement for disposal. The scientific approach envisioned through fundamentals of ion exchange may also be transplanted in multi-stage evaporative desalination systems to avoid scaling and consequent reduction in heat transfer efficiency of evaporators.  &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

California has experienced drought conditions in 11 of the last 15 years &ndash; a trend that may not change in the near future. Since fresh water resources are dwindling or uncertain, an increased emphasis is being laid on impaired brackish water sources that still remain largely untapped. Brackish water with relatively high total dissolved solids (TDS) is the primary candidate to replenish the water supply and sustain economic prosperity. Treatment of brackish water is accomplished through the use of reverse osmosis (RO) where water, under high pressure, is forced through a semi-permeable membrane which extracts pure water from the brackish source leaving behind a concentrate stream high in TDS. The costs associated with disposal of concentrated reject brine, especially in inland locations, can constitute a significant portion of the operating costs. In addition, anti-scaling chemicals, dosed in the feed water to prevent membrane fouling, are eventually discharged to the environment.  Increasing the recovery of the RO process will result in a reduction of produced waste brine, but this is not immediately possible as at higher recoveries the solubility of certain salts is exceeded. One of the most common precipitates formed during RO is calcium sulfate. However, precipitation can be prevented by removing and replacing sulfate by chloride.  Ion exchange (IX) technology can be used to selectively remove and replace sulfate by chloride as a pretreatment for RO processes.

The efficiency of this Hybrid Ion Exchange-Reverse Osmosis process (HIX-RO) process is dependent on the ability of the ion exchange column to switch between being sulfate selective at the feed concentration, and chloride selective at the reject concentration.
