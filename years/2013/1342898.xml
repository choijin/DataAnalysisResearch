<AbstractNarration>This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 13-country initiative on global change research through the Belmont Forum and the G8 countries Heads of Research Councils. The Belmont Forum is a high level group of the world's major and emerging funders of global environmental change research and international science councils.  It aims to accelerate delivery of the international environmental research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. The G8 Heads of Research Councils developed a funding framework to support multilateral research projects that address global challenges in ways that are beyond the capacity of national or bilateral activities. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders.  This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working together in an inaugural call of the International Opportunities Fund, the Belmont Forum and G8HORCs have provided support for research projects that seek to deliver knowledge needed for action to mitigate and adapt to detrimental environmental change and extreme hazardous events that relate to either Freshwater Security or Coastal Vulnerability.  This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries and that bring together natural scientists, social scientists and research users (e.g., policy makers, regulators, NGOs, communities and industry).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports research activities that will develop a versatile modeling framework that can be applied to evaluate the unique functioning, critical stressors, and vulnerability of the world?s deltas. Deltas are economically and environmentally important systems, sustaining a large portion of the world?s populations, economic activity, and ecosystems. These systems are deteriorating rapidly due to climate changes, catchment changes, and local exploitation and ecosystem degradation. This project will develop an evidence-based framework for global delta sustainability by (1) advancing delta sustainability science as critical coupled human-natural systems; (2) co-design, -develop, and -deliver an evidence-based sustainability framework for risk assessment and decision support; (3) build an international repository of integrated delta datasets; and (4) develop and implement a modeling and decision support framework in partnership with local stakeholders. Applicable from local to national levels, this framework will be applied to three case-studies in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna, Mekong, and Amazon deltas. This project will contribute toward effective regional delta management and governance by providing a mechanism to integrate social, economic, bio-physical, and ecosystem services components to assess delta vulnerability and guide sustainable management strategies and decisions across scales, in collaboration with experts and stakeholders.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Deltaic systems are among the most dynamic and productive environments on Earth, home to a human population density many-fold that of world average. Important breadbaskets of the world, deltas play a central role in food and water security, and riverine and coastal vulnerability of urban and rural areas. Comparative assessments suggest that during the past decade 85% of the world&rsquo;s deltas experienced severe flooding, a situation that could increase by 50% under current scenarios for relative sea-level rise. Undergoing intense urban transformations, deltas are therefore not only important socio-ecological systems in virtually all regions of the world, but also coastal sentinels of global change. To better understanding the challenges faced by delta regions worldwide, the project &ldquo;<em>Catalyzing action towards sustainability of deltaic systems with an integrated modeling framework for risk assessment</em>&rdquo; brought together 23 research teams from 13 countries to develop a science-based integrative modeling framework that can be used to assess delta vulnerability and guide sustainable management and policy decisions at the regional and local scales. The project focused on three deltas of global importance: the Amazon, the Mekong, and the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna. During the course of the project the research team developed a research framework that includes five main work-packages: a) developing an analytical framework for assessing delta vulnerability and scenarios of change (Delta-SRES), b) developing an open-access, science-based, integrative modeling framework for risk assessment and decision support (Delta-RADS), c) developing tools to support quantitative mapping of the biophysical and socioeconomic environment of deltas within shared data repositories (Deltas-DAT), d) developing Global Delta Vulnerability Indices (Delta-GDVI), that capture current and projected scenarios for major deltas around the world and e) collaborating with regional colleagues and stakeholders to put the science, modeling, and data into action (Delta-ACT).</p> <p>As part of this effort, the Indiana University team focused on studying the transformations of the Amazon delta and contributing lessons and analytical frameworks developed for the Amazon but applicable to other deltas. The Amazon delta offered an excellent laboratory to accomplish the goals of the project. At the ocean interface of the largest watershed in the world, draining approximately 40% of South America, the Amazon delta is both the largest estuary and delta on Earth with an overarching influence of over 1500 km of the South American coast between Brazil and Venezuela. For five hundred years, the AD has been a hub for regional and global economic chains but entering a new phase of urban and industrial expansion (and pollution), expansion of transportation and communication infrastructures, pressure on land and aquatic resources, upstream engineering projects, proposed new ports and offshore oil platforms. These changes are interacting with shifting rainfall and sea level patterns that, together, are introducing new types of vulnerabilities, as well as opportunities. The Indiana University research team accomplished the following goals during the duration of the project. <em>First</em>, we developed a comprehensive geospatial data system (Amazon Delta-DAT) including social and biophysical data layers and census data for 50 municipalities of the Amazon delta region. This data system has been shared with partner institutions and publically through the NSF-funded IEDA group at Columbia University. <em>Second</em>, we developed and published a conceptual framework for analyzing deltas as complex coupled social-ecological systems, which offers analytical guidelines for problem-oriented research involving interdisciplinary teams. <em>Third</em>, we carried out 6 stakeholder workshops in different parts of the Amazon delta, which contributed to the development of vulnerability analysis and indicators for the whole Amazon delta region. <em>Fourth</em>, using the Amazon Deltas-DAT and the conceptual framework mentioned above, we carried out and published analysis of urban vulnerability to flooding for 41 cities in the region. We also carried out analysis of adaptation strategies used by urban residents to confront flooding in areas lacking public infrastructure such as drainage and sanitation. The results of this analysis were the first to show the location and population potentially affected by flooding in urban areas of the region, indicating that over 60% of the urban sectors within the Amazon delta present high degree of vulnerability to flooding, reaching a population of over 1 million inhabitants. &nbsp;<em>Fifth</em>, we carried out and published research with rural riverine fisher-farmers to understand local perception and indicators of increase tidal levels.
