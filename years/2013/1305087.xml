    <AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to develop an innovative approach to yield high efficiency organic?{inorganic hybrid solar cells based on hyperbranched nanocomposite assemblies composed of sea-urchin-like semiconductor nanocrystals and upconversion nanocrystals that are intimately and permanently connected with conjugated polymers (i.e., potentially transformative research). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is manifested in innovative design and crafting of inorganic sea-urchin-like nanocrystals (i.e., CdSe and upconversion nanocrystal/CdSe) that are closely linked with conjugated polymers to yield high efficiency hybrid solar cells for renewable energy production as a direct consequence of (a) largely increased light harvesting efficiency due to the incorporation of upconversion nanocrystals for expanding the absorption spectrum to infrared range, (b) faster charge transfer from conjugated polymer to sea-urchin-like nanocrystals attributed to intimate interfacial contact between conjugated polymer and nanocrystals enabled by utilizing star-like block copolymer templates, and (c) enhanced pathway for efficient charge transport and longer electron lifetime resulting from the use of anisotropic sea-urchin-like CdSe nanocrystals (i.e., they interconnect one another to yield a network for fast charge transport). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include strong nanoscience education across several levels. Undergraduate students, especially those from underrepresented groups, will be recruited to participate in the research project. Summer research for high school teachers in the PI's lab will provide a medium for transferring nanomaterials science and technology knowledge to high school classrooms. High school students will further be exposed to nanoscience through annual Career Day in the School of Materials Science and Engineering at Georgia Tech.</AbstractNarration>
