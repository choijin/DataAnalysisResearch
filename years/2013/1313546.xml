<AbstractNarration>Researchers have developed two point-of-use water treatment technologies that can be used alone, or in combination. These ceramic based water purifiers can be produced using local labor and materials in the developing world. The research team has demonstrated social acceptance and technological efficacy in a Guatemalan community as well as demonstrating human health benefits of the technology for an HIVpositive human cohort in South Africa. Building on the originally developed technology, the team has developed an additional point-of-use technology that is roughly 3-5 times less expensive than the original technology. The team has also developed particular expertise in the use of silver nanotechnology as applied to the media used to create the original technology and has developed an different, silver-ceramic point-of-use technology that will be about 3-5 times less expensive than the original technology. Researchers have developed a technique of applying silver to ceramic porous media that does not require pre-synthesized silver nanoparticles. This new technique has the potential to significantly reduce filter production costs compared to current methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The team proposes to further specialize in creation of the two types of ceramic point-of-use water purification technologies. The team is taking steps to create infrastructure for production of these technologies in the U.S. as well as in South Africa. The ceramic filters have a potential market in the U.S. for households using well-water, as well as with disaster-relief agencies and the U.S. Department of Defense for use in conflict areas where purified water may not be readily accessible.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have developed an entirely new point-of-use water purification technology called the MadiDrop.  The MadiDrop is a porous ceramic tablet that is impregnated with silver nanopatches.  When dropped in a water storage container, it gradually releases silver ions and disinfects the water.  The MadiDrop is "tuned" to release sufficient silver for disinfection of waterborne pathogens, but at the same time maintain silver levels below the drinking water standard.  The MadiDrop can be used daily to treat about 20 liters of water per day for at least six months.  We anticipate a retail price point between $5 and $10, making this technology the least expensive water treatment option on the market today.  Through 100 customer discovery interiews, we have identified several customer segments, including non-profit organizations working to assist developing world communities, large aid agencies such as the International Rescue Committee, Oxfam, and the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, and direct-to-consumer sales.  We have developed prototype production facilities that with minimial space and equipment requirements, can produce 600 MadiDrops per day with three workers.  The technological effectiveness of the MadiDrop has been confirmed with a variety of water-quality conditions, as has the duration of its effectiveness.  We are moving forward to create a commercial company and will seek NSF STTR funding in the coming months.       Last Modified: 10/20/2013       Submitted by: James A Smith]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
