<AbstractNarration>Choice drives virtually all behavior and is one of the most studied phenomena in psychology. The present research brings together three previously separate bodies of knowledge to further illuminate the nature of choice processes, with a particular emphasis on choice justification -- a phenomenon involving increased preference for a chosen option and decreased preference for a rejected option. The research involves a Gene X Situation X Culture Interaction Framework. Although the present effort is ambitious, recent developments in three relevant areas of research make the effort, not only possible, but also potentially fruitful. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;From cultural psychological work we know that choice justification is ubiquitous and, yet, the situations in which it occurs vary systematically across cultures: Whereas European Americans (who tend to see themselves as independent from others) justify choices they make for themselves, Asians (who tend to see themselves as interdependent with others) justify choices they make for their friends. From the neuroscience of decision-making, we know that choice justification occurs at the mesocorticolimbic neural pathway of reward processing. From genetics we know that the neural pathway of reward processing is regulated closely by several dopamine system related genes. In combination, these three bodies of literature add importantly to the current view that choice making is neither static nor merely cognitive. Instead, choice making is best conceptualized as an open, dynamic process that receives constant input from genes, situations, and culture.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To investigate how choice justification depends on genes, situations (i.e., self vs. friend choice), and culture (i.e., European American vs. Asian), the current proposal involves one large-scale, cross-cultural imaging genetics study -- the first of its kind. Both European Americans and East Asians who have either high or low genetic profiles of dopamine signaling capacity will be recruited. They will be scanned while making choices for themselves or for their friends. It is anticipated that when choices are made for the self, choice justification as revealed in activity in the ventral striatal area will be most pronounced for European Americans and, moreover, among European Americans the effect will be stronger for those with genetic profiles linked to high (vs. low) dopamine signaling capacity. In contrast, when choices are made for friends, the choice justification effect as revealed in the same ventral striatal region will be most pronounced for Asians and, moreover, among Asians this effect will be stronger for those with the genetic profiles associated with high (vs. low) dopamine signaling capacity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If confirmed, the current prediction regarding Gene X Situation X Culture interaction effects will support the view that the study of human mind requires a multi-disciplinary point of view. For example, neither genetics nor neuroscience can be neatly separated from careful analysis of society and culture that provides the context for both genes and the brain to operate. The current work will therefore contribute to teaching, training and knowledge creation of several different fields. Furthermore, the current work will be conducted by a multi-cultural and ethnic group of researchers and research assistants with participants who have multi-cultural and ethnic backgrounds. This work will therefore help educate and train underrepresented groups of individuals in the biological and behavioral sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In the present project, we investigated neural mechanisms underlying a choice justification effect, wherein after a choice people justify and rationalize it so that they can feel that they have made &ldquo;the right choice.&rdquo; Traditionally, this effect was explained by cognitive dissonance theory. The theory holds that when making a difficult choice, people are motivated to justify the choice so as to reduce post-decisional dissonance and, as a consequence, they increase their liking for the chosen item while decreasing the liking for the rejected item. This theoretical account, however, ignores how the choice is made to begin with. Nor is it clear how the decision making process might be related to choice justification. To address this issue, we have hypothesized that when facing a difficult decision, people are conflicted and negatively aroused and, in order to reduce this "pre-decisional" dissonance (composed of conflict and negative arousal), they seek positive incentives associated with one of choice options and, to the extent that such incentives are identified, they choose the option. Hence, by the time a decision is made, preferences must have been changed such that the updated preferences readily foster the decision. Thus, the preference change that is observed after the choice have may already been produced during choice. In an fMRI study, we had 50 European Americans and 45 Asians make choices between two posters. Both before and after the choices, all the stimulus posters were rated for attractiveness (see Figure 1). In support for our key hypothesis, in-choice activation of a reward-processing region (ventral striatum, vSTR &ndash; an index of the identification of positive incentives in a choice option) predicted subsequent choice justification (see Figure 2). Further, the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/Pcu) also predicted choice justification, suggesting that self-referential processing and autobiographic memory retrieval (as indicated by the PCC/Pcu activation) may play a role in helping the decision maker identify positive incentives in a choice option (as indicated by the vSTR activation). These effects were no different across cultures and, moreover, there was no evidence that it is modulated by polymorphisms in dopamine-system genes including <em>DRD4, COMT, DRD2, </em>and <em>DAT1</em>. Given prior work suggesting the predicted culture/genes effect, the absence of any cultural effects or genes effects is puzzling. Future work should test these effects with improved study designs and procedures. In addition to this primary study, we tested another hypothesis (which has been elaborated in the dissonance theory and its subsequent elaborations) that self-referential processing of chosen items is instrumental in bolstering choice justification. In a different fMRI study, we tested functional connectivity between two cortical regions that are typically implicated in self-processing (mPFC and PCC/Pcu) serves as a reliable marker of self-referential processing and observed that the attitude change for chosen items was predicted by an increase of this connectivity after (vs. before) the choice. This study provides the first neural evidence for the self-referential processing hypothesis of choice justification. Also, we have carried out a series of EEG studies and found evidence for error-processing in general and its link to both culture and genes in particular. Our work is important in shedding light on how decisions are made at the neural level. It is also important in highlighting potential influences of both culture and genes on the decision-making process.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/28/2016<br>      Modified by: Shinobu&nbsp;Kitayama</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1325881/1325881_10272025_1480273980672_Figure_1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1325881/1325881_10272025_1480273980672_Figure_1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1325881/1325881_10272025_1480273980672_Figure_1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The procedure of the present study.</div> <div class="imageCredit">None</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Shinobu&nbsp;Kitayama</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1325881/1325881_10272025_1480274219384_figure_2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1325881/1325881_10272025_1480274219384_figure_2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1325881/1325881_10272025_1480274219384_figure_2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The brain regions correlated with attitude change for Chosen items.</div> <div class="imageCredit">None</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Shinobu&nbsp;Kitayama</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1325881/1325881_10272025_1480274318865_Figure_3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1325881/1325881_10272025_1480274318865_Figure_3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1325881/1325881_10272025_1480274318865_Figure_3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The connectivity between mPFC and PCC/Pcu during rating tasks  (A).
