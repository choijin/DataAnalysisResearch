<AbstractNarration>The planned I/UCRC for Windstorm Hazard Mitigation intends to undertake functions at the interface between basic and applied research and between private and public interests. Working with its members, the Center will focus on seeking solutions to real world problems encountered by industry members and improve their performance and competitiveness; enhancing government agencies and NGOs capabilities to prepare for and respond to future windstorms; transferring findings from federally sponsored research to products and intellectual properties that benefit researchers, university, and industry; and facilitating collaboration between Center members by developing long-term strategies for enhancing community resiliency to wind and other hazards. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned center aims to protect homeowners, businesses, and communities through collaborative research in windstorm mitigation and the implementation of innovations will enhance the Nation's resiliency to future disasters. Integrated in the project are several initiatives aimed at increasing diversity and collectively they contribute to the development of a more diverse workforce and business environment. Meanwhile, the planning activities provide a unique opportunity for students to interact with the industry, improve their communication skills, and enhance their employment potentials. The project helps develop students with strong problem solving, marketable capabilities. The project also helps train Center faculty on how to work with the industry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The objective of this effort was to explore the feasibility of and initiate the planning for establishing an I/UCRC with Texas Tech University, Louisiana State University, and the University of Alabama with the aim of fostering long-term public-private partnerships for wind hazard mitigation.  After witnessing the devastation caused by recent hurricanes and tornadoes, major stakeholders have become increasingly aware of the complex interactions within and among natural and human systems in hazard prone regions and have begun seeking sound investment strategies for disaster mitigation.  While life and safety remain top priorities, the wellbeing of residents and businesses depends intimately on their community's ability to quickly restore economic, social, and physical infrastructures.  However, for low-frequency-high-consequence events such as severe windstorms, a critical knowledge gap still exists between understanding fundamental processes of wind loadings and projecting future performance for structures and infrastructures under extreme conditions.  Furthermore, the theoretical and empirical framework for characterizing, quantifying, and modeling windstorm impacts at various temporal and spatial scales ought to be expanded in order to support evidence-based risk management and mitigation. Research on hazard mitigation at the University of Alabama started in earnest in 2005 following Hurricane Katrina.  Following the EF 4 tornado that cut through Tuscaloosa and caused over 50 fatalities and more than $1 billion in damages, the University has become even more involved in loss prevention and community resiliency.  In addition to the University of Alabama, Texas Tech University and Louisiana State University both have established expertise in windstorm loss mitigation.  The Center for Wind Hazard Mitigation (CWHM) was envisioned to be a collaborative venture between the University of Alabama, Louisiana State University, and Texas Tech University and would have partnering members comprising private industry, non-profit organizations, and Federal agencies. UAÆs primary contribution were identified and would be in the areas of: (1) characterizing severe windstorms (e.g. wind flow characteristics and wind speed profiles found in land-falling hurricanes, engineering-relevant aspects of extreme thunderstorm winds, improvement to the Enhanced Fajita scale, etc.); (2) improving the understanding of built environment performance under extreme wind loadings (e.g. wind loads on low-rise buildings, development and testing of in-resident storm shelters, estimating wind and water damage in hurricanes, evaluation of essential facilities, etc.); and (3) developing advanced models and tools for disaster response and recovery (e.g. remote sensing of windstorm damage, regional economic resilience to hurricanes, innovation in enterprise risk management, impact of climate change on coastal communities, etc.). Following the planning meeting with representatives from all three universities, a cross-section of industry representatives and NSF personnel, the University of Alabama opted to excuse itself from the proposed center and encouraged Texas Tech and Louisiana State to go forward without UAÆs formal involvement.  Through the planning effort it became evident that UAÆs industrial partners, while interested and committed to supporting research in this critical area and the overall goals of the center, were hesitant at that time to formalize their commitment at a level and within the timeframe necessary for the proposal to be successfully completed.  The University of Alabama will be prepared to join the center at later date, with itÆs industrial partners fully on board, should the I/UCRC be funded to Texas Tech and LSU.
