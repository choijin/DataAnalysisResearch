<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;19 August 2013&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  1317524&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  Columbia University, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory&lt;br/&gt;PI:   S. Higgins&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests four Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment (SSSE) items for the R/V MARCUS LANGSETH operated by Columbia University, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO); namely a new public address system, completion of the wireless hydraulic remote controls, workboat davit, and noise and sponsoning engineering evaluations. Funding of these items will greatly enhance science support capability and safety on board the vessel.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:   The LANGSETH supports federally funded scientific research throughout the world?s oceans to expand human knowledge of the ocean environment and is the only 3D seismic vessel in the Academic Fleet.  During operations, the vessel routinely exposes graduate and undergraduate students to seagoing oceanography through real-time satellite connectivity from ship to shore, and open house events.  The LANGSETH is scheduled to complete nearly 185 NSF sponsored days in 2013.</AbstractNarration>

The award funded the replacement and upgrade of a new public address system and phone system on the vessel that significantly improves the communciations around the vessel for onboard crew and scientists.  This upgrade both the removal of existing system and a significant rewiring to put the new public address system in place as well as replace the entire phone system network.  The Langseth maintains a number of winches and equipment for deploying science equipment over the side of the vessel. A wireless controls system allows technicians to move freely with control boxes so they have improved visibility and safety when deploying this equipment.  This award allowed us to complete the expansion of this wireless network to remaining equipment without this capability.  A noise study was also undertaken to look at alternatives to decrease sound levels from engine room blowers on main decks to improve working conditions of crew and scientists on the vessel.
