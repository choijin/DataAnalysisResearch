<AbstractNarration>The American Indian Higher Education Consortium, in collaboration with the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher Education, and other stakeholders, will develop a model for closing the gap between broadening participation research and practice. The project design team will employ a strategic methodology, to develop the framework for a broadening participation network of stakeholder relationships, which should significantly increase the responsiveness of STEM education programs and initiatives focusing on underrepresented populations to relevant research findings, program evaluations, and recommendations derived from them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The project will apply cooperative theories to the problem of the management of the connection between national broadening participation (and possibly more broadly learning sciences) research resources and broadening participation practice. The successes of the project have established that simulations of real-world resource allocation problems access the distributed problem-solving ability of closely interacting groups sharing a common set of intentions, and that involving a diverse set of actors encompassing a broad distribution of knowledge and motivational systems is effective in solving resource allocation problems within a complex resource ecosystem. The strategic planning project will test the hypothesis that the Broadening Participation Research to Practice problem is solvable within this framework.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The project will establish the applicability of strategic methodology to a major national resource management issue, thereby providing confirmation of a model for addressing a broad range of national issues, including education reform, and other problems within the broader sphere of social dynamics. The proposed work will provide a rich data set that will be used to customize future strategic iterations within complex stakeholder ecosystems involving a wide range of industries, communities, governments, and organizations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project was designed to convene a group of stakeholders to develop a set of recommendations around closing a gap between research and practice associated with interventions for broadening participation on the part of underrepresented minorities in STEM.  The project's research component involved an examination of the Prosperity Game, a game theory-inspired large group intervention model used to manage a social problem-solving processes intended to achieve a set of recommendations for resolving a problem, issue or set of issues.  The Prosperity Game  A diverse and committed group of people gathered at Howard University on February 3-4, 2014, to interact over two days to address the question:  how can we more effectively employ research to systematically broaden participation of underrepresented populations in STEM?  These 50 participants were convened to participate in an interactive strategic change process where the stakeholders that manage, support and operate within the STEM education-to-work pipeline worked in small and large groups, building toward periods of "system interaction."  The stakeholder "teams" that enacted an evolving and adapting system included:  The Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) team:  the minority serving institutions-HBCUs, PBIs, HSIs, and TCUs;  MSI Partners team:  institutions of higher education that are not MSI's, as well as, research centers and institutes committed to broadening participation;  K-12 team:  organizations that create and drive K-12 educational policy;  Communities team:  those within the service area of an institution that have a stake in and an impact in broadening participation;  Policy and Advocacy team:  governmental and nongovernmental organizations that are involved in developing and/or implementing policies that encourage broadening participation at regional and national levels;  Practitioners team: the broad range of recruitment, student support, advisement and academic programs that students experience along a STEM career;  Research team:  researchers focusing on interventions and activities relevant to broadening participation;  Employers team:  consists of public and private entities that employ people to work in STEM fields or require some background in STEM.   The eight stakeholders groups involved in the Research to Practice Prosperity Game developed the following summary recommendations:  MSIs are in an ideal position and must be strongly involved in identifying, testing and disseminating evidence-based and culturally-relevant best practices in broadening participation, influencing action within the larger stakeholder community, including generation of resources needed to transform K-16 STEM curricula.   MSI Partner Institutions should assume a stronger role in providing research and evaluation resources as needed to assess the effectiveness of STEM program components at MSIs and their feeder schools to assist in identifying best practices and creating culturally relevant resources. K-12 schools should provide Master STEM teachers to engage with local community and 4-year colleges for co-teaching and professional development.  Communities add value to all stakeholder strategies, which should involve explicit positive impact for diverse types of community across scope and scale.  Policy and Advocacy agencies and organizations should convene stakeholders to identify effective mechanisms for incentivizing innovation in STEM curriculum and alternate forms of credentialing.  Practitioners (teachers, counselors, other student support staff) should work collaboratively and systematically across K-20 to facilitate research in STEM education, leverage human and material resources and actively participate in STEM decision-making.  Researchers must identify strategies for transforming education research and evaluation to be culturally relevant, strategic, collaborative and community-based.  Employers should invest in the talented diverse student pool, with increased st...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
