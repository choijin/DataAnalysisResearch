<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future program of the Chemistry Division, Professors David Baker of the University of Washington and Todd Yeates of the University of California, Los Angeles will develop robust methods for the design of complex protein-based nanomaterials.  The research project will integrate theory, computation, and experiment to describe the possible space of symmetric protein assemblies and develop methods for the rapid and reliable production of novel materials.  An atlas of theoretical symmetric architectures will be delineated and integrated with cutting-edge protein structure modeling software to identify novel amino acid sequences predicted to self-assemble into precisely defined structures.  The corresponding proteins will be produced experimentally and their structures determined at high resolution to provide feedback for the improvement of both the theoretical and computational aspects of the program.  In this way, a general approach for patterning complex protein-based materials with sub-nanometer resolution will be developed that is expected to have a profound impact on the fields of molecular self-assembly and nanomaterials.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biological systems use proteins to carry out complex tasks at the molecular level.  Proteins are "oligomers":  they are composed  of multiple chemical subunits linked together in a long chain.  The chain must fold into a specific, complex shape in order for the protein to become functional.  Additionally, protein units can interact to form larger structures that perform an array of chemical and mechanical functions.  This research project involves a joint experimental and computational effort to design proteins that can fold and assemble into preordained structures.  Long-term outcomes of this basic research could include the development of new types of medicines, materials with unprecedented properties, and other useful chemical technologies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal of this project was to integrate theory, computation and experiment to develop methods for the predictable design of new protein-based nanomaterials with complex structures and functions not achievable with current approaches. The project was intended to be highly iterative, with each round of experimental results being used to further improve the theory and computational methodology. During the lifetime of this award, we produced a series of the largest geometrically designed protein assemblies ever created in the laboratory, representing major achievements in the field of nanomaterials.  We developed general methods for modeling symmetric protein architectures within the publicly available and widely distributed Rosetta protein design software, allowing the design of protein nanocages made of one or two components that self-assemble. More recently we designed and experimentally characterized co-assembling two-component 120 subunit icosahedral protein nanostructures with molecular weights and dimensions comparable to small viral capsids. These large protein nanocages are highly customizable and should have considerable utility in targeted drug delivery, vaccine design and synthetic biology. We have also made signficant achievements in the design of 1- and 2-dimensional protein arrays and protein fibers. The ability to design large-scale materials with atomic-level accuracy and controllable assembly opens the door to a new generation of genetically programmable protein-based molecular machines.  As a stepping stone to building nanomaterials from robust de novo designed building blocks, we developed general methods for designing novel idealized repeat proteins. Repeat proteins are composed of repeated modules similar to interlocking Lego blocks. Our results show that it is possible to design totally new proteins with precisely specified geometries that go far beyond what nature has achieved. These results open up a wide array of new possibilites for biomolecular engineering.  As a theoretical foundation for the design work, we have used group theory to work out the geometric rules for assembling protein-based materials by combining together two symmetries. We have published rules for both designing closed cages and for two-dimensional layers.       Last Modified: 12/30/2016       Submitted by: David Baker]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
