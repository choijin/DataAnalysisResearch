<AbstractNarration>1335990&lt;br/&gt;Sankaran&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Carbon nanomaterials are a special class of materials with a diverse range of structures and unparalleled electronic, photonic, and chemical properties that have elicited interest for a wide-range of technological applications.  This project will study the homogeneous nucleation of carbon nanomaterials in a novel microplasma process.   Microplasmas are non-equilibrium, atmospheric-pressure plasmas formed in confined electrode geometries that allow particles to be nucleated and rapidly quenched to limit their final size and agglomeration.  Preliminary results have shown that nanodiamond, carbon clusters less than 5 nm in size exhibiting diamond phase, can be produced at near ambient conditions, far from the thermodynamic stability of diamond, by dissociation of ethanol vapor in a microplasma.  This project will extend these experiments to the formation of other carbon allotropes including fullerene and graphene.  Dissociation of carbon precursors in the microplasma with varying C:H:O ratios will be characterized by optical emission spectroscopy to relate radical species such as carbon dimers and atomic hydrogen to particle nucleation.  Particle nucleation will be monitored in real time by aerosol mobility measurements.  The as-grown carbon nanomaterials will be collected and further characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, micro Raman spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.  A particularly important aspect of the work will be to explore the influence of quenching rate on particle formation by pulsing the microplasma at different frequencies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide new insight into the formation of carbon nanomaterials.  By linking plasma chemistry to material structure, an empirical model for homogeneous nucleation analogous to chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of thin films will be developed.  Size-structure relationships such as the stability of nanodiamond will be established by varying the residence time and quench rate in the microplasma.  Ultimately, the research will enable the structure of carbon nanomaterials to be controlled at nucleation so that it is possible to tune their properties for various applications.  The research activities will provide educational opportunities for graduate, undergraduate, and high school students, and be a part of an elective course on nanotechnology at a local high school.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Carbon nanomaterials are extremely diverse in both structure and properties ranging from layered, sheet-like graphite or graphene which is an excellent conductor, to spherical nanodiamonds which can contain bright color centers.  Whereas graphite is well-known to be the thermodynamically favored form of carbon at the bulk scale, atomic-scale calculations have predicted that at the nanoscale, diamond is more stable.  However, the nucleation, growth, and stability of different forms of carbon nanomaterials has not been carefully studied and no single process has been developed that can tune their structure by controlling process conditions.  In this project, the nucleation and growth of different allotropes of carbon nanomaterials was studied in plasma-based processes where the carbon precursors are dissociated non-thermally and nanostructures are nucleated free of any substrate.  In particular, the influence of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in the precursor and the potential of seeding the growth with another nanoparticle material was explored.  The following outcomes resulted from the research activities:  We successfully showed the formation of nanodiamonds using a direct-current, atmospheric-pressure microplasma setup from ethanol and methanol vapor which contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in different ratios (Nat. Comm. 2013).  A key difference between ethanol and methanol was the fragmentation of the precursor: ethanol produced significantly more C2 radical while methanol produced significantly more CHx radical and as a result, ethanol produced significantly more nondiamond carbon particles.   The direct-current, atmospheric-pressure microplasma process suffered from very low production rates.  To address this issue, we studied an atmospheric-pressure, dielectric barrier discharge powered by high voltage alternating current.  We introduced the idea of capillary injection to control particle size distributions (J. Phys. D 2015), and showed one potential path to scale up and its effect on particle size distributions (J. Phys. D 2017). We studied the possibility of seeding the plasma process to improve selectivity towards a desired form of carbon nanomaterial.  In particular, we carried out experiments with silicon nanoparticles grown from silane.  While mixing silane with the carbon precursor did not improve nanodiamond formation, we confirmed that silicon nanoparticles synthesized in a plasma process could serve as seeds for chemical vapor deposition (CVD)-grown diamond.
