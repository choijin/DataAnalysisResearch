<AbstractNarration>Accurate model predictions of future atmospheric CO2 levels are critical for anticipating and planning for the impact of climate change. Since about one-quarter of fossil fuel combustion-derived CO2 is taken up by the ocean, accurate models of this uptake process are essential to accurately forecast the earth's climate. Models of the earth's carbon cycle are complex because of the many processes affecting atmospheric CO2 and its cycling between the atmosphere, terrestrial biota, and ocean. Thus, comparison between model output and observations is an essential step to evaluating model performance and improving climate predictions. In this study, researchers from the University of Washington will aim to improve the validity of the ocean component of the Earth System Model using new and historic datasets of a carbon tracer. Results from this study will increase the accuracy of the model's predicted cycling of anthropogenic CO2 in the ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The research will provide a better understanding of, and improved model simulations and forecasts of the changing ocean carbon cycle, ultimately contributing to climate research. The project will support a postdoctoral researcher, who will further their expertise in carbon cycle research and advance their scientific career.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Observed changes in the 13C/12C of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the ocean provide a means to better understand the ocean?s uptake of and impact on atmospheric CO2.  During our research in this grant, we demonstrated and exploited four key characteristics of the 13C tracer provide information otherwise not available from carbon measurements alone.   1)  The air-sea 13C disequilibrium is, in most ocean regions, quantifiable  2)  Ocean 13C provides a signal/noise advantage for anthropogenic CO2  3) Ocean CO2 transports can be diagnosed from 13C measurements alone  The fact that air-sea CO2 fluxes (item 1) and the accumulation rate of the anthropogenic DIC change (item 2) can be readily computed means that we can determine transport rates of anthropogenic DIC in the ocean interior based on observations alone.  This is not possible for anthropogenic DIC itself.  A regional imbalance between 13C inventory changes and air-sea 13C fluxes must be due to transports in the ocean interior (Fig. 1).   In this effort we quantified regional patterns of uptake and accumulation of anthropogenic CO2 in the Pacific Basin.  We found that the accumulation rate of anthropogenic DIC inventory in the South Pacific Ocean between 40?S and 60?S was significantly greater than the air-sea CO2 flux in the region, which indicated that most of the local accumulation of the anthropogenic signal had been imported, likely via Northward transport from the Southern Ocean.  We took an added step of attempting to distinguish contemporary 13CO2 fluxes and transports (Fig. 1) from anthropogenic 13CO2 fluxes and transports.  This requires an estimate of the preindustrial 13C condition.  This was done using 3-D model output by subtracting the model?s industrial-era change in the 13C air-sea disequilibrium from the measured contemporary air-sea 13C disequilibrium.    4) 13C changes in the ocean are sensitive to changes in overturning at high latitudes  Because of the 10x slower air-sea13C equilibration time and temperature dependence of the 13C equilibrium state, 13C provides a key diagnostic of changes in water mass formation conditions in high latitude regions thought to exert longer-term influences on atmospheric CO2.  We evaluated recent re-occupations of 2000s and 1990s hydrographic sections that include the 13C.  In the South Pacific Ocean we observed a significant decline in the rate of anthropogenic 13C change during 2005-2014 period as compared with 1991-2005 (Fig. 2).    As part of this research effort, we examined available 13C datasets for possible decadal changes in d13C accumulation. In the Atlantic and Indian Oceans we concluded that the decadal trends seen in the South Pacific basin uptake of anthropogenic 13C were either missed by the timing of the sampling, or that the uptake has been largely steady.  This grant funded a postdoctoral researcher?s training in modeling and interpretation of 13C in the ocean C-cycle.  Dr. Mariona Claret incorporated 13C into a state of the art ocean GCM for climate studies.  That 13C code is now in use in some of the next-generation climate models participating in the Climate Model Intercomparison Project 6.  Dr. Claret incorporated the 13C into an efficient gas-exchange and Iron, Light, and Nutrient controlled oceanic biological cycling scheme.  The 13C code has been fully tested and now incorporated into the 3-D ice-ocean component of a widely used Earth System Model, ESM2M.    BLING-13C is a significant improvement over our prior model versions that had been used to help interpret the transports of anthropogenic CO2 and 13C in the Ocean.  In the Pacific, the earlier models overestimated equatorial upwelling, and upwelled waters from too deep, overestimating sea to air transports of natural (preindustrial) CO2 in that retion.  BLING-13C exhibits more realistic oceanic response to the anthropogenic 13C change, with very small 13C changes in the high latitude Southern Ocean, due to rapid overturning, and, in the Pacific basin, mimics the east to west increases in the 13C response seen in observations (Fig. 3).   Dr. Claret's first important finding is that regional sea-air and accumulation budgets can be reconstructed from the limited 13C fields available.  She used model output to confirm that the air-sea disequilibrium, coupled with local accumulation, can be leveraged to actually, from observations (no model) alone, quantify transport of anthropogenic CO2 in the ocean interior.   Dr. Claret also noted that BLING-13C had a tendency to underestimate meridional variability in the 13C of sea surface CO2.  She tested the hypothesis that the wind-speed dependence of air-sea gas exchange may be the culprit ? the model overestimates 13C in regions like the southern ocean where winds are high and 13C is thermodynamically driven upwards.  Dr. Claret ran an experiment that concluded that meridional and inter-basin trends in 13C in the ocean can be used to further constrain the wind-speed dependence of air-sea exchange              Dr. Claret?s findings provide additional tools for understanding the ocean?s impact on atmospheric CO2 going forward, providing a means to more accurately predict future climate.
