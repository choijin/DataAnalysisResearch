<AbstractNarration>In cognitive radio networks, to avoid interference with licensed users, unlicensed users must vacate the spectrum accessed by the primary users. Since it takes some time for the unlicensed users to detect and switch to other available spectrum, the ongoing data transmission may have to be interrupted, leading to poor data access performance. Although there is a lot of research on cognitive radio networks, not much work has been done on data access.  This project focuses on three intertwined issues to support resilient and efficient data access: (i) Various topology control protocols which carefully assign communication channels considering network robustness and channel interference to achieve better data accessibility, are designed and evaluated;  (ii) Delay-constrained caching techniques are introduced to deal with primary user appearance, where data is cached/replicated at appropriate nodes to statistically limit the data access delay; (iii) Spectrum-aware data replication schemes are designed to improve data access performance in intermittently connected cognitive radio networks, by considering both node mobility pattern and primary user appearance.  This project will make significant theoretical and technological advances in understanding and supporting resilient and efficient data access in cognitive radio networks. The success of this project is likely to have a broader impact on making cognitive radio networks more affordable and amenable to commercial, civilian, and military applications.  The results of the project will be disseminated widely through high quality publications and presentations. The proposed research will also be integrated with the education curricula at the Pennsylvania State University.</AbstractNarration>

Through this project, various techniques have been developed to support resilient and efficient data access in cognitive radio networks by mitigating the effects of primary user appearance.  First, we have designed and evaluated robust topology control protocols to achieve better data accessibility.  In cognitive radio networks, network topology can be affected by spectrum assignment. Thus, the operating spectrum for each user has to be carefully assigned to satisfy the robustness constraint, i.e., the network is not partitioned when primary users appear.  We have proposed centralized and distributed algorithms based on channel hopping techniques, derived their performance bounds, and proved their correctness. Evaluation results show that our solutions outperform existing interference-aware approaches substantially when primary users appear.  Second, to reduce the data access delay, we have investigated caching techniques in cognitive radio networks.  By caching data at multiple places in the network, data can be accessed from nearby nodes to reduce the interruption for data transmission caused by primary user appearance, and then reducing the data access delay. Since caching data also associates with some cost such as the bandwidth and energy consumed on disseminating data to the caching nodes, we design caching algorithms to reduce various caching cost while satisfying the delay constraint.  We have formulated the cache placement problem in cognitive radio networks as an optimization problem, and proposed three approaches: cost-based, delay-based and hybrid.

Third, we have designed and evaluated data replication schemes to improve data access performance in intermittently connected cognitive radio networks.  As with caching, the problem here is to determine the best locations within the network for replication and complex modelling approaches are required to deal with primary user appearance. Making decisions on where to replicate data cannot be based solely on the accessibility of a node to other nodes, but spectrum availability as well.  In order to determine what to replicate and where, we have designed a spectrum-aware scheme based on node contact frequency, primary user appearance and node mobility pattern. Trace-driven simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the average data retrieval probability within the constraints of storage space and time.  Many of the research results have been integrated with the education curricula at the Pennsylvania State University. The project has supported three Ph.D.  students working on their dissertations and two undergraduate students have participated in the research. The involvement of the graduate and undergraduate students will prepare them for leadership roles in computer science research, academia, and industry.
