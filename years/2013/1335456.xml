<AbstractNarration>The overall objective of this research is to experimentally determine the unsaturated hydraulic properties of expansive clays while, at the same time, gain insight into the relationships between these hydraulic characteristics and the magnitude of swelling.  Accounting for the soil volumetric strains as an additional variable within the framework of unsaturated hydraulic characteristics adds complexity to the already intricate, non-linear relationships representing the response of volumetric water content and hydraulic conductivity as a function of the soil matric suction.  This investigation will use centrifuge technology to allow measurement of the unsaturated hydraulic characteristics and associated volumetric changes in expansive clays.  Specifically, centrifuge testing will be used for the continuous and expeditious measurement of the changing soil moisture content, suction, hydraulic conductivity and void ratio that occur during unsaturated flow.  This study will allow: (i) gaining insight into the relationships between unsaturated hydraulic properties and volume changes in highly plastic clays, (ii) expeditiously determining the hydraulic properties of highly plastic clays, (iii) understanding the boundary conditions and stresses in clay specimens subjected to open flow centrifugation, (iv) quantifying the effect of normal stress, initial moisture content, initial void ratio, soil fabric and imposed inflow rate on the magnitude and rate of swelling, and (v) developing models that are suitable to represent the soil water retention curve, the hydraulic conductivity function, and the swell-stress relationship of expansive clays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Because of conceptual and experimental complexities, the characterization of unsaturated hydraulic properties of expansive clays has remained largely unexplored.  Yet, significant benefits will result from gaining insight into the variables governing the unsaturated flow in expansive clays, as the annual cost of damages in the US induced by moisture fluctuations in expansive soils has been reported to exceed that caused by floods, hurricanes, earthquakes and tornadoes combined.  The broader impacts resulting from the proposed activity include: (i) using centrifuge testing not only for geotechnical modeling but also for hydraulic characterization of expansive clays, (ii) increasing community awareness of the problems associated with the presence of expansive clays, (iii) transferring of fundamental findings from this research into practical recommendations, and (iv) developing educational modules that are useful to integrate research into geotechnical instruction as well as to introduce geo-hazards concepts into outreach minority programs.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>A number of experimental techniques and analytical methods, with emphasis on centrifuge testing, were implemented in this research to characterize the hydro-mechanical behavior of unsaturated clays. In particular, experimental procedures and back-analysis methods were developed to determine the Soil Water Retention Surface (SWRS) and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (k-function) of clays, both of low and high plasticity.</p> <p>The new experimental devices and non-intrusive sensors were developed specifically to incorporate four key variables that control unsaturated flow processes: moisture content, suction, volumetric changes and hydraulic conductivity. The new equipment and sensors are capable of monitoring all relevant variables without interfering with the flow process or volumetric changes. Specifically, two nonintrusive sensor systems were implemented to upgrade the capabilities of the centrifuge permeameter for unsaturated soils (CPUS): a water content sensor, the GTDR, based on Time Domain Reflectometry (Figure 1), and an image analysis tool to quantify soil deformation in-flight. When combined, both systems allowed for continuous monitoring of the volumetric and water content changes in-flight. With these tools, experimental data was generated for the SWRS and hydraulic conductivity of clays, using steady-state and transient procedures. In addition, a new workbench equipment, the ATX Cell (Figure 2), was developed to facilitate the characterization of the hydromechanical behavior of unsaturated clays by simultaneously monitoring the void ratio, matric suction and water content. It allows testing clays under different imposed stresses, a feature that was particularly relevant to testing on expansive clays.</p> <p>The hydraulic properties of an unsaturated low plasticity clay (RMA soil) were evaluated via centrifuge testing using the new sensors and other standard experimental techniques (Figures 3 and 4). The RMA soil?s SWRS was determined over a wide range of void ratio values with samples compacted at optimum water content. Although volumetric changes measured in the ATX Cell were negligible, the level of deformation in RMA soil samples measured during centrifuge testing was found to depend on the initial conditions and stresses imposed during testing. A comparison between destructive and non-destructive measurements revealed that destructive measurements result in changes that affect the measured volumetric water content and degree of saturation profiles. Non-intrusive sensors were found to solve this problem and improve the definition of the SWRS. The RMA k-function was evaluated using steady-state and transient methods.</p> <p>Gardner?s outflow method was applied to the transient measurements obtained from the ATX Cell, and Hydrus 1-D code was implemented to determine the k-function using transient information from centrifuge tests. Hydrus-1D overestimated the saturated hydraulic conductivity. However, the k-function was found to show good agreement with the hydraulic conductivity values obtained using the steady-state (imposed flow) approach. The hydro-mechanical behavior of an unsaturated high plasticity clay, Eagle Ford, was characterized implementing all the sensors, devices and testing approaches previously developed in this research. Special focus was placed on the hydraulic properties as well as swelling characteristics of this clay. The inclusion of the void ratio as an additional variable was found to be particularly relevant when interpreting the experimental data and defining the SWRS and k-function of the clay. The ATX Cell was used to evaluate the hydro-mechanical characteristics of Eagle Ford clay by monitoring the void ratio and water changes through different suction stages under different values of imposed stresses. The volume and water content changes were found to depend on the initial void ratio and stresses imposed. A coupled behavior was identified between the swelling and inflow rates.</p> <p>Results from centrifuge tests on Eagle Ford clay showed that volume changes occur as a result of the coupled effect of imposed stresses and water content changes. Image analysis detected the swelling and contraction of the soil in-flight successfully. The volumetric water content measured via GTDRs matched the values measured using semi-destructive techniques. Use of the GTDRs and image analysis facilitated obtaining experimental data to define the SWRS of Eagle Ford clay using centrifuge testing. A comparison between two centrifuge (hydrostatic) tests performed at 100g and 200g showed that the void was reduced due to the higher imposed stresses, and consequently a larger portion of the sample remained saturated despite the higher suction imposed. Despite the higher hydraulic gradient, the flow velocity was smaller in the second test due to a possible reduction in hydraulic conductivity. While steady-state techniques were successful implemented for low plasticity clays, this approach was time-consuming for high plasticity clays. The interpretation of transient information became useful to determine the hydraulic conductivity. Swelling tests performed in the centrifuge showed that volumetric water content increased rapidly during primary swelling, while secondary swelling occurred under an approximately constant degree of saturation. Volumetric changes along the sample were defined using the image analysis tools, providing additional information to generate the swell-stress curve. &nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/23/2019<br>      Modified by: Jorge&nbsp;G&nbsp;Zornberg</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1335456/1335456_10265871_1553355401654_Figure1-GTDR--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1335456/1335456_10265871_1553355401654_Figure1-GTDR--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1 - GTDR"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1335456/1335456_10265871_1553355401654_Figure1-GTDR--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1 - GTDR"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">View of GTDR used for in-flight monitoring of moisture content</div> <div class="imageCredit">Gaston Quaglia</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jorge&nbsp;G&nbsp;Zornberg</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1 - GTDR</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1335456/1335456_10265871_1553355484924_Figure2-ATXCell--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1335456/1335456_10265871_1553355484924_Figure2-ATXCell--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2 - ATX Cell"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1335456/1335456_10265871_1553355484924_Figure2-ATXCell--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2 - ATX Cell"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">View of the ATX Cell for 1g monitoring of moisture content and volumetric changes</div> <div class="imageCredit">Gaston Quaglia</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jorge&nbsp;G&nbsp;Zornberg</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2 - ATX Cell</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1335456/1335456_10265871_1553355636671_Figure3-Largecentrifuge--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1335456/1335456_10265871_1553355636671_Figure3-Largecentrifuge--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3 - Geo-hydraulic centrifuge at The University  of Texas"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1335456/1335456_10265871_1553355636671_Figure3-Largecentrifuge--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3 - Geo-hydraulic centrifuge at The University  of Texas"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">View of the Geo-hydraulic centrifuge at the University of Texas at Austin</div> <div class="imageCredit">Gaston Quaglia</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jorge&nbsp;G&nbsp;Zornberg</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 3 - Geo-hydraulic centrifuge at The University  of Texas</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1335456/1335456_10265871_1553355735828_Figure4-SampleinCentrifuge--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1335456/1335456_10265871_1553355735828_Figure4-SampleinCentrifuge--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 4 - Sample in Centrifuge"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1335456/1335456_10265871_1553355735828_Figure4-SampleinCentrifuge--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 4 - Sample in Centrifuge"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">View of a soil sample ready for centrifuge testing</div> <div class="imageCredit">Gaston Quaglia</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Jorge&nbsp;G&nbsp;Zornberg</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 4 - Sample in Centrifuge</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
