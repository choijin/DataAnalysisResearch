<AbstractNarration>To date, less than a thousand profiles of turbulence have been acquired in the deep ocean and these are concentrated in only a few geographic regions. As a result of this paucity of direct measurements, the distribution of mixing is inferred largely through proxies and parameterizations that have known limitations. Mixing budgets remain poorly constrained. The purpose of this pilot project is to demonstrate that systematic, repeated sequences of turbulent mixing over full-ocean depths can be obtained in a broad distribution throughout the global ocean. To accomplish this goal, the investigators in this project will deploy chi-pods - "turbulent mixing meters" on standard shipboard CTD/LADCPs package operated by the Global Repeat Hydrography Program. A few thousand turbulence profiles will be collected and analyzed over a three-year period. The chi-pods are self-contained instruments that have been quantifying mixing on equatorial moorings since 2005. They use fast response thermistors and precision accelerometers to measure microscale temperature gradients, from which the dissipation rate of temperature variance, รท and the eddy diffusivity of heat and other tracers. Unlike traditional velocity microstructure measurements based on shear probes, temperature microstructure measurements are not sensitive to platform vibration - a necessity for deployment on moorings with a surface expression or from a CTD rosette. The CTD-chi-pod has modifications that allow it to be easily clamped to a standard rosette with minimal impact during repeat hydrography operations, and has been proven successful in several recent pilot experiments in shallower waters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Diapycnal mixing in the ocean interior has a strong influence on upper ocean heat and nutrient budgets, abyssal circulation, and water mass distributions. An initial attempt to develop and implement parameterizations of diapycnal mixing for large-scale models is underway as part of an NSF-funded Climate Process Team. The largest impediment to that effort is the incredible scarcity of direct turbulence observations, particularly those that cover the full water column depth. This project will demonstrate the feasibility and value of collecting a global dataset of microstructure observations that will be made publicly available as soon as possible after acquisition, following repeat hydrography protocols. The data will allow the PIs, as well as the broader scientific community, to  calculate better global and regional averages of diapycnal mixing rates, explore underlying dynamics that control the geographic distribution of ocean turbulence, evaluate gradual changes in basin-averaged mixing rates, assess uncertainty and systematic bias in finescale shear and strain parameterizations of mixing that are becoming widely used, and validate turbulence parameterizations that will be going into the next generation of regional and climate models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed measurements will be the first comprehensive set of direct mixing observations easily available to the broader community. These measurements can be used by a wide range of scientists to constrain everything from regional tracer budgets to biological nutrient fluxes to global energetics. The results will be particularly useful for testing and improving parameterizations of turbulent mixing being developed for global climate models (http://www-pord.ucsd.edu/~jen/cpt/), as diapycnal mixing rates remain one of the most influential tuning parameters in such models. This project will train one graduate student and give other students exposure to open-ocean observational techniques.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The world's oceans are responsible for storing the majority of the heat available within the Earth's global climate system.  The ways in which heat gets redistributed in the ocean is largely through turbulence-enhanced mixing - a process similar to that by which cream is first mechanically stirred and subsequently thermodynamically mixed in our morning cup of coffee.  In the ocean, the energy for stirring comes from a combination of winds and tides, which fuel a complicated cascade of motions that typically originates at very large scales (the scales of a weather system) and ultimately drives small turbulent eddies similar to the size of a penny.  This turbulence-enhanced mixing alters water composition (for example, it dilutes rivers flowing into coastal waters), and is responsible for the redistributions of heat, salt and dissolved gases like CO2 throughout the ocean.  This redistribution affects surface water temperatures, thereby impacting the strengths of monsoons and tropical storms and can affect the freezing and thawing of sea ice.   In addition, recent work has shown that the spatial and temporal variability in deep-ocean mixing may play a critical role in climate; understanding the physics that drives the distribution of deep-ocean mixing intensity is believed to be critical for improving ocean climate predictions.   Quantifying ocean mixing has historically required specialized measurement procedures and instrumentation. As a result, turbulence has not been measured during routine ocean surveying, but has instead required dedicated expeditions.   As a consequence, there is sparse global coverage of mixing rates.  Up until now, the only way to estimate patterns of mixing is from proxies &amp; parameterizations, or using indirect methods to infer mixing. The NSF SYSDMM project represents the first step in a long-term effort to obtain turbulent mixing during all Global Repeat Hydrography Program cruises.  Because these cruises sample broad expanses of the world's oceans, they represent a great opportunity to substantially increase the ocean science community's inventory of ocean mixing data.  Because these routine surveys are repeated on decadal timescales, they also help to create a benchmark dataset that may help to assess future changes.   This project was a pilot effort. Through this effort, we (1) developed new ocean mixing sensors (called CTD-chipods) that can be deployed on the repeat hydrography cruises, (2) tested the feasibility of repeated measurements, (3) practiced integrating them into the structure and culture of the repeat hydrography cruises, and (4) developed a methodology for processing and interpreting the acquired ocean mixing data.  While we originally budgeted for participation in 2 cruises, we ended up expanding our effort and have successfully acquired full-depth microstructure data on six global cruises, a map of which is included.  The bulk of our analysis time has been spent on the methodology development and validation that is shared with the community and available through the mixing github site described below.   The successful demonstration of CTD-chipods on repeat hydrography cruises relies both on the acquisition of the mixing data as well as the acceptance of the methodology by the ocean science community.  The former has been established; we anticipate that the latter will follow once our paper that describes the methodology, uncertainties and bias is published.  At that time, we hope that these measurements may become part of the standard measurement suite of the repeat hydrography program.
