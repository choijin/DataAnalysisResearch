<AbstractNarration>Atmospheric CO2 rise is one of the most pressing societal and scientific issues, but future projections of&lt;br/&gt;system behavior often rely heavily on models rather than data. Earth underwent a very relevant analog&lt;br/&gt;experiment 200 million years ago, and this project seeks to learn and abstract from that experiment. The&lt;br/&gt;CO2 release associated with the Triassic-Jurassic (T-J) boundary is estimated to have risen at a rate&lt;br/&gt;comparable to the present-day (as a result of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province volcanism, CAMP),&lt;br/&gt;and tellingly, it was associated with a mass extinction. Notably, representatives of the fauna that inhabits&lt;br/&gt;today's seas, the so-called modern fauna were preferentially negatively affected by the T-J event versus other mass extinctions, making the T-J perhaps the most relevant mass extinction with respect to the present-day impact of high CO2 levels on the biosystem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The T-J event is arguably the least studied of the mass extinctions that frame the Mesozoic, and it&lt;br/&gt;represents an underutilized opportunity to investigate a geologically rapid injection of CO2 into the Earth&lt;br/&gt;system. The results of this CO2 pulse are quantifiable, and will serve to establish new models of system&lt;br/&gt;response to punctuated perturbations. The PIs believe that using novel geochemical tracers for&lt;br/&gt;weathering and redox, coupled with biofacies analysis, will result in a paradigm shift in our knowledge of&lt;br/&gt;such an event. The proxies will inform a novel model that links a solid Earth model, carbon cycle model,&lt;br/&gt;and ecological model. This project will help to elucidate the details of the most significant mass extinction&lt;br/&gt;to affect the modern fauna. Moreover, the new models developed for the T-J event will have relevance for&lt;br/&gt;other mass extinctions, including the ongoing Anthropocene event.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One way to understand how the Earth will respond to rising CO2 in the atmosphere today is to look back in the geologic past to a time when CO2 is known to have risen.  Approximately 200 million years ago, the splitting apart of the supercontinent Pangea led to the eruption of tremendous amounts of volcanic material (the so-called Central Atlantic Magmatic Province, or CAMP), and with the lava, CO2 was released.  Thus, the time surrounding the eruption of CAMP constitutes an analogue to study the sensitivity of the Earth System to CO2 input.  Our results show the following:  1. The timing of the eruption/CO2 input overlaps with the End Triassic Mass Extinction, one of the biggest mass extinctions in the geologic record, demonstrated by tracking mercury (Hg), sourced from the eruptions, in the marine rocks that contain the record of the extinction.  The takeaway here is that the Earth experienced one of the most severe die-offs of life in association with the eruption/CO2 rise.  2. The structure of the marine ecosystem changed dramatically.  Before the eruption, coral reefs were prominent, not unlike today.  Corals nearly disappear from the rock record after the extinction and are replaced by sponges.  Geochemical evidence in the form of silicon and lithium isotopes suggest post-CAMP weathering could have delivered abundant silica to the oceans, a nutrient for sponges, that allowed them to take over the shallow marine ecosystem for nearly 2 million years before the corals came back.  The takeaway here was that completely unexpected changes to the ecosystem took place after the extinction.  3. Major changes to the carbon cycle occurred in association with CAMP and the extinction, and they can be tracked by examining the amount of 13C vs. 12C in marine rocks.  For example, it was well known that a negative excursion in the isotopes of carbon occurred in association with the extinction, but it was not known how long the perturbation lasted.  Our work was able to constrain the duration of the carbon perturbations, which turned out to be on the order of 85 thousand years, much longer than some previous estimates.  The takeaway here is that knowing the duration of the carbon cycle perturbation can inform carbon cycle computer models to better understand how the Earth responds to such changes.  With respect to broader impacts, the research activity significantly impacted the careers of multiple scientists.  For example, seven affiliated graduate students/postdocs became assistant professors (all women) during the grant period.  Affiliated personnel engaged in significant outreach, including via the Joint Education Project at USC, where our students take what they learn and bring it to elementary schools in the local community, and other events (e.g., Dino Days at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County).  In Peru, personnel visited local elementary schools to explain what we were doing in their country and why their rocks were so important for our study.
