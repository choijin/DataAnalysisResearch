<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will establish the feasibility and commercial potential of developing software technologies that enable disaster recovery and high availability for cloud-based web applications and mobile app back-ends (apps). The innovations address the key pain points associated with public cloud use as revealed by interviews conducted as part of the NSF I-Corps program: disruption, privacy, and lock-in.  The project plan is to design, develop, and empirically evaluate the utility, scale, and commercial potential of cutting edge proprietary software products that automate and make migration and failover easy for app developers that employ cloud-based services to implement their apps.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project results from its ability to benefit a wide constituency.  On the commercial side, cloud and platform-as-a-service (PaaS) markets are growing at an alarming pace. This project is unique in that it combines the benefits of modern cloud platforms with the key missing pieces of all extant approaches to PaaS:  disaster recovery, easy migration, and hybrid cloud use by apps and data across public and on-premise deployment options. The simplification enabled by this cloud platform with a disaster recovery solution lowers the barrier to entry and reduces both the risk and cost associated with public cloud use.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Small/Medium Businesses and Enterprises alike increasingly rely on cloud computing to automate their information technology, to lower costs, and to simplify the process of making their applications and data available to their customers and employees via the Internet.  Such use results from multiple advantages that public clouds provide, including ease-of-use, automated remote management of compute and storage resources, and making available virtually unlimited resources on a pay-per-use basis. Despite these advantages, public cloud use also comes with costs and risk.  In particular, public cloud systems "lock-in" their users by making it difficult for users to move their applications and data to competitive solutions once deployed.  Moreover, public cloud vendors have unlimited access to private intellectual property of their customers (e.g. applications, data, user activity and access patterns, etc.) that may provide the vendor with commercial advantages.  Finally, public clouds can and do fail, leaving users with little recourse or control despite potentially commercially damaging outages.  In this SBIR Phase I project, we have investigated the feasibility and commercial potential of software technologies that address these limitations associated with public cloud use by making it easy to move applications and data across clouds.  Our technologies leverage the freely available AppScale cloud platform-as-a-service (PaaS) that we have developed, which mirrors Google's public cloud platform using only open source software.  The intellectual merit of the project is a new approach to cloud application and data deployment that facilitates backup, disaster recovery, and automatic migration between competitive public cloud offerings as well as to/from on-premise computer systems.  By doing so, we are able to give cloud application developers control over where they deploy their applications and data, without having to modify their code. Such portability is useful for reducing costs, controlling privacy, and avoiding lock-in and disruption.  This project has enabled us to identify viable commercial products and services that leverage the AppScale platform, to develop new partnerships that enable us to reach more customers, and to establish the feasibility of, and evolve our engineering and technology roadmap to maximize the potential of our commercial viability and success.

In summary, AppScale, coupled with the novel technologies investigated and validated with this SBIR Phase I award, lowers the barrier to entry on and reduces both the risk and cost associated with public cloud use.
