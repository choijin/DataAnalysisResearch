<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic &amp; Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor David R Tyler of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of Oregon will investigate the reactivity of a class of molecules known as radicals.  Radicals are implicated in many important chemical reactions and processes including aging, plastics manufacturing, plastics degradation, photosynthesis, cellular processes, solar energy conversion and storage, and the environmental damage caused by pollutants.  The goals of this research are to understand how radicals react so that we can exploit their development for useful purposes and, when necessary, mitigate their damaging reactivity.  The project lies at the interface of organic, inorganic, organometallic, and biochemistry and is therefore well suited to the education of scientists at all levels.  This research group also has a strong commitment to the education and training of students underrepresented in science.  Outreach activities involving non-science majors and students interested in communicating science to the public will also be part of the funded project.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Radical cage effects have an enormous impact on reactivity in solution, and the overall goal of the project is to uncover the underlying principles that govern radical cage effects so radical reactivity can be understood and interpreted better.  Radical cage pairs will be generated by photolysis of metal-metal or metal-carbon bonds in organometallic molecules.  Both laser pump-probe methods and steady-state irradiation methods will be used to measure the cage effects in these systems.  Experiments are proposed to answer the following fundamental, as yet unanswered, questions.  1. Are cage effects more properly analyzed using solvent microviscosity rather than bulk viscosity?  2. What are the effects of radical mass, size, and shape on the cage effect in systems in which the two radicals in the solvent cage are not identical?  The answer to this question, when combined with the information learned during the investigation of question 1, will provide a quantitative predictive capability that can be applied to a wide variety of different radicals and solvents.  3. Does the cage effect depend on the excitation wavelength used to generate the radicals?  4.  Is the cage effect affected by tensile or shear stress on a molecule?</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project studied a phenomenon that occurs when chemical bonds break during a reaction that occurs in solution.  The phenomenon is known as the "cage effect."  When chemical bonds break, in order for the reaction to continue, it is important for the two parts of the molecule that formed by breaking the bond to move away from each other.  If they don?t move away from each other then the bond will simply reform and there is no net reaction.  It is not easy for the particles to move away from each other because the solvent molecules surrounding the particles act as a "cage," which tends to keep the molecules close to each other.  Chemists have known about the "cage effect" for decades, but we have only a rudimentary knowledge about the factors that determine the efficiency of "cage escape."  It is important to know about the efficiency of "cage escape" because the rates of many important reactions are governed by the "cage escape" efficiency.  For example, the manufacture of plastics is governed by "cage escape" efficiencies.  Likewise, the degradation of pollutants in our lakes and streams is governed by "cage escape" efficiencies.  And, to give just one more example, the degradation of plastics in the environment is governed by the efficiency of the "cage escape" process.  The work supported by this grant focused on two important questions concerning the "cage effect."  The first question we addressed was whether we could predict how much cage escape would occur when a bond is broken.  We showed that we can predict how much cage escape will occur.  Specifically, we showed that the amount of cage escape is proportional to the viscosity of the solvent.  (The viscosity is defined as the resistance to flow of a solvent.)  This makes sense.  If a solvent is viscous (think of molasses) then it is harder for a particle to move away from its partner that is formed when the bond breaks.  Conversely, particle movement is easier when the solvent is not so viscous (water, for example) so escape is more likely.  The problem is actually a bit more subtle, however, because the viscosity that matters is the viscosity in the immediate vicinity of the particle.  We refer to this viscosity as the microviscosity (as opposed to the average viscosity of the solvent, which is referred to as the macroviscosity).  The microviscosity can be very different from the macroviscosity.  Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we developed a method to measure the microviscosity so now we can accurately predict the ratio of "cage escape" to "cage recombination" when a bond breaks.  In a practical application of these results and results from prior support, we showed that "cage effects" are a primary factor in controlling the decomposition rate of plastics.  Importantly, we obtained a mathematical equation that can be used to predict the lifetime of plastics when they are exposed to sunlight.  It is our intention to use this equation to design plastics that degrade after their useful lifetime, thereby preventing the build-up of waste plastics in the environment.  Another question we asked was whether the efficiency of cage escape depended on whether the two particles in the solvent cage were formed from the same precursor or from different precursors.  We showed that when the particles were formed from different precursors they were more likely to escape the cage.  The reason for this is that molecules have to have the correct orientation to undergo reaction (combination) in the solvent cage.  When particles are formed from the same precursor (by bond cleavage) they have the proper orientation so they are more likely to combine.  Particles from different precursors do not typically have the proper orientation so they are less likely to react.  This sounds technical, but these results are important in the manufacture of plastics.  Support from the NSF also enabled my graduate students and me to work on several goals related to the broader impacts of scientific research.  Thus, four colleagues and I developed a course on the "Chemistry of Sustainability" that is taught to 200 non-science majors every spring term.  The course has several themes, including sustainability and green chemistry, as well as the theme that chemists are problem solvers.  These themes give me the opportunity to present lectures on the green aspects of modern chemical production (catalysis, use of "earth-abundant" metals as catalysts, energy efficiency, and process design for fewer pollutants).  My co-teachers and I discuss the value of doing fundamental research (for example, my NSF-supported research) and how the information learned in these studies may someday be used to improve production efforts.  Finally, I note that undergraduate researchers are an important part of my research group.  Fifteen undergraduates worked with me and my graduate students during the grant period.
