<AbstractNarration>A request is made to fund new and replacement instrumentation on the R/V Endeavor, a 185' general purpose research vessel operated by the University of Rhode Island as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The R/V Endeavor is a well-equipped, intermediate sized research vessel that is owned by NSF and operated under a Charter Party Agreement by the University of Rhode Island. The vessel was built in 1976 and refit in 1993. She can carry up to 17 scientists on cruises up to 30 days in duration. The vessel supports projects from all disciplines of oceanography.  In 2012, R/V Endurance completed 215 days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 123 days or 57% of the total sailing schedule. In 2013, R/V Endeavor is scheduled for 205 days with NSF days accounting for 54% (111 days) of the total sailing schedule.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Oceanographic instrumentation requested in this proposal includes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MC-800 Multicorer $37,515&lt;br/&gt;Upgrade of CTD Connectors and Cables $35,212&lt;br/&gt; $72,727&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;        &lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two of the Proposal Guidelines. They provide infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

This style connector has been recommended by Sea-Bird as a higher priced, optional upgrade on new CTDs since 2003.  The awarded funds were in fact used to replace all cables and connectors on our CTD systems.

The value of the upgrade is minimization of down time caused by both subtle, long term corrosion, and by sudden connector failure due to the difficulty of removing and re-mating the old style connectors.  According to Sea-Bird, corrosion on the old style connector pins is a common cause of noisy and intermittent data as well as channel and whole instrument failure during CTD casts.  The problem with the old style connectors is that they do not exclude water when mated so that a bit of salt water can enter the connector and corrosion can begin.

According to Sea-Bird, corrosion on the old style connector pins is a common cause of noisy and intermittent data as well as channel and whole instrument failure during CTD casts. There is a wealth of anecdotal evidence from Endeavor cruises that bolstered this assessment.
