<AbstractNarration>This award supports the travel of US doctoral students to, and their participation in the Twelfth International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 2013), and the doctoral consortium to be held in conjunction with it.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AAMAS is the premier international conference devoted to all aspects of agent technology and its applications in the World Wide Web, electronic commerce, digital libraries, search, personalization, etc. The Doctoral Consortium offers the students an opportunity to present their research  and receive in-depth feedback from  senior researchers. Students will benefit from  attending  the conference, with its rich technical program of contributed and invited research talks, complemented by focused workshops, tutorials and other events. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The student travel awards will help enrich the eduation and training of a diverse group of young researchers, including women and members of underrepresented groups, working in Artificial Intelligence in general, and Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems in particular.</AbstractNarration>
