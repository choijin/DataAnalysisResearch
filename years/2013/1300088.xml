<AbstractNarration>With this award from the Chemical Synthesis Program, Prof. Robert A. Stockland Jr. from Bucknell University will synthesize unique P-metallated nucleosides through phosphorus-hydrogen (P-H) activation of hydrogen phosphonates and related compounds using organometallic complexes as precursors.  These metallated nucleosides will serve as transfer agents in a new base-free cross-coupling reaction that will be developed for the synthesis of P-arylated derivatives.  The cross-coupling chemistry will be expanded to include heteroaryl substrates through the incorporation of nitrogen, sulfur, and oxygen-containing aromatic heterocycles.  Detailed mechanistic studies will shed light on key reaction intermediates as well as the electronic and steric scope of the reaction.  Furthermore, the synthesis of new derivatives through the exchange of one metal center for another will be investigated in order to expand the scope of the chemistry and incorporate metal centers that have a rich history in electrochemistry or photophysics.  The metallated nucleosides will also be used as building blocks in the synthesis of unique metal-organic architectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will lead to the development of new synthetic methodology for the preparation of functionalized nucleosides.  These new compounds are high-value targets due to their potential applications in medicine and chemical biology.  Furthermore, this work will generate strategies for the synthesis of compounds with unique geometries and reactivity profiles that are not accessible with current methods.   Experiments designed to probe the importance of specific structural motifs will be carried out to refine the synthetic procedures and design second-generation catalysts.  The undergraduate researchers involved in these projects will gain valuable laboratory experience in several areas of chemistry and will hone their critical thinking and problem solving skills.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit. The bulk of the project was devoted to developing a greater understanding of how to make and use P-metalated nucleosides.  This unusual class of compounds has been challenging to prepare due to a lack of available precursors.  We successfully designed a series of reactions that enabled the synthesis of these interesting compounds.  Once in hand, we examined the reactivity of these P-metalated nucleosides with other molecules.  One of the most important reactions in organic synthesis is the selective preparation of molecules that have a specific three-dimensional arrangement.  Typically, chemical reactions tend to generate all possible arrangements.  Using the P-metalated nucleosides, we developed a system for the selective preparation of functionalized nucleosides with a specific three-dimensional arrangement.  During this work we discovered the first example of this type of reaction between gold and palladium and defined the selectivity of the transfer process.  Building on the chemical knowledge obtained while working with the P-metalated nucleosides, we developed a streamlined synthesis of P-arylated spirocycles.  These fascinating compounds are essentially two rings that are connected at a single point.  Previous work with this class of compounds was limited due to the challenges related to the synthetic methodology.  Using our new approach, over 20 new examples of these compounds were prepared and characterized.   Recently, there has been considerable interest in the use of macrocycles to modify the efficacy of bioactive small molecules.  One of the potential applications of this chemistry entails developing new and more selective treatments for cancer.  For breast cancer, managing the effects of b-estradiol (estrogen) and estrogenic materials is a critical concern for estrogen receptor positive breast cancer.  To this end, we developed a 32-membered metallomacrocycle that will recognize and bind estrogen in solution.         Broader impacts.  Many premier scientists point to their undergraduate research experience as a pivotal time in their education.  It is arguably the most meaningful thing we do for our students.  During the course of this project, 13 undergraduate students were involved in the work.  10 of these students are coauthors on manuscripts that have been published or submitted.  The PI is a strong believer that undergraduates need to contribute to the intellectual development of the projects as well as the hands-on work.  As a result, students presented and defend their findings during group meetings as well as at regional and national ACS meetings.  Several of these students have continued their studies in graduate programs while others are currently employed in industrial positions or attending medical school.
