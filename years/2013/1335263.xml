<AbstractNarration>Proposal #: 13-35263&lt;br/&gt;PI(s):  Hu, Fei&lt;br/&gt;  Qahouq, Jaber Abu; Brown, David A.; Gray, Jeffrey G.; Tsoupikova, Daria&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Alabama ? Tuscaloosa&lt;br/&gt;Title:  MRI/Dev.: Robot-aided, Cognitive Virtual Rehabilitation for Automatic Physical Training of &lt;br/&gt;    Individuals with Disabilities (iRAPID) &lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;This project, developing iRAPID, a robot-aided cognitive virtual rehabilitation instrument for automatic physical training of individuals with disabilities, integrates several hardware components (the KineAssist robot, programmable treadmill, biomarkers (sensors) and Xbox kinect sensors) to build an augmented virtual reality animation of the patient. A series of newly developed software tools will support virtual rehab research computations of body balancing and neuro-pattern changes during rehab.&lt;br/&gt;The instrument will be designed to be suitable for three different cost/performance levels, with successive levels making use of more comprehensive sensors. Combining the sensors (e.g., functional NearInfraRed and EEG brain imaging) with physical rehab mechanisms (e.e., treadmill) make possible interesting research areas related to the effectiveness of physical rehabilitation training. Hence, iRAPID will be a cognitive, research-oriented rehab instrument with automatic, accurate rehab training progress computation.  To enable the stated goals, the system should be capable of recording a wealth of sensor measurements. Advancing the next-generation  rehab system, the work&lt;br/&gt;- Adopts a hierarchical (3 layers), incremental (3 modes) development strategy,&lt;br/&gt;- Supports computational rehabilitation research, and&lt;br/&gt;- Adopts evolution-oriented software design.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The instrumentation enables research an education of an exciting new field, Cognitive ElectroBiomedical Systems (CEBS), enables the training in CEEBS of two PhD students, and outreach to minorities. CEBS is a trans-disciplinary (TrD) field has distinguished features compared to multi-disciplinary (MuD) and inter-disciplinary (InD). The authors compare these fields to a cake where different ingredients are not easily distinguishable (TrD) giving a new format product,  and a plate of salad that still has clear existence of different ingredients ((InD).  The PhD training program will have a training structure  included TrD/MuD/InD curriculum and service learning. The Director of Multicultural Engineering Program (MEP) will assist in involving underrepresented students with summer CAMP and K-12 activities. This development is likely to highly contribute within an EPSCoR jurisdiction.</AbstractNarration>

Instead of relying on labor-intensive manual rehab training, iRAPID is a <em>cognitive, research-oriented</em> rehab instrument with automatic, accurate rehab training progress computation. To achieve the above goal, this project has performed seamless integration of the units including the robot (called KineAssist), treadmill, augmented virtual reality (AVR), and some bio-markers such as medical/gait/acoustic sensors. Here, AVR refers to the embedding of reconstructed 3D body motion (captured via Kinect) into a virtual reality animation scene. &nbsp;This development has been undertaken in-house, rather than through published designs in the literature. We have customized the wired and wireless communication interfaces among hardware units. Specifically, this iRAPID design has followed a novel instrument development methodology with a hierarchical, incremental, and extendable (via our invented software evolution model) style. This instrument development has benefited from a team of rehab/computer scientists, electrical/mechanical engineers, and industry technician who has brought complementary skills to this project. Its design has involved the knowledge of rehab science, signal processing, machine learning, software engineering, sensors, communications, robotics, circuit design, and VR animation design. It is based on a quantitative evaluation of the virtual rehab performance.</p> <p>2. Broader Impacts: This project has great impacts on rehab engineering and education. (1) The iRAPID provides significant new capabilities that are not available from an instrument provided by a vendor: First, none of the existing vendors can provide such an integrated hardware system with seamless inter-operations among the co-robot (KineAssist), treadmill, wireless sensors, and VR units. Second, we are the first team to build a series of software tools to support virtual rehab research with accurate, automatic computation of body balancing levels and neuro-pattern changes during rehab. (2) This iRAPID instrument, which has been successfully developed, has enabled the research and education of an exciting new field - called Cognitive ElectroBiomedical Systems (CEBS). Just like a revolutionary field proposed two decades ago - microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), CEBS is also a transdisciplinary (TrD) field which has distinguished features compared to multi-disciplinary (MuD) and inter-disciplinary (InD) fields. Multiple PhD students have published high-quality papers based on this instrument design.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/25/2018<br>      Modified by: Fei&nbsp;Hu</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1335263/1335263_10273159_1540495751693_fig1-robot--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1335263/1335263_10273159_1540495751693_fig1-robot--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Robot architecture"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1335263/1335263_10273159_1540495751693_fig1-robot--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Robot architecture"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This figure shows the main components of our developed robot for rehab purpose.</div> <div class="imageCredit">original</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Fei&nbsp;Hu</div> <div class="imageTitle">Robot architecture</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1335263/1335263_10273159_1540495820323_fig3-developsteps--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1335263/1335263_10273159_1540495820323_fig3-developsteps--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Instrument development steps"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1335263/1335263_10273159_1540495820323_fig3-developsteps--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Instrument development steps"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This diagram shows our multi-phase instrument development plan.</div> <div class="imageCredit">original</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Fei&nbsp;Hu</div> <div class="imageTitle">Instrument development steps</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1335263/1335263_10273159_1540495902909_fig2-robottest--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1335263/1335263_10273159_1540495902909_fig2-robottest--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Robot test"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1335263/1335263_10273159_1540495902909_fig2-robottest--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Robot test"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This diagram shows our robot testing principle.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Original</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Fei&nbsp;Hu</div> <div class="imageTitle">Robot test</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
