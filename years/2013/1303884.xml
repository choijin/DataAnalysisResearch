<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2013 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Jose Carrion is "Noncommutative Spaces Associated with Groups and Dynamical Systems." The host institution for the fellowship is Pennsylvania State University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Nathanial Brown.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The award supported research in the field of Operator Algebras, the noncommutative mathematical theory that emerged from Heisenberg's matrix model for quantum mechanics.  The theory serves as a theoretical basis for quantum mechanics, and draws inspiration from it at the same time.  The objects of study are complicated, infinite dimensional structures and he project aimed to study how to model the behavior of these structures using finite-dimensional building blocks.  An aim was to approximate them externally and internally with finite matrices and study the interactions between these various approximations.  More specifically, the project studied several approximation properties of operator algebras using recent tools developed in the classification theory of nuclear C*-algebras.  One of them, nuclearity, is an internal approximation, and another, quasidiagonality, an external one. The two have have been intensely studied over the years, and the role of quasidiagonality in the classification theory of nuclear C*-algebras has been made especially prominent in the recent work of other researchers.  The project studied these properties for general algebras and for those that arise in connection with groups of symmetries.  The major results of our project are contained in three articles, published or accepted in well-established scientific mathematical journals.  The Principal Investigator co-mentored three graduate students. Two of these students have graduated and have successfully moved on to other academic positions. The results obtained in this project have been communicated to other researchers at several national and international meetings.
