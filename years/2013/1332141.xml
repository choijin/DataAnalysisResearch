<AbstractNarration>This proposal seeks funding for the Center for Electromagnetic Compatibility (CEMC) comprised of the Missouri University of Science and Technology (MUST) and the University of Houston (UH). Funding Requests for Fundamental Research are authorized by an NSF approved solicitation, NSF 11-570. The solicitation invites I/UCRCs to submit proposals for support of industry-defined fundamental research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to explore and develop statistical analysis methodologies for practical EMC and Signal Integrity applications. The proposed research will be focused on two areas: 1) charactering effects of geometry/material variations, manufacturing tolerances, and process variations on high-speed signal channel performance; and, 2) characterizing random noise sources through nearfield scanning. Various methodologies will be investigated through modeling and measurements, and the gained insights can be used to develop effective design tools for specific practical engineering applications in the next step. The high-speed design community has neither systematic experimental procedures nor simulation-based tools for addressing random effects in complex real-world problems, which are critical when the industry moves ahead to the next generation of designs. The proposed study will close this gap by developing and improving general statistical analysis methodologies for real-world EMC and signal integrity applications. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful completion of the project will result in a deep understanding of various statistical analysis methodologies for high-speed designs, which can provide useful insights and guideline for engineering CAD tool development. The outcome of the project can help the nation to maintain its competitive advantages in high tech industry. The next generation of electronic, computer, and communication systems will benefit when more accurate modeling and measurement techniques to address random effects become available. The knowledge gained in this project can inspire similar ideas and approaches in other engineering fields to incorporate statistical methodologies. The proposed innovative research will be effectively integrated into education to transfer the developed technologies into the minds and hands of the next generation workforce. Research findings and results will be disseminated through the IUCRC CEMC to the center members, and through conferences, publications, and websites to the general public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the second year of the fundamental reserach, we have applied to theoritical development into more practical applications. In particular, based on the results of these studies, Huawei Technology company has joined the NSF IUCRC to implement the developed method into practical circuit/system/antenna designs. The work is aim at developing a software package integrated in CST studio for uncertainty analysis of antenna array performance. The input uncertain variables include geometric parameters, electric and magnetic properties, and excitations. The uncertainty of the antenna array performance (antenna radiation pattern) will be estimated from the specified multiple input stochastic variables.  More specifically, the methods investigated in this fundamental are:  1)      Stochastic collation method for single variable analysis  This method is used to select a subset of input stochastic variables according to their importance. The less important variables can be dropped in the uncertainty analysis. This method can accelerate the overall analysis. The selected parameters will be further used for the following sparse grid method.  2)      Sparse grid based stochastic collocation method  This method can provide a highly accurate estimation. However, its computation load increases rapidly if the number of input stochastic variables is large.  3)      Stroud?s quadrature based stochastic collocation method  This method can be efficient since its computation load increases linearly with the number of input stochastic variables. The limitation of this method is its low accuracy.  4)      Monte Carlo method for validation. This method is not practical for many-variable uncertainty analysis and is mainly used for validating the other methods.  In addtion, a Ph.D. student from Missouri University of Science and Technology is jointly supervised by University of Houston Center for Electromagnetic Compatibity Research to work on eye-diagram estimation based on high-speed systems. The dissertation further applies the method into circuit modeling region.           Last Modified: 01/27/2017       Submitted by: Ji Chen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
