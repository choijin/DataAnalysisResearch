<AbstractNarration>The project in the College of Engineering, Technology &amp; Physical Sciences at Alabama A&amp;M University (AAMU) will enhance the engineering and technology curriculum by integrating theoretical and hands-on experiences in the field of renewable energy. This will be achieved by introducing new undergraduate and graduate courses in solar, wind and other renewable energies; introducing hands-on laboratory experience in solar and wind energy; enhancing the quality of education by introducing and expanding undergraduate and graduate research opportunities; and strengthening the recruitment, retention and transition of engineering and science students from secondary to post-graduate studies and industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Project activities will advance the knowledge of the student participants, sharpen their skills and provide a support system that empowers them to successfully graduate and succeed in a competitive job market. By integrating theory, lab experiences and research into multidisciplinary renewable energy courses, students will be engaged in the learning process. The project will impact more than two hundred students at AAMU, as well as about four hundred high school students. Project activities can serve as a model for other institutions that desire to strengthen their engineering and technology programs.</AbstractNarration>

AAMU is a Historically Black University (HBCU) providing high quality education for a culturally diverse student population of which 91% are African-American students. Renewable Energy is an alternate source of clean energy which is abundantly available in nature, will save the environment by reducing pollution, and also alleviate the foreign dependency on fossil fuel. It is an emerging field in which many government agencies and private organizations are heavily investing in research and implementation. As a result, there will be huge demand for engineers and technologists with experience in renewable energy. CETPS at AAMU received this grant from NSF for the period July 2013 &ndash; June 2016, and plans to address the national energy crisis by producing a quality pool of underrepresented engineers and scientists with experience in renewable energy and develop a diverse national workforce through achieving the following four goals: 1) Enhance Engineering and Science Curriculum by introducing new undergraduate and graduate courses in solar, wind and other renewable energies; 2) Introduce hands-on experience in solar and wind energy; 3) Enhance the quality of education by introducing and expanding undergraduate and graduate research opportunities; 4) Increase the recruitment, retention and transition of engineering and science students from secondary to post-graduate studies and <span>industry.</span></span></p> <p><span><span><span>The project intends to enhance the engineering and technology curriculum at AAMU by integrating theoretical and hands-on experience in the cutting edge field of renewable energy.

Out of these 13 students doing research in renewable energy, 5 students have graduated and remaining 8 are continuing their studies. This means the retention rate for this cohort is 100% which is significantly high compared to the college average retention rate.  Also, all the 5 students graduated with research experience in renewable energy were employed or enrolled into graduate school.  By providing students opportunity to graduate from programs in cutting edge fields and having higher demands in job market, will encourage them to focus on learning and to graduate on time, which in turn will increase enrollment, retention and graduation rate of underrepresented minorities and improve diversity in national workforce, as supported by the above data.  Information about the success of these new Renewable Energy courses and research at Alabama A&amp;M University was published in the local newspaper "Huntsville Times", AAMU online newsletter "Bulldog BottomLine", and CETPS Newsletter.
