<AbstractNarration>The PIs plan to establish the effects of climate change on terrestrial organic carbon (OC) dynamics in the Ganges-Brahmaputra/Bengal Fan system since the Last Glacial Maximum. Sub-millennial resolution records of sediment and OC burial in the Bengal Fan will be developed using inorganic proxies of sediment composition and delivery and paired stable isotope/radiocarbon measurements. These records will enable reconstructions of variations in monsoon strength, paleo-vegetation, and OC residence time, providing insight into the relationships between climate change, geomorphic response, vascular plant biomarkers, and terrestrial OC dynamics in the Bengal Fan. The proposed work will support two early-career scientists, and will train two undergraduate students from underrepresented minority groups. The project will strengthen international collaborative ties through data sharing and synthesis efforts with Swiss and German researchers.</AbstractNarration>

Finally, we demonstrate that the burial of organic carbon in the Bay of Bengal has been rapid and efficient (near 100%) through time, and that periods of greater monsoon strength correspond to periods of higher rates of export of young, fresh (&lt;100 years old) carbon from the Ganges-Brahmaputra basin to the coastal ocean. This finding demonstrates that the expansion of woody vegetation associated with the strengthening of the monsoon and the gradually warming temperatures following the Last Glacial Maximum provided a negative feedback on climate change; that is, more carbon was taken up by plants (reducing atmospheric CO2 levels) and that carbon was rapidly transferred to the Bay of Bengal, where it was buried and likely sequestered for thousands of years (or longer).
