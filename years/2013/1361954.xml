<AbstractNarration>The research of the planned I/UCRC for Sensory Sciences and Innovation aims to support basic and applied research in several areas across the spectrum of chemosensory science, providing a focal point for industry-university collaboration. The planned center targets new understanding through multi-disciplinary, cross-cutting research of such topics as how flavors and fragrances influence memory, cognitive function and mood; the full range of benefits of flavors and fragrances in fighting infection (e.g., citral), supporting immune function and protecting food against spoilage (e.g. rosemary oil). The center vision seeks to transform the sensory sciences by integrating the discovery and characterization of taste and flavor molecules, with the study of their physiological and psychological mechanisms, to ultimately understand their effects on human behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The flavor and fragrance industry represent a $ 23 B sector of the U.S. economy and is a critical driver of innovation across a broad range of consumer and industrial products from foods, beverages, and medicines, to personal care, home care and cosmetics. The planned I/UCRC?s holistic approach will likely lead to greater insights than the ?piecemeal? approach that is typically practiced in this field. Moreover, in cooperation with industry partners, the Center will establish a blueprint for training students and workers as multi-disciplinary sensory scientists. Partnering with industry will foster the rapid translation of this new knowledge into the next generation of innovative goods and services, resulting in broad societal impacts.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
