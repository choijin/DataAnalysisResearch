<AbstractNarration>There has been extensive academic and industry research, especially over the last decade on&lt;br/&gt;developing spectrum using concepts and architectures. These include research on dynamic spectrum&lt;br/&gt;access, spectrum sharing, co-existence, spectrum databases, new protocols, wireless security&lt;br/&gt;and others. However, deployable dynamic spectrum sharing technologies do not exist. The fundamental&lt;br/&gt;issues of spectrum sharing trust and security remain. It is critical that the research that&lt;br/&gt;has been done and proven in indoor environments is well understood, collaborated and transformed&lt;br/&gt;into deployable technologies by industry and government, even as new research is being initiated.&lt;br/&gt;This calls for open collaboration between the research communities along with integrated outdoor&lt;br/&gt;test facilities for performing realistic research experimentation (augmenting smaller indoor&lt;br/&gt;wireless testbeds across the nation), across various bands and applications. The proposed&lt;br/&gt;annual research symposium is needed to create the national collaboration between the research&lt;br/&gt;and other ecosystem stakeholders.</AbstractNarration>
