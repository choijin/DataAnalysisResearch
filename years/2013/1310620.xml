<AbstractNarration>Objective: The objective of this program is to achieve high quantum efficiency in a deep sub-wavelength absorbing region, using a novel metallo-dielectric optical antenna. The reduced volume of the device leads to a reduced noise, while the antenna maintains high quantum efficiency. This combination leads to a high detectivity even at elevated temperatures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The proposed research provides a new insight into the operation of optical antennas; in particular, the use of metallo-dielectric structures to enhance efficient coupling of light to deep sub-wavelength structures. Realization of thermoelectric-cooled LWIR detectors and imagers with background limited infrared photo-detection performance could significantly impact many fields of science and engineering. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Some of the results of this research will be incorporated in the photonics courses and an advanced course on Infrared Detectors. Open-source simulation tools that will be developed in this research effort will become publicly available through the literature and shared with other researchers in this field. Undergraduate and graduate students from under-represented and minority groups will be encouraged to take part in this research. Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professorate (AGEP) program at Northwestern University would be used in this regard.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ While radio antenna is a common part in most radio receivers and transmitters, its optical counterpart in the visible and infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum is not commonly used. This limitation has hindered efficient coupling of light to very small material, including atoms and molecules, over a broad spectral band. Addressing this limitation could lead to many breakthroughs in detection of bio-molecules, quantum computing, and ultra-sensitive cameras. There are two main issues with optical antennas that have limited their progress: 1- Their shape must be controlled well below the wavelength of light, which is in the nano-scale for the visible and infrared regions. 2- They need metallic parts, but metals waste a lot of the light energy by converting it to heat. The first issue is mostly engineering and has been rapidly addressed by the fast progress of nano-processing methods in the recent years. However, the second issue is more fundamental and is proved to be very challenging. Detailed evaluation of all viable metals have shown that high loss is an inherent limit of metals. This is much more serious if one is to make a "directional" antenna to send/receive light to/from a specific direction. A fundamental property of electromagnetic waves, called diffraction, dictates that higher directivities can only be achieved with larger antennas. However, the bigger the metallic antenna, the higher is its loss - as light has to travel across a longer path in the metal. We have developed a new kind of optical antenna that can achieved a low loss and a high directivity at the same time. This new antenna is made of a combination of metallic and dielectric parts to couple light with a high directivity to a volume that is about three orders of magnitude smaller than the wavelength of light cubed.
