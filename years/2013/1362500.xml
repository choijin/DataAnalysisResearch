<AbstractNarration>Marina Guenza at the University of Oregon Eugene is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program focusing on understanding the relation between molecular structure and macroscopic properties of synthetic polymeric materials and large biological molecules. Computer simulations are useful to provide information about the microscopic molecular structure of a liquid, but describing the macroscopic properties that are measured experimentally exceeds the computational capabilities of traditional simulations. New computational strategies are being developed here to accelerate simulations and connect the molecular structure to the macroscopic properties for different temperatures and other  thermodynamic conditions. This provides an important tool to study the properties of novel materials and biological molecules such as proteins, DNAs, and RNAs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project uses a coarse-graining theory with the desirable property that structural and thermodynamic consistency are maintained throughout coarse-graining. Novel applications include the search for macromolecular structures that self-assmble in a soft crystal lattice of desired geometry. An original approach is used for the coarse-grained dynamics of biological macromolecules, specifically protein, DNA, and RNA, that is based on the Langevin equation for the dynamics of macromolecules in solution. This method also accounts for the presence of local conformational barriers and for internal hydrophobic regions. Theoretical predictions are compared to experimental data from collaborators at the University of Oregon.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The structural and dynamical properties of liquids of large macromolecules are characterized by an extended range of length and time scales. Understanding the physics of these systems across multiple scales is important but also a real challenge: because of the limitations of the conventional computational techniques, such as Molecular Dynamics, that range is too wide and atomistic simulations become time prohibitive. The strategy to overcome this limitation is to design reduced representations of the system, a process that is called "coarse-graining". Because in coarse-grained models the molecular picture is simplified, the information that is collected is reduced. It follows that there is a speed up in the computational calculations due to this reduction, which opens up the possibility of studying the properties of macromolecular liquids of interest on a very large scale. While coarse-graining methods are quite promising, the key questions remain on how the process of coarse-graining can be implemented while ensuring that the predictions of the reduced simulations are still highly accurate.  The work completed under this award has addressed the design and (partial) testing of two coarse-grained models for the structure and dynamics of macromolecular liquids. The two theories are the Integral Equation Coarse-Graining (IECG) approach and the Langevin Equation for Protein Dynamics (LE4PD). Both approaches have proven to be accurate in the prediction of physical properties in the thermodynamic conditions and time regimes where each theory applies.  The Integral Equation Coarse-Graining method is based on the Ornstein-Zernike equation for liquids. The IECG theory has been shown to conserve the structure, pressure, compressibility, and free energy, while applying varying coarse-graining resolution, including the atomistic representation. The dynamics measured by MD simulations in the IECG representation are reconstructed by a proper rescaling procedure that recovers the diffusive dynamics of the molecule, as measured in atomistic simulations and in experiments. Because it is solved analytically, in a well-defined range of conditions, the IECG also provides useful insights on the general properties of coarse-graining, and on the conditions that are required to build a CG model that is structurally and thermodynamically consistent. The structural and thermodynamic consistency allows for the agile modeling of multiple resolution systems, such as it is done in the Adaptive Resolution simulation (AdResS) method.  The Langevin Equation for Protein Dynamics is a diffusive approach with hydrodynamic interaction and internal energy barriers, which predicts with accuracy time correlation functions and localized fluctuations of a protein dynamics over a wide range of time scales. The theory has been tested for a number of proteins, and agrees with experiments of T1, T2, and NOE NMR relaxation times, as well as with x-Ray crystallography Debye-Waller factors, and with time correlation functions from atomistic computer simulations.  In conclusion, while both approaches have been proven to provide accurate predictions of a number of properties for the systems simulated, both considerably reduce the computational needs, thus opening up the possibility of adopting these methods for the accurate simulations of large macromolecular systems. Developing this understanding is essential in the design of advanced materials, which could address the challenges in clean energy production, clear water, and more, which we will all have to face in the near future.
