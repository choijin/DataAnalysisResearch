<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project, supported by the Polymers Program of the Division of Materials Research and the Mechanics of Materials Program of the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation, will develop fundamental knowledge of mechanical properties for ultra-soft materials. The primary goal will be to experimentally investigate the effect of size scale on achieving large strain, resilient mechanical responses in ultra-soft materials.  Ultra-soft materials with these attributes are important for numerous applications, from protective devices to tissue engineering.  Recently, many novel polymers which mimic naturally-occurring gels, such as resilin, have been demonstrated with some success, but these polymers are often complex and potentially difficult to implement practically. An alternative strategy may be found by understanding the mechanical properties of ultra-soft materials at small size scales.  This strategy is motivated by a well-known property for metals and ceramics that size can influence the sensitivity to defects under mechanical loading.  Thus, metals and ceramics fabricated on small size scales can display extraordinary mechanical properties.  For ultra-soft materials, these effects have not been experimentally measured. In the proposed research, scaling relationships provide guiding hypotheses that predict the existence of optimized size scales for large strain reversible deformations for swollen polymer networks.  These hypotheses will be experimentally confirmed using standard and novel characterization methods on two different gel materials. The results of this research will lead to new characterization methods and understanding for both synthetic gels and living tissues, as well as new materials strategies for creating ultra-soft materials that can achieve high strains, high strength, and high resiliency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ultra-soft materials are attractive for many technologies, from protective gear to tissue engineering.  Currently, these materials are either brittle, not allowing them to stretch very far, or they are able to stretch far by dissipating energy, similar to the way Silly Putty works.  Recent efforts have focused on creating new polymers that mimic the structure and properties of biological proteins, such as resilin.  However, these new materials are complex and may be difficult to implement practically.  One possible strategy for overcoming these challenges is to take advantage of predicted mechanical property enhancements at small size scales.  It is well known that metals and ceramics display improved mechanical performance on small size scales relative to their molecular size scale; however, similar experimental investigations have not been conducted on ultra-soft materials.  The proposed research will experimentally investigate the mechanical properties of ultra-soft materials at small sizes to achieve high strains, high strength, and high resiliency. The lessons learned are anticipated to impact the development of new protective devices; to influence the characterization for soft materials including living tissues; and to provoke new questions related to traumatic damage in soft biological tissues, such as the brain.  In addition, an innovative workshop program on Bioinspired Materials Design will be developed to inspire high school students from diverse backgrounds to pursue future careers in science and engineering. This program will allow students and the general public in Western Massachusetts to realize the importance of materials and mechanics research, the role of creativity in scientific and engineering discovery, and the difficulties that arise when bioinspiration is used without foundational principles.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Soft materials, such as polymer gels, are being used at an increasing rate in a wide range of advanced technologies, ranging from soft robotics to wearable sensors and electronics. These materials are sought for numerous reasons, including, perhaps most importantly, their ability to comfortably interface with the human body.  Although their ?softness? can be understood with classical theories, their strength, or ability to resist failure, is far less understood, leading to inefficient engineering of devices with these materials.  This project aimed to provide new experimental measurements on the failure of soft, polymer gels and how these processes change at small size scales.  In conducting this study, we discovered new knowledge related to how small objects, such as needles, puncture gels. Puncture is a process that involves the nucleation, or spontaneous formation, of a crack. This knowledge has stimulated a new discussion in the field of materials science of how cracks form in soft materials and how these processes are fundamentally different than mechanisms known for hard materials.  Furthermore, this new understanding has led to new inventions that can decrease the force required to puncture a soft gel, which could lead to improved methods in medical practice.  Beyond technical outcomes, we have had a great impact on teaching hundreds of students at the K-12 level throughout the Western Massachusetts region about soft materials science and how examples from nature can help guide materials design.  This outreach has been facilitated through visiting elementary, middle, and high schools, hosting numerous school groups in our laboratory at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and giving lectures at public venues.  Perhaps the broadest outreach outcome of this project is the launch of a new curriculum, called BioInspire!, which teaches fifth graders about soft materials and concepts of bio-inspired design in art classes.  This curriculum was launched by teaching 40 students weekly over an eight week period, and the curriculum has been shared at a national venue to educators.
