<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on strongly correlated phases of cold-atomic systems in optical lattices where collective behavior is governed by laws of quantum mechanics. The prototypical strongly correlated fermionic systems -- the Hubbard model and resonant fermions in the regime of BCS-BEC crossover -- are central in the fields of the cold atom research and condensed matter. Understanding quantum plasticity and super transport in solid 4He remains one of big challenges in modern low-temperature physics. There is urgent need for universal unbiased first-principles methods for strongly correlated fermionic systems across all fields of physics, quantum chemistry, and materials science. Ab initio and model simulations provide crucial information about quantitative and qualitative properties of these systems, test analytical predictions and help establish the proper theoretical framework, lay the ground for the unambiguous analysis of experimental data and further development of measuring techniques. In particular, this project aims to (i) develop generic diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DiagMC) tools for continuous-space and lattice fermionic/fermionized systems: resonant fermions, Hubbard model, and frustrated spin systems, (ii) understand quantum plasticity and supertransport in solid helium-4, (iii) perform Worm Algorithm (WA) studies of quantum-critical phenomena and novel phases of ultra-cold atoms: deconfined criticality, universal critical dynamics, phases of multi-bound complexes of polar molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An unbiased theoretical description of collective quantum phenomena is of vital interdisciplinary importance for a number of applied and fundamental areas, such as quantum computing and high-energy physics. High-end computing methods and techniques often find applications outside the physics community. Simulations of complex models with multiple constraints, randomness, and a variable number of continuous parameters are typical in polymer science, neural networks, computer science, behavioral, social and economics studies. The algorithms developed in the project provide an example of how some of the difficulties may be circumvented. An integral part of the project is the training of graduate students and post-doctoral associate in advanced numeric techniques, quantum statistics, topical problems of atomic and solid state physics, network administration, and parallel supercomputing.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In this project several strongly interacting systems have been studied: 1.

This &nbsp;view forms a basis for our studies aimed at explaining the experiments. Our main prediction is that the syringe effect should vanish at low enough temperatures and low pressure difference causing the transport. We have also made predictions about time dependencies of the superflow. This forms a basis for testing the model that the supertransport through solid occurs along dislocations hosting inside their cores the quantum fluid of jogs and the superfluid. We have also determined the nature of solidification in nanopores (the key element of the experiment).

Similar situation was predicted to occur in coupled parallel quantum wires -- under certain condition wires should loose connection (spontaneously) with their neigbors so that the current can exist along the wires and not between the wires. Using a mathematical approach called duality, we have reformulated the problem in terms of properties of fluctuating flexible closed loops. This allowed us to formulate the universal condition for the dimensional decoupling to occur. As it became evident, this condition is not satisfied in the theoretical proposals.

Then, we have developed the effective numerical tool -- multi-worm algorithm -- for simulating these phases and performed simulations for several most important configurations. Both methods have shown very good agreement with each other. As a practical outcome of our study, we have proposed that such systems can be used in sensors of rotations. The advantage with respect to the existing systems comes from the possibility to increase sensitivity of the sensor by the factor determined by the numbers of dipoles in each chain, which is unlimited.&nbsp;</p> <p>The part #4 is devoted to the old problem -- the nature of the critical point between liquid and gas.

This special point is characterized by strong long-range fluctuations of density.&nbsp;</span>Despite its seemingly obvious outcome -- the difference between liquid and gas vanishes at this point -- the nature of the fluctuations is still a subject for disagreement between physicists. On one hand, there is a similarity with other systems undergoing phase transformations -- say, magnets transforming from non-magnetic state to spontaneously magnetized one. On the other, there is no spontaneous order emerging at the critical point of the liquid-gas transition. &nbsp;As it turned out, experimental and numerical studies of this special point are notoriously difficult because of the extreme sensitivity of the fluctuations to many factors such as gravity, thermal gradients and others. Even the attempts to test the critical point in microgravity (on the Earth orbit) didn't produce conclusive results. Numerical studies are also not conclusive because of the need to determine the critical parameters with high accuracy. Our numerical method -- so called numerical flowgram -- avoids the need of determining the critical point position. Instead this position follows naturally as a byproduct of the analysis. As a result, we have managed to determine universal parameters of the transition in 2D with 99% accuracy and have established that the nature of the fluctuations is the same as in the Ising magnet.
