<AbstractNarration>This research further investigates how molecular expression on red blood cell membranes alters the dielectric properties, which are discernable in a dielectrophoretic microdevice. The immediate application for this scientific finding is that ABO-Rh blood types, which are morphologically similar cells whose phenotype differs only by expression of a polysaccharide surface antigen exhibit different polarization responses. A secondary application for this finding is to use the baseline ABO-Rh responses to determine if the blood is in a diseased state. Future progress will correct remaining deficiencies in knowledge and commercialize-able practicality of the ABO-Rh blood typing device by 1) identifying the greatest commercial utility in discerning molecular expression for medical diagnostics, 2) experimentally achieving unique signatures for every combination of the eight blood types (A+, B+, AB+, O+, A-, B-, AB-, and O-), 3) demonstrating via antigen modification, the scientific basis for the ABO/Rh antigen?s impact on the effective polarizability of the blood cell and thus the observed dielectrophoretic response. This work is a significant addition to scientific knowledge and is a powerful alternative to antigen/antibody molecular recognition reactions for medical diagnosis. Thus, this electric field mediated approach enables more rapid analysis without perishable reagents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current medical diagnosis relies on expensive and time-consuming blood tests in centralized analytical laboratories. The research team's electrokinetic microdevice technology could replace off-line lab analysis with significantly less-expensive point-of-care devices featuring user-friendly operation that produces rapid results with equivalent reliability. There are currently 84 million blood typings per year in the U.S., 16 million donations, and current protocols require 4 or more tests to minimize fatal transfusions. Current technology cost ~$95 per test, while the electrokinetic approach could cost as low as $5 (reusable) $10 (single-use) per test. This technology has the potential to streamline preparations during emergency blood transfusions, while reducing overhead and costs. It also has the potential to take blood typing outside of the traditional medical laboratory and into the hands of emergency medical personnel such as EMTs and third world health organizations.</AbstractNarration>

We all were effectively trained on the business canvas approach and made extensive contacts within the medical devices community to help us move this technology along the path to commercialization.
