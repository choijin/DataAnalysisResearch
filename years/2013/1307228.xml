<AbstractNarration>Objective: The objective of this program is to develop a novel hybrid energy storage system for electric vehicles. The specific objectives are to: (a) reduce the weight of the energy storage system (composed of high energy-density battery pack, ultracapacitor pack and a DC/DC converter) to less than the weight of a high power-density battery pack alone, while increasing the battery lifetime; (b) implement, develop, and validate this technology on the powertrain of a new electric car.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit is in the design, optimization, power management, thermal management, and validation of the advanced energy storage technology. The underlying foundation behind the proposed research is to provide a transformative solution to overcome current limitations of the batteries, achieved by (a) a SiC based novel converter and (b) a unique decoupled power/energy management strategy to optimally control the system. The project integrates different disciplines such as electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and applied mathematics, thus fostering multidisciplinary collaborative research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The broader impacts include the highest quality integrated education and research to meet the emerging workforce and educational needs of U.S. energy and transportation industry by educating talented students. It is the intention of the team to broaden the participation of female and minority students in this project through close collaboration with the Maryland LSAMP program. In addition, the team will collaborate with the Baltimore-Washington Electric Vehicle Initiative to educate a broad range of high school and college students in mid-Atlantic region in strategic field of sustainable transportation systems.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project was a Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) collaborative effort between a research team at the University of Maryland at College Park and the Genovation Cars Inc. It was an interdisciplinary collaborative research between faculty with expertise in power electronics, control, packaging, thermal management, power management, and optimization. It led to introduction of an innovative power converter topology, optimized control strategies, and enhanced packaging techniques for hybrid battery and ultracapacitor based energy storage systems in electric vehicles, which are the main intellectual merits of this project. Substantial improvements to the current state of the art were made. A unique DC/DC converter topology with a maximum efficiency of 95% was designed and developed. An innovative approach for optimal sizing and enhancing the life cycle of battery in a battery/UC hybrid energy storage system is proposed. Furthermore, a rule-based supervisory power splitting approach for hybrid battery/ultracapacitor powered electric vehicles is presented. Then, an optimization problem is formulated to optimize the power split between battery and ultracapacitor in order to extend battery cycle life and reduce energy losses in a hybrid energy storage system. In addition, an online model predictive control power management strategy is presented to optimally split the battery and ultracapacitor power during online driving. This was implemented and tested using a processor-in-the-loop system and also a hardware-in-the-loop system. It is shown that battery cycle life can be extended by over 50% through an optimized control strategy. Moreover, optimized paste compositions including particle sizes and shapes as well as flux binder for Silicon Carbide semiconductor devices are studied and developed. Finally, long-term aging tests of Transient Liquid Phase Sinter (TLPS) preform technology to verify long-term high temperature capability are studied and conducted. In addition, Power Cycling and Thermal Cycling test for the assessment of TLPS interconnect time-to-failure and reliability testing of SiC converter with TLPS interconnects is conducted.</p> <p>This project created engineering research and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. The graduate and undergraduate students, involved in this project, are advised by the PI and the Co-PIs. They performed research in which engineering concepts were applied to the understanding of electric vehicles and their complications. In addition, students were exposed to the broader implications of their research through collaboration with the Genovation Cars Inc in Rockville, MD. The project involved students from minorities and underrepresented groups in engineering. The paste-based TLPS technology has been introduced and taught as interconnect technology as part of the curriculum of ENME473/690 (Mechanical Fundamentals of Electronic Systems) in the Department of Mechanical Engineering. Furthermore, the some of the results of this project were incorporated in the ENEE 719B (Advanced Power Electronics) Course in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.
