<AbstractNarration>Individuals of a species can respond to changes in their environment by making adjustments in, for example, their development, metabolism, appearance, or behavior. Individuals of mobile species can also move to other locations with more suitable surroundings.  Populations of the same species can respond to the same environmental changes by growing or shrinking in abundance, or by evolving adaptively if individuals vary genetically.  It is important to consider all these possibilities simultaneously when trying to understand how species have responded to historical environmental changes and to forecast their potential responses to future changes.  The objective of this project is to develop a mathematically-based theoretical framework combining all these biological processes that could be used along with data from field and laboratory studies to deduce past reactions and predict future responses of species to changed environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will result in a guidebook with an associated freely-available package of computer programming scripts that empirical researchers can use to design efficient and effective experimental or observational studies about how species respond to environmental change.  These data and models will, in turn, provide wildlife managers, policy makers, and conservation biologists with process-based quantitative tools to forecast responses of species of interest to anticipated environmental changes.  In addition, a new graduate course will be developed based on the material in the proposed book.   The creation of illustrative examples for the guidebook based on an extensive marmot dataset will contribute to graduate training and foster new collaborations with researchers in the United States and abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is being made jointly by three programs: 1) Evolutionary Processes in the Division of Environmental Biology (BIO Directorate), 2) Population and Community Ecology in the Division of Environmental Biology (BIO Directorate), and 3) Mathematical Biology in the Division of Mathematical Sciences (MPS Directorate).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Species have faced change in their environments since life on earth arose and there is considerable concern about how oraganisms will respond to the unprecedented conditions that have been unfolding in modern times. Scientists and citizens are obviously interested in understanding how these changes might affect earth's inhabitants and it is of paramount importance to reach this understanding based on a combination of empirical evidence and sound reasoning.  This project has contributed to the latter aim in that is has developed a logical set of general principles for understanding the impacts of environmental change on individuals, populations, and species.  The principles were developed by synthesizing general concepts drawn from a wide range of biological areas (including developmental biology, physiology, animal behavior, genetics, epidemiology, demography, ecology, and evolution).  The synthetic theory is relatively abstract but also highly flexible which will make it useful to researchers and managers who seek to understand how environmental change over space and time has shaped current biological diversity and who wish to forecast its likely fate based on current knowledge of biological processes. A central outcome of this project is a handbook (in-progress) that this project allowed me to create, design, and prepare.  The guide will help students, researchers, and managers develop a comprehensive and cohesive conceptual understanding of how species and ecological communities respond to change in their environments.  These responses to environmental change can be split into four distinct categories: demographic, evolutionary, environment-dependent expression of traits (including development, physiology, and behavior), and movement among geographic locations. The express goal of this book is to guide readers toward clear ways (based on rigorous theory) to understand how these four categories of response unfold separately and together so they can design convincing empirical studies and make rationale management decisions and projections for species of interest.     In addition to its central synthetic component, a number of specific findings were discovered in the course of this project that are related to some of the distinct responses to environmental change.  Perhaps the most interesting and important of these are concerned with the impact of adaptive evolution on the lifetime of populations that are facing exinctiion.  Our mathematically-derived predictions show that the immediate demographic effects of an environimental change are far more important to determining the remaining lifetime of a population than adaptive evolution.  This means that remediation measures (in conservation biology or wildlife management) or eradication efforts (in agricultural pest management or medical settings) should focus mainly on improving or degrading survival and reproduction and only marginally on strategies that speed or slow adaptative evolution.     Another set of important specific results were found in our analyses of Asian "running" bamboos that have been introduced in North America and have become established in Pacific Northwest forests. These bamboos are capable of producing an immense quantity of seeds in a short period of time, which are known to drive rodent population explosions is Asia. We found, using on data from feeding trials with deer mice combined with mathematical modeling, that these introduced bamboos could spur a similar large and sustained "irruption" in North American deer mice.  Since deer mice are know carriers of hantavirus, the results suggest that, if left unchecked, these introduced bamboos could trigger a substantial public health risk.     Finally, the results of our analyses of the transmission of non-typhoidal Salmonella, which is an important public health concern, suggest that scaling up interventions along  the animal-human transmission pathway combined with convential interventions along the food-chain is a logical defensible approach to further reducing Salmonella infection levels below current ones.
