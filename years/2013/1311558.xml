<AbstractNarration>The main goals of NSF grant DMS-1311558 are to use microlocal analysis and integral geometry to understand important problems in tomography and then to use this to develop and improve algorithms for those problems. Professor Quinto will develop and test algorithms for electron microscopy, X-ray tomography, and radar.  Professor Quinto will adapt and test his three-dimensional electron microscope tomography (ET) algorithm with new scanning geometries (ways of obtaining the data) in ET, and he will refine the algorithm to address more aspects of the physical model.  Long-term collaborators at the Royal Institute of Technology and the Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, will provide biological and realistic simulated data.  Prof. Quinto will develop Sobolev seminorms that tell how strongly features in an object will show up in its tomographic data.  He will use microlocal analysis to understand streak artifacts that occur in limited angle tomography and use this to develop algorithms that decrease these streaks.  A large part of the PI's research in this project will involve novel methods in bistatic radar with general flight paths.  He and his collaborators will develop the microlocal theory of radar for a broad range of flight paths.  They will use this to find flight paths that provide better data, and he will develop and test algorithms for these flight paths.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tomography is the mathematics that images objects from indirect data including from X-ray CT scanners, electron microscopes, or radar. He will develop methods to image submicroscopic objects from electron microscopy data, the body from X-ray tomography data, and the terrain of the earth from radar data.  His electron microscopy project is undertaken with biologists and mathematicians, and it has already been used to image and understand individual sub-microscopic structures. Prof. Quinto will use sophisticated mathematics to understand which features the specific data can image well and what features cannot be well-imaged.  He will use this information to improve his algorithms. Professor Quinto is committed to undergraduate teaching, advising, and mentoring a broad range of students and young mathematicians, and his NSF project will directly support this through two undergraduate projects. The PI's many undergraduate research students help accomplish his research by developing algorithms and learning the underlying mathematics as they learn to become creative researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Computerized Tomography has revolutionized diagnostic medicine, biology, and industrial nondestructive evaluation.  The key idea of X-ray tomography is to X-ray the body from many directions all around the body in order to get a picture of the inside of the body.  The problem is that the data just provide pictures of the body from different angles, but the data do not directly show the inside of the object.  This is like looking at pictures of a house from positions all around the outside and using this to put together a three-dimensional picture of the house. Mathematical algorithms are required to interpret this X-ray data and put it together into an accurate picture (called a reconstruction) of the inside of the body.   Under this grant, Professor Quinto developed methods to image the body from X-ray tomography data and photo/thermos-acoustic data.  In addition, he developed the mathematics to understand the structure of the earth from seismic experiments, objects in the ocean from Sonar data, and the terrain of the earth from synthetic aperture radar data.   A major focus of Prof. Quinto?s research is on scientific and industrial problems for which the standard algorithms do not work because some data are missing--only limited data are given.  He uses microlocal analysis (sophisticated mathematics that characterizes singularities, such as cracks and tumor boundaries) to understand which features of the object being scanned are visible from the data (i.e., can be imaged well from algorithms that use such data) and which features are invisible and cannot be well imaged by the limited data.  This research tells scientists what parts of the object they will be able to see from limited data reconstructions and what features they cannot see.  They can use this to determine when there could be missing features.  Many reconstructions from limited tomographic data have added streak artifacts that are not in the object, and Prof. Quinto develops mathematics to explain and characterize these artifacts. This allows scientists to know which features in a reconstruction are real (parts of the object) and which are artifacts that should be ignored.   Prof. Quinto uses this information to develop new reconstruction algorithms that decrease these artifacts and still show almost all of the visible features (from the limited data).  He has developed the theory for X-ray CT and photo/thermo-acoustic CT.  With Bernadette Hahn, he applied this theory to X-ray CT when the patient moves during the scan.  He is developing a more general theory that researchers can use to determine visible features and artifacts in a very broad range of limited data tomographic problems. Prof. Quinto and his collaborators developed the microlocal theory of radar for a broad range of flight paths.  They use this to find flight paths that provide better data, and he will develop and test algorithms for these flight paths.  This research naturally leads to work that he and colleagues are doing to analyze data acquisition in seismic imaging and ultrasound.  They have analyzed two standard types of seismic data and proven rigorously that one type shows many more features of the earth?s crust than the other one.  This is useful because it provides a better way to analyze the data. Professor Quinto is committed to undergraduate teaching, advising, and mentoring a broad range of students and young mathematicians, and his NSF project directly supported this through three Research Experiences for Undergraduate (REU) projects.  The PI's undergraduate research students help accomplish his research by developing and testing algorithms and making and exploring conjectures about the algorithms and how they work.  These students learn the underlying microlocal and numerical analysis, and they learn to become researchers themselves.  Furthermore, he mentors young mathematicians by co-organizing conferences at which they speak and by developing research collaborations with them, several of which are projects supported by this grant.  These outreach activities enhance and motivate his research, and his NSF support makes him more effective in this outreach.
