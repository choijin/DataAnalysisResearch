<AbstractNarration>The 9th William Rowan Hamilton Geometry and Topology Workshop is a five-day, directed workshop on  "Geometry and Groups after Thurston", to be held at the Hamilton Mathematical Institute (HMI) in Dublin, Ireland, August 27-31, 2013. The workshop will consist of a two-day minicourse for graduate students and junior researchers, followed by a three day lecture series.  This past year has seen the passing of William P. Thurston (1946-2012) whose work and conjectural program infuenced much of the research in the field over the past  three decades. Also, recent progress has seen most of Thurston's conjectural program now solved. This year's workshop aims to consider new directions of research and new problems which will direct future research in the spirit of Thurston's original program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The goal of the William Rowan Hamilton Geometry and Topology Workshop is to investigate  common themes and techniques among significant areas of current research in geometry and topology and to support junior researchers interested in these areas. The workshop will bring together leading researchers in geometry and topology  with graduates students and junior researchers who have a special interest in problems related to group theory and low-dimensional geometry to investigate  questions at the forefront of research in these areas. The confluence of expertise from different areas will result in new collaborative projects, and in broadening the research horizons of the participants.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2013 William Rowan Hamilton Workshop, Geometry and Groups after Thurston, workshop was a five-day directed  workshop  held at the Hamilton Mathematical Institute (HMI) in  Dublin, Ireland,  August 27-31, 2013 comprising a two-day mini-course August 27-28 of background/survey lectures given by a team of leading experts,  followed by a 3-day lecture series August 29 -31.    The goal of the minicourse was to educate researchers, in particular graduate students and junior researchers,  so that they can participate more fully in the week-long workshop as well as broadening their mathematical knowledge-base. The lectures series gave researchers at the forefront of the field an opportunity to disseminate their recent advances and to propose new directions of research.  The immediate goal of the 2013 workshop was to gather leading researchers in low-dimensional geometry and topology in order to educate each other and workshop participants about recent advances in the field and to propose new directions of research. Much research in the field this past 30 years has been motivated by Thurston's conjectural program. With the recent completion of the main components of this, one of the central goals of the workshop was to produce a list of conjectural problems to motivate future research.    Intellectual Merit: The purpose of the workshop  was to investigate common themes and techniques among significant areas of current research in geometry and topology and to propose new directions of research. Among the main topics of the workshop will be the  recent work of Agol, Wise and collaborators, that culminated in Agol's announcement of a proof of the virtual Haken and virtual fiber conjectures.     Another major topic is higher Teichmuller theory, where geometric and dynamical techniques are used to study representations of finitely generated groups into general Lie groups. Work of Goldman, Guichard, Hitchin, Labourie, Wienhard and others have shown that the spaces of such representations exhibit many of the properties that arise  in Thurston's work on the mapping class group and Teichmuller space.  The conference brought together many of the leading researchers on these topics and other related topics.    Broader Impacts: Immediate broader impacts include the generation of a more well-defined set of research directions and open problems in a number of related fields for the next generation of young researchers to work on. Also through the mini-course for graduate students, the workshop broadens the research fields of future math researchers.  As the leading research  community, it is important that the U.S. fosters strong links with the international research community. Co-sponsoring events such as the proposed workshop is a excellent way of doing  this. It is hoped that the Hamilton Geometry and Topology Workshop will become an annual  forum for communication between the U.S. and European research communities.
