<AbstractNarration>This mixed methods research project investigates the puzzling problem of variations in student learning gains that are observed at different institutions of higher education when implementing the same research-based instructional method in highly interactive classrooms. The study investigates model implementations of algebra-based studio physics to identify and analyze the critical features of this instructional method.  The study is guided by the following questions.  Research Question1: How is algebra-based studio physics implemented at a variety of institutions and for what types of students?  Research Question 2: Why are departments implementing algebra-based studio physics in those ways?  Research Question 3: What factors are associated with student outcomes that indicate student learning gains? Algebra-based studio physics comprise the physics experience for many students who enroll in introductory physics courses.  However, this approach to teaching physics remains understudied relative to calculus-based studio physics. Therefore, the research takes advantage of a unique opportunity to examine student learning gains.  The study examines how different types of students respond to interactive teaching strategies in model implementations of this instructional method to teach physics and how institutional types influence teaching and learning. Three initial institutions serve as the basis for Phase 1 of this multi-phase study. One of the institutions has reported high student learning gains in the algebra-based studio physics courses.  The other two institutions have observed low student learning gains. Phase 1 is designed to establish baseline measures for the research.  During Phase 2 the research team is examining a total of twelve additional institutions that utilize algebra-based studio physics.  The twelve institutions represent a range of those in the U.S. implementing this approach. Institutions that are included in Phase 2 provide settings in which the research team tests emergent hypotheses and the robustness of findings from Phase 1. Specifically, the project is investigating (a) characteristics of model implementations of algebra-based studio physics by faculty at different institutions and (b) the characteristics of students engaged in these types of courses, to investigate and explain the observed variations in student learning gains.  Research methods include classroom observations, interviews, surveys, and student outcomes assessments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This project involved understanding "studio" physics classes, where students sit at round tables to discuss physics.  Because there is no predetermined structure for studio physics courses, teachers must invent their own instructional style, physics labs, and activities.  Researchers at Georgia State University had the following goals:  1. We worked to understand how educators design physics laboratories.  We focused on research-based physics laboratories, for which there was some evidence of their effectiveness.  2. We visited eleven universities to observe their studio physics classes.  Along with our collaborators at the University of Central Florida and George Washington University, we designed a systematic way of observing studio classes.  3. Along with our collaborators, we interviewed instructors at the eleven universities to understand their approach to teaching.  At Georgia State University, three graduate students and nine undergraduate students worked on this project.  Georgia State University researchers were a presenter or author on four peer-reviewed conference proceedings articles, one invited talk, seven contributed talks, and five posters.  Georgia State University's major effort was to understand physics labs.  We used a k-means cluster analysis to discover that there are three main types of physics laboratories, which can be classified in terms of their goals and strategies:  1) Thinking like a physicist.  These laboratories try to promote "thinking like a physicist" by asking students to design experiments and requiring students to consider their assumptions and errors.  2) Conceptual change through experiment.  These laboratories try to promote conceptual change through predictions and observations.  3) Thought experiments and exercises.  These laboratories have a limited amount of actual experimentation, and place some focus on thought experiments or written problems.  These may promote conceptual change or else give students practice in working with representations.  Physics teachers can use this categorization scheme to help them decide on a goal, and to learn the art of lab design.  Perhaps the best way to learn to design a physics lab is to examine similar labs designed by other authors.  Another product of the research was the SCOUT protocol, or "Studio Classroom Observation UTility."  This system is useful for researchers who would like to observe a studio physics class and record what happens in the class.  The protocol has separate categories for a "one conversation" mode, where one person (student or teacher) is talking at a time, and a "parallel work" mode, where students are working in groups.  A third category is technological, accounting for the devices, media, and objects that students use at their tables, at whiteboards, or on a screen.
