<AbstractNarration>This project develops an interdisciplinary and transformative in- and out of-school science education and technology program that engages high school aged youth and their teachers in 1) the production of food using hydroponics, and 2) the use of green energy technologies (solar, and wind) to power hydroponic systems. This distinctive program integrates food production, a novel model of parental outreach, a focus on green career development, and an authentic reason (growing their own produce for selling at a market) for learning how and why to use alternative energy technologies.  The project creates an approach to sustainability in which students not only give back to their community, but are in a position to provide a continuous revenue stream to the school in order to operate their indoor urban garden indefinitely. The partnership with the Boston Youth Environmental Network provides youth opportunities for summer internships with green energy companies. The project builds upon a learning progressions model in which youth gradually learn about complex scientific systems and economic principles throughout their years in the program. Rather than a onetime experience, youth are engaged in a long-term experience building their knowledge and skills regarding science, economics, and college preparedness.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;This project has the potential to impact thousands of students informally and over 2000 students (in classrooms) directly with a minimum of 60 students receiving focused and in depth learning experiences during the summer and on weekends during the school year. With the passage of laws encouraging local schools to partner with local farms, the need for locally grown produce will increase; in that context, the program brings the farm to the school in a way that allows food to be grown year round. Thus, a model is developed that any school or informal learning center could adopt to grow their own food while simultaneously creating a living and learning laboratory for youth in their own program.</AbstractNarration>

In having youth at farmers markets we learned that it was not just important for the youth but extremely important to dessiminate the nature and type of work that the youth were engaged in while participating in this work.   Broader Impacts  The broader impact of our work focuses on the recruitment of low-income youth and youth from underrepresented populations in science. This focus is important because recent reports show that while half of all people from higher-income families have a bachelor?s degree by age 25, just 1 in 10 people from low-income families do, which greatly impacts their socio-economic mobility (Presidents Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, 2014). Further, this work addresses one of the major calls in the recent Presidential Council of Scientific Advisors to the President (PCAST, 2014) that it is "critical to connect more low-income students to post-secondary institutions where youth can succeed and are encouraged to complete their degree once they arrive on campus.
