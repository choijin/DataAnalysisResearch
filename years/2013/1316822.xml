<AbstractNarration>This action funds Thomas S. Cox of South Dakota State University to conduct a research project in Geoscience during the summer of 2013 at Polar Research Institute of China in Shanghai, China.  The project title is "Development of a Melter-based Analytical Technique for an East Antarctic Ice Core." The host scientist is Dr. Su Jiang.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;China is currently gearing up for a deep ice core project in East Antarctica (Dome A), as well as in the process of setting up an ice core analytical laboratory.  The Polar Research Institute of China (PRIC) is the leading group involved in this deep ice core project, as well as charged with the construction of the ice core research laboratory.  The Fellow's project builds on a 10-year collaborative relationship between the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at South Dakota State University (SDSU) and PRIC to utilize an analytical technique developed at SDSU that will likely contribute to the Dome A project. The Fellow is assisting in the installation and testing of the instrumentation required for the technique.  The Fellow and researchers at PRIC are also analyzing a shallow core (less than 20 meters) drilled in the vicinity of the Dome A site to provide preliminary accumulation and chemical data for the deep ice core project.  The primary data being generated by this project will be those of the detailed chemical analysis of a shallow ice core and the determination of average annual accumulation in the region (Dome A, East Antarctica).  The results of this analysis will provide preliminary data for China's deep ice core project at Dome A.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, the data will be disseminated in scientific journal publications and meeting presentations.  The chemical and accumulation data, along with metadata (e.g., instrumental technique used in measurement, average annual accumulation determination procedures, guidance for usage) will be submitted to and archived at national or international data centers such as the National Snow and Ice Data Center.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Project Summary  China is currently gearing up for a deep ice core project in East Antarctica (Dome A), as well as in the process of setting up an ice core analytical laboratory.  The Polar Research Institute of China (PRIC) is the leading group involved in this deep ice core project, as well as charged with the construction of the ice core research laboratory.  However, China and PRIC are relatively new to ice core research and South Dakota State University has over a decade of experience in the field of ice core chemical analysis that has contributed to ChinaÆs ice core project via collaboration with Graduate Student Thomas Cox (the Prinicipal Investigator).  Thomas traveled to China to assist in the chemical analysis of snow samples from East Antarctica &ndash; a preliminary study investigating the temporal temperature and chemical trends of Dome A.  The collorabtive work and efforts experienced by the PI and researchers at PRIC has lead to the collaboration in another similar project &ndash; the trace analysis of perchlorate in Antarctic snow.    Intellectual Merit  The project provided assistance in analytical techniques and chemical measurements that have contributed to ChinaÆs Dome A ice core project, as well as obtained preliminary data for the deep ice core project through the analysis of various snow pit samples in the vicinity of the Dome A site.  The PI (Graduate Student Thomas Cox) has several years experience with the analytical techniques and has worked in a research setting with international participants, both in the laboratory and in the field. The summer research made available thru the EAPSI program has enabled and further strenghtened the collaborative relationship between the Polar Research Institute of China and South Dakota State University.    Broader Impacts  The activity has lead to the strengthening of the scientific infrastructure in China and has strengthened the U.S. and China relationship in ice core research.  The activity has provided a graduate student (PI Thomas Cox) the opportunity to work and perform research in an international setting, and through collaboration, established professional and personal relationships with international peers.  Most recently, Dr. Yuansheng Li (deputy director of the Polar Research Institute of China and leader of the 28th and 29th Antarctic Research Expeditions) made a professional visit to the facilities and ice core laboratory at South Dakota State University.  The project has also broadened the participation of a student (PI Thomas Cox) whom comes from an underrepresented, EPSCoR-eligible state: South Dakota.
