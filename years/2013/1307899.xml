<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Measurements and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry supports Prof. Darryl Bornhop of Vanderbilt University to enhance understanding and extend application of backscattering interferometry (BSI) to investigate molecular interactions that are difficult to study by other methods.  Dr. Bornhop's group is further demonstrating that BSI can be used for quantifying the influence of immobilization and structural modifications on molecular interaction binding affinity, and for studying interactions and chemical reactions in complex milieu.  The research seeks to expand on defining the BSI signal generation mechanism, aiming to quantify the roles of changes in conformation and hydration resulting from a molecular interaction.  The potential to define interaction mechanism of action by incorporating BSI signal directionality will also be investigated.  Efforts on BSI performance optimization are planned to aid in translation of the technology to the broader scientific community.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By enabling the study of molecular interactions in solution at physiological or biochemically relevant concentrations, and with nanoliter sample volumes, this work will allow investigation of a wide array of biological and chemical problems previously considered intractable.  Broad societal impact may result, including enabling of sub-micron scale synthesis, the study of binding in complex samples, expedited drug discovery, and more efficient biomarker validation.  Graduate, undergraduate and high school students in the interdisciplinary Bornhop group will participate in the research, results of which will be disseminated via the Vanderbilt Student Volunteers for Science as well as by conventional means.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Chemical interactions drive chemistry, biology, and are the foundation of medical diagnosis.  Interaction studies typically require one or more modification to the participating species, yet through this NSF-funded research it has been shown that these modifications are not necessary.  It has been demonstrated that molecular interaction studies can be performed free in solution and label-free and that there is a theoretical basis for these unanticipated observations.   The model for the new assay methodology is termed FreeSRF, for Free-Solution Response Function, and as shown in a recent PNAS paper, it can predict the performance of a free-solution assay performed on a backscattering interferometer (BSI).  BSI is a simple sensor, having the same components as a CD player, a laser, an object and a camera.  Together, FreeSRF and BSI have enhanced our understanding of the chemical/biochemical behavior of numerous important biochemical and molecular recognition systems and put forth a sound argument for our observations previously unpredicted by the existing theory.  These observations open a path to an entirely new assay methodology critical to molecular biology, biochemistry, medicine, and diagnostics.  An assay methodology that is both binding partner and matrix agnostic.  In other words, the BSI free-solution assay is not limited to aqueous solutions, such as simple buffers, allowing determinations in urine, serum, tissues, and even non-aqueous media.  Furthermore, the BSI assay doesn?t require a mass change upon binding, is not limited by the size or relative size of the species (molecules or ions) participating in the chemical or biochemical reaction.   The preliminary results have shaped an entirely new perspective about what is possible with label-free, free-solution techniques.  Protein folding can be measured, as can how labels perturb a binding interaction; reaction mechanisms can be unraveled and disease biomarkers can be quantified rapidly.  Our free-solution has also allowed us to determine how much of a target (cancer biomarker, pollutant, therapy, etc.) is present, even when species could not be seen at the same levels in the absence of binding.  Most BSI assays are performed on miniscule amounts of sample (a microliter-sized drop) and require little or no prior knowledge about either of the binding partners, enabling rapid screening.  Collectively, these advances are impacting drug discovery by reducing late-stage attrition due to disconnects between in-vivo in-vitro correlations, measurements essential to first in human dose and patient selection.   Understanding BSI signal transduction is ushering in a new paradigm in sensing methodology, offering an alternative to the historical model, which fails to predict the presence of a detectable signal between any of the chemical interactions we and others have successfully interrogated with BSI.  FreeSRF definitively illustrates that when two species interact they form a new complex, and that this complex is physically/chemically distinct from the reactants.  The observation that changes in structure (conformation) and hydration are the major contributors to the BSI signal has the potential to address some the most important unanswered chemical and biochemical research questions.  Knowing how structure and hydration change with binding is central to our understanding of chemistry and biology.    Our observations and educational activities will accelerate drug discovery, deployment of personalized medicine, and enable the measurement of important indicators of environmental damage and afflictions such as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
