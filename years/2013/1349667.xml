<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: An Exceptional Window into Late Triassic Terrestrial Ecosystems from the Western United States&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By&lt;br/&gt;Randall Irmis, EAR-1349560, University of Utah&lt;br/&gt;Sterling Nesbitt, EAR-1349554, Howard University&lt;br/&gt;Nathan Smith, EAR-1349654, Virginia Tech&lt;br/&gt;Alan Turner, EAR-1349667, SUNY Stonybrook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt; Intellectual Merit: The Late Triassic (~235-201 million years ago) records one of the most dynamic intervals of Earth history. A critical time of paleoenvironmental and biotic turnover, this interval witnessed the origin of modern terrestrial ecosystems. The Hayden Quarry (HQ) represents a unique opportunity to establish an extensive multi-million-year biotic-paleoenvironmental archive from nonmarine strata. HQ and associated localities in the Upper Triassic Chinle Formation of northern New Mexico provide an unparalleled window into the evolution of terrestrial vertebrate ecosystems, including the rise of dinosaurs. The extremely well-preserved fossils of HQ include at least 12 major groups of Late Triassic vertebrates sampled from over 15,000 collected specimens. This project has two major goals: 1) to establish an integrated record of paleoenvironmental and faunal change in Upper Triassic strata of northern New Mexico; and 2) utilize the extraordinary HQ vertebrate assemblage to elucidate the evolutionary history of early Mesozoic archosauromorph reptiles. This project represents one of the first integrated studies of biotic response to paleoenvironmental changes in a terrestrial ecosystem during the rise of dinosaurs.&lt;br/&gt; Broader Impacts: PIs discoveries are assimilated into the education curriculum and new exhibits at the Ghost Ranch Museum of Paleontology, exposing over 2,000 K-12 students from Rio Arriba County to science (where 70% of residents belong to population groups traditionally underrepresented in science), including through class site visits to the Hayden Quarry itself. To date, forty-five graduate and undergraduate students from nine different institutions have participated in and received training through our Ghost Ranch field project. This project provides funding for a minimum of four graduate students and six undergraduates in fieldwork and research, including support for underrepresented groups in the geosciences (e.g., African-Americans and women). Research will be disseminated through both scholarly and popular publications, as well as media press releases (e.g., http://www.nsf.gov/tawa). Finally, data generated by the project will be contributed to NSF-supported publically accessible databases such as MorphoBank (http://www.morphobank.org) and the Paleobiology Database (http://paleodb.org/).</AbstractNarration>

Our goals were two-fold: to establish an integrated record of paleoenvironmental and faunal change in Upper Triassic strata of northern New Mexico and to utilize the extraordinary fossil assemblages to elucidate the relationships and evolutionary patterns of Upper Triassic vertebrates. We accomplished the first goal by integrating plant occurrences, wildfire, paleoenvironmental indicators, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations, and animal distribution through time. Unexpectedly, we discovered that poor and unstable environments in the low latitudes of Pangea in the Upper Triassic prevented large active warm-blooded herbivorous dinosaurs from becoming established in subtropical low latitudes until later in the Mesozoic. This will serve as a model of integrating paleoenvironmental conditions and vertebrate evolution. &nbsp;</p> <p>Our second goal focused on the fossils themselves from the Hayden Quarry, but our results had much wider effects on our understanding of global Triassic Period faunas. We were able to show that the biogeographic patterns of most Triassic Period vertebrates was heavily influenced by environmental factors in the low latitudes of Pangea. Nearly complete skeletons of early dinosaurs and their close relatives demonstrated the morphology of these forms was not what other related animals would have predicted and that dinosaurs and their close relatives grew unlike any other group of living vertebrates. We formally recognized 4 new species from the Hayden Quarry and surround area and these discoveries helped understand the relationships and diversification patterns of Triassic Period reptiles. Most importantly, we recovered small and rare reptiles (e.g., drepanosaurs, tanystropheids) that revolutionized our understanding of the biogeographic distribution and morphology of these forms. The tens of thousands of bones extracted during the grant will provide data and further research questions for the next decade.</p> <p>This large collaboration resulted in 14 published peer-reviewed papers in specialty (Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology) and broad scientific journals (PNAS), 5 other papers in review or nearly completed, 23 presentations at professional conferences and 7 more that will be presented in fall 2018, 8 public lectures and seminars by the PI, and the formation of a network of 15 colleagues. Additionally, we were able to build infrastructure (organized the collection, created a database) at the Ruth Hall Museum of Paleontology for further research in the area. Some of the publications are Open Access and available to all. Our taxonomic data was entered into Paleobiology Database (<a href="http://paleodb.org/">http://paleodb.org/</a>) and our phylogenetic matrices are available at MorphoBank (<a href="http://www.morphobank.org">http://www.morphobank.org</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>We were dedicated to student training at all levels.

I completely integrated the results of the grant and the fossils themselves into my undergraduate and graduate student courses at Virginia Tech. At Virginia Tech, I mentored two Master&rsquo;s and two PhD students that incorporated data from this project, directly mentored eight undergraduates with research projects associated with the project, four summer funded undergraduate field assistants, and 14 undergraduate volunteers cleaning fossils from the project. Undergraduate participation in research resulted in two undergraduate-led peer reviewed publications and 8 presentations with undergraduate coauthors.
