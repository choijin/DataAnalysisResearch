<AbstractNarration>This award will enable Professor Edward Cackett at Wayne State University to analyze archival X-ray data and carry out new observations of low-mass X-ray binaries.  He will use both timing and spectral information to probe the kinematics and geometry of the inner regions of accretion disks. His procedure involves modeling the reverberation of emission from a corona or boundary layer as it reflects off the inner accretion disk. Models of this process will be constrained by the spectral-dependent time lag of two emission components.  The PI has been a key player in applying these techniques to active galactic nuclei and stellar-mass black-hole accretion, and he will extend this work to neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Neutron stars provide the only way to probe fundamental questions regarding the behavior of matter under the most extreme conditions, with densities at their center being many times nuclear density. This award will facilitate a better measurement of the radius of neutron stars, and it will use neutron stars with low-mass companions as laboratories to study the physical process of accretion, which happens in a wide range of astrophysical contexts.  Professor Cackett is actively building an integrated research and education program at Wayne State University. As part of this award, he will develop a program to provide solar telescopes to metropolitan Detroit area high schools to add a hands-on daytime observing aspect to their science curricula. To multiply the effectiveness, he will conduct workshops for high-school teachers and provide sample curricular materials and independent research projects.  These workshops will also include a review of all astronomy topics in the high school science standards, with a particular focus on contemporary topics of interest that are associated with the original and creative research funded by this award.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Neutron stars are remnants from the explosions of massive stars at the end of their life.  They are extreme in all their properties and contain the densest directly observable material known to occur naturally.  Neutron stars are city-sized objects (about 12 miles across) that contain about 1.5 times the mass of the Sun.  The matter inside a neutron star is crushed to densities greater than that of an atomic nucleus, equivalent to cramming all of humanity into the size of a sugar cube.  This extreme density also leads to a strong gravitational field, with the gravity around a neutron star second only to black holes. Therefore, it is of great interest to find ways to study neutron stars so as to better understand the properties of matter at extreme densities, and better understand strong gravity.    One of the best ways is to study neutron star is to observe their X-ray emission.  Neutron stars are often found in binary systems where a star like our Sun orbits around the neutron star.  In these systems (called low-mass X-ray binaries) material from the Sun-like star can fall (or 'accrete') onto the neutron star.  As the material falls onto the neutron star it gets hot enough to emit brightly in X-rays.  The X-ray emission probes the material just before it falls onto the neutron star, and thus can provide vital information about the properties of the neutron star and its gravitational field.   The intellectual merits of this project allow for a better understanding of the geometry and physical conditions around neutron stars - an environment that is one of the most extreme in the universe.  Through this project we applied cutting-edge analysis techniques to study the energy-dependence of the variability properties of neutron stars in low-mass X-ray binaries.  Previously, most studies have focused either on looking at either the distribution of the energy of the X-rays from these objects (spectral analysis), or on their variability properties (timing analysis).  Here, we combined both, performing a spectral-timing analysis to look at the delay (or lag) between the arrival time of X-rays of different energies.  This is then used to place constraints physical mechanisms leading to the X-ray emission, hence providing a better idea of the geometry of the system.    Much of our work in this project focused on a phenomenon known a kilohertz quasi-periodic oscillations (kHz QPOs).  These kHz QPOs are oscillations in the X-ray emission occurring at frequencies that might be associated with material orbiting right next to the neutron star, and so are of great interest.  We applied these spectral-timing techniques to a large archival dataset of kHz QPOs detected by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. We achieved the most detailed characterization of their properties yet, demonstrating that the two types of kHz QPOs likely have different physical origins. We were also able to demonstrate through careful modeling that the time lags in kHz QPOs cannot be explained by 'reverberation' - a process where X-rays echo off the material onto the neutron star (like sound echoing in a cavern).  Work on this project contributed to 22 publications in peer-reviewed journals.    The broader impacts of the project involves both the advanced training of graduate students, as well as public outreach to schools and professional development for teachers.  The project directly led to the training of graduate students in advanced data analysis and modeling techniques, with two graduate students earning PhDs based on their work on this project.  As part of the project I developed the Solar Observing in Schools program, which involves both professional development and training in astronomy for teachers and providing access to solar telescopes for use in schools.  The program provided astronomy training for over 60 teachers from Detroit Public Schools, with topics covered ranging from the Sun and our solar system to the origins of the Universe.  All training was directly linked to science standards.  Teachers who came through the program were then eligible to borrow solar telescopes for use in their own classrooms.  Moreover, I have shared my knowledge and passion for astronomy through school visits, public lectures and media interviews.
