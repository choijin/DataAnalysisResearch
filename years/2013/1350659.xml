<AbstractNarration>1350659 &lt;br/&gt;Shen, Xiling    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that bind and inactivate target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). While the extensive roles of microRNAs in regulating cellular processes have been appreciated by now, the questions emerge as why many critical hubs in the regulatory network rely on microRNA rather than protein, and how such microRNAs manage to properly regulate genes of drastically different dynamic properties. The purpose of microRNA is often thought to fine-tune gene expression. However, a recent study has demonstrated that microRNAs can also form a binary switch to determine cell fate asymmetry, which suggests that microRNA regulation is more versatile than it was previously given credit for. This project will investigate how microRNA versatility contributes to the overall performance of the regulatory network in terms of robustness, programmability and speed. The proposed study will combine computational modeling and quantitative experiments to approach these questions from three angles: (i) Do microRNAs and proteins form specific regulatory motifs to enhance regulation dynamics? (ii) Do microRNAs target specific sets of genes for binary instead of modulatory regulation? (iii) Is microRNA regulation capable of filtering extrinsic and intrinsic cellular noise?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Found in plants and animals, microRNAs add an extra layer of complexity to regulatory networks and play critical roles in development, oncogenesis, aging, etc. The proposed study will reveal the versatility of microRNAs and how they contribute to the performance of the regulatory network. This may provide an explanation as to why certain microRNAs serve as regulatory hubs while others do not. The study may also reveal the underlying mechanism that allows microRNAs to be programmable by evolution and help improve future microRNA-dependent diagnostics and therapies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the project, this CAREER award by the Biotechnology, Biochemical, and Biomass Engineering Program of the CBET Division is co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project studied how microRNA forms regulatory circuits to safeguard tissue integrity and how its dysregulation contributes to tumor formation. This team first discovered that a microRNA miR-1269 forms a positive feedback loop with TGF-beta to promote colon cancer metastasis (Bu et al, Nature Communications, 2014). The team then reported that the microRNA miR-34a is activated in inflammatory colon and intestinal stem cell niches to promote asymmetric stem cell division during reparative regeneration (Bu et al, Cell Stem Cell, 2015). It also forms a feedforward loop with Notch to regulates asymmetric division of colon cancer stem cells. Silencing of miR-34a contributes to oncogenesis and tumor progression. The team then discovered that the silencing of miR-34a in late stage tumors is due to a novel long non-coding RNA, lnc34a, which epigenetically silences miR-34a expression by recruiting Dnmt3a and HDAC1 to methylate and deacetylate the miR-34a promoter simultaneously (Wang et al, eLife, 2016). Lastly, the team reported that miR-34a is a central checkpoint for safeguarding colon stem cell niche and epithelium integrity during bacterial infection-induced inflammation (Wang et al, eLife, 2018). miR-34a simultaneously targets immune and epithelial cells during infection-induced inflammation by suppressing T helper 17 (Th17) cell differentiation and expansion, hindering Th17 cell recruitment to the colon epithelium, and inhibiting IL-17-induced stem cell proliferation. Overall, this project highlights the importance of microRNA in protecting tissue integrity under inflammatory conditions, and such microRNA-mediated mechanisms continue to play a role in limiting stem cell proliferation in early-stage cancer until its silencing by cancer progression.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/07/2019<br>      Modified by: Xiling&nbsp;Shen</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
