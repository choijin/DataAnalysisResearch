<AbstractNarration>Technical Description: The objective of this research is to develop a fundamental understanding of carrier transport across materials interfaces. Rectifying interfaces between different materials such as p-n junctions and metal-semiconductor contacts are the foundation of modern digital logic and optoelectronic devices. This research provides knowledge of how carrier attenuation, parallel momentum conservation, and interface band structure affect carrier transport. The scientific objectives are to: i) measure the effects of interface band structure and parallel momentum conservation upon carrier attenuation, ii) locally map these effects with nanoscale resolution, and iii) develop custom materials interfaces which enhance or suppress these effects. The technical approach consists of thin film deposition in a state-of-the-art ultrahigh vacuum chamber, and carrier transport measurements using low-temperature in-situ ballistic electron emission microscopy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Description: The project addresses fundamental areas of charge carrier transport across materials interfaces that have high technological relevance. Hot-carrier attenuation, conservation of parallel momentum, and interface band structure are fundamental aspects of carrier transport in solid state logic and optoelectronic devices. Advancements in this knowledge enable improvements in functionality and efficiency that are critically needed to keep pace with the ever increasing demands placed upon electronic devices.  In addition, a significant program in outreach and education is included that enables research experience for high-school students, as well as the participation in community and K-12 outreach events. Furthermore intensive training and development of graduate and undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented groups, is a significant part of the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ PI: Vincent LaBella  Recipient Organization: University at Albany - SUNY  This project addresses fundamental areas of electron transport across material interfaces that have high technological relevance. Material interfaces are the foundation of modern digital high-speed electronic devices such as diodes and transistors.  Controlling their properties and understanding how charge carriers (electrons) flow or travel through them is paramount to making nanoscale devices.  One of the major outcomes was the ability to visualize the electrostatic barrier that exists at the interface between a metal and a semiconductor (W/Si) as displayed in the figure. The barrier exists because charges in the semiconductor repel the electrons traveling from the metal into the semiconductor. If these electrons have enough energy they will overcome this repulsive force and overcome the barrier.  The figure shows that the value of the energy needed to overcome the barrier fluctuates significantly over the nanoscale regime. This barrier is assumed to be uniform in conventional modeling of device performance and these nanoscale fluctuations demonstrate that this assumption needs to be revisited.  This is even more important as the contact area between metals and semiconductors found in transistors within modern smart phones are roughly 10 nm by 30 nm, or ten times smaller than this image and on the size scale as the fluctuations observed.  Another outcome of this work was the development of a high-speed and robust data fitting routine that is utilized to generate these nanoscale maps of the electrostatic barrier.  The PI has made this numerical routine publically available on his research group?s website for anyone to use.  This discovery has provided a new visualization method for other scientists and engineers to utilize for making current and next generation electronic devices.  In addition, it has provided new knowledge surrounding the cause of the electrostatic fluctuations at material interfaces with nanoscale resolution.  This new knowledge can now be used for new studies and for fabricating new devices with novel functionality.  An intensive focus of this program was also in personnel development and outreach activities.  The PI was elected as a fellow of the American Physical Society in 2014 and won the Chancellors Award for Excellence in Scholarship and Creative Activities from the State University of New York in 2015.  Two graduate students supported by this award graduated and earned their Ph.D. and found jobs in high tech companies in New York State, and a third graduate student is within a year of graduating.  Several undergraduate students also worked on the project.   The PI participated in several outreach events to the public and middle and high school students by giving several presentations on nanotechnology and its impact on video game development over the past 40 years.  In addition, he voluntarily taught an after school computer programming class at a local junior high and performed electrical motor building activities with junior high students, teaching them about electricity and power generation.
