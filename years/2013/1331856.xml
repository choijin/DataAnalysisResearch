<AbstractNarration>This 1-year project represents a plan to complete the investments made in the Christina River Basin (CRB) Critical Zone Observatory (CZO) with NSF award 0724971. The overarching scientific objectives of the CRB-CZO were established in 2009 to test two related hypotheses: 1) Hydrological, chemical, and biological processes that produce and mix mineral surfaces and organic carbon are rate limiting to watershed scale chemical weathering, soil production, and carbon sequestration; and: 2) Humans accelerate rates of carbon-mineral mixing, resulting in anthropogenic carbon sequestration significant to local, regional, and global budgets.  The extended CRB-CZO team examined these hypotheses within the 6th-order CRB watershed of Southeastern Pennsylvania and Southern Delaware with a suite of long-term studies organized into 4 inter-related objective areas: 1) Carbon-mineral-microbe-water interactions, 2) Co-evolution of critical zone structure, hydro-bio-geo-chemical function and carbon complexation, 3) Mobilization, transport &amp; depositional controls on carbon-mineral supply, mixing, and burial, and 4) Saprolite to sea integration of erosion-driven carbon sequestration.  CRB-CZO studies investigate scales varying from individual mineral grains to entire watersheds, and involve field, lab, and modeling approaches.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This 1-year award will fund 14 investigators from 5 institutions to finalize ongoing research on these topics. In addition, the CRB-CZO team will also finalize installation of sensor stations in the streams draining study watersheds with different "endmember" land uses (forest, agriculture, and disturbed) as an investment in future studies.  The research plan also outlines opportunities to pursue ongoing funding beyond the NSF CZO program.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CRB-CZO research activities under this 1-year award will finalize training of approximately 8 PhD students and result in numerous publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at scientific meetings.  CRB-CZO will, to the extent possible, continue to communicate and coordinate with the national CZO network (including the national CZO office).  Investigators will also organize a Christina River Basin Science and Management Symposium in the Fall of 2014.  The Symposium will highlight CRB-CZO research to a variety of stakeholders, including the Christina Basin Water Quality Management Committee, which includes representatives from 15 federal, state, and local environmental resource agencies.</AbstractNarration>

Our study was the first one to examine (1) the processes of interaction between organic matter and minerals across large spatial scales and (2) the effects that these processes have on the local to regional carbon balance.  At the smallest scale, we demonstrated that anaerobic microbial processes destabilize geochemical associations involving dissolved organic carbon and iron.  Studies at the hillslope scale reveal that the production rate of mineral surface area varies most substantially at a depth between the water table and the soil-saprolite boundary, challenging previous views that these transition zones play a vital role in the geochemistry of the critical zone.  Using a novel Zr normalization of elemental abundances in soils, we quantitatively determined, for the first time, the long-term geochemical impacts of agriculture on soil chemistry, a critical step for assessing the efficiency of fertilizers and other soil amendments over decadal to centennial timescales. Other work has determined that organic carbon stabilized by mineral surfaces in soils influences soil water chemistry by reducing mineral dissolution rates, revealing a previously unknown mechanism of soil carbon effects on chemical weathering. At the scale of entire watersheds, we also developed new models for watershed scale sediment routing.  Our results indicate that particle travel times from upland sources to a watershed outlet are almost entirely determined by the time particles spend in alluvial deposits; transport processes (e.g., storms) may be largely neglected.  Watershed-scale particle travel times may range from months to thousands of years, often challenging watershed management planning to reduce the loading of sediment and other particles to estuarine receiving waters.  All of these ideas are gaining traction within and beyond our disciplines, including those involved in large-scale watershed restoration activities.  In completing these studies, we have provided opportunities for training and professional development, helped to educate the public, and informed scientists around the world.  Our activities help to train 20 graduate students and 5 post-doctoral scientists.  Our joint summer internship program reached 34 undergraduate students and K-12 educators during the last two years.  The WikiWatershed initiative of the Stroud Water Research Center was built from data infrastructure created by this project to help inform K-12 students and the public through the WikiWatershed website (http://wikiwatershed.org/) and the Model My Watershed web applications (https://app.wikiwatershed.org/ and https://app.wikiwatershed.org/micro/).
