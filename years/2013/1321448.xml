<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this travel grant is to increase participation at the  2013 International Workshop on Software Engineering for Computational Science and Engineering Workshop, taking place in Conjunction with the International Conference on Software Engineering 2013.  The grant will increase the amount and diversity of participation from the Software Engineering and Computational Science/Engineering communities, help nurture interactions, synergies and collaborations involving the two communities, and help build the next generation of knowledgeable researchers and practitioners working on software development to sustain and advance software for computational science and engineering. The funds will support faculty and students, with attention to underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
