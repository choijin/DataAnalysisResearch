<AbstractNarration>The proposal requests for travel funds to support US participants, particularly&lt;br/&gt;graduate students and recent Ph.D.s, to attend the international&lt;br/&gt;workshop Model Theory 2013 that will be held June 10-15 in Ravello Italy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the objectives of this workshop will be  &lt;br/&gt;bringing together researchers in Model Theory and other areas of mathematics where&lt;br/&gt;model theory has had significant applications.  By presenting and discussion problems &lt;br/&gt;as well as  recent advances in these areas we hope to  facilitate further interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another goal of the workshop is to provide an informal setting where graduate students and younger researchers from  US &lt;br/&gt;can learn about new trends and interact with one another as well as with prominent senior&lt;br/&gt;mathematicians.  There will be three tutorials on recent developments&lt;br/&gt;in Model Theory given by experts and aimed mostly at young researchers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is expecting participation from a large number of&lt;br/&gt;graduate student and recent Ph.D.s.&lt;br/&gt;Besides providing an opportunity for researchers to exchange ideas and discuss open problems, another&lt;br/&gt;equally important goal of the workshop is to foster interaction among&lt;br/&gt;graduate students and recent Ph.D  by providing a setting&lt;br/&gt;contacts with junior and senior researchers are naturally and easily made.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More information about the workshop can be found on its webpage&lt;br/&gt;http://logica.dmi.unisa.it/Ravello/</AbstractNarration>

Postdoctoral researchers and graduate students had the opportunity to present their work in shorter lectures and poster sessions.  The award provided  partial or full support for 18 US  based researchers including 9 graduate students, 2 postdoctoral researchers and 2 early career researchers.  5 of the supported participants were invited speakers.  5 of the supported participants were women and 2 were underrepresented minorities.  Slides from all lectures and copies of posters from the poster session are available on the conference website.          Last Modified: 06/02/2014       Submitted by: David E Marker]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
