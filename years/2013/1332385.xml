<AbstractNarration>PROPOSAL TITLE:  ESE: Spatial Interactive Optimization for Restoration of Upland Storage in Watersheds: Community Participation in the Design of Distributed Practices and Alternatives&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Dr. Meghna Babbar-Sebens, Assistant Professor, Department of Earth Sciences, Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CO-PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR: Dr. Snehasis Mukhopadhyay, Associate Professor, Department of Computer and Information Science, Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;COLLABORATOR:  Dr. Edna Loehman, Emeritus Professor, Department of Agricultural Economics, Purdue University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The alteration of the natural hydrologic cycle due to human activities -- such as deforestation, artificial agricultural drainage systems, urbanization, and residential development has resulted in loss of multiple ecosystem services (e.g. flood attenuation and water quality control) that were previously provided naturally by various landscape features in river basins and watersheds. Re-naturalization of the hydrologic cycle in degraded watersheds has been proposed to replace lost storage on floodplains with upland storage.  At the same time, agronomic practices recommended by USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service can improve water quality and habitat. This research focuses on the design of a distributed upland storage system, with design involving the selection of sites, scales, structural changes, and agronomic practices for agricultural landscapes in a degraded watershed. We will use the Eagle Creek Watershed (HUC 11 watershed) for development and demonstration of design methods.  Because there are a large number of alternative sites, scales, and mitigation methods, and because there are multiple criteria for selection of locations and methods, design is complex.  Quantifiable criteria for selection include downstream flood volume, cost of mitigation, loss of habitat, etc.  As in any decision problem, there are also unquantifiable criteria such as inconvenience and loss of productivity and control for private land holders.  Because upland re-naturalization must occur on private land, there must be voluntary agreement for any mitigation measures. To address both complexity and acceptability to land holders, our research will integrate computational tools (GIS, simulation, optimization algorithms, etc.) for quantified criteria with community participation to address un-quantified criteria. Specific objectives are: 1) Develop a simulation-visualization framework for stakeholders to assess mitigation alternatives under conditions of climate change. 2) Develop and investigate interactive, multi-objective, and stochastic optimization approaches for including single and multiple stakeholders' participation to generate preferred alternatives that reflect non-quantitative and local criteria. 3) Compare efficacy of the interactive approach with non-interactive optimization through stakeholder assessment. Though we demonstrate the usefulness of the approach for Eagle Creek Watershed, IN, it can, however, be applicable to many other areas and problems.</AbstractNarration>
