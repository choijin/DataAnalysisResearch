<AbstractNarration>Through archival research and interviews with innovators, the PI will produce a history of electronic reading technologies for blind and print-disabled people, and their co-evolution with mainstream reading practices. Beyond the introduction of new formats such as audiobooks and electronic books, print access efforts in the twentieth century gave rise to numerous technical innovations that transferred to other branches of electroacoustics and computing. Innovations in long-playing records,pitch-shifting with magnetic tape, scanning, optical character recognition (OCR), and synthetic speech ultimately retooled reading for both humans and machines. The project will contribute to the history of computing through attention to the overlooked topics of optical character recognition (OCR) as a mode of data input, and pattern-matching as a technique for artificial intelligence.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on these historical examples, this communications scholar develops new tools for understanding and stimulating innovative technology design and transfer. The work will contribute to the subfield of disability and STS, will train two disabled students, and will help destigmatize the category of assistive technology by tracing the ways these devices intervene into media policy, are repurposed for broad use, or in fact are marketed to multiple audiences. In addition to a monograph, the project will result in a website that will preserve and make publicly-available examples from several historical reading formats (e.g. Talking Books, text-to-tone, and text-to-speech systems). The website will model best practices of electronic accessibility.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Mission:   The initial research goals were as follows:  To reverse the common presumption of a "trickle down" relationship between innovation and disability (Pullin 2009) by proposing an exclusion-adaptation model for technology development. To produce a history of reading formats beyond print, with a focus on "assistive" electronic technologies whose components disseminated and ultimately transformed the print medium. To expand the history of computing through attention to the overlooked topic of optical character recognition (OCR) as a mode of data input. To connect present-day debates about the definition of reading in psychology and education to earlier discussions in the field of blindness rehabilitation&mdash;with the goal of destigmatizing nontraditional reading practices. To detail the history of "print disability" in the activist and legal spheres, arguing that this concept is a precursor to the "social model" that has dominated disability studies since the mid-1970s.   Research:   The PI conducted extensive archival research with two student assistants. Research trips were made to: AT&amp;T Archives, American Foundation for the Blind (AFB), National Federation of the Blind (NFB), Haskins Laboratories, University of Louisville Archives, American Printing House for the Blind, Perkins School, New York Public Library, VA Hines Hospital, Smithsonian NMAH, Cornell University Archives, Royal National Institute for the Blind (London), and Glasgow University Archives. The PI and RAs further examined the personal collections of several blind technology specialists, and conducted an online survey with NFB members about their reading habits.   Research entailed the digital preservation of audio recordings found in a wide range of formats at the sites listed above. The Talking Book collection at the AFB, the sound recording collection at the NFB, and the entire Womyn?s Braille Press Collection were digitally preserved. Hashash transcribed dozens of historical Braille documents held at the AFB, NFB, and private collections.  Education, Outreach, and Broader Impacts:   In addition to preserving three historically significant Talking Book collections&mdash;each of which will be made publicly available through the archive at which it is held&mdash;the PI has collected and digitized several hundred sound recordings related to the history of OCR and time-stretching technology. The PI will make these items publicly available via on-line databases hosted by the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science and the University of Minnesota Manifold site.  This project employed two RAs from the disabled NYU student community who were trained in digital transfer, archival research, and interview methods.  The group?s research was featured in a January 2015 edition of NYU Stories entitled "Beyond Braille: A History of Reading By Ear."  The work of the PI and Hashash was also featured in the Canadian disability studies podcast Adaptive in April 2016, later rebroadcast by CBC Radio.  In January 2017, PI and Hashash were interviewed by Craig Eley, Communications Manager for the Consortium of Humanities Center and Institutes, for a second podcast about their research on the history of "reading by ear" in the blind community (episode forthcoming).  Supplementing the academic publications derived from this research (described below), the PI has published three public blog posts:  "Optophones and Musical Print," Sounding Out!, 5 January 2015.  "Helen Keller and Talking Books," AFB Blog, 8 July 2015.  "Beyond Recognition: What Machines Don?t Read," AFB Blog, 15 September 2016.  The PI additionally mentored RA Hashash as she worked on her MA thesis, which was informed by the field of disability studies. In 2016, Mills and Hashash jointly gave two public presentations about their research, one to an audience at the University of Minnesota, and one to the HCI Seminar at Cornell Tech.  Mills successfully recommended Hashash for the Youth in International Development and Foreign Affairs summer internship program, coordinated by the U.S. International Council on Disabilities. Mills and Hashash received 2016 Nia Awards from the NYU Center for Multicultural Education and Programs.  Outcomes:   The PI delivered 27 lectures in 6 countries, in both public and academic settings, between May 2014 and May 2017. She has authored 9 publications, ranging from peer-reviewed articles to short on-line pieces, on the topic of blind reading tools and techniques. The PI has also been awarded a book contract from the University of Minnesota Press.  Beyond the initial goals of the project, research insights for the history of science and technology include:  The influence of optophone technology on Vladimir Zworykin (RCA) as he developed the first OCR device; the unexpectedly long history of optophone use among a subset of blind readers. The significance of the Optacon to university-industry collaborations in early "Silicon Valley" (an expansion of Christophe L&eacute;cuyer?s prior thesis). The centrality of OCR-based reading machines to the emergence of pattern recognition and AI in the second half of the twentieth century, and later to theories of reading itself in cognitive psychology. The social pull by blind speed-readers of Talking Books (beginning in the 1930s) for time stretching tools (commercialized in the 1970s).
