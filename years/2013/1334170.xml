<AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;"Topological Insulation" represents a new functionality whereby a specific inversion in the order of the energy bands in a 3D bulk insulator necessitates that the corresponding 2D surface would be metallic, with linearly dispersed crossing surface bands. Most remarkably, the ensuing surface states are spin-polarized and resilient to any passivation that respects the underlying symmetry. Unfortunately, in the absence of predictive "design principles", it has proven difficult to guide synthesis towards those materials in which this remarkable functionality would live. Indeed, the handful of known TI materials tend to be high-atomic number materials, thus not only being narrow-gap semiconductors, but also prone to structural defects that produce free carriers which obscure the TI-ness. We find that in addition to the band inversion necessitated for these, "Type1 TI's", there are other patterns of band inversion leading to different degrees of resilience to surface passivation. Such yet undiscovered cases, called here TI-2, as well as Band-Inversion (BI) of types 1 and 2 (BI-1, BI-2) could exist in a far wider range of materials, including wide gap insulators and semiconductors. We have developed theoretically calculable "Design Principles" (metrics of TI-ness) which we will apply, via first-principles electronic structure theory, to a wide range of both existing, and "designed" materials, screening for the specific patterns that would lead to TI-1, TI-2, BI-1 and BI-2 behaviors. Close integration with synthesis and ARPES experiments would lead to next-generation wide gap, light element TI's and BI's that would dramatically broaden the scope and understanding of surface electronic structure of new types of topological and band-inverted materials, providing a new paradigm for the design of conductive surfaces controlled by bulk properties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;***Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Most high technologies are based on unique functionalities (conductivity, magnetism) that "live" in certain, specific materials and no others. Identifying, (out of an astronomic number of possibilities) those materials likely to have a specific functionality is a generally unsolved problem in material research. This work offers a general strategy around this problem. It focuses on a newly discovered functionality- a single material having a conducting surface but an insulating interior, a property called "Topological Insulation" (TI). By combining a calculable "metric" (based on quantum theory of matter) that guesses if a material is likely to be a TI or not, with laboratory synthesis and synchrotron measurement, we offer to identify hitherto unknown new materials that have such prescribed properties. Graduate students and post-doctoral researchers will be supported under this grant, and will receive training in broad aspects of materials theory, synthesis, and characterization, as well as communication and leadership skills.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award is funded by the Division of Materials Research (DMR) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>During this three-year lifetime of the project, the main outcome includes two parts summarized in the following:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><em>1) New spin polarization effects and related phenomena. </em></strong>This new understanding of the enabling principle could be used in the future to design and discover new materials that exhibit this remarkable &ldquo;magnetism without magnets&rdquo;. The basic effect has been known to result from the coupling between the intrinsic angular momentum of individual electrons (&ldquo;spin&rdquo;) and the orbital motion of the electron in atoms. When this &ldquo;spin-orbit coupling&rdquo; exists in molecules or solids whose atoms are arranged without a particular symmetry, it creates distinctly oriented magnetic moments of the electrons (&ldquo;spin polarization&rdquo;) even though no magnetic field has been applied. These textbook effects were associated with the <em>global</em> absence of inversion symmetry, and consequently it was always assumed that it would be foolish to look for spintronic materials among the thousands known centrosymmetric compounds. We note, however, that the relativistic spin-orbit interaction is anchored primarily on atomic nuclear sites and should thus be primarily sensitive to <em>site</em> <em>point-group</em> asymmetries, rather than <em>bulk space-group</em> <em>crystal asymmetry</em>. In centrosymetric crystals the spin bands are degenerate in <em>E</em> vs <em>k</em> <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">momentum space</span></em> (i.e., each band containing both spin components), but this does not mean that the spins are mixed in <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">position space</span></em>. In contrast, we find and validate via first-principles calculations that in centrosymmetric materials with non-centrosymmetric site symmetries (such as MoS<sub>2</sub>, LaOBiS<sub>2</sub>, or Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>) there is a <strong><em>nonzero local spin polarization</em></strong> on each of the sector &alpha; and &beta; forming inversion partner, even though the<strong><em> total</em></strong> spin is zero (Fig. 1). Such real-space spin-polarizations are normally hidden by compensation effect, rather than being intrinsically absent, and are already verified by upcoming experiments. As the Nature News [Nat. Phys. 10, 333 (2014)] commented: &ldquo;The results will certainly lead to some changes in the next editions of textbooks discussing spin effects in solids. The work carried out by the authors is a beautiful example of how first-principles calculations can provide fundamental new insights into the properties of matter.&rdquo;</p> <p>The concept of hidden spin polarization also explains many previously embarrassing observations of apparent polarization noted in centrosymmetric systems that by common understanding should not have existed. One such example is the recent prediction and subsequent observation of strong circular polarization (CP) in bilayers of transition-metal dichalcogenides that are naturally centrosymmetric and thus should have no &ldquo;valley polarization&rdquo; effects. We show&nbsp;that for bilayers where inversion symmetry is present and valley polarization physics is strictly absent (Fig. 2), such intrinsic selectivity in CP is to be expected on the basis of fundamental spin-orbit physics.</p> <p><strong><em>2) Predicting new topological insulators with light elements:</em></strong> Topological insulators (TIs) are nonmetallic 3D bulk compounds or 2D nanostructures having an inversion in the order of the valence and conduction bands at special, time reversal invariant wave vectors in the Brillouin zone. Currently known topological insulators (TIs) are limited to narrow gap compounds incorporating heavy elements, thus severely limiting the material pool available for such applications. We focus on the possibility of converting a normal insulator into a topological one by designing an intrinsic or external electric field induces a specific band inversion, which leads to a topological state. Two cases are successfully predicted by theory. One is few-layer phosphorene, isolated through mechanical exfoliation from black phosphorus. Using first-principles calculations with applied perpendicular electric field we predict a continuous transition from the normal insulator to a topological insulator and eventually to a metal (Fig. 3). The other one is InSb/CdTe heterovalent superlattice and quantum wells. The heterovalent nature of such interfaces sets up, in the absence of interfacial atomic exchange, a natural internal electric field that along with the quantum confinement leads to band inversion, transforming these semiconductors into a topological phase while also forming a giant Rashba spin splitting (Fig. 4). The understanding gained from this study could significantly broaden the current, rather restricted repertoire of functionalities available from individual compounds by creating next-generation super-structured functional materials.</p> <p>We also advance a conjecture that the conditions needed for TI-ness&mdash;depopulation of bonding valence band states and the occupation of anti-bonding conduction band states&mdash;is contraindicated to thermodynamic stability, and may drive structural deformations if carried out throughout a significant portion of the Brillouin zone. We examine this possibility on oxide perovskites. First we identify the electronic and structural motif (&lsquo;topological gene&rsquo;) that achieves a topological band inversion in oxide perovskite (a lone-pair B atom at the octahedral site in the cubic ABO3, see Fig. 5). Then we identify that twelve ABO3 compounds that possess this gene are confirmed to be topological insulators in the cubic phase. However, we show that at ambient pressure the crystal structure that carries the topological gene is not the thermodynamically stable structure (the &lsquo;stability gene&rsquo;).</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/28/2016<br>      Modified by: Alex&nbsp;Zunger</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1334170/1334170_10275653_1480255512077_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1334170/1334170_10275653_1480255512077_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig. 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1334170/1334170_10275653_1480255512077_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig. 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Crystal structure, band structure, and projected local spin polarization of a "R-2" material LaOBiS2.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Nature</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alex&nbsp;Zunger</div> <div class="imageTitle">Fig. 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1334170/1334170_10275653_1480255596039_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1334170/1334170_10275653_1480255596039_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig. 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1334170/1334170_10275653_1480255596039_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig. 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Calculated circular polarization  ?  for different  (MX2)n  materials as a function of the number of monolayers  n.</div> <div class="imageCredit">APS</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alex&nbsp;Zunger</div> <div class="imageTitle">Fig. 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1334170/1334170_10275653_1480255705751_Fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1334170/1334170_10275653_1480255705751_Fig3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig. 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1334170/1334170_10275653_1480255705751_Fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig. 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Schematic plot of the topological phase transition of few-layer phosphorene under an external electric field</div> <div class="imageCredit">ACS</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Alex&nbsp;Zunger</div> <div class="imageTitle">Fig. 3</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1334170/1334170_10275653_1480255803955_Fig4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1334170/1334170_10275653_1480255803955_Fig4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig. 4"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1334170/1334170_10275653_1480255803955_Fig4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig. 4"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Inversion energy of InSb/CdTe abrupt superlattices as a function of the thickness of InSb layers m.
