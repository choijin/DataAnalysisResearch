<AbstractNarration>This workshop, led by an organizing committee of law and social science scholars affiliated with the Consortium for Undergraduate Law and Justice Programs (CULJP) and the Law and Society Association (LSA), will help identify and advance the next wave of research questions among four key subfields of sociolegal studies and expand the involvement of undergraduates in this research.  Those subfields include legal consciousness, legal mobilization, cause lawyering, and judicial decision making.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop is targeted to 30 sociolegal scholars from primarily undergraduate programs and will be held over one and a-half days.  Half of the participants will be selected by invitation with the other half open to application. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The workshop will help chart and stimulate new waves of sociolegal scholarship while increasing the involvement of undergraduates in this research.  One of the goals of the workshop is to create a network of research-active sociolegal scholars who are interested in expanding research projects at undergraduate sociolegal programs or involving undergraduates.  The organizers will enable this process by creating a listserv of participants and facilitating conversations as planning begins for potential research experiences involving undergraduates (REUs).  The organizers also will prepare an analytical article that synthesizes the discussions and conclusions of the workshop and how sociolegal scholarship might expand in four key subareas.  In order to stimulate and broaden the participation of undergraduates in sociolegal scholarship, the resulting publication also will report on strategies derived from the workshop to recruit and involve undergraduates in research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A group of sociolegal scholars, in conjunction with the Consortium of Undergraduate Law and Justice Programs (CULJP), proposed a workshop to help identify and advance the next wave of research questions in four key subfields of sociolegal studies and to expand the involvement of undergraduates in this research. Those subfields include legal consciousness, legal mobilization, cause lawyering, and judicial decision.     On July 21-22, 2014, 39 sociolegal scholars gathered for a two-day workshop at the National Science Foundation.  They were joined by two additional faculty and three doctoral students from American University.  Collectively, the participants spanned large research universities to small, regional colleges, from senior scholars to new faculty just beginning their careers.  They heard presentations on the current state of scholarship in the four identified subfields and spent considerable time discussing what questions in these areas warrant new or additional research. They also identified mechanisms and approaches for including undergraduates in future research projects.     A summary of the discussions and papers exploring future research and opportunities for undergraduate involvement was completed by the CULJP, which has disseminated that information to the sociolegal community through its newly improved website, listserv, and gatherings. The CULJP has built a community of scholars now engaged in further discussions about these issues.       Last Modified: 11/06/2015       Submitted by: Bill Davies]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
