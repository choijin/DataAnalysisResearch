<AbstractNarration>PI: Cowles, Geoffrey / Martinelli, Luigi&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1336007 / 1336020&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth / Princeton University&lt;br/&gt;Title: Collaborative Research: A multi-scale approach for optimizing tidal kinetic energy extraction for sustainable power generation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tidal in-stream energy conversion (TISEC) facilities provide a highly predictable and dependable source of energy. Given the economic and social incentives to migrate towards renewable energy sources there has been tremendous interest in the technology. However, at present it is not yet apparent what the most efficient design would be for real ocean conditions. A second open issue pertains to environmental impact. Such devices are able to extract a significant fraction of energy from the water column and can produce local modifications to the bed stress resulting in a morphodynamic adjustment in locations where the substrate is mobile. When sited in an inlet or constriction, a turbine array can influence the exchanges of water between an embayment and the adjacent ocean. An accurate quantification of environmental impact is critical for site planning and permitting.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Presently, researchers are examining scientific issues related to tidal kinetic energy extraction using a variety of computational tools that range from commercial CFD codes for evaluating device performance to ocean models for evaluating impact and site selection. Taken independently, such approaches are forced to rely on simplifying assumptions that decrease the accuracy and utility of the computations. The device scale CFD models typically employ a uniform inflow velocity, ignoring realistic site-specific ocean conditions that influence device performance such as vertical shear, surface waves, free-stream turbulence, and eccentricity of the tidal ellipse. Large-scale hydrodynamic models typically employ subgrid-scale approaches to model energy extraction using simple parameterizations to represent the influence of the device on the flowfield.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will apply a multi-model approach to link the scales of interest. Device scale simulations will be performed using a RANS CFD code with an optimal shape design capability. The shape design procedure uses a highly efficient approach based on control theory for construction of the gradient. For the larger scales necessary for impact assessment and site evaluation, an unstructured grid ocean model will be employed. The models will be coupled using a two-way approach. The device scale simulations will provide momentum loss and changes in turbulent kinetic energy needed for accurate subgrid-scale parameterization of energy extrac- tion in the ocean model. The ocean model will provide realistic flow conditions for the device scale simulations. The coupled approach will be applied to both idealized and realistic domains and will be capable of improving turbine performance in realistic conditions while simultaneously considering the potential impacts to the environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop and test a process for optimizing and evaluating tidal kinetic energy extraction across the entire range of critical scales. In particular, the multi-model approach will enable (1) automatic device shape design for increased efficiency in realistic flow conditions, (2) assessments of impact on circulation and sediment transport using accurate parameterizations of turbine effects. An important outcome of this research will be the development and demonstration of a suite of tools to support the planning and permitting processes for tidal energy installations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Computational simulation of tidal kinetic energy extraction has been traditionally carried out by independent models at the device (rotor), and environmental scales. At the device scale computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models typically employ a uniform inflow velocity, ignoring realistic site-specific ocean conditions that influence device performance such as vertical shear, surface waves, free-stream turbulence, and eccentricity of the tidal ellipse.  Large-scale hydrodynamic models typically employ subgrid-scale approaches to model energy extraction using simple parameterizations to represent the influence of the device on the flow field. This work advances our ability to carry out CFD analysis of cross-flow rotors at all scales.  In particular, our contribution to this CRA project has been directed at improving the simulation accuracy and speed for cross-flow rotor simulations at the device scale.  This work advanced the state-of-the-art of the CFD simulation of cross-flow turbines using unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS).  In particular, by adapting a well validated CFD code (SUMB) originally developed for compressible flow, we have devised an efficient and robust three-dimensional solver, which enables high fidelity time resolved solutions with computational speed and costs compatible with what is needed in the early stages of a new design.  We also have discovered and documented, we believe for the first time, a severe sensitivity of the turbine power predicted by CFD on the far-field boundary proximity.   The analytical justification for this behavior is based on blockage effects, and is applicable to the simulation of every type of rotor, axial or cross-flow.   Additionally, by studying the physical scaling over a range of Reynolds numbers of three geometrically similar turbines of differing solidity, we have shown significant improvement in power efficiency as the Reynolds number is increased. Furthermore, we have shown  that Betz limit is theoretically achievable by a cross-flow rotor as the Reynolds number is sufficiently increased.   In an ancillary study of cross-flow rotors for wind energy extraction, we have demonstrated that with an Actuator Line Model, the results obtained at the device scale can be used in an environmental scale LES -CFD analysis.   In the course of our numerical study, we discovered that only a few experimental data were available in the literature, which limits the ability of validating a CFD model. This motivated the last component of the work performed under this grant, which was aimed at providing detailed flow measurement of the wake structure downstream of cross-flow rotors.   We have measured the wake of a model turbine in a small recirculating wind tunnel under uniform low turbulence inflow conditions. Stereoscopic and planar particle image velocimetry were used to capture the wake using both ensemble-averaged and phase-locked measurements such that turbulence statics and wake structure could be investigated.  Four different blade profiles were tested to probe the effect of different blade geometries on the wake structure and planform energy flux, while the turbine performance was monitored using a combination of strain gauges and brake current measurements. The blade geometry was found to have a considerable effect on the planform energy flux and the recovery of the wake, and differences in the measured power output of each turbine were observed.  The detailed experimental results obtained, will be invaluable for further validation of computational models. Additionally, since cross-flow rotors are also used in vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT), the results of this study are also applicable to wind energy harvesting.
