<AbstractNarration>A Technical description&lt;br/&gt;The proposed collaboration proposes a joint research study of the electro-optical properties of BaTiO3 (BTO) films grown on Si by a group in University of Texas Austin and the group at IBM Zurich. The proposed collaboration is focused on developing hybrid ferroelectric/semiconductor materials for future information technology. The multidisciplinary nature of ferroelectric/ semiconductor systems means it is almost impossible to have all the necessary expertise in one institution, or even in one country.  &lt;br/&gt;Two broad scientific questions will be addressed: how does strain affect the linear electro-optical (EO) effect (i.e. Pockels effect), and how can the EO effect can be enhanced? The EO effect describes the change of refractive index of a material in a static electric field, and is exploited in many technological applications such as electro-optical modulators and deflectors. Ferroelectric ABO3 compounds such as BTO exhibit unusually large EO coefficients and are therefore materials of choice for optical devices.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A Non-technical description&lt;br/&gt;The integration of electro-optically active BTO on silicon can pave the way to the realization of a new variety of photonic devices with industry-changing performance. The development of silicon photonics, a hybrid technology combining semiconductor logic with fast broadband optical communications, could greatly benefit from the linear electro-optical properties of ferroelectric oxides, a property not present in bulk silicon, as a novel way to seamlessly connect the electrical and optical domains. Currently, no more than 5% of interconnects in a state of the art supercomputer, such as the IBM Roadrunner, are optical. Improving optical interconnects is thus tremendously promising for advancing information technology. With scientific research becoming increasingly multinational, it is of paramount importance to prepare our students to work in this highly collaborative international environment if we want to ensure US competitiveness in the global marketplace of tomorrow. The collective IRES experience will prepare our students for scientific careers in an international market place in an increasingly competitive technological world where scientists are expected to have a range of skills.&lt;br/&gt;The program will involve three graduate students, one focusing on first principles theory and two focusing on growth and electro-optical characterization. Every year, each student will spend up to twenty four weeks at the IBM facility in Zurich. Students will participate in the complete process flow, from materials growth to device fabrication and characterization, and thus learn how to process the materials and manufacture devices. It is expected that the theory students will develop a strong interaction with IBM researchers performing simulation and design of optical structures and devices.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
