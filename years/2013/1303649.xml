<AbstractNarration>This proposal will investigate the role of solar wind (magnetosheath) plasma under low-beta and sub-nominal solar wind Alfvén Mach number (&lt;3) conditions. The magnetosphere under these conditions is frequently called an Alfvén Wing magnetosphere.  The research will use the Coupled Magnetosphere-Ionosphere-Thermosphere (CMIT) model which includes the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM) MHD model coupled with the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIE_GCM) along with solar wind (OMNI), magnetosheath (Cluster and Geotail) and ionospheric (AMPERE and SuperDARN) data to investigate the effects of solar wind pressure, ionospheric conductivity and dipolar tilt on the transport of open magnetic flux and field aligned current generation in the polar cap. By examining the data and carrying out simulations for this newly discovered state of the magnetosphere they will determine how the configuration and dynamics of the lobes are controlled by Mach number and plasma beta, how the beta and Mach number control field aligned currents and flow and how important the dipole tilt is for the polar cap configuration and dynamics. &lt;br/&gt;This proposal will support a young scientist.  It has relevance to space weather.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It is a common misunderstanding that the aurora is caused by charged particles streaming directly from the solar wind into the polar ionosphere. Rather, it is caused by a complex interaction between the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) embedded in the solar wind, and the geomagnetic field at Earth. In this interaction, the IMF merges with the geomagnetic field at the dayside of Earth?s magnetosphere through a process called magnetic reconnection. This leads to "open" magnetic field lines that connect the Earth?s polar ionosphere to the solar wind, which are carried over the polar cap and into the magnetosphere?s comet-like tail. This process drives circulation of plasma in the ionosphere, and has an associated voltage. In studies of space weather, this voltage is often used as a measure of the intensity of solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. Initially, it was thought that when the IMF grew stronger, the corresponding voltage in the ionosphere would increase linearly in response. As it turns out, there comes a point where this voltage doesn?t respond as strongly to the IMF driving. Space physicists call this phenomenon "Cross Polar Cap Potential (CPCP) saturation." Our study used global simulations of the Earth?s magnetosphere and ionosphere to study the CPCP saturation phenomenon and understand why it happens.  Currently, there are two major competing theories attempting to explain CPCP saturation: called the "sheath force balance" and "Alfv&eacute;n wing" models. Both are based on the fact that when saturation occurs, the Mach number in the solar wind is typically very low. The sheath force balance model is based on the behavior of a region of slowed-down solar wind, called the magnetosheath, which flows past Earth. When the solar wind Mach number is low, that region expands outward, and more IMF is diverted around the sides of the magnetosphere, missing the region where magnetic reconnection occurs. In the Alfv&eacute;n wing model, the comet-like tail of the Earth?s magnetosphere splits into a wing-like structure, called "Alfv&eacute;n wings." This leads to a slow-down of the solar wind on open field lines as it flows past Earth, in turn leading to a slowdown of the plasma flow in the ionosphere.  Three major results were found in our simulation. First, we simulated the Earth?s magnetosphere under a variety of solar wind conditions, and found that when saturation happens, features predicted by both theories often occur. Second, we found that the saturation is more prominent in the summer hemisphere of Earth. Third, we found a special case where the CPCP saturated, and while there were Alfv&eacute;n wings, they didn?t connect to Earth and had no effect on the ionosphere. This suggests that while Alfv&eacute;n wings may form, they aren?t required to cause saturation of the polar ionosphere. These results will help predict future space weather events.
