<AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this program is to study local structures of quantum materials with electrical contrast.  Because of its scientific as well as technological importance, the electronic properties of complex quantum materials have been an important area of research.  As model material systems, their understanding often leads to revelations well beyond these materials themselves, as well as to important technology.  A recent development of the field is the emerging importance of local organizations in these materials, such as edge channels, domain walls, glassy patterns and interface structures. As a result, it is highly desirable to probe the local electrical response to external excitations and gain insight on electronic organization in these materials.  The experimental tool to carry out this study is a novel scanning near-field microwave impedance microscopy (sMIM). With optimized sensitivity, the minute local dielectric response to electromagnetic waves can be detected by RF electronics to form microwave images, with a spatial resolution determined by the tip diameter which can be one million times smaller than radiation wavelength. The combined strength of high resolution microwave imaging and temperature/field environment in the experimental system will allow the team to spatially visualize many interesting physical processes.  This project will support the education of a PhD student and postdoc in these highly sophisticated experiments, which have  historically been excellent training for many scientific careers from academia to the most advanced technology industries. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this program is to study electrical properties of materials that are candidates to continue the Si revolution.  This understanding often leads to revelations well beyond these materials themselves, as well as to important new technology.  A recent development of the field is the emerging importance of local organizations in these materials. As a result, it is highly desirable to probe the local electrical response to external excitations and gain insight on electronic organization in these materials, thus optimizing the opportunity to tailor their properties for application.  The experimental tool to carry out this study is a novel scanning near-field microwave impedance microscopy (sMIM).  This project will support the education of a PhD student and postdoc in these highly sophisticated experiments, which have historically been excellent training for many scientific careers from academia to the most advanced technology industries.  Because of the relative ease of operation of RF electronics, a first-order understanding of the technique and its contrast mechanism are easily understood with a simple lumped-element circuit models, which can be taught in high school physics classes. Further, the dual nature of both science and instrumentation development is an excellent platform to engage college students for research. This technology is also of industrial interest, for example in semiconductor metrology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The grant provided partial support for the following activities:  Significant scientific discoveries that are published in leading professional journals. We discovered/demonstrated a number of important phenomena that are at the forefront of the field of topological materials. These results not only advance the scientific understanding of these novel quantum phases of matter, but also provide the scientific underpinning for future quantum information technology.  Three examples of topological phases are listed below:  We discovered novel metallic domain walls in a failed Weyl semimetal, indicating that the novel topological physics persists at the domain boundaries (Science 2015).  We discovered/demonstrated the realization of the novel but elusive Axion insulator phase in the magnetic topological material system of Cr doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 (PNAS, 2019)  We demonstrated the Quantum Spin Hall (QSH) edge state in 1T'-WTe2 - which is the cleanest demonstrate of the QSH edge state to date. QSH has the potential to be the foundation of topological quantum information devices.  New precision measurement modalities (microwave impedance microscopy) that are covered by US patents. We licensed the technology to a Silicon Valley Startup that commercializes the technology. The MIM technology has now been used by many, including major semiconductor companies like Intel, Chipworks, Sony, Toshiba, Samsung, and TSMC.  We trained five young scientists - three to academic career (faculty- UCSD (woman), faculty-UC Riverside, scientific staff - Univ. of Tokyo/Riken), one to industry technical staff - Apple Corp, and one postdoc - Stanford. They are part of the highly qualified scientific workforce now.           Last Modified: 07/06/2019       Submitted by: Zhi-Xun Shen]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
