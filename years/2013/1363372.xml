<AbstractNarration>This project consists of a study of differential and difference equations and their generalizations  through the lens of model theory in the sense of mathematical logic, attacks on difficult problems in arithmetic dynamics using multiple model theoretic ideas, and a fundamental investigation into decidability in geometry and arithmetic.  In their many applications,  differential and difference equations describe the evolution and dynamics of complex systems.  Various  methods, computational and analytic, for example, are commonly employed to understand and solve these equations. With this project, ideas from algebra and logic, especially related to the principles of definability and  tameness of structure, will be used to understand differential and difference equations.   This basic research should have consequences in mathematics and the sciences broadly due to the importance of differential and difference equations in the applications of mathematics to the sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Concretely, with regards to differential equations, this project will extend the fundamental model theoretic results about differential fields to the class of D-fields in a more expansive sense. Secondly, the project involves a study of the fine structure of definability and dependence in D-fields. In particular, the project will extend the Zilber trichotomy (or, at least, results of a similar flavor) to infinite dimensional types, and, thus, specializing to classical theories, to underdetermined difference-differential, partial differential, and Hasse differential equations. Moreover, a goal of the project is an explicit characterization the induced structure on sets with trivial forking geometry. Thirdly, the project will develop a theory of specializations of D-rings through a model theory of valued D-fields. Fourthly, the project includes a development of general D-Galois theories based on multiple model theoretic perspectives. Finally in connection to D-fields, the project  includes an ambitious application of the theory of D-fields which may have transformative consequences; that is, to realize Borger's F-1-geometry as the study of finite dimensional definable sets relative to a certain theory of D-rings. With regards to diophantine geometry, the project will address Zhang's dense orbit conjecture and the dynamical Mordell-Lang through the model theory of difference fields and methods from o-minimality.  The project includes a program establish the decidability of complicated fragments of the theory of C(t), the field of rational functions over the complex numbers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Several important resutls were obtained through this project. These include the following.   It has been observed since the late Nineteenth century that the local inverses of many analytic covering maps satisfy nontrivial nonlinear algebraic differential equations.  We found a general explanation for this algebraicity based on the Peterzil-Starchenko theory of o-minimal complex analysis.  This construction has allowed us to explain the apparent complextiy of the associated algebraic differential equations in simple analytic terms.   In work still in progress when this project terminated, these constructions are used to verify variants of the functional transcendence conjectures in the vein of the Zilber-Pink conjectures.   In the late 1970s, researchers in the model theory of differential fields had proposed that all sets defined by ODEs which are orthogonal to the constant field have an aleph-null categorical induced structure.  The exiistence of the Manin kernels studied by Buium and then from the model theoretic perspective by Hrushovski shows that such a conjecture is false, but the refinement of the conjecture to trivial strongly minimal sets had remained open for two more decades.  With this project we resolved this conjecture negatively by analyzing the differential equation satisfied by the analytic j-function.   In so doing, we also proved strong functional transcendence results on the j-function and proved an effective finiteness theorem on intersections of varieties with Hecke orbits.  This project supported work on the theory of Chow varieties for differential fields.  In particular, we established that such Chow varieties always exist parameterizing families of differential varieties over ordinary differntial fields.  Strong results on the arithmetic of algebraic dynamical systems have been obtained through this project.  For instance, the Zhang dense orbit conjecture was established for self-maps of semiabelian varieties in characteristic zero.   Other important results were obtained on definability in finitely generated rings, on o-minimality, on decision procedures in linear algebra, and other topics.
