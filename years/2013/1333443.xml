<AbstractNarration>The project supports 10 students to attend the 22nd ACM International Symposium on High Performance Parallel&lt;br/&gt;and Distributed Computing (HPDC-2013) to be held in New York, NY, June 17-21, 2013. HPDC 2013 comprises the main conference as well as 8 affiliated workshops, and is the premier forum for presenting the latest research findings on the design and use of parallel and distributed systems for high end computing, collaboration, data analysis, and other innovative applications. Student attendance at the conference will greatly benefit the students by exposing them to a variety of issues in high end computing.</AbstractNarration>

In 2013, HPDC was held in New York City, NY, June 17th through June 21st.  The award has provided partial funding for eligible expenses (including transportation, lodging, meals) for fourteen Ph.D. students to attend the HPDC conference. These students presented their research on the main conference, the poster session, and/or one of the associated workshops. Four of the students were able to give their first presentation at a conference/workshop with the support from this grant.
