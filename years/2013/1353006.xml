<AbstractNarration>1353006&lt;br/&gt;Emami-Neyestanak&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will focus on mechanically and electrically adaptive and modular designs that conform to the tissue. Instead of having one large chip connected to a dense electrode array via a cable, many tiny low-cost chips that form a complete system are distributed over a foldable substrate. Specified regions of the substrate willt be arranged to establish relations in the final folded form. New patterns will be developed that can be tiled into pixel arrays and provide 3D positioning of the components mounted upon the substrate. The reconfigurable chips will have novel proximity sensors and communication circuits to form a complete system suitable for the origami structure and deployment. Micromechanical latches will be used for fixation and tuning of the structure. Different module "types" will be developed that can be elegantly tiled into arrays and result in 3D shapes that match the contour of the tissue. The reconfigurable chips will have novel proximity sensors,  communication and power delivery circuits to form a complete system with the proposed modular structure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project we used origami art and science to develop a high-performance implant system that allows minimally invasive surgery and closely apposes the implant to the target organs.  In order to achieve these goals, we focused on development of origami designs for adaptive distributed electronics and electrode arrays that fold for minimal incision, and then self deploy to conform to the body. While we targeted neural stimulation, such solution is applicable to numerous classes of biomedical implants.   Our team developed a theoretical model and design algorithm for constructing spherical surfaces via folding. The output of this model was used as the input for both experimental fabrication and for detailed numerical modeling that included material properties, thicknesses, and other non-idealities.  We also developed a general numerical simulation technique for origami folding and we used this technique to study the implants made by an origami technique. Our simulation computes the final shape of the implant, the stress and strain distribution in the implant during construction, and the pressure forces applied by the implant onto the organ. Using this simulation, we were able to examine the separation between the surface of the implant and the organ, considering  different curvatures. Once the implant shape has been determined, as outlined above, the second part of the simulation determines how the implant shape changes in response to different actions that may be applied during a surgical procedure.   We then fabricated a prototype origami structure using of the Parylene-C. Due to its high biocompatibility, good mechanical strength and machinability, parylene-C (PA-C) has become a good candidate as the material for implantable devices. We developed a robust methodology for folding a fully-released 2D parylene-C thin film with the special folding crease patterns to a 3D spherical origami structure.
