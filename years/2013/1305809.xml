<AbstractNarration>This renewal grant provides continued funding for TASI, the annual Theoretical Advanced Study Institutes in Elementary Particle Physics, currently under the direction of Professors K.T. Mahanthappa and T. deGrand at the University of Colorado, Boulder. The four-week long TASI summer programs have been held every year since 1984. The aim of TASI is to introduce advanced graduate students to a much broader range of ideas and topics than they normally experience in their home institutions while working on their dissertation topics. TASI has been highly successful in achieving this by providing a series of lectures and seminars on topics of current research in theoretical particle physics and related experimental subjects. Indeed, during their nearly 30-year history, the TASI summer programs have become a major educational experience and indeed an eagerly anticipated "rite of passage" for literally generations of high-energy theory graduate students. Moreover, since 2007, the TASI lectures have been video-recorded and are accessible online. These video tapes form an important "broader impacts" outreach component of TASI, and have become increasingly valuable to the entire high-energy physics research community.  Students attending TASI also have the opportunity to present seminars on their current research to their peers.</AbstractNarration>
