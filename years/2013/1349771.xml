<AbstractNarration>Dr. Scott Burdick has been awarded an NSF EAR Postdoctoral fellowship to carry out a research and education plan at the University of Maryland. The investigation will focus on developing seismic images of rifting continental lithosphere and the underlying mantle in order to provide new constraints on the factors that control continental rifting. Continental rift zones, localized regions where extension occurs and the lithosphere is ruptured, play a central role in continental evolution. Despite progress in modeling of rifting lithosphere, fundamental questions concerning the initiation and evolution of continental rifts remain. The education plan will include developing teaching modules for introductory classes, and mentoring graduate and undergraduate students in developing tomographic models&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To accomplish the goals of the project, Dr. Burdick will use whole-mantle traveltime tomography and a novel reflection tomography method that simultaneously constraints both smooth variations in seismic velocity and locations of seismic discontinuities, such as the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary and mid-lithopsheric discontinuities. The proposed research is focused on two active and well-instrumented continental rifts: the Rio Grande Rift and the Salton Trough. In order to provide a point of reference on the preexisting seismic properties involved in the initiation of rifting, the project will also examine the South Georgia Suture. All study regions are covered by dense broadband seismic arrays. Data from these arrays, as well as the USArray Transportable Array and global catalogues will be used in the continental-scale research component that will help provide a connection to deeper processes.</AbstractNarration>

The velocity with which seismic waves travel is affected by variations in temperature, mineral composition, melt, and fluid content.  Seismic tomography is one of the best tools to interrogate these variations.  With its images of cold, seismically fast slabs descending from subduction zones and hot, buoyant plumes rising from the deep mantle, tomographic velocity models provides us with a three-dimensional snapshot of the dynamic mantle and helps us understand its relationship to the origin and evolution of the Earth?s lithosphere.  Funding from this award allowed for the construction and publication of a P-wave velocity model of North America using data from USArray, the seismological component of Earthscope.  This model brings greater illumination to large scale features in the mantle beneath the United States&mdash;failed continental rifts beneath the midcontinent and Mississippi embayment, a concentrated slow region underlying recent volcanism in central Virginia, and, for the first time, the deep structure of the Pacific plate subducted beneath Alaska and the Aleutians.
