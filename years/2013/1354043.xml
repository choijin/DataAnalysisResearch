<AbstractNarration>This project will synthesize knowledge about the reproductive biology of tropical forest trees. The synthesis will incorporate recent ideas and data, update previous findings, and review the impact of contemporary global environmental changes such as land use change, the spread of invasive species, and climate change. This review will help define future trends in reproduction and regeneration in tropical forests, and assess the effects of these trends for sustaining tropical biodiversity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this synthesis will be of interest to a wide range of biologists, and foster new research on reproduction and regeneration of plants in tropical forests. The work on the effects of global environmental change on the reproduction and population biology of forest trees, and the possibilities for mitigating these effects, will help conservation biologists, resource managers, and policy makers. It will offer opportunities for graduate students to participate in the synthesis of concepts and data, meta-analyses, and the linking of fundamental research with issues of human use of natural resources, land management, and conservation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><em>Intellectual Outcomes:</em> The two major goals were to: a) undertake a synthesis of a range of current concepts and data on reproductive traits of tropical forest trees to test some basic hypotheses about the evolution of breeding systems, pollination mechanisms, seed dispersal, population genetic structure, and of such traits as polyploidy and apomixes, and b) link my earlier work on reproductive traits with today?s challenges to the sustainable management of tropical forests. Even though the project is over, the work on these two goals is continuing. Major outputs so far include two papers on kin selection published in peer-reviewed journals. Kin selection refers to the sacrifice of the individual to enhance the fitness of its close relatives. Our results indicate that kin selection may have led to two types of flowering plants, plants with large flowers pollinated by specialized pollinators and having multi-seeded fruits in which all or most seeds are from a single pollen parent. The other group has small flowers, generalist pollinators, and single or few seed fruits. In addition to three papers on kin selection, two more papers were published on the evolution of certain reproductive traits in plants.
