<AbstractNarration>Project scientists will conduct whole-genome DNA sequencing and comparative genomic analyses on several species of fire ants to reveal the genetic determinants of variation in colony social organization.  Fire ants are ideal models to learn about genes that influence complex social behavior because the biology of these pests is well known, genetic resources are available, and strict genetic control over variation in fundamental social traits has been documented.  Project researchers will generate complete genome sequences for more than 140 specimens of native, South American fire ants and use statistical and comparative analyses to reconstruct the architecture and evolutionary history of the genomic region regulating social organization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will have broad implications for evolutionary biologists seeking to understand the genetic bases of complex social behaviors.  Description of a genomic region involved in a major social innovation using the fire ant model will advance understanding of the evolution of advanced social behavior as well as clarify the evolutionary origin of integrated gene complexes, which underlie such important biological phenomena as the origin of sex chromosomes and self-incompatibility.  The information to be generated is essential for an improved understanding of the molecular basis of social life.  Associated outreach and educational activities will inform the public about the evolution of social behavior and involve secondary school classrooms in citizen-science activities related to the project.</AbstractNarration>
