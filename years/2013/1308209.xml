<AbstractNarration>"3-Manifolds: Heegaard Splittings, the Curve Complex, and Hyperbolic Geometry" is a mathematics research conference which will be held April 19-21, 2013 at Rice University in Houston, Texas. This conference will bring together senior and junior researchers in the above areas of 3-manifolds in order to share recent progress and reflect on the future direction of the subject. It will feature approximately eight research lectures together with an introductory lecture intended for graduate students.  Ample time will be set aside for interaction and collaboration among the attendees.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In its broadest terms this project is about the mathematical structure of the "shape" of 3-dimensional objects (topology/geometry). Understanding complex shapes has many diverse applications. The geometric structure of proteins and other complex molecules is crucial to drug development. The geometric shape of organs (especially the brain) is vital to the field of medical imaging. The prediction of shape from incomplete data has important military and commercial applications. The geometric configuration of cellular DNA is vital in determining the precise mechanisms of cellular processes. In the past few decades, topology has experienced fundamental and transformative developments. This conference will fertilize new research directions by encouraging mathematical interaction and collaboration among researchers. The budget will help support the travel expenses of the speakers, and it will provide partial support to graduate students and other young researchers to  enable their participation in this event. Every effort will be made to support and encourage participation from underrepresented groups. Registration for the conference is available at the conference website, http://math.rice.edu/Conferences/3-Manifolds/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supported a mathematical research conference at Rice University on April19-21,  2013, on the subject of 3-dimensional manifolds.  In its broadest terms the subject of this conference is  the mathematical study of  the ``shape'' of 3-dimensional objects. Understanding complex shapes has many applications. The geometric structure of proteins and other complex molecules is crucial to drug development. The geometric shape of organs (especially the brain) is vital to the field of medical imaging. The prediction of shape from incomplete data has important military and commercial applications. The geometric configuration of cellular DNA is important in determining the precise mechanisms of cellular processes.  Eight of the leading researchers in the United States and Europe presented their research during the conference.  The research topics included Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds, distance and the cabling conjecture, triangulations of 3-manifolds, the virtual Haken conjecture, rank and genus of 3-manifolds, curves in the Masur domain, the diameter of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and left orderability of 3-manifold groups.   The conference was attended by over 60 persons including 35 mathematics Ph.D. students and 15 postdoctoral researchers and junior faculty. Through the dissemination of this important information, and through the concomitant  mentoring by senior faculty attendees, this project  increased the scientific capablities,  and the participation of U.S. citizens, permanent residents and women in mathematical research.  The webpage for the conference can be found here.  http://math.rice.edu/Conferences/3-Manifolds/       Last Modified: 05/01/2014       Submitted by: Shelly Harvey]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
