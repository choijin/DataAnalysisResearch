<AbstractNarration>The objective of this Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project is to create a general methodology for developing and using parametric human finite element models that can represent a wide range of attributes of people that are important to automobile safety, such as size, shape, age, and tissue characteristics. When designing cars for safety, these models can be used for population-based simulations to predict reductions in injuries.  We are linking a statistical human body geometry model based on medical image, body scan, and sitting posture data with a baseline human finite element model through an automated mesh morphing algorithm.  The resulted parametric human models are being validated against cadaver tests and used in a feasibility study to optimize a restraint system for a selected General Motors vehicle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The success of this work will address the specific challenges posed by the changing demographics observed in the US population, such as the increased prevalence of obese and older people, and also will lead to development of tools and methods that are useful for many other engineering designs interacting with humans, such as medical devices, aircraft, blast protection system, sports gear, and heavy-duty equipment.  The concept of developing injury assessment tools for population-based simulations will lead to safety designs that provide better protection for millions of individuals who are elderly, obese or in other special conditions, which will provide extremely high societal benefits.  The project will also include a wide range of educational and outreach activities, including hiring undergraduate students through UM's Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program, create summer intern positions at UM for undergraduate students and intern positions at GM for PhD students.  The project activities entail collaborative research between the university and General Motors, which will significantly broaden the scientific and technical knowledge of all the students involved.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In motor vehicle crashes, small-female, elderly, and obese occupants are at increased risk of death and serious injury compared with young, mid-size men.  Unfortunately, current procedures for evaluating vehicle safety designs are mainly based on crash test dummies and computational dummy/human models that represent only a few sizes of occupants.  These surrogates do not account for age, gender, and obesity effects on injury risk.  As a result, vehicle designers are limited in their ability to address the full range of the occupant population. The projected increase of older and obese population in the US further motivates the efforts to develop more advanced injury assessment methodologies and tools.  The objectives of this GOALI project are 1) to provide a general methodology for developing parametric human finite element (FE) models that can represent a wide range of human attributes (such as size, shape, and tissue characteristics) for conducting population-based simulations and predicting injuries, and 2) to demonstrate the feasibility of applying this model in the safety design process of a selected General Motors (GM) study vehicle.  The following tasks have been accomplished in this study:  1) Statistical human geometry model for a diverse population:  Statistical human skeleton geometry models, including rib cage, femur, pelvis, and tibia, have been developed using CT scan data from more than 300 subjects. Analysis methods have included generalized Procrustes alignment, principal component analysis, and regression.  Using similar statistical methods, a statistical human external body shape model has also been created based on body surface measurement data from hundreds of men and women.  An algorithm was developed to integrate the skeleton and body shape geometry models, so that the target human geometry can be predicted from age, gender, stature, and body mass index (BMI).  2) Development of parametric human FE model by mesh morphing:  A mesh morphing method for rapid development of human FE models with different human attributes has been developed based on radial basis functions (RBF), a non-linear 3D interpolation and smoothing function.  The GHBMC M50-O version 4.3, a state-of-the-art mid-size male FE human model with 2.2 million of elements, was used as the baseline FE model to be morphed into different geometry targets predicted by the statistical human geometry model.  The mesh morphing was conducted region-by-region, so that only 30 minutes were needed on a personal computer to morph the baseline FE model into a model representing another person, while maintaining acceptable mesh quality.  3) Subject-specific model validation  Subject-specific model validations have been conducted against cadaver test data on femur impact response and whole-body occupant response in frontal crashes.  The validation results clearly demonstrated that human FE models with accurate bone geometry and body shape can provide more accurate impact/injury responses than a mid-size male model.  4) Crash simulations using the parametric human FE model and a GM study vehicle  Crash simulations using morphed male human FE models with various age, stature, and BMI values have been conducted under a frontal crash condition with a GM study vehicle.  The simulation results identified injury risk trends due to different occupant characteristics.  Specifically, we found taller occupants tended to have a higher risk of head injuries due to head-to-interior contact, obese occupants tended to have higher lower extremity injury risk due to poor belt fit and higher pelvis excursion, and older occupants tended to have higher thorax and femur injury risks due to lower injury tolerance.  These results demonstrated that adaptive restraint designs may be necessary to optimally protect occupants in a diverse population.  Human modeling is an emerging topic in the field of vehicle design.  This project is unique such that it is the first time that both geom...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
