<AbstractNarration>The SuperMAG project obtains ground magnetic field observations from approximately 300 observatories around the world. The SuperMAG team subtracts baselines from the observed magnetic field vectors and then the data are normalized to a common coordinate system and cadence. SuperMAG provides a graphical interface and allows users to display the data. Registered users can download digital data. This project will continue operation of SuperMAG and enhance its capabilities. This grant provides one year of support for SuperMAG.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SuperMAG team has involved and will continue to involve students in SuperMAG. SuperMAG  also contributes to the broader scientific community by providing data to scientific users.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ SuperMAG (Gjerloev, 2010, 2012) is a worldwide collaboration of organizations and national agencies that currently operate more than 300 ground-based magnetometers. Through a user friendly website it provides measurements of magnetic field perturbations from all available stations in the same coordinate system, with identical time resolution and a common baseline removal approach. This high quality dataset enables continuous and nearly global monitoring of the ionospheric current system and itÃ†s coupling to the magnetosphere.  The community has embraced SuperMAG: ~2200 unique users/month, ~40,000 plots produced/month, and the ~850 registered users download ~2500 data products/month, &gt;30 peer reviewed papers published per year. A large fraction of the users are students since the website is designed with a focus on user friendliness. All measures of usage are constantly increasing.  In short, SuperMAG has a proven record of excellence as a community service as well as a tool for student activities.  All objectives and goals stated in the proposal were achieved in a timely manner.  These were reported at conferences, workshops, and made available on the SuperMAG website.  Under this proposal SuperMAG significantly increased the data holdings, the derived products, the tools and a list of collaborators joined SuperMAG.  No problems were encountered and all was delivered as proposed.          Last Modified: 10/06/2015       Submitted by: Jesper W Gjerloev]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
