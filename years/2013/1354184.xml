<AbstractNarration>Many infectious diseases of humans are caused by pathogens that are transmitted from wildlife.  One important example is Lyme disease, in which the bacterial pathogen lives inside small mammals, such as the white-footed mouse, and is transmitted to people by ticks that first bite an infected mouse and then a person. Human risk of Lyme disease increases with the abundance of white-footed mice.  Recent data collected by the investigators suggest that mice infected with the Lyme disease bacterium live, on average, 17% longer than do uninfected mice.  This is an unexpected finding, given that the bacterium causes illness in people and other animals. It is important because longer life spans likely result in larger populations of infected mice. How might the bacterium increase life span in mice and what are the consequences for disease transmission to other mammals (including humans) and for the forest ecosystem?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will experimentally determine the effects of the Lyme bacterium on: (1) mouse survival and abundance; (2) mouse foraging behavior; (3) how commonly mice are bitten by ticks; (4) the rate at which other (non-mouse) hosts for the tick become infected; and (5) the ability of mice to control populations of an exotic forest pest, the gypsy moth.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will provide both content material and research experiences for the Community Science program at the University of Pennsylvania.  This program is designed to increase the understanding of biology by high school teachers in inner-city Philadelphia schools and to expose high school students to scientific research and careers in science. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lyme disease is a common and serious problem for humans in North America and elsewhere.  The investigators will develop and test a vaccine to protect mice species from the pathogen that causes the disease. If this vaccine works as expected, it may reduce transmission of the pathogen to humans.  Through a carefully designed experiment on wild mice, the investigators will be able to evaluate both the intended and potential unintended consequences of wildlife vaccination.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The majority of emerging infectious diseases of humans are transmitted to humans from other vertebrates; that is, they are &ldquo;zoonotic&rdquo; (Taylor et al. 2001; Woolhouse &amp; Gowtage-Sequeria 2005). Zoonotic pathogens can infect one or more wildlife host species in addition to humans. The abundance and behavior of these wildlife hosts can have large impacts on human disease risk, as a number of studies have now shown (Ostfeld &amp; Holt 2004; Estrada-Pe?a et al. 2008; Gort?zar et al. 2006). For example, population bottlenecks in guinea pigs, which are key reservoir hosts for the parasite that causes Chagas disease, can drive the parasite through vector colonies (Levy et al. 2015), and irrigation-induced increases in the abundance of gerbil reservoirs for the Leishmania parasites that cause cutaneous leishmaniasis can increase risk to humans (Wasserberg et al. 2003). Rarely, however, have the effects of zoonotic pathogens on their wildlife hosts been considered (Gage &amp; Kosoy 2005; George et al. 2013; Luis et al. 2012), and we know of no studies examining the impacts of zoonotic pathogens on interactions between reservoir hosts and other members of the ecological communities of which they are a part.&nbsp;</p> <p>The effects of a zoonotic pathogen on host behavior, population dynamics, or competitive interactions could have significant ecological consequences that radiate through an ecosystem.

Transmission of the pathogen from infected hosts to new hosts depends critically on the population density and behavior of the infected hosts. Both of these factors could be affected by the pathogen. Some host species also play other important roles in ecosystems &ndash; for example as keystone or hub species &ndash; and their roles in communities could be affected by changes in behavior or abundance caused by the pathogen (Dobson et al. 1986; Collinge &amp; Ray 2007).&nbsp;</p> <p>We examined the effects of a widespread zoonotic pathogen, the Lyme disease bacterium&nbsp;<em>Borrelia burgdorferi&nbsp;</em>(hereafter<em>B. burgdorferi</em>), on a key reservoir host, the white-footed mouse (<em>Peroymscus leucopus</em>) (Brisson et al 2008) using a wildlife vaccine. Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the temperate zone worldwide, and its incidence rates and geographic extent are both expanding rapidly&nbsp;(Schwartzet al 2017; Ostfeld 2011). The disease is transmitted to vertebrate hosts through bites by ixodid ticks, which serve as its vectors. In eastern North America, the vector species is the blacklegged tick (<em>Ixodes scapularis</em>) (Lane et al. 1991). Larvae of these ticks hatch uninfected with the Lyme disease bacterium, but they can acquire the bacterium from a host during their larval blood meal.

The findings have importance to the manipulation of natural systems to reduce exposure of humans to zoonotic diseases.
