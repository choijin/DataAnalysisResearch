<AbstractNarration>The Amazon basin contains nearly one million square kilometers of wetlands, predominantly peatlands, which are known to be highly productive and to store significant quantities of carbon in plant biomass and soil. Peatlands are characterized by soils rich in organic matter that are often saturated with water, and are therefore often low in oxygen. These conditions often lead to the release of methane, a greenhouse gas with ~25 times the heat-trapping capacity of carbon dioxide, and peatlands are known to be important global sources of methane. Until very recently, peatlands were not expected to be a significant component of the Amazon basin since these wetlands are more common in cold, northern latitudes and there were few records of their existence in the Amazon. In recent years, however, multiple studies aided by satellite imagery and guided field explorations have documented hundreds of peatlands across basins in the West and Central Amazon. An estimated 3-6 millions of tons of organic carbon are contained in these newly discovered Amazon peatlands, which may also represent a significant, previously unrecorded, source of methane annually. The magnitude of organic carbon stored in plants and soils every year vs. that released as methane from these peatlands is not known. This project proposes to evaluate for the first time a set of diverse Amazonian peatlands their organic carbon content, and rates of forest productivity and methane formation and release. This work will also include experimental manipulations of water levels to evaluate responses of productivity and methane release to environmental changes likely to occur as the climate warms. This project will also develop mathematical models of these ecosystems to evaluate the impact of peatlands at larger scales and to propose quantitative predictions for future productivity and methane emissions. Two hypotheses will be tested in this study including (i) whether vegetation change and water regime determine methane production and release, and (ii) whether the response of methane production to altered water regimes is modulated by the diversity of Amazon peatlands. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will contribute substantially to our understanding of feedbacks between changes in atmospheric chemistry and climate because of the magnitude of carbon storage in Amazonian peatlands and their potential to be major sources of methane. The research will provide the first comprehensive analysis of these peatlands in the Amazon, and provide quantitative predictions of future methane emissions from the Amazon. This project will also provide data on carbon stocks and fluxes for future comparisons under climatic change and will provide evidence to monitor tropical peatlands for future conservation and policy-making efforts. This collaborative effort including three US and one Peruvian institution, will train a postdoctoral researcher, two graduate and one undergraduate student. This project will also develop a virtual classroom program connecting high school students in Arizona and Iquitos Peru to discuss the impact of ecological research in Amazon peatlands and to track expeditions. Educational activities at the high school level will be targeted to generate an effective conservation-teaching tool to reach a broader public.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Amazon basin holds one of the three most important tropical peatland regions in the world. As recently as 12 years ago, there were no records of the existence of tropical peatlands in the Amazon. Peatlands are a type of wetland characterized by soils extremely rich in organic matter often saturated with water, and therefore often low in oxygen. Tropical peatlands are mostly forested with frequent high plant productivity and store high quantities of carbon in plant biomass as well as soil organic debris. &nbsp;The conditions in peatlands often lead to the transformation of organic matter and the release of greenhouse gases like methane, a powerful gas with ~25 times the heat-trapping capacity of carbon dioxide. &nbsp;Global records show the Amazon basin is a region where the fluxes of methane are high and variable but the contribution of the extensive areas rich in peatlands is not known. Prior to this project, there was no systematic or sustained effort to document and explain the methane fluxes or the drivers controlling such flux from Amazon peatlands. Hence, we completed a major endeavor to solve this from 2014 to 2018. This research project tested hypotheses about the dynamics and controls of methane flux in contrasting peatlands of the Amazon basin representing the natural ecological variation of forested composition and dynamics, hydrological regimes, geochemical variation and methane flux magnitude. In the testing of our hypotheses, we have developed: a three-years long time series of a broad array of components related to vegetation dynamic (using standardize approaches for interregional comparisons), high resolution water level records, methane and CO<sub>2</sub> soil emission rates. Also, we assessed methane emissions from stems (as a unaccounted path), and extended to new hypotheses of additional geochemical controls of methane by interaction with nitrogenous compounds. Several reports from this project now document the short- and long-term variation of methane flux and possible interactions of vegetation and hydrological controls. Hypotheses about vegetation dynamics have been further advanced and we have learned that initial predictions based on nutrient geochemistry have alternative patterns in different components of vegetation, and plant-trait driven responses may affect in distinct fashion the entry of organic carbon to the soils for subsequent transformation into methane. We also developed water table manipulation experiments simulating putative dramatic shifts in the region as part of our core hypotheses. The record of these responses to simulated dramatic changes are complementary to the modeling findings of our collaborative research partners (Q. Zhuang at Purdue University) that predicts how the region could become a hotspot of soil carbon loss that will likely lead to more methane emissions. We will continue further evaluating more aspects of our dataset in collaborative fashion with various groups collecting this rare but critical information for the tropics.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This project also had multiple activities to broaden the impact of our findings with the scientific and general public. At least eight research theses have been completed so far (the majority at the undergraduate level and a few more in writing) with a close to even distribution across the USA and local collaborators at the Universidad Nacional de la Amazonia Peruana (Peru). A large number of college students have been introduced to peatland research either through workshops, research experiences, or classes; a high school pilot program was successfully developed to study the impact of anthropogenic activity in peatlands; and several broad and specialized conversations, minidocumentary videos, and public news sharing have been achieved within this project. This project is creating new research and engagement avenues in a region characterized by its vast biological and peatland diversity and high global importance. We hope to continue providing inspiring developments and promote peatland understanding and conservation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/10/2020<br>      Modified by: Hinsby&nbsp;Cadillo-Quiroz</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1355066/1355066_10300450_1594354091851_5_WalkingInPeatQuistococha--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1355066/1355066_10300450_1594354091851_5_WalkingInPeatQuistococha--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Walking in Amazon peat"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1355066/1355066_10300450_1594354091851_5_WalkingInPeatQuistococha--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Walking in Amazon peat"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">PI Hinsby Cadillo-Quiroz, walking in peatland path, notice sinking of researcher in soft structured soil.
