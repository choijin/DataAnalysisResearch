<AbstractNarration>This summer REU-Site program in the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Chapman University (Orange, CA) will annually provide 10 students selected exclusively from 2-year community colleges with the opportunity to engage in research projects related to earth and environmental issues from the regional to global scale. Through the program, they will provide an under-served student population with hands-on, interdisciplinary research experiences and enhance the recruitment and retention of under-represented students into STEM fields. They will partner with multiple local community colleges that serve ethnically diverse communities and lack scientific research facilities. Faculty mentors include biologists, chemists, and geoscientists with active undergraduate research labs at Chapman. Through participation in cutting-edge research with faculty mentors working at the forefront of their respective disciplines, students will engage in complex scientific studies on topics including the sources, transport, and transformation pathways of pollutants, environmental impacts on intertidal organisms, and carbon sequestration in wetlands. In addition to research, students will participate in group activities including pre-experience training workshops, seminars with local speakers on environmental careers/issues, weekly group meetings/presentations within their research groups, university life and academic success workshops, a research poster presentation session, and a post-experience evaluation assessment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship in Earth and Environmental Sciences (SURFEES) at Chapman University, a 4-year comprehensive master's university, provided students from local community colleges with the opportunity to engage in summer research projects related to earth and environmental issues from the molecular to global scale with Chapman University faculty.  A total of 34 participants were accepted to participate in the program from summer 2014-summer 2016 from four local community colleges (over 300 applications were received).  Student applications were screened utilizing a project-made rubric and the PI and Co-PI made preliminary selections which were presented to the mentors prior to final placements.  Pre-summer trainings were conducted for mentors and pre-summer workshops were held for participants. Pre-experience evaluation data was collected from participants and faculty mentors during these events. Professional development was provided to all participants on a weekly basis throughout the summer and included, for example, sessions on writing a resume, giving public presentations, and finding scholarship/fellowship opportunities.  The research experience concluded with a formal poster presentation which was attended by mentors, Chapman University faculty and administrators, participants? families, and representatives from the community colleges.     Post-experience evaluation data, including focus group interviews were conducted.  Annual findings and feedback were used for program improvement and aggregated findings have been presented at national conferences.   The objectives of the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship in Earth and Environmental Sciences (SURFEES) program, and the way(s) in which they were achieved, were to:  a) Provide transformative research experiences for students from 2-year institutions:  Participants were recruited from four local community colleges including, Citrus College (Glendora, CA), Santiago Canyon College (Orange, CA), Santa Ana College (Santa Ana, CA), and Saddleback College (Mission Viejo, CA).  Three of the four colleges are designated Hispanic-Serving Institutions.  All participants were engaged in the full range of activities outlined in the proposal including a rigorous research experience, professional development and networking, and workshops on transfer to four-year institutions.   Data from the SURE III Survey (Lopatto), administered post-REU experience, indicate that participants made considerable gains across the 21 items measured by the survey.  SURFEES participants? gains were considerably more robust as compared to the total population.  b) Increase the participation of under-represented students: The project set a target of serving a cohort of 10 students annually with 50% of the cohort underrepresented minorities, 50% women, and 50% low-income.  REU Supplement Awards made it possible to include 12 students in the Year 2 and Year 3 cohorts.              Target    2014   (n=10)    2015   (n=12)    2016   (n=12)    Total   (n=34)      Female    50%    80%    67%    42%    62%      Under-represented minority    50%    80%    67%    100%    82%      Low-income    50%    80%    83%    83%    82%         c) Develop scientifically-literate, experienced participants:  The 8-week REU experience included regular reading of the relevant literature, lab and field work, presentations, and mentoring from faculty and graduate students, all opportunities that built participants? literacy and experience.  Moreover, students lived on campus in university apartments and had considerable time to interact with mentors and with each other, discussing projects and other science topics.  d) Increase student awareness of earth and environmental issues  The REU was designed to ensure participants? awareness and understanding of earth and environmental issues was increased.  In part this was accomplished through:  Reading literature relevant to their project; Lab and field work; Workshops; Presentations by faculty and practitioners; Interaction with both their community college peers and Chapman University students working across a range of labs during the REU period.
