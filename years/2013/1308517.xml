<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Frieder Jaekle of Rutgers University at Newark will apply recent advances in the activation of small molecules by frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) to polymer-supported catalysis. A multi-pronged approach will be taken: (1) soluble polymers will be pursued that are functionalized with strong Lewis acid (acceptor) and/or Lewis base (donor) sites (amines, phosphines, carbenes), which are sterically encumbered to allow for formation of "frustrated" Lewis pairs. (2) Innovative approaches to porous polymers that contain catalytically active Lewis acid and Lewis base groups will also be developed. The efficacy of these new materials in catalytic processes will be examined. In addition to the societal benefits of developing sustainable chemistry processes, the broader impacts of the project include the training of undergraduate and graduate students in a highly interdisciplinary research environment, involvement of students from groups underrepresented in chemistry (e.g. ACS Project SEED high school students, minority undergraduate students), and creating awareness of sustainability in chemistry through a Polymer and Materials Chemistry Outreach Program. The Professor Jaekle will also organize the "Boron in the Americas" meeting in 2014 at the Rutgers-Newark campus.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work addresses the need for new sustainable chemistry processes by developing metal-free catalysts for accelerating chemical reactions. Successful preparation of the proposed catalysts is expected to have an impact in many areas that employ catalysis, such as fine chemical synthesis, refining, and plastics manufacturing.  Additionally, this research could lead to new processes available that will reduce reliance on rare and costly metals, toxic byproducts, as well as the amounts of chemical waste generated.</AbstractNarration>
