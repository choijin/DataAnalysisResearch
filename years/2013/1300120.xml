<AbstractNarration>Combinatorics is an area centered around problems and applications. Some of these problems arise in the field itself and others come from other mathematical areas and from applications in other scientific fields. We present problems which in the interface between combinatorics, geometry and probability with much input from theoretical computer science and mathematical programming. We will study, also using discrete harmonic analysis, phase transition phenomena for combinatorial stochastic models and problems related to the combinatorics of simplicial and polyhedral complexes arising in geometric problems about convex sets.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research topics were selected to have potential impact in other areas of mathematics,  theoretical computer science, mathematical programming, and questions regarding social choice. What causes phase transition for stochastic combinatorial models, and what is the nature of this phase transition? How to analyze the noise sensitivity of Boolean functions and how it is related to models of computations on the one hand, and to voting rules on the other? What can we infer from combinatorics of polyhedra to the performance of optimization algorithms. These are areas where theory and practice are surprisingly interlaced, and information as well as inspiration go both ways.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     The NSF project has made significant progress on both topics probabilistic and geometric combinatorics.       Boolean functions are of importance in combinatorics, probability theory, computer science, voting, and other areas.  In the area of probabilistic combinatorics we proposed to study influence of variables on Boolean functions, sharp threshold phenomena, and noise stability and sensitivity of Boolean functions and other related models.       Kalai and Mossel  studied sharp threshold behavior of functions with large alphabet. Kalai, Keller and Mossel  developed new correlation inequalities with various applications. Friedgut, Kalai, Keller and Kahn applied correlation inequalities to study Chvatal's classic conjecture in extremal combinatorics.  Bourgain, Kahn and Kalai made a substantial progress in the study of influence of sets of variables on Boolean functions solving central problems in this area from the early 90s.    Kalai and Kindler studied noise sensitivity and stability of the nodel of non interacting bosons. Their study and subsequent works by Kalai shed doubts on the feasibility of computational superior quantum computers. More specifically this work raises the possibility that NISQ-systems (NISQ stands for Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum) represent for constant level of noise very low level computational class that does not support quantum error correction.        In the area of geometric combinatorics we proposed to study cellular structures arising in geometry and , in particular, in Helly-type theory and the study of convex polytopes. In the last years these areas of geometric combinatorics were connected (by other researchers) to high-dimensional expanders and gained much interest. Kalai, Nevo and Novik developed a novel theory of bipartite rigidity, and this team together with Chudnovsky and Seymour developed a notion of bipartite minors and exhibit a bipartite analog to Kuratowski's theorem. Barany, Kalai, and Meshulam proved a matroidal analog of Tverberg's theorem. Kalai and Nevo proposed an approach based on algebraic shifting for attacking the famous Turan's (4,3)-problem and obtained some partial results.      Kalai was active in his blog "Combinatorics and More" and other Internet vanues for Research-level and outreach activities related to the project.  The developments of the BSF research project were presented by Kalai as a plenary speaker in the 2016 Europen Congress of Mathematics (7ECM, Berlin) and 2018 International Congress of Mathematics (ICM2018, Rio) and by his articles in the Proceedings of these congresses. The paper and the talk in the 7ECM was centered around the combinatorics and analysis of Boolean functions.  The paper and the talk in ICM2018 were centered around various connections of both the probabilistic and geometric part of the research to theory and practice of computer science and optimization. This includes also the (controversial) work regarding quantum computers.        Last Modified: 08/15/2018       Submitted by: Gil Kalai]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
