<AbstractNarration>This proposal addresses NSF?s call for universities to nurture students and/or faculty who are engaged in projects having the potential to be transitioned into the marketplace. I-Corps Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their ideas, devices, processes or other intellectual activities into the marketplace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The University of Akron (UA) is developing a new I-Corps Site, entitled the UA Technology Innovation and Entrepreneurial Preparation Grant (UA TIE Prep Grant), that will build upon their existing expertise, while filling a gap that is critical in the commercialization and translation of university-based research. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, the UA TIE Prep Grant will:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. stimulate the translation of fundamental university-based research into commercially viable technologies prepared to progress into the National Science Foundation?s I-Corps Teams program, SBIR, or other avenues toward commercialization;&lt;br/&gt;2. encourage faculty, students, and community-based industry personnel to collaborate around early stage university technologies, and;&lt;br/&gt;3. enhance the entrepreneurship potential of faculty, students, and community-based industry partners through hands-on training and experiential learning in innovation and entrepreneurship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The UA TIE Prep Grant Program has the potential to greatly improve commercialization outcomes for UA technologies which will influence the regional economy and serve as a national model for entrepreneurship.</AbstractNarration>

UA&rsquo;s 91 I-Corps Sites teams have gone on to achieve the following: seven I-Corps Teams awards, 13 I-Corps@Ohio awards, three VentureWell E-Teams awards, 13 Ohio Third Frontier awards (aimed at prototyping and testing), five UA Proof of Concept Initiative funding awards, and three LaunchTown Business Idea Competition winners. In total, UA I-Corps graduates have raised $1.8 million in funding aimed at continuing customer discovery or conducting customer driven prototyping and testing. Teams have also formed 11 startups and executed three licenses and three option with two more agreements currently under negotiation. These companies have raised $1.6 million in just the last two years. In addition to training UA faculty in the I-Corps methodology, UA has opened the program up to faculty and students from nearby institutions. Thus far, faculty and students from Cleveland State University, Kent State University, Youngstown State University, and Ohio State University&rsquo;s Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center have participated. &nbsp;UA received supplemental funding from the Burton D. Morgan Foundation to allow the Site to host non-NSF teams, which are typically led by an entrepreneur from JumpStart&rsquo;s Inclusion Program for female and minority entrepreneurs, or by a group of students that have a &ldquo;low tech&rdquo; idea. UA also partnered with Akron Urban League to increase outreach and participation by minority led businesses. These business teams are supplemented with students and mentors that assist in conducting customer interviews and completing deliverables. In total, this extension of the I-Corps program has resulted in 17 teams with 6 faculty, 19 students, 7 entrepreneurs and 14 mentors completing the I-Corps process. Furthermore, leadership from UA&rsquo;s I-Corps Site was instrumental in creating the statewide I-Corps@Ohio program. Funded by the State of Ohio and supported by Ohio Board of Regents in collaboration with NSF, this program will host 20 teams per year as they go through the full I-Corps Node curriculum.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/08/2017<br>      Modified by: Patrick&nbsp;H&nbsp;Gaughan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
