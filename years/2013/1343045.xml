<AbstractNarration>This project will combine theoretical and empirical modeling efforts to develop a comprehensive model of the ionosphere, plasmasphere, and inner magnetosphere system. This will be accomplished by coupling the Naval Research Laboratory ionosphere model, SAMI3, with the Rice University inner magnetosphere code, RCM. Model-data comparisons will be an integral part of the model development, using multi-instrument observational data from MIT Haystack Observatory.&lt;br/&gt; A graduate student will work closely with the modelers in the coupling of SAMI3 and RCM and also with experimentalists to gain proficiency in multi-instrument data analysis techniques. The student will receive a comprehensive education in the system science approach of the ionosphere-thermosphere-magnetosphere system. Additionally, undergraduate students will be involved in this research through the research experience for undergraduates (REU) program run at the MIT Haystack Observatory.&lt;br/&gt; The key physics issues to be addressed are the dynamics and spatial distribution (specifically longitudinal variations) of the sub-auroral polarization stream (SAPS) flow channels and the storm enhanced density (SED) ionospheric density features during geomagnetic storms. Correct first-principles modeling of the SAPS/SED development will provide a better understanding of the connectivities and causal relationships involving the ionosphere-thermosphere-magnetosphere (ITM) components of the Sun-Earth system. There is a crucial need for improved knowledge of the spatial/temporal structure of electric fields in the inner magnetosphere and subauroral ionosphere.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The plasmasphere, ionosphere, and magnetosphere are all regions of the upper atmosphere that are directly involved with space weather.  In particular, significant changes in these regions can occur due to impacts of large coronal mass ejections from the Sun. The changes in these regions can beautiful (i.e. the aurora) or devasting (i.e. loss of HF communication in the polar regions, and/or serious impacts to GPS/GNSS navigation and timing).  This research program is a step towards improving the models that are used to understand and predict what changes will occur.  The science goal is to merge models of the different atmospheric regions to understand the coupling and interplay between these regions.      This proposal was for a four-year collaborative program to develop a comprehensive model of the plasmasphere-ionosphere system by coupling the NRL ionosphere model, SAMI3, with the Rice University inner magnetosphere code, RCM.  To guide model development, observational data was collected and provided by MIT Haystack Observatory, and model-data comparisons were an integral part of the on-going model development.  The newly-developed model and accompanying data sets were applied to address two key physics issues:  the dynamics and spatial distribution (specifically longitudinal variations) of the sub-auroral polarization stream (SAPS) electric field structures and the storm enhanced density (SED) feature during geomagnetic storms.      We show here model- data comparisons for one geomagnetic storm period that we studied in detail during the course of this proposal.  This is the comparison of GPS total electron content (TEC) measurements to those predicted by the merged SAMI3-RCM model for the 22 June 2015 geomagnetic storm.  Figure 1 shows the comparison between the modeled TEC for the northern polar region (shown on the right side of the plot).  On the left side of the plot are the mearsured TEC values for both the north pole (top) and the south pole (bottom).  Clearly seen in the data for both hemisphere is the feature known as the tongue of ionization (TOI).  This feature is the enhanced (shown in red/yellow) TEC that is shown reaching out over the poles.  It is more evident in the southern hemisphere plot than the northern hemisphere (where the TOI is only just beginning to form).  The modelled TEC, which is for the northern hemisphere, clearly shows this feature as being well formed. Although the data/model comparison is not perfect, the fact that both the model and data show TOI features is extremely encouraging.  The next research step will be to incorporate a more realistic model for the Earth?s geomagnetic field into the ionospheric model SAMI3.  It is important to study the difference between the hemispheres.             Last Modified: 08/18/2019       Submitted by: Anthea J Coster]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
