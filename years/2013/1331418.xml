<AbstractNarration>This project integrates the study of cooperation and conflict by bringing together research leaders in social science and animal behavior for an interdisciplinary workshop. The workshop is designed to foster exchange and integrate ideas and methods, to spur creative, new research projects, and to work towards creating a unified framework for thinking about cooperation and competition and their underlying mechanisms. One of the dominant themes of social science in the past several decades has been the remarkable capacity of humans for cooperation. A parallel theme has emerged in animal behavior research, where cooperation remains a major focus. In social science, the advent of game-theoretic models of behavior led to cooperation being viewed as an anomaly or mystery. Only recently, in the face of overwhelming laboratory and field evidence, were formal models expanded to reveal how such behaviors could be "rational."  Similarly, in animal behavior research (including human animals), the pervasiveness of cooperative behaviors challenged theorists to explain how they increased fitness. Understanding the evolutionary origins of cooperation among individuals, and among groups and species, is one of the triumphs of 20th-century biology. At the same time, the study of conflict among individuals or groups also has led to important insights. The focus has been less on game-theoretic or evolutionary underpinnings, because the behavior is seen as a logical outgrowth of standard models of the drive to survive and reproduce. Conflict is seen as arising from resource competition, with the extra resources claimed by winners serving to enhance their utility (in social science) or survival and reproduction (in animal research). For the most part conflict has been studied separately from cooperation. They are,however, two sides of the same coin. Cooperation and conflict can be viewed as endpoints on a continuum of behavioral possibilities. But cooperation and conflict also are intertwined in a different way.  Conflict, or the potential for conflict, may be necessary to support cooperation, and cooperation within a group may be necessary to mount successful conflict with another group. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop advances understanding of the fundamental social and biological forces that shape interactions involving cooperation and conflict. This approach stands to fundamentally transform our understanding of the interplay of cooperation and conflict. The workshop provides an important advance in the theoretical core of a wide range of disciplines. In addition, the project funds follow-on collaborative projects resulting from the workshop, thus leveraging the assembled expertise to produce new knowledge. In addition, the workshop explicitly includes the participation of PhD students and postdocs from a variety of disciplines, and it is expected that these younger scholars will participate in the funded projects, thus influencing the next generation of scholars.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project funded an interdisciplinary workshop designed to produce new research that crosses boundaries between biology and social science as it relates to the interrelationship between cooperation and conflict.  Our goal was to facilitate new interdisciplinary research by teams that come together during the workshop.  The grant included funding for seed money to support the initial research of these teams.   The model we used to organize the workshop was one that had been successful in producing new research in other contexts.  We first identified scholars from biology and the social sciences that had an interest in exploring interdisciplinary collaborations.  We invited these scholars to attend a three day workshop. The workshop began with two overview lectures by scholars representing biology and the social sciences.  After this there were brainstorming sessions during which participants proposed and debated potential research projects, and a selection procedure whereby projects were chosen and participants allocated to groups.  The groups then discussed their projects and proposed original research projects in competition for the available seed money.  Conference organizers rotated among the groups, assisting in translation between disciplines and methods, and helping to produce viable research projects.  Then participants went back to their universities with plans to complete the projects. Four projects were initially funded.   Intellectual merit.  When the workshop took place, the participants were very enthusiastic about the overall agenda of bridging research in biology and social science on the relationship between cooperation and conflict, and all have reported benefitting from the interactions at the worshop itself.  The four projects that were originally submitted were exciting interdisciplinary efforts, with high potential for transformative research.  However, three of the four projects are now abandoned, and the fourth is progressing slowly. In the last two years of the project, we have extended the project by funding two additional projects that were proposed by project participants after the conference ended, and we have also used remaining funds to support interdisciplinary student research activities and projects.  We were surprised and disappointed by this result, especially given our previous successes with this workshop structure.  Eckel previously conducted a similar workshop that was quite successful, but the fields that were included in her project were closer in terms of subject matter and methodology than this current effort (game theory, experimental methods, economics and political science_ and the topic itself had a tighter focus (terrorism-related research).  Taking the two workshops together, we believe that the most important lesson is that interdisciplinary research can be fostered in a a relatively brief workshop setting, but only when the fields are not too far apart intellectually.  We also note the importance of including junior researchers in the workshop, because only they have 'room on their plate' to take on significant new projects.   In our opinion this illustrates one of the fundamental difficulties with interdisciplinary research.  Successful interdisciplinary teams need to interact over time to develop a deep understanding of each others' disciplines, including the relevant background and terminology, and a grasp of key questions that are considered important in each of the fields. Our workshop structure apparently did not provide enough infrastructure to accomplish the goal of creating productive interdisciplinary research teams.  We recommend that others considering similar workshop structures include funding for a series of meetings, rather than just one, and a longer period for developing potential projects.  Broader impacts.  The workshop experience provided broader impacts on two levels.  First the workshop gave additional evidence about the difficulty of successfully instigating interdisciplinary research.  Interdisciplinary research requires patience and considerable investment by participants, especially when fields are relatively far apart.  Any workshop such as ours is a high-risk investment, in the sense that the payoffs could be very high, but might be relatively low.  We continue to believe that funding interdisciplinary research should be a significant part of NSF?s portfolio, because of the potential for high payoff, both in terms of intellectual merit and broader impacts.  Second, the workshop gave a lot of young scholars exposure to other disciplines.  This means that they learned about research that they would not have come across in their disciplinary work, and this can have high payoff in the future.
