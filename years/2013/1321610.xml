<AbstractNarration>The 9th World Congress of Chemical Engineering will be held August 18-23, 2013 in Seoul, Korea. To increase the presence of US researchers at the Congress, this proposal seeks support to offset the travel expenses of approximately 20 US faculty who will participate as speakers. It should be noted that all of the speakers invited by the PI have strong ties to the Process and Reaction Engineering division of CBET.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The invited speakers consist of two main subgroups:&lt;br/&gt;1. The twelve to fourteen speakers making up two new reaction engineering sessions organized for the World Congress by the PI and Dr. Maria Burka;&lt;br/&gt;2. An additional group of process systems faculty invited by the PI, selected to add a strong systems component to already established sessions at the World Congress.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: The reaction engineering sessions will focus on computational, energy, and environmental aspects of reaction engineering, as well as microchemical systems and modeling the interaction of reaction and transport mechanisms. Furthermore, the sessions on sustainability, energy, and process safety will receive a substantial benefit from our invited systems-oriented speakers, bolstering the quantitative aspects of these important ChE research areas. The PI has invited a mix of early-career and more established speakers with an emphasis on the junior faculty who stand to improve their international presence by participating in this conference.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: The exchange of ideas and current trends in Chemical Engineering research between the US, Korean, and other international participants has the potential to broadly impact the Congress participants. US participants supported by this travel grant will benefit from Congress themes that include university-industry cooperation and chemical engineering education. The proposal PI will encourage speakers supported by this travel grant to participate in publishing their work in the special issue of Chemical Engineering Science that will be devoted to the World Congress.</AbstractNarration>

The exchange of ideas and current trends in Chemical Engineering research between the US, Korean, and other international WCCE9 participants benefited all Congress participants. US participants supported by this travel grant benefited from Congress themes that included university-industry cooperation and chemical engineering education.  The three sessions suported by this grant were very well attended; feedback from audience members indicated that our sessions were considered to be a strong addition to the Congress program.
