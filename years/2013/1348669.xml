<AbstractNarration>This project is funded by NSF's Research on Education and Learning (REAL) program.  REAL supports the accumulation of robust evidence to inform efforts to understand, build theory to explain, and suggest innovations and interventions to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning, and participation.  This project addresses a grand challenge facing contemporary STEM education by identifying characteristics of effective teacher professional development and curricular improvement efforts. The research will produce the most comprehensive and rigorous synthesis to date of the causal research evidence on this topic. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will accumulate evidence on the impacts of interventions intended to improve instructional quality on preK-12th grade students' social-emotional, behavioral, affective, and learning outcomes in mathematics and science.  The project has been designed to produce a comprehensive synthesis of research exploring the (immediate, intermediate, and long-term) impacts of professional development (and other) interventions intended to enhance teacher learning, and initiatives to enhance teachers' use of novel curricular materials in the classroom.  Specifically, the researchers will build a comprehensive database of studies will be constructed through searches of reference databases, review articles, results of funded research projects, web-based resources, abstracts of major STEM and general education conferences, and direct contact with researchers, including principal investigators of NSF and U.S. Department of Education supported studies. The database will include information on the key moderators that likely impact the efficacy of the programs studied such as: duration, intensity, format, grade, and disciplinary topic. The investigators will then utilize meta-analytic techniques to synthesize findings from methodologically rigorous studies of STEM interventions with the explicit intent of improving mathematics and science teaching (e.g., interventions involving professional development, curricular materials, or both).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We present results from a meta-analysis of 95 experimental and quasi-experimental preK-12 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professional development and curriculum programs, seeking to estimate average program impact and to understand what content, activities and formats relate to stronger student outcomes. We found that rigorously conducted studies of STEM instructional improvement programs documented an average positive effect on student achievement, with a mean pooled effect size across studies of 0.21 SD.   We conducted a series of analyses to examine the relationships between program characteristics and the size of achievement impacts.  The characteristics that were significantly associated with improved student learning across the current set of studies included:  Professional development combined with new curriculum materials;  Content designed to improve teachers' content/pedagogical content knowledge, or understanding of how students learn;  Specific formats, including:   meetings to troubleshoot and discuss classroom implementation of the program; the provision of summer workshops to begin the professional development learning process;  same-school collaboration.     We also found that on average, programs that provided any component of the PD online had poorer student outcomes than programs that did not use an online PD component. In general, there was not a statistically significant difference in the magnitudes of program impacts depending on whether programs focused on mathematics or science, and no variability in impact size by features of curriculum materials.   Many of the specific programs associated with improved student learning in our review are unlikely to accessible to the typical U.S. teacher, making research on local professional development and curriculum implementation imperative.  In addition, studies included in our analyses typically provided little information about how district and school contexts interact to support or impede these programs, leaving us with unanswered questions about how local educators can maximize program efficacy. Thus future experimental studies that build on the current findings are warranted, to advance researchers' and policymakers' understanding of key supports for improving student learning in STEM at scale.
