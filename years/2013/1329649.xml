<AbstractNarration>This project investigates a new type of cyber-physical system (CPS), comprising magnetic nanoparticles in a fluidic environment such as human tissue whose motion is controlled by a computer via a magnetic field. The research aims to develop computational and experimental tools to perform the dynamic modeling, closed loop control and experimental validation of such a system of nanoparticles  under guidance and observation using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) environment.  The envisioned CPS infrastructure is composed of a new computational platform to perform 3D simulation, visualization and post-processing analysis of the aggregation and disaggregation process of magnetic nanoparticles within a fluidic environment like the small arteries and arterioles or fluid-filled cavities of the human body. It also includes the development of robust control algorithms for the guidance of a swarm of magnetic nanoparticles in a MRI environment.  Experimental validation is to be performed in clinical MRI scanners and in customized laboratory test-beds that generate controllable magnetic fields able to move magnetic nanoparticles in fluidic environments.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Potential applications of this basic research include nano-robotic drug delivery systems, composed of a system of magnetic nanoparticles guided by MRI scanners for targeted drug delivery in the human body.  The project integrates education through participation of graduate and undergraduate students in the research, and involvement of the PI and graduate students in several outreach activities for students in high and middle schools.</AbstractNarration>
