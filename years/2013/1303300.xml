<AbstractNarration>The source of energetic electrons in the radiation belts during magnetic storms has long been and remains an unsolved problem in magnetospheric physics. In the most common model electrons are first accelerated in the near-Earth plasma sheet and these accelerated particles provide a ?seed? population for the radiation belts. Under this model the seed electrons undergo further acceleration in the radiation belts. Recently some studies have questioned whether or not this seed population is necessary. In this view the electrons are locally accelerated in the radiation belts. This proposal will investigate whether or not a seed population is necessary. The investigators will examine the phase space density of electrons as a function of radial distance by using observations from the THEMIS satellites, the Van Allen Probes, SWARM (an ESA mission) and e-POP (a Canadian mission). This will be a statistical study that uses a number of events.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI has long involved secondary school students in his research. His research projects for high school students have been very successful. He will continue this under this grant. The research findings from this proposal are important for space weather applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       My NSF-funded research project in magnetospheric physics was a collaboration with Dr. Kaijun Liu of Auburn University.  The major goal of this project was to carry out a theoretical and computational study of certain plasma instabilities which are observed in the Earth?s magnetosphere, the region of magnetic fields and hot plasma surrounding Earth.  These fields form a "magnetic bottle" which traps energetic plasma near the Earth; extended exposure to these fast charged particles can degrade and eventually destroy spacecraft electronics so that understanding their dynamics is essential for protecting satellites, both military and commercial, in Earth orbit.       The ions and electrons trapped in the geomagnetic field are not in a steady state, but are the sources of plasma instabilities, fluctuating electric and magnetic fields which grow to large amplitudes and then react back on the plasma particles.  The particular subject of our research has been instabilities which are excited by magnetospheric ions; specifically under the conditions that there  are more ions moving in the directions perpendicular to the geomagnetic field than ions moving parallel to that field.  These ions form a ring in velocity space and can drive several different kinds of growing modes.  An important component of our research was to use theory and computer models to compare the properties of these different types of these instabilities to better understand how these modes can be controlled and how their potentially harmful consequences es can be reduced if not eliminated.        A recent specific achievement of our research has been the derivation of simple expressions for the frequencies, growth rates, and maximum field magnetic fluctuation levels for a specific growing mode, the Alfven-cyclotron instability.  These new results will help improve the accuracy of large-scale computer models of ion dynamics.          Last Modified: 03/01/2017       Submitted by: Stephen P Gary]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
