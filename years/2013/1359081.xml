<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Connecticut (UConn). Professors Mark Pezuh and Jose A. Gascon who will recruit motivated undergraduates from primarily non-Ph.D. granting institutions to participate in a graduate-level research project over a 10-week period. Students with limited opportunities for independent research, women, and students from under-represented groups are especially encouraged to apply. As a unique thrust, the program targets participation from nearby Central Connecticut State University (CCSU), a non-Ph.D.-granting institution. The program pays special attention to develop communication skills and ethical behavior in the research setting. Participants also obtain a foundation for making informed choices about future careers in chemistry and establish networks with peers from a range of disciplines and experiences. Overall, the UConn Chemistry REU program aims to enhance students' enthusiasm for chemistry and prepare them for post-graduate success in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core aim of this program is to introduce participants to the full breadth of research-related activities, a number of ancillary technical workshops, and professional development seminars. In addition to the research conducted in the host laboratories, students participate in two hands-on workshops: one on computational chemistry and the other on single crystal X-ray crystallography held at CCSU. These activities introduce an intellectually challenging technical component to the program that involves the entire cohort and provides a deeper understanding about techniques that are instrumental to all fields of chemistry. The program incorporates a graduate assistant as a near-peer leader to cultivate a group identity for each year's cohort. Activities culminate in oral presentations and a poster symposium for which the University community, parents and faculty from the students' home institutions are invited.</AbstractNarration>
