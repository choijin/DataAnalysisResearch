<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Proposal No: SES - 1327008  &lt;br/&gt;Institution: Yale University&lt;br/&gt;NSF Program: ECONOMICS&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Berry, Steven T.&lt;br/&gt;Title: Doctoral Dissertation Research in economics: Examining the Impact of Hybrids on the U.S. Automobile Market&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the project is to determine the impact of hybrids on the United States automobile market by answering two questions: how much utility have consumers gained from the creation of hybrids, and as a result, how has the composition of the overall U.S. vehicle fleet changed over time?&lt;br/&gt;Hybrids, which currently make up a significant and growing portion of the vehicle fleet, have received a great deal of attention in recent years due to their relevance in alternative energy and environmental protection policies.  However, while hybrids have factored into discussions on the impacts of gasoline taxes or fuel-efficiency standards imposed on auto manufacturers, the analysis of the overall benefits of hybrids remains incomplete.&lt;br/&gt;By using data which track the vehicle holdings of households across a ten-year period, this project will estimate how the creation of hybrids have benefited the nation as a whole, and how much welfare can be expected from further technological advancements in the market.  Specifically, the project looks at the period of 1999-2009 and examines the release of the 2004 Toyota Prius and the release of hybrids in general, both of which occur during the observed time.  The 2004 Prius is particularly interesting, as it is the first commercially successful hybrid in the United States, and has been the best-selling hybrid in every year.  By estimating how consumers might have purchased differently if the Prius and other hybrids had not been available, the research can determine how much value hybrids bring to the market.&lt;br/&gt;The datasets used for this project have two distinct advantages over those used in most studies of the automobile market.  First, the data track the same households over time.  Most of the research done on automobile markets draw on multiple years of data, but take a random sample of households from each year.  Since each year of the data contains a new set of households, each family?s unique unobservable tastes (e.g., a love of fast, powerful cars; the resolve to ?drive a car into the ground?) cannot be controlled for in the analysis.  As a result, the effect of these tastes merges with the effect of vehicle purchases over time.  However, by identifying and controlling for each household over multiple years, this project can control for the tastes effect, isolating the vehicle effect as desired.&lt;br/&gt;Second, while most datasets differentiate between vehicles at the level of year, make, and model, the data used for this research also differentiates between gasoline and hybrid trims.  Many of the hybrids on the market in the late 2000s are alternative trims of gasoline-powered cars, such as the Honda Civic and Toyota Camry.  With this feature in the data, hybrids can be distinguished from other vehicles, making the proposed analysis possible.&lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the new model used by the project allows past purchases to directly influence current purchases, a feature not shared by models used by the recent econometrics literature.  Previously, estimates of impacts to the vehicle fleet were only applicable ten or more years after the impact, since all consumers needed to be given a chance to respond to the change.  By examining past purchases, the model in this project controls for households? tendencies to hold onto cars for several years regardless of impacts to the market, making forecasts two to ten years after the impact possible.  The usefulness of the new model is not restricted to the automobile market; it can be applied to many durable-goods markets (e.g., appliances, computers).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Gasoline usage has been a popular topic of discussion recently in political and economic fields.  In energy regulation, the United States' heavy dependence on gasoline as an energy source is a recognized issue.  In environmental economics, carbon emissions and air pollution from gasoline-burning vehicles are a major concern.  To better inform discussion on these issues, I estimate the consumer market benefits from the creation of hybrid vehicles.  By understanding the scope of the impact that changes in energy-saving policies and technologies have, social planners can anticipate changes in the automotive and gasoline markets more precisely and better maximize welfare.   My co-author Ken Gillingham and I estimate a demand and supply model of the new car market to measure the benefits generated by the introduction of the hybrid vehicle to the U.S. automobile market.  The data used to estimate this model are the complete set of new vehicle registrations in the state of California from 2001-2008, which allows us to adequately capture the effects of a small segment of the market. Using a counterfactual analysis of the market without hybrid vehicles, we examine the changes in consumer utility and calculate compensating variation to estimate the average benefit that the availability of hybrids brings to consumers, conditional on observable characteristics based on their residence. Compensating variation is initially estimated at $39 for each new vehicle purchaser in 2001, but by 2008, this number increases to $632 thanks to the success of the Toyota Prius and increased demand for hybrids in general. We find differences in compensation based on income, with high-income households requiring $733 to be compensated in 2008, and low-income households only needing $559. The total market benefit from hybrids in the state of California is estimated as high as $837 million in 2007, not including environmental and energy benefits.
