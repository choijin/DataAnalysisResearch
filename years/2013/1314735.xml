<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on strongly correlated phases of cold-atomic systems in optical lattices where collective behavior is governed by laws of quantum mechanics. The prototypical strongly correlated fermionic systems -- the Hubbard model and resonant fermions in the regime of BCS-BEC crossover -- are central in the fields of the cold atom research and condensed matter. Understanding quantum plasticity and super transport in solid 4He remains one of big challenges in modern low-temperature physics. There is urgent need for universal unbiased first-principles methods for strongly correlated fermionic systems across all fields of physics, quantum chemistry, and materials science. Ab initio and model simulations provide crucial information about quantitative and qualitative properties of these systems, test analytical predictions and help establish the proper theoretical framework, lay the ground for the unambiguous analysis of experimental data and further development of measuring techniques. In particular, this project aims to (i) develop generic diagrammatic Monte Carlo (DiagMC) tools for continuous-space and lattice fermionic/fermionized systems: resonant fermions, Hubbard model, and frustrated spin systems, (ii) understand quantum plasticity and supertransport in solid helium-4, (iii) perform Worm Algorithm (WA) studies of quantum-critical phenomena and novel phases of ultra-cold atoms: deconfined criticality, universal critical dynamics, phases of multi-bound complexes of polar molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An unbiased theoretical description of collective quantum phenomena is of vital interdisciplinary importance for a number of applied and fundamental areas, such as quantum computing and high-energy physics. High-end computing methods and techniques often find applications outside the physics community. Simulations of complex models with multiple constraints, randomness, and a variable number of continuous parameters are typical in polymer science, neural networks, computer science, behavioral, social and economics studies. The algorithms developed in the project provide an example of how some of the difficulties may be circumvented. An integral part of the project is the training of graduate students and post-doctoral associate in advanced numeric techniques, quantum statistics, topical problems of atomic and solid state physics, network administration, and parallel supercomputing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Key Outcomes of the project consist of the following 6 results:  1. Superfluid-insulator transition in strongly disordered one-dimensional systems  We developed an asymptotically exact renormalization-group theory of the superfluid-insulator transition in one-dimensional disordered systems. A special emphasis was made on an accurate description of the interplay between the Giamarchi-Schulz (instanton-anti-instanton) and weak-link (aka scratched-XY) criticalities. Combining the theory with extensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations allowed us to shed new light on the ground-state phase diagram of the one-dimensional disordered Bose-Hubbard model at unit filling.  2.  Trapping centers at the superfluid-Mott-insulator criticality: highly non-trivial transition between charge-quantized states  We found that under the conditions of superfluid-Mott-insulator criticality in two dimensions, the trapping centers&mdash;i.e., local potential wells and bumps&mdash;are  generically characterized by an integer charge corresponding to the number of trapped particles (if positive) or holes (if negative).  Varying the strength of the center leads to a highly non-trivial transition between two competing ground states with charges  differing by 1. The hallmark of the transition scenario is a splitting of the number density distortion into a half-integer core and a large halo carrying the complementary charge of plus/minus &frac12;.  The sign of the halo changes across the transition and the radius of the halo diverges on the approach to the critical strength of the center following a critical power law.  3. Consistent description of Coulomb and electron-phonon interactions in metals  An consistent theory of phonons in metals requires that all long-range Coulomb interactions between charged particles (electrons and ions) be treated on equal footing. So far, all attempts to deal with this non-perturbative system were relying on uncontrolled approximations in the absence of small parameters. We developed the Diagrammatic Monte Carlo approach for a two-component Coulomb system that obtains the solution to this fundamental problem in an approximation free way by computing vertex corrections from higher-order skeleton graphs. The feasibility of the method is demonstrated by calculating the spectrum of longitudinal acoustic phonons in a simple cubic lattice, determining their sound velocity, and obtaining the phonon spectral densities by analytic continuation of the Matsubara Green's functions.   4. Stability of Dirac liquids with strong Coulomb interaction  We developed and applied the Diagrammatic Monte Carlo technique to address the problem of stability of the Dirac liquid state (in a graphene-type system) against strong long-range part of the Coulomb interaction. So far, all attempts to deal with this problem in the field-theoretical framework were limited either to perturbative or RPA treatments, with diametrically opposite conclusions.  We unambiguously demonstrated that with increasing the system size, the coupling constant always flows towards zero; i.e. the two dimensional Dirac liquid is an asymptotically free T=0 state with divergent Fermi velocity.  5. New methods to control diagrammatic expansions: shifted-action expansion and applicability of dressed diagrammatic schemes  While bare diagrammatic series are merely Taylor expansions in powers of interaction strength, dressed diagrammatic series, built on fully or partially dressed lines and vertices, are usually constructed by reordering the bare diagrams, which is an a priori unjustified manipulation, and can even lead to convergence to an unphysical result. We found that for a broad class of partially dressed diagrammatic schemes, there exists an action S(&xi;) depending analytically on an auxiliary complex parameter &xi;, such that the Taylor expansion in &xi; of correlation functions reproduces the original diagrammatic series. The resulting applicability conditions are similar to the bare case.   6.  A breakthrough in the fermionic sign problem: Plynomial complexity despite the fermionic sign  It has been commonly believed that in unbiased quantum Monte Carlo approaches to fermionic many-body problems, the infamous sign problem generically implies prohibitively large computational times for obtaining thermodynamic-limit quantities. We pointed out that for convergent Feynman diagrammatic series evaluated with a recently introduced Monte Carlo algorithm [Rossi, Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 045701 (2017)] -- an enhanced version of diagrammatic Monte Carlo, the computational time increases only polynomially with the inverse error on thermodynamic-limit quantities, 1/&epsilon;. We also pointed out that for the standard version of diagrammatic Monte Carlo, the complexity is quai-polynomial rather than exponential: The power of corresponding polynomial increases only double-logarithmically with 1/&epsilon;.
