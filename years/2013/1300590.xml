<AbstractNarration>This nanomanufacturing research program aims to engineer arrays of dissimilar biomolecules for the purpose of studying increasingly complex biomolecular interactions. Advanced lithographic patterning will be used to create molecular-scale binding posts on solid surfaces. Different biomolecules, such as proteins and peptides, will be chemically assembled on the posts. The biomolecules will be organized in a variety of geometric arrangements, and the position of each molecule will be precisely determined. The arrays will be characterized by different microscopy techniques in order to optimize the placement accuracy and chemical selectivity of the process. A range of molecular densities, nanometer-scale spacings and geometric arrangements will be explored, and their effects on binding interactions between different biomolecules will be measured and quantified. The arrays will then be applied to the study of cellular response to the geometric organization of different proteins that are part of a cell's environment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to control the placement and organization of individual molecules is a key challenge in nanoscience and nanotechnology. The types of nano-scale arrayed surfaces developed in this program represent an important step towards manufacturing with molecular precision. They can be applied to a broad assortment of cellular and biomolecular systems and can be used for assembly of heterogeneous molecular species over a wide range of length scales. Applications in medical diagnostics, tissue engineering and therapeutic treatment are possible. Notably, the research in this program is highly interdisciplinary. It integrates tools and techniques originally developed by the semiconductor industry for the manufacture of electronic devices with biosystems in order to create new functionality at the nanoscale. The students and post-docs who train in this program will represent a new class of scientists who are comfortable working across traditional scientific boundaries.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p class="Default">The incredible proliferation of electronics in recent decades to where it now pervades nearly every sphere of human activity has been enabled by the continual shrinking of the transistor, a process known as scaling. The key features of transistors are now around the same size as biomolecules. This project has been based upon the adaptation of semiconductor lithography &ndash; the technology used for patterning transistors on chips &ndash; to the creation of arrays of different biomolecules for the purpose of studying biomolecular interactions and cellular functions with single-molecule precision and specificity. The primary aim of the project is the development of new nanomanufacturing technologies to control the placement and organization of heterogeneous molecular species on surfaces in order to enable the study of cooperative, synergistic and inhibitory effects, which can play a key role in many cellular interactions. We have created arrays of arbitrary geometries comprising individual proteins anchored to nanoparticles surrounded by a background containing a second protein. The background can be either static or mobile, and it can be in the plane of the nanoparticles or recessed by a fixed distance (Fig. 1). Thus, we are able to achieve full control over protein position in all three dimensions. We tested the arrays by studying the response of T cells to different geometric arrangements of T cell receptor ligands in the presence of mobile adhesion proteins and were able to establish the geometric rules for T cell receptor triggering. These results illustrate the utility of heteromolecular nanoarrays for the study of biomolecular interactions, and they have potential implications for new types of cancer therapies.</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit: </strong>The ability to control the placement and organization of individual molecules promises to enable a wide range of applications and is a key challenge in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology. While the study of individual biomolecular interactions is and will continue to be important, many interactions involve more than a single pair of molecules. This project has achieved an unprecedented level of placement control of single molecules, including controlling the number of molecules at a given site (Fig. 2). This research program combines traditional semiconductor engineering tools and process with innovative surface chemistry approaches and selective biomolecular functionalization in order to engineer surfaces patterned with different biomolecular species, while maintaining single-molecule control over placement and geometric organization. The project&rsquo;s approach also demonstrates that the tools and processes used to manufacture advanced semiconductors can be adapted to the life sciences. This is validated by our study of T cell response to ligand geometry (Fig. 3).</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts: </strong>This project is, by its very nature, highly interdisciplinary, combining nanoengineering, surface chemistry, selective self-assembly and cell biology. All aspects of the work have been closely integrated, so that trainees have learned to become a new class of scientist - one that has a firm base in the physical sciences (and engineering) but is fluent in the language of the life sciences and can, in fact, function comfortably in a life sciences setting. Biologists are also learning to appreciate and understand issues with which physical scientists and engineers have to contend, and their horizons are broadened as well. Students, whether in the lab or in the classroom, are also learning to think about science in ways that they can transport out of these settings, so that they can apply scientific thinking to other aspects of their lives. On a curricular level, aspects of this work were incorporated into class lectures taught by the PIs, in both engineering and in biology. Connections were also made to extracurricular K-12 programs that cater to underrepresented groups in order to expose young minds to new scientific perspectives.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/29/2017<br>      Modified by: Shalom&nbsp;J&nbsp;Wind</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1300590/1300590_10259192_1498242478841_Fig1-Nanoarryschematics--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1300590/1300590_10259192_1498242478841_Fig1-Nanoarryschematics--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1 - Heteromolecular nanoarray schematics"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1300590/1300590_10259192_1498242478841_Fig1-Nanoarryschematics--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1 - Heteromolecular nanoarray schematics"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Variations of nanoarray platform.
