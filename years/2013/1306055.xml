<AbstractNarration>Objective: &gt; The objective of this program is to develop new nonlinear and active artificial impedance surfaces. This represents a new research area with the potential to significantly expand the capabilities of artificial media, and overcome the limitations of current passive impedance surfaces. This program will involve all aspects of research, from conceptual development and simulations to fabrication and measurements. &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: &gt; The intellectual merit is that the development of active and nonlinear surfaces will expand human knowledge to include nonlinear surface wave effects, as well as superluminal propagation of surface waves through the use of active electronics embedded in periodic structures. This proposal is transformative in that these structures will demonstrate unique new phenomena at a size and frequency scale that is amenable to direct probing of the electric field to enable full examination of the underlying physics. In the future, these concepts can also be extended to other regimes such as optical surfaces that include active or nonlinear materials. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &gt; The broader impacts are that this program will involve new outreach efforts to historically underrepresented groups, as well as K-12 students to motivate them to pursue higher education in engineering. This outreach effort will be through coordination with the UCSD Jacobs School of Engineering IDEA (Inclusion, Diversity, Excellence, and Advancement) Center. The PI will pledge to work with the center to identify potential grad students from historically underrepresented groups, and to identify opportunities to promote the excitement of this research to K-12 students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project focused on development of nonlinear and active metasurfaces. Metasurfaces (two dimensional versions of metamaterials) are a kind of man-made material, like a composite, that is fabricated from periodic arrangements of metals, insulators, and other components. They allow us to make materials that have properties that are not available in nature, such as very high or low values of refractive index, surface impedance, effective permittivity or permeability, and unusual frequency response. In this work, we added nonlinear or active devices such as diodes and transistors to these metasurfaces to create an even wider range of properties. Our first work was aimed at building microwave materials that mimic some of the properties of nonlinear optical crystals, in particular self-focusing of radio frequency surface waves. Following electromagnetic simulations, we were able to successfully fabricate and measure the first self-focusing microwave surface, shown in figure 1. This could potentially be used to build automatic direction-finding antennas by focusing any incoming signal to a common feed point. Next, we developed active metasurfaces based on non-Foster circuits, which are negative capacitors or negative inductors which are built using active transistor circuits. As one example, shown in figure 2, we demonstrated waveguides that support faster-than-light propagation, without violating causality, and we explored the limits of these structures. These can potentially be used to build thin, broadband leaky wave antennas. We also examined the applicability of these non-Foster circuits to other applications such as electrically small antennas. Finally, we built active artificial impedance surfaces that are capable of very broadband operation (more than an octave in the UHF range) in a surface that is only 5 mm thick. This structure, shown in figure 3, would not be possible without active metasurfaces, and it may enable thin broadband coatings for conformal antennas, or control over the microwave scattering properties of aircraft.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/08/2017<br>      Modified by: Daniel&nbsp;Sievenpiper</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1306055/1306055_10248688_1507500792544_BroadbandActiveSurface--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1306055/1306055_10248688_1507500792544_BroadbandActiveSurface--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Broadband Active Surface"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1306055/1306055_10248688_1507500792544_BroadbandActiveSurface--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Broadband Active Surface"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This is a photo of our broadband active surface.
