<AbstractNarration>1338008&lt;br/&gt;Islam&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is for the acquisition of a Micro-Particle Image Velocimetry (micro-PIV) system to conduct micro-fluidics, MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical-systems), and biomedical flow experiments for both research and student training at the University of Texas at Brownsville (UTB). UTB is a minority-serving institution in the Rio Grande Valley (RGV) of Texas. With a population of 1.5 million, comprised primarily of Hispanics, the RGV is the fourth-largest populated region in the state. The project supports four specific research components: (i) Integration of Microcantilever with AC Electrokinetics for Sensing Bio-/Nano-Particles. tric fields for the implementation of high-efficiency bioparticle collection and separation. (ii) Biased AC Electroosmosis Micropump for Water Management in PEM Fuel Cells. (iii) Biomimetic Flow Sensing. The main objective of this activity is to obtain the micro-scale time-dependent flow structures. (iv) Selective Filtration/Absorption of Nano- and Micron- Size Particles Using Carbon Nanotube-Based Media. This activity will synthesize carbon nanotube-based media with various morphologies and densities to  selectively filter nano- and micron-size particles from fluid flow.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes/Findings  The main outcome of the project is to acquire Micro-Particle Image Velocimetry (&micro;PIV) system that will be used to characterize the micro/nano flow, to track bio particles in micro-/nano-fluidics and biomimetic flow investigations. &micro;PIV is housed in the MEMS/NEMS research laboratory that is open for the students, faculty members and community in the Rio Grande Valley (RGV), TX, the fourth largest populated area in Texas; which is historically underrepresented region. The area has a population of 1.5 million and UTRGV is the only institution that offers graduate programs in the engineering fields.  Now many researchers have access to &micro;PIV  system and the students are now able to use it to support Science and Engineering research.  The research laboratory serves as the foundation in which core research is being conducted at a world-class level; collaborations between two campuses of UTRGV drive significant advances in interdisciplinary research; and significant opportunities are made available to both undergraduate and graduate students.   Impact on UTRGV research infrastructure:   The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (UTRGV)  is established in 2015 in a historic move that brings together the resources and assets of UT Brownsville (UTB) and UT Pan American (UTPA). UTPA and UTB have been growing tremendously over the past ten years. U.S. college access rates have flattened, and the gap in rates of college attendance between low income and other Americans has persisted. However the new university growth rate is promising. The current students? enrollment is over 28500. The College of Engineering &amp; Computer Science (COECS) at UTRGV has now over 3200 students.  The new university is maintaining state leadership in the preparation and production of public school teachers in south Texas. The MEMS/NEMS research laboratory that house the &micro;PIV system is also playing an important role for the research infrastructure at UTRGV.   Summary of project Impact:  i)                       Performed a broad range of research related to microfluidics, MEMS and biomedical flow experiments; the system allows us to characterize micro-pumps, microfluidics mixers and biomedical flow experiments. Following projects were the part of the research:   Integration of Microcantilever with AC Electrokinetics  for Sensing Bio-/Nano-Particles Biased AC Electroosmosis Micropump for Water Management in PEM Fuel Cells Biomimetic Flow Sensing Selective Filtration/Absorption of Nano- and Micron- Size Particles Using Carbon Nanotube-Based Media.   ii)                     Prepared qualified and skilled graduate and undergraduate students who are working in world?s leading companies, such as Intel, Reytheon, Texas Instrument, NASA, Alps, General Electric, Boeing, Caterpillar, FreeScale, and IBM.  iii)                    Enhanced the multidisciplinary research partnership among different departments leading to collaborations for further external funding.
