<AbstractNarration>A persistent puzzle in the U.S. science and engineering (S&amp;E) workforce is that there are far more Americans with S&amp;E degrees than work in S&amp;E jobs, while at the same time industry leaders argue there is a shortage of qualified workers in this strategically important sector. This research uses the NSF SESTAT database to focus on factors that can affect the entry and exit dynamics of all S&amp;E workers. We exploit the insights gained from disaggregation to show how the nation?s gain or loss of supply of S&amp;E workers varies by field of degree, how workers without an S&amp;E degree can impact the S&amp;E worker supply, how university type and geographic location interact with these and demographic variables like race, gender and age, and how all of these are affected by how we choose to define what constitutes an S&amp;E job in the first place.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This research provides a necessary foundation for understanding prominent, higher order questions in research on the S&amp;E workforce, such as how we can increase the numbers of women and minorities in S&amp;E, or how immigration affects the supply and demand for S&amp;E workers. Moreover, this exploration will identify the strengths of SESTAT, and highlight where new or revised questions may improve it. Finally, this examination of the multiple pathways of entry and exit will generate new hypotheses for exploration.</AbstractNarration>

Why was this important? There are major efforts underway, funded by the federal, state and local governments, as well as by foundations, to train Americans in S&amp;E (also known as "STEM"--science, technology, engineering, math) skills. Various policies and project attempt to increase or widen the S&amp;E "pipeline" by better training Americans in these skills, and to attract immigrants with these skills to study and work in America. Other efforts aim to fix the "leaky pipeline," encouraging persistence in studying and working in S&amp;E.  Government, academic and business leaders commonly refer to these workers as the key to the innovation economy, growth and job creation. Our research has shed new light on these processes, and offered new insights for better understanding.     While the NSF datasets cannot capture many of the fine-grained details necessary to illuminate the innovation economy, we can capture a lot. Regarding the "leaky pipeline," the data indicate some good news from the perspective of "return on investment" in the educational sense: the longer one is in school for training in S&amp;E, the more likely they are to work in an S&amp;E job (PhDs are more likely to stay than are Masters holders, who in turn are more likely to stay than are those with only a four-year degree).     But what does it mean to not "leak" from "the pipeline"? That metaphor assumes that working in S&amp;E is something that is straightforward, but it is not. The National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG) contains three key measures of working in S&amp;E. One is simply a classification of occupational titles as S&amp;E or not (e.g., mechanical engineer).

We can see this if we examine the large number of Americans who&mdash;in a process that is not at all captured by the pipeline metaphor&mdash;work in S&amp;E despite having no S&amp;E degree. For example, in 2010, and focusing on the highest degree earned, the top five non-S&amp;E degrees in S&amp;E jobs were business administration and management; accounting; elementary teacher education; business (general); and financial management.     The top five S&amp;E jobs in 2010 for non-S&amp;E degree holders (who claim to use S&amp;E expertise) were accountants, auditors, and other financial specialists; teachers: elementary; top-level managers, execs, admins (CEO/COO/CFO, president, etc.); teachers: Secondary- computer, math or sciences; other mid-level managers.
