<AbstractNarration>Quantum computers have the potential to solve problems that are completely impossible for classical computers, ranging from cryptography for national defense to face recognition and drug development. Just as the transistor is the building block of all modern digital circuits, the quantum bit (aka the qubit) is the heart of a quantum computer.  Superconducting qubits, which are essentially artificial two-level atoms that can be designed and fabricated using integrated circuit technology, have emerged as one of the top candidates for realizing scalable quantum information processing. In order to perform quantum computation successfully, quantum computing circuits must be able to transfer quantum information rapidly among a large number of qubits with high fidelity.  However, because existing protocols for quantum information transfer (QIT) are in general an order of magnitude slower than single qubit gates, QIT has become the bottleneck for quantum computation. Furthermore, conventional methods of QIT either require a large amount of on-chip real estate or have relatively low quality factor leading to lower efficiency and fidelity. Therefore, it is difficult to scale up qubit circuits to a practically useful size with these protocols.  The focus of this project is to demonstrate the basic elements of a novel method of quantum information transmission in superconducting qubit circuits. This new approach uses "dual-rail arrays of negative-inductance Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices (nSQUIDs)" as the information transmitting structures for significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art QIT protocols. The negative mutual inductance between the branches of an nSQUID assigns the two tasks of processing and transferring quantum information to different parts of the nSQUID circuit and therefore makes it possible to optimize parameters of each part for its particular task, so that much faster QIT can be achieved. The success of the project will thus remove one of the most critical roadblocks to building quantum computers. Therefore, knowledge and insights gained from the project activities can be readily applied to other superconducting qubit based quantum computing circuits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum information research has emerged as a highly competitive cutting edge research field which is actively pursued by all major nations around the world. It is critically important to national security and to maintaining United States' leadership position in scientific discoveries and technological innovations. This collaborative project between theoretical and experimental groups in quantum circuit physics provides a good opportunity for education and training of the graduate and undergraduate students in one of the frontiers of scientific exploration. The project also includes significant outreach and education activities such as improving the undergraduate and graduate classes in Quantum Computing developed with previous NSF support at the University of Kansas and Stony Brook University; involving undergraduates into quantum information research at Kansas; and presenting colloquia on quantum information at local high schools, colleges and universities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The work in the project was focused on the two main areas. One is the thermodynamics of information in nanostructures, and the other is the motion of classical and quantum information specifically in circuits of superconducting qubits. Our work made novel contributions to both of these areas.   On thermodynamics of information, the outcome of our work is the suggestion that the reversal of the optimal Landauer?s erasure of classical information provides the basis for operation of a Maxwell?s demon with the ultimate thermodynamics efficiency.  Such a reversible demon extracts the heat Q=kBT ln 2 from an equilibrium reservoir at temperature T and converts it into free energy, at the thermodynamic cost of creating one bit of information about the state of the working body of the demon.  As stated above, the central element of this approach is the reversal of the process of erasure of one bit of information which would generate kBT ln 2 of heat in the reservoir.  This scheme of Maxwell?s demon operation was realized experimentally using as the working body of the demon a nano-scale tunnel junction in which the information is encoded in the position of an individual electron on the left or the right electrode of the junction.  The average heat  exchanged with the reservoir by such a "single-electron" demon is shown in the included Figure as a function of the normalized gate voltage ng across the junction, which effectively controls the probabilities for the electron to be on the left or the right junction electrode. The Figure shows that for ng=0.5, when the two probabilities are equal, and therefore, position of electron encodes precisely one bit of information, the reversible Maxwell?s demon extracts  kBT ln 2 of heat from the reservoir.  On the motion of quantum information in superconducting qubits, we showed that one can design superconducting circuits in which the logical qubits encoding quantum information can be directly transported along the circuit. Such trasnport of quantum information should become increasingly more important as the superconducting quantum circuits approach the goal of information processing on at least a medium scale.  We also found that the transport of logical qubits in arays of physical qubits provides an additional benefit of suppressing the low-frequency decoherence prevalent in solid state structures including the superconducting qubits, even in the small few-qubit structures.
