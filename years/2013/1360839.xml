<AbstractNarration>A fundamental mission of the Documenting Endangered Language Program is to create digital infrastructure that provides scientists and endangered-language community members access to threatened language data.  Countless extant records of endangered languages worldwide are in need of curation with input from linguists and the speaker-communities.  April Counceller and Alisha Drabek of the Alutiiq Heritage Foundation will work with a strong team of community members, linguists, archivists, and museum curators to build a comprehensive database of one highly endangered language, Kodiak Alutiiq spoken in coastal Alaska (Alaska Peninsula to Prince William Sound).  This database will include existing audio recordings with enhanced metadata, additional data from 33 remaining speakers, and a speaker registry recording when and how each speaker acquired the language.   A major part of the project will be to educate Alutiiq speakers on metadata terminology so that materials can continue to be curated and located with ease.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The key to improved language documentation and linguistic discovery is access to language data from a variety of genres, ages, and styles since each data sample provides a different view of language structure.  The proposed Alutiq database, created using the innovative Mukurtu Content Management System for endangered language data, will be a model for other communities on how to create a rich corpus for linguistic analysis and community use and how to curate data.  It will provide data access and search capabilities.  The project will fill gaps in the database by recording missing genres or interaction-types from speakers.  The database will be easily accessible through the Alutiiq Museum and the Alaska Native Language Archive websites.</AbstractNarration>
