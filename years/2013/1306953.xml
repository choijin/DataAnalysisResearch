<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for the University of Kansas Particle Physics group to conduct research with the CMS experiment at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland and to complete ongoing efforts in Particle Astrophysics at several locations worldwide.  The group is making significant contributions to CMS both analytically and technically.   In analysis, the group is focusing its efforts on studies of Higgs bosons, top quarks, electroweak processes and new phenomena.   Technical contributions include responsibilities for supporting the existing CMS tracker and the building the new "Phase I" pixel detector.  Toward a future high energy electron collider, the group is developing improved methods of jet energy reconstruction using particle-flow based techniques.  In the area of particle astrophysics, the group is completing a number of technically challenging efforts based upon radio detection and located in Antarctica, Utah and Siberia.   In the area of broader impacts, the group has an exceptionally strong outreach program including a QuarkNet Center, the Quarked! Project that engages young children in the excitement of science and scientific questions, and significant engagement of undergraduates at all levels of the program.</AbstractNarration>

Most of the funds went to salary support for the group, which includes three faculty members, three postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, undergraduate students, and summer high school researchers. The remainder of the funds provided supplies and travel support for the group. The group works in collaboration with the CMS experiment at CERN&rsquo;s Large Hadron Collider.

The CMS detector was one of two experiments that discovered the Higgs boson in 2012. This completed the roster of particles in the theory known as the Standard Model. The Higgs boson provides mass to the other particles and KU&rsquo;s data analysis efforts have focused on this particle and its relation to the heaviest known elementary particle &ndash; the top quark.

Evidence for this process was found in the 7 TeV data and a statistically significant discovery of this process was made with the 8 TeV data. Data analysis with the 13 TeV data is ongoing and has focused on searches for new particles, especially heavier cousins of the top quark (called &ldquo;vector-like quarks&rdquo;) that would decay into a top quark and a Higgs boson.

The group helped with the electronic readout system and the testing of the sensors. The group is now working on the development of a future version of this device. KU also used the nuclear interactions of particles with the detector material to make a sort of &ldquo;X-ray&rdquo; image of the detector.
