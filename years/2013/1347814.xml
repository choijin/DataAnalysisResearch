<AbstractNarration>This project at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln aims at bridging the gap between research and practice in STEM education.  The project is drawing upon prior research on effective pedagogies and theories of change to effect institutional transformation in undergraduate STEM education with a particular emphasis on introductory classes where student attrition is most pronounced.   Within the implementation component of the project, over one hundred faculty members in fourteen STEM departments are being provided professional development on research based instructional strategies and course design.   The faculty members are using this professional development to change their instructional practices with the overall goal of improving student learning outcomes.  This is impacting approximately 5000 students, including a significant number of underrepresented students, over the life of the project.  The research team will use this context of instructional transformation to study factors that influence faculty and departmental adoption of effective pedagogies.  The results of these studies are contributing to the higher education knowledge base and could influence how other institutions seek to enact transformations in STEM teaching and learning.  The research results are being broadly disseminated to other institutions and to the public through a variety of mechanisms.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal of the Adopting Research-based Instructional Strategies for Enhancing (ARISE) STEM Education project was to create a sustainable model for transforming and supporting STEM education using research-based instructional strategies in STEM courses, with an emphasis on large introductory-level courses taught in 14 STEM departments at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL).  A key factor in the ability of the United States to remain economically competitive is the ability of universities to educate the next generation of the STEM workforce.  This will require institutions to increase and diversify the student body studying STEM disciplines.  To do this, faculty need to better understand how students learn engineering and adopt research based instructional strategies that increase student learning and allow a broader student body to succeed in undergraduate STEM curricula.   We recognized three central considerations to transforming STEM education: (i) content matter expertise does not translate to pedagogical expertise, (ii) nurturing communities of practice support experimentation and implementation of teaching practices that are new to any given faculty member, and (iii) the culture and practice around evaluating and rewarding effective teaching is not fully developed. The ARISE STEM Education project was designed with three major components that specifically address these three considerations. The first major component involved professional development workshops for STEM faculty. In these workshops, faculty learned about course design, the iterative relationship between goals and assessments, various types of assessment techniques, research-based instructional strategies (RBISs), and how to productively do peer observations of teaching, including methods for note taking that lead to useful feedback. The second major component was a mentoring program where faculty who participated in the professional development activities were with those new to the activities. The mentoring program was designed to encourage faculty to talk about teaching with as much ease, richness, and detail as they would do with their research, support faculty experimentation and implementation of new practices in their classrooms, and cultivate a supportive community of practice around STEM education that is transformative to both students and instructors. The third was an initiative led by our STEM department chairs aimed at understanding and proposing changes in current policies and practices about what constitutes effective teaching, how effective teaching is rewarded in the context of different departmental cultures and norms, and how existing protocols for evaluating teaching and promotion and tenure files might be revised in order to better account for the use of transformative teaching practices.  Participation in ARISE professional development programs has impacted 192 STEM faculty and created a new culture around teaching undergraduate STEM courses.  The project resulted in the institutionalization of the Engineering and Computing Education Core that provides resources and support for engineering faculty towards the UNL College of Engineering?s mission of providing excellent post-secondary education through ABET-Accredited programs.  The project also resulted in the establishment of the College of Engineering Graduate Student Teaching Fellows Program. This program is a one-year competitive program that prepares graduate students who are currently (or will be) teaching at the postsecondary level. The design of the program allows graduate students a professional development opportunity with the potential to earn national Center for the Integration of Research, Teaching and Learning (CIRTL) Associate level certification.
