<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this award is to provide partial support to selected students studying in US institutions to participate in the 9th International Conference on Micro-Manufacturing to be held in Singapore, 25-28 March 2014. This is a premiere global conference on micro-manufacturing which draws large attendance of researchers and engineers each year from America, Europe, and Asia. Over one hundred papers covering a wide range of topics pertinent to micro-manufacturing and micro-engineering are expected to be presented at the conference. The attending students will participate in the conference by presenting technical papers they have authored. The funding opportunity will be broadly announced giving students ample notice and time to apply. Applications will be reviewed by the conference scientific committee. A total of sixteen students will be partially supported from this award which will help offset expenses for travel, conference registration, and lodging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to nurturing a global micro-manufacturing vision, participating students will learn about the latest research progress and challenges in micro-manufacturing by attending technical presentations by leading international experts in the field. The students will also have opportunities to exchange ideas with leading researchers and engineers from worldwide industrial and governmental facilities, as well as the opportunity to visit companies and laboratories involved with micro-manufacturing in Singapore.</AbstractNarration>
