<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for scaled-up nanomanufacturing and assembly of virus-based Janus bio-nanoparticles including higher-order structures. The Janus term refers to the Roman god of beginnings and transitions, depicted with two faces. As dual-faced nano-objects, Janus-type nanomaterials offer a higher degree of functionality and tunability of properties compared to most traditional nanoparticles. They also have unique self-assembly properties, allowing new phases to form and phase transitions to occur that were not previously observed. Research under this program is focused on devising scalable and in-solution synthetic methods for the production of these bio-nanoparticle assemblies with high yields, and involving fewer synthetic and purification steps, while maintaining high-precision nanostructuring and scalable manufacturing. Specifically, plant virus-based nanoparticles will be produced through genetic engineering and scalable molecular farming in plants. Sphere- and tube-like bio-nanoparticles will be applied in various geometries for solution-based chemical and colloidal synthesis. Chemical functionalization will be carried out in situ, minimizing yield-limiting purification procedures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The methods and materials produced under this award will provide a new avenue towards scalable nanomanufacturing of Janus-based nanoparticles and their higher-ordered structures. Based on the broad applicability of such materials in areas of medicine, materials, and energy, devising methods for efficient nanomanufacturing is expected to have wide-ranging applications and impact on commercialization. For example, the proposed Janus-type materials, when functionalized with appropriate ligands or ions, have possible applications in healthcare, sensors, display optics, energy conversion, and data storage devices. These materials and devices can contribute towards enhanced quality of life, sustainability, and technological competitiveness.</AbstractNarration>

Biology-assisted nanomanufacturing holds tremendous potential. Biological systems self-assemble into hierarchical but well-defined structures able to orchestrate complex functionalities.

Viruses can be regarded as naturally occurring nanomaterials offering a platform to be engineered to impart new functionality. The virus-assisted nanomanufacturing studied under this award has led to the following key advancements in the field:  Using the coding elements of viruses, imaging probes were produced through farming in plants; such probes could be produced cost-effectively and used as sensor for disease detection.  At the same time, the virus-based nanomaterials could act as a carrier to delivery toxic payloads targeted to diseased tissues; in this scenario the viral coat proteins are utilized to form a protective coat around the toxic payload to chaperone the drug, just like a Trojan horse, to the disease site of interest. Finally, we demonstrated the virus-assisted nanomanufacturing of fibrous and porous films through virus-programmed self-assembly; these matrices could be applied as coatings or used as scaffolds for regenerative medicine.                Based on the broad applicability of virus-based, nanoscale materials in areas of medical, materials, and energy-research, devising methods for efficient nanomanufacturing is expected to have wide-ranging applications and impact in diverse disciplines.
