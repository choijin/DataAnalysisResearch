<AbstractNarration>This award funds shipboard scientific support equipment on the RV Blue Heron, which is owned by the University of Minnesota and operated by the Large Lakes Observatory and operated as a UNOLS vessel.  Funds will be used to develop maximum capacity documentation (MCDs) for our A-frame, crane, deck sockets and 01 deck, fishing gallows, and winches as per UNOLS RVSS Appendix B, and to purchase a fire detection system, and a replacement Automated Information System. All of this equipment and documentation will help ensure safer working conditions on board the Blue Heron thereby improving operations for all users of the ship.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts result from the funded MCDs, fire detection system, AIS and chemical storage locker, which will enhance the University of Minnesota?s infrastructure for research and education.  The items and documentation will increase the level of safety on board the vessel, ensuring that projects supported by NSF will be completed in a safe and timely manner. The equipment will be installed on the vessel and therefore will be available to all of the Blue Heron?s users.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of Minnesota Duluth purchased and installed the following equipment for the research vessel Blue Heron using funds provided in the National Science Foundation award OCE-1317333 'Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment, RV Blue Heron, 2013?: a new AIS (Automatic Identification System) for the pilothouse, a fire detection system for the entire vessel, a new slipring for our primary winch, and a chemical storage locker.  Additionally, we used funds from this award to install an aft facing search light, assess the lifting capacity of our aft A-frame (the primary lifting point for the wire rope used on the vessel) and assess the strength of our winch deck which is where the winches are placed on the vessel.  Once the A-frame and winch deck were assessed, funds from this award were used to strengthen the weak points on the A-frame, which were the pad-eyes where sheaves are attached to the A-frame, and to replace a weakened section of the winch deck.     The new equipment was necessary for the following reasons: 1) Our old AIS unit was 10 years old and failing.  Our local electronics specialist informed us that the parts and labor to fix the unit were the same cost as a new unit.  Since the RV Blue Heron often works at night, sometimes in heavy fog and sometimes while maintaining station for hours, and considering the heavy boat traffic on the Great Lakes, a working AIS unit is a primary safety tool; 2) We did not have a fire detection system on the RV Blue Heron and after our 2012 NSF inspection, NSF determined that installing a fire detection system was a priority; 3) Our winch slipring is 18 years old and necessary for data to travel to and from equipment attached to the wire rope on our primary winch.  We did not have a spare on board.  The additional slipring will allow us to continue a scientific expedition if the slipring were to fail; 4) We did not have a chemical storage locker and having a locker was advisable.     The additional work done using funds from this grant was necessary for the following reasons: 1) Modifications were necessary for the installation of the aft facing search light on the vessel?s mast; 2) We did not have a structural assessment of our A-frame which is the primary lifting point for equipment that is deployed from the vessel.  Once that assessment was done, we strengthened the A-frame?s pad eyes so that the A-frame had a 16,000lb lifting capacity; 3) Our primary winch deck was warped.  This award paid for a structural assessment of the winch deck and then replacement of some of the steel plating of the deck.     All of this equipment is available to all users of the RV Blue Heron, including two National Science Foundation funded projects that are occurring in 2018.  Besides the NSF funded projects, we are supporting several other science projects in 2018: multiple Great Lakes Observing System (NOAA) cruises, a State of Minnesota Department of Natural Resources cruise, a Legislative-Citizen Commission on Minnesota Resources cruise, and multiple research and educational cruises funded by the University of Minnesota.  Regarding the educational cruises, the University of Minnesota will probably fund approximately eight cruises in 2018, which will expose close to 200 undergraduates to scientific research on the Great Lakes.  As stated above, all of the equipment purchased using the award 'Shipboard Scientific Support Equipment, RV Blue Heron, 2013? (OCE-1317333) is available for use on all of these cruises.
