<AbstractNarration>Consistent individual differences in behavior, analogous to personality in humans, are ubiquitous throughout the animal kingdom. Animals can serve as models to study the evolutionary and ecological causes and consequences of personality in ways that are not possible in human psychology. For example, researchers interested in differences in boldness, aggression, and exploratory behavior have studied a fish, named the three-spined stickleback, that has a relatively short lifespan and is easy to care for. Previous studies have shown that different personalities of three-spined stickleback occur in different habitats and social environments in nature. The goal of this project is to determine 1) whether the personality of an individual is shaped by their environment, i.e. via plasticity; 2) if certain personalities consistently use certain environments over time (for example, if bold individuals always occur in large social groups); and 3) whether individuals tend to occur in environments for which they are well-suited. The project comprises an intensive laboratory-based experiment and a large-scale study of three-spined stickleback in their natural environment to provide a complete understanding of why some personalities are more likely to occur in certain habitats or social environments. This work has important implications for understanding why animals, including humans, show such marked variation in behavior that is consistent across time or context. This project provides ample training opportunities for undergraduates to become future scientists. The topic of the research, especially the field component, is highly accessible to a general audience and will be presented as science-in-action to local citizens and vacationers throughout the field season in rural Mendocino County, CA. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data from this project will be made available in the Dryad Digital Repository (datadryad.org).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Populations of animals are often composed of individuals that differ consistently from one another in behavior. In humans, the name we use for consistent individual differences in behavior is personality. Although the traits we study in non-human animals differ from the well-known human traits, i.e. the "big five", consistent individual differences in behavior in non-human animals have been dubbed animal personality.     A growing number of researchers are studying animal personality because it challenges the status quo notion that species are evolving a single optimal set of behaviors. Instead it is possible that a diverse set of behavioral types exist in nature because differences between individuals are actually adaptive. One way the coexistence of different behavioral types might happen is if individuals occur in environment to which they are best suited.       We decided to test this hypothesis using a small fish species that goes by the name, three-spined stickleback. It occurs in marine and freshwater habitats throughout the Northern hemisphere.

The other advantage of studying three-spined stickleback was that previous researchers had shown that individuals differ consistently in a trait that has the potential to affect survival; the trait commonly referred to as boldness reflects an individualÆs willingness to take risks.     In previous research, we found that fish with relatively bold behavioral types were more likely to occur in open habitats rather than in vegetation and that they occurred in groups as opposed to occurring alone.  Relatively shy fish were more likely to be in vegetated habitats or they were usually alone. This observation in itself did not show that fish occurred in environments to which their behavior was well suited as it was strictly a correlation.
