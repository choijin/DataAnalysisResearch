<AbstractNarration>This is a short-term (less than one-year) effort to conduct initial operations and data analysis for the original FIREBIRD mission and to construct a second set of FIREBIRD cubesats to be launched in August 2014. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Focused Investigations of Relativistic Electron Burst Intensity, Range, and Dynamics (FIREBIRD) is a space weather NSF CubeSat project that was selected for funding through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in 2009.   It is CubeSat mission consisting of two identical 1.5U satellites that will measure relativistic electron precipitation with unprecedented temporal resolution in a high inclination low-Earth orbit to resolve the spatial scale size and energy dependence of electron microbursts from the Van Allen radiation belts. FIREBIRD is a collaborative effort between the University of New Hampshire (UNH) and Montana State University (MSU) and is scheduled for launch in October 2013 as a secondary payload under NASA's Educational Launch of Nanosatellites program.  Support for initial mission operations and science analysis to secure the immediate and full success for FIREBIRD as well as the opportunity to develop an identical pair of spacecraft (FIREBIRD II) at a fraction of the cost of the original FIREBIRD award while the present workforce and expertise is in place are the subject of this RAPID proposal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The so-called "killer" electrons in the radiation belt can produce deep dielectric discharging in spacecraft components, a significant concern for satellite health and operations. Microbursts are thought to be a significant loss mechanism for relativistic electrons but remain poorly understood, thus rendering space weather predictive models of Earth's radiation belts incomplete.  The FIREBIRD project is design to address important questions about the physical process that generates relativistic microbursts.    FIREBIRD II providing an additional pair of satellites that collect microburst observations at the same time greatly enhances the capability to assess the global impact of microbursts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to addressing fundamental space physics research and space weather applications, the FIREBIRD and FIREBIRD II projects also contribute to the training and education of a diverse population of university students. Students at MSU and UNH will have major responsibility for the design and implementation of the instruments and the spacecraft while at the same time being mentored by professionals in each expert area. The impact is that the fruits of this investigation will continue strongly for years, if not decades, as the twenty or more students who "cut their teeth" on this science mission become practicing scientists and engineers.</AbstractNarration>

The present award achieved its primary objectives. Objective 1 provided support for launch and, through radio frequency communications links, for in-orbit operations by a team of university students to operate the first two FIREBIRD satellites, developed under a previous award and placed into orbit around Earth on December 3, 2013. Insight gained in achieving this objective demonstrated that a very few modifications to the hardware and on-board software would add significant robustness to the operational behavior of these small satellites in the harsh environment of space. While the initial pair of satellites both operated in space and successfully measured radiation belt precipitation, REM events were not observed from the two satellites simultaneously, or nearly simultaneously.  Objective 2 of this award, therefore, provided the low level of support required to develop and launch a second pair of satellites appropriately modified based on lessons learned from operation of the initial pair.  The FIREBIRD-II satellites (see attached image) were developed and successfully launched on January 31, 2015 into an orbit significantly more favorable for passage through the REM precipitation regions that occur at high latitudes.  The satellites operated as designed making the first ever dual point measurements of REM precipitation in the first days following launch at an intersatellite separation as small as 12 kilometers.  Over the subsequent two weeks hundreds of additional microbursts were detected on both satellites, or in some cases only on one, as the satellites slowly drifted apart providing the fundamental data required to enable disambiguation of spatial from temporal variations.  Full mission success was declared two weeks after launch.  As of this writing (January 2016) the FIREBIRD-II satellites continue to operate in orbit providing unique dual satellite observations of the targeted electron microbursts and providing scientifically valuable data on other characteristics of radiation belt precipitation.  Several presentations at scientific and technical meetings have been made, with additional refereed scientific publications in preparation, providing insight into mechanisms that result in the loss of Van Allen Belt electrons through precipitation into the upper atmosphere.  In addition to technical and scientific outcomes, another major outcome of this award has been the hands-on experiential training that more than ninety STEM university students have received in the process...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
