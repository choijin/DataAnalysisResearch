<AbstractNarration>The goal of this research is to characterize how the content and depth of students? ethnographic&lt;br/&gt;investigations impact their design decisions, specifically as students define the problem,&lt;br/&gt;develop design requirements and engineering specifications, select concepts, and develop&lt;br/&gt;validation studies. Successful design solutions must be practical in the cultural context in which&lt;br/&gt;they will be used. While all engineering students are not able to participate in a substantial&lt;br/&gt;cultural immersion experience, a clear understanding of how these skills develop, the&lt;br/&gt;challenges students face, and how design ethnography affects later stages of design will&lt;br/&gt;facilitate the development and integration of these techniques into engineering design courses&lt;br/&gt;as well as the development of validated metrics to evaluate proficiency in design ethnography.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance of this research is to provide undergraduate engineering students with&lt;br/&gt;pedagogy, curricula, and experiences that teach them ethnographic and co-creation skills. The&lt;br/&gt;result will be design solutions that better address user needs for emerging global technological&lt;br/&gt;challenges. The ability of engineers to conduct ethnographic studies and use the data to make&lt;br/&gt;effective design decisions will facilitate the development of innovative, practical, and&lt;br/&gt;implementable solutions that address this century?s global challenges.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The context in which a design solution will be employed is becoming increasingly critical for engineering designers to consider because of current and future global technological challenges (e.g., health, clean water, energy). Growing in popularity, design ethnography is a methodology for developing products that are well adapted to context and culture. Design ethnography represents a set of tools used to gain a deep understanding of stakeholder behaviors and priorities through observing stakeholders in their native environments and interacting with stakeholders through semiformal and formal interviews. Design ethnography performed in stakeholders? native environments provides a host of advantages over traditional market research methodologies. A key advantage is its ability to discover needs and problems that are not otherwise obvious to the designer or even the stakeholder.  While some engineering programs have incorporated design ethnography methods and processes into curricula, studies have shown that successfully engaging with stakeholders and incorporating the information gathered through these interactions into the design process is challenging.  Prior research on students? understanding and use of data generated through stakeholder interactions during the design process showed that students do not always interact with stakeholders successfully.
