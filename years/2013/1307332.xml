<AbstractNarration>The electroweak standard model describes two of the four fundamental forces present in the universe.  By conducting experiments that probe with increasing sensitivity phenomena that can be described with this model, it is hoped discrepancies will appear that will lead to a more complete understanding of the weak interaction which is responsible for the decay, or transformation, of the neutron into a proton, electron and antineutrino.  Among the measurements that can be made involving neutron decay are correlations between the properties of the neutron and its decay products.  One of these correlations, known as little "a", involves the direction of emission of the electron and antineutrino from the decay region.  Other neutron decay correlations are known to within 1%, but little "a" is only known to 4%.  After several years of planning and construction, the aCORN ("a" CORrelation in Neutron decay) collaboration is in the process of collecting data on the fundamental physics beamline at the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Center for Neutron Research (NCNR).  This grant will provide support that will allow DePauw University undergraduate students and the Principal Investigator to continue participating in the experiment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The aCORN experiment gathered data at the NG-6 neutron beamline at the National Institute of Standards and Technology Center for Neutron Research (NCNR) to produce a precise measurement of the tendency of the electron and antineutrino from neutron decay to be emitted in a preferred relative direction.  This tendency is also known as "a".   The Principle Investigator (PI) from DePauw University was involved with initial data analysis and the construction and use of simulations to evaluate corrections that needed to be applied to the data.  Most notably the simulations involved the proton trajectories that allowed the proton detectector efficiencies to be determined and an insight as to whether or not the proton detector was aligned properly.  The PI was able to determine the correction due to imperfect proton focusing and applied this to the measured "a".  The value of "a", published recently in Physical Review Letters &ndash; PRL 119, 042502 (2017), with this correction, among others, is found to be -0.1090 +/- 0.0030 +/- 0.0028.  The errors are statistical and systematic respectively.  This value of "a" is at the present the most precise measurement.  In the summer of 2014, the PI worked with two undergraduate researchers.  Both worked with the PI on initial analysis of the NG-6 data and testing a Monte Carlo neutron generator the PI used for the proton focusing simulations.  Both students became acquainted with the statistical software package R and programming in FORTRAN and spent part of the summer with the PI at the NCNR to work on the aCORN experiment itself.  Both students were physics majors and have since graduated.  One is now working for the USDA in its Client and Technology Services department.  Another is currently a graduate student in the Duke University Medical Physics Program.  Both students had an experience working with aCORN that proves relevant to their current endeavors.             Last Modified: 08/03/2017       Submitted by: Alexander K Komives]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
