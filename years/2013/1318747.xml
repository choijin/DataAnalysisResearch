<AbstractNarration>Miami University is awarded a grant for infrastructural and equipment improvements to Lacawac Sanctuary. This project will create a year-round Aquatic Optical Analysis Laboratory by: 1) renovating Lacawac Sanctuary's Visitor Center with the addition of an analytical lab (600 square ft.) and 2) acquiring two critical core optical instruments: a UV-Vis scanning spectrophotometer and benchtop fluorometer. Both research instruments are integral to the innovative optical sensor research at Lacawac. The addition will include a chemical fume hood, a water purification system, two laboratory sinks, laboratory benches, and cabinets. Lacawac has a long history of supporting research on ultraviolet radiation impacts to lake communities and ecosystems, the development of novel aquatic optical metrics, and as a site to test emerging sensors, sensor platforms, and sensor techniques. The improvements, together with the existing expertise and goals of the Lacawac staff and its research community, will enable Lacawac to serve more effectively as a regional research and training hub for ecological observatory networks (EON). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lacawac Sanctuary (http://lacawac.org/) is an independent, non-profit field station and nature preserve founded in 1966. Lacawac is located in the Pocono Mountains of Northeastern Pennsylvania and is within 100 miles of 140 institutions of higher education. Without a field station of their own, many of these institutions depend on Lacawac as a field site for research. Lacawac also serves as a site for weekend field trips in ecology and environmental science classes for many institutions of higher education. Lacawac Sanctuary is 206 ha in area, including a 21 ha pristine natural lake (Lake Lacawac) and nearly all of its watershed, wetlands, 2 small impoundments, and stands of mixed hardwoods and hemlock. Visiting classes and researchers have access to long-term databases of physical, chemical and biological lake data, and weather and solar data. Analytical laboratory space and the two core optical instruments will allow Lacawac to increase its leadership in training students and faculty on emerging sensors, sensor deployment platforms, and other EON approaches. Through active research programs, training workshops, and websites facilitated by Lacawac, hundreds of students and faculty are reached each year in person or in the virtual world. Lacawac's large public user base and member base is reached through: 1) public programs 2) general audience articles in a quarterly newsletter, 3) website and social media sites, and 4) informational outdoor display panels and pamphlets.</AbstractNarration>
