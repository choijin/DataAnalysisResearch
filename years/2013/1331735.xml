<AbstractNarration>In this project, studies of micro-extrusion of pastes through high aspect ratio (HAR) micro-nozzles to fabricate multi-material, multi-layer (M3L) devices will be conducted. The capability for layer-by-layer fabrication with composition variation within each layer will be investigated. To provide unmatched capability for fabricating novel architecture of M3L devices not achievable today, extrusion behavior of various sizes of HAR micro-nozzles starting from millimeters all the way down to 25 micrometers will be studied. Novel three-dimensional (3D) supercapacitors with high energy densities will be used as a model system to investigate the challenges of the M3L technology. As such, extensive efforts will be made to study and establish the proper formulations of the desired pastes that can be micro-extruded using HAR micro-nozzles and have pseudoplastic characteristics to form a large layer with the desired thickness and a uniform composition. The 3D supercapacitors fabricated will be characterized structurally and electro-chemically to demonstrate the unmatched power of the M3L technology in fabricating durable, low cost, high performance devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;M3L technology will reduce part count, part handling, part transportation and part storage because only one processing step is needed. Furthermore, the M3L technology will offer new manufacturing capabilities to produce M3L devices with the composition control locally at the micrometer level for the desired functionalities and the dimension control spanning over 5 orders of magnitude for high fabrication rates. It is expected that the M3L technology proposed can compete with conventional manufacturing methods for cost effectiveness, not to mention that the M3L technology can fabricate novel devices with new functionalities, not achievable via today's manufacturing technology. This project will have a substantial impact on manufacturing technology. It can greatly improve productivity, reduce the production cost, and enhance the U.S. manufacturing competitiveness. This project will also provide an excellent education and training opportunity to one graduate student and many undergraduate students in the areas of manufacturing and alternative energy.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The overarching objective of this project is to investigate a novel concept of micro-extrusion of slurries and pastes through high aspect ratio (HAR) nozzles for additive manufacturing. The advantage of HAR nozzles over the circular nozzles widely used today in additive manufacturing is their ability to deposit a single layer in one micro-extrusion operation, whereas several-hundred printing operations are needed to create a layer if circular nozzles are used. Figure 1 compares a plane with an area of 32 x 30 cm<sup>2</sup> micro-extruded using a circular nozzle versus using a HAR nozzle. It can be seen that 150 micro-extrusion operations are required to deposit the plane for the circular nozzle machine, whereas only three micro-extrusion operations are needed using the HAR nozzle machine. As such, fabrication productivity has been increased by 50 times in this particular case. Conventional manufacturing methods in making multi-material, multi-layer devices, such as solid oxide fuel cells, multi-layer ceramic capacitors, resistor-capacitor, inductor-capacitor, and varistor-capacitor multilayer combinations, are tape casting followed by cutting, punching, stacking, binder burnout, and sintering. When compared with conventional manufacturing methods, additive manufacturing using HAR nozzles can eliminate cutting, punching and stacking operations and at the same time reduce part count, part handling, part transportation and part storage because only one fabrication step is needed. Therefore, micro-extrusion using HAR nozzles could be cost effective even in comparison with conventional manufacturing methods.</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> We have investigated major micro-extrusion parameters for using HAR nozzles and established quantitative relationships between the quality of micro-extruded layer(s) and the micro-extrusion conditions using HAR nozzles. It is shown that the major micro-extrusion parameters are the aspect ratio of HAR nozzles, extrusion rate, nozzle moving speed, and distance between the nozzle tip and the substrate during micro-extrusion. A quantitative formulation has been developed to link the quality of micro-extruded layer(s) to each of these micro-extrusion parameters. Three key issues encountered in micro-extrusion using HAR nozzles have been revealed: (i) under-filling and over-filling, (ii) transition regions at the beginning, ending and sharp turns, and (iii) air bubbles trapped in extrudates. Solutions to each of these issues have been investigated and established.</p> <p><strong>Boarder Impacts:</strong> The knowledge created in this project can be utilized by scientific community and industry to fabricate multi-material, multi-layer devices with high productivity at low costs in the future. A US patent application has been filed as the first step towards commercialization of the HAR technology. This NSF project has also provided education and research training to multiple graduate students in the areas of additive manufacturing, material processing, and microstructural characterization. Further, we have been active in outreach to general public, promoting science and engineering and encouraging high school students to pursue careers involving science, engineering and technology. Specifically, we have worked with ASM International Chicago Chapter for the last three years to provide introductions and lab tours to middle/high school teachers during the ASM International Summer Teacher Camps in Chicago. Each year the Summer Teacher Camp has about 20 to 25 teachers who have become our ambassadors to spread the impact of science and technology on society and to stimulate the interest of middle and high school students in pursuing careers involving science, engineering and technology. In summer 2016 we also worked with the Chicago Zoological Society to carry out lab tours and demonstrations, showing how batteries are fabricated to about 300 diverse middle and high school students from across the Chicago metro area as part of "Summer 2016 Teen Conservation Leadership Conference". This three-day conference has featured presentations on a variety of topics from industry experts, college professors and students as well as fellow teen&nbsp;participants of the Chicago Zoological Society's King Conservation Science program.
