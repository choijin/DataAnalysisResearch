<AbstractNarration>This action funds Jesse P. Angle of The University of California at Irvine to conduct a research project in Engineering during the summer of 2013 in the Crystal Interface Laboratory at The University of Tokyo in Tokyo, Japan. The project title is "In-situ Transmission Electron Microscopy Indentation to Characterize Deformation in Ceramics." The host scientist is Professor Yuichi Ikuhara. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on determining the deformation mechanism in a widely used ceramic material, mullite. Even with its uses in the aerospace and electronics industries, many of the essential mechanical properties of this material still remain unknown and by understanding the fundamental deformation mechanism of slip, both the slip direction and slip-system, a complete characterization of the mechanical properties of mullite can be achieved. In order to observe the dislocation formation necessary to study the slip system of mullite, an in-situ Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) piezo actuator controlled nano indenter is used to form indentations on the surface of a single crystal mullite sample to create plastic deformation region and create localized dislocations. By analyzing the reciprocal lattice vector (g) of the planes that diffract electrons under a two-beam condition (meaning one set of planes satisfies Bragg's Law), the Burgers vector (b) of the dislocation can be characterized. Matching this slip direction to the orientation of the crystal, the slip plane and thus the slip system can be determined. Understanding the limits of commonly used materials, allows the design, manufacture and implementation of critical engineering compounds with a much higher degree of success and reliability. This project has potential to see direct impact in the aerospace and electronics sectors where material advances drive the industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, results of this project will be disseminated at conferences and in presentations, and will enhance scientific understanding in the form of journal publications. Being active in both academic and research focused outreach groups, this EAPSI Fellow plans to share his experiences in the NSF EASPI program by showing students, graduate and undergraduate, how international collaboration can be beneficial to their careers as scientists and engineers.</AbstractNarration>
