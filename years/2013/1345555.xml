<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project proposes to develop a novel method to combat Erwinia amylovora (Ea), a causative agent of fire blight. Fire blight has emerged as the most devastating disease of apple and pear trees worldwide. Many growers apply streptomycin or oxytetracycline multiple times during bloom and following plant injuries to prevent the growth of Ea. Resistant strains have been isolated and resistance is expected to proliferate directly in the human food chain. Here we propose to replace these antibiotics with the microscopic predators of bacteria, slime molds, which are benign to humans, animals, and plants. As advancement in agriculture, bacterial predators represent a new proprietary biocontrol approach. Whereas the proposed project will focus on reducing orchard carriage of Ea, the general approach should be extensible to treating agricultural infections and contaminations of many other species of bacterial pathogens. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be a novel method for the treatment bacterial infections in fruit and vegetable crops.  Among fruit crops grown commercially in the U.S., apples and pears rank third in terms of area in production and utilized value. A pressing issue driving the need for an alternative to current treatments is the inevitable ban on the use of clinical antibiotics in agriculture. For organic orchardists, this ban will take effect in 2014, and will leave a significant gap in the marketplace. From a timing perspective, this gives agrochemical industry an immediate opportunity to fill this gap and gain quick acceptance of predator-based new technology. Furthermore, many agricultural diseases demand the development of fundamentally new treatments effective against biofilm-encased bacteria, which are refractory to antibiotics. Alarmingly, there is currently no single treatment that can efficiently kill biofilms even though the incidence of reoccurring infections indicate that biofilms exist in orchards throughout the world. Antibiotics typically kill only growing cells whereas predators we will harness can consume bacteria whether the bacteria are free-living or biofilm-encased. The $300M apple/pear market is the first target market for predator-based biocontrol. Future markets including citrus, grapes, and vegetables, will bring the total addressable agricultural market alone to &gt;$1B.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Award Title: SBIR Phase I: Biological      treatment of orchards to combat fire blight (Erwina amylovora) Federal Award ID: 1345555   AmebaGone is developing a platform for production of novel biopesticides in dried, shelf-stable form using a hitherto unexploited organism found in soil called Dictyostelids ("Dicty"). Dicty have evolved for &gt;600 million years to eat and kill bacteria.  They are natural predators of bacteria, including Erwinia amylovora (E.a.), the causative agent of Fire Blight (FB), an agricultural disease that plagues apple and pear trees worldwide.     Significantly, greater than 90% of the worldÆs agricultural antibiotic use is aimed at control of FB.  Organic growers suffer higher losses as there are no good alternatives to antibiotics to control this disease.  Driving the need for alternatives to current treatments is the 2014 ban on use of clinically significant antibiotics on organic apples and pears. This gives AmebaGone an immediate opportunity to fill a market need and gain quick acceptance of its novel Dicty-based technology. In addition to E.a., there are similar bacterial plant pathogens causing significant economic losses in corn and citrus fruit crops, among others.  Our approach is extensible to treating these agricultural infections and contaminations. Importantly, it appears extensible to treating other bacterial pathogens in animals and humans, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).     The use of pre-packaged Dicty spores to combat FireBlight and other infections in plants, animals and humans is an elegant solution.  Dicty are present in soils everywhere, are non-pathogenic, pose no known risk to the environment, and can be used as a green, stand-alone treatment that may eventually replace extensive use of antibiotics. Importantly, they destroy free-living bacteria and biofilm-encased bacterial communities that are highly resistant to disinfectants and antibiotics.  Thus, our approach provides a novel means to combatting the overuse of antibiotics in plants, animals and humans to treat a variety of disease-causing pathogens.  Dicty spores are inert until activated.  In dried form they have a long shelf-life, making them suitable for packaging and shipping.      AmebaGone has investigated many different strains of Dicty for their ability to consume E.a. both in Petri dishes and on apple flowers, where Fire Blight infections are thought to start. We have identified multiple strains that effectively kill E.a. growing in petri dishes as free living cells and biofilm-protected cells (Figure 1; Top row, milky E.a.  bacteria evenly covering the Petri dishes.  Bottom row, Dicty (WS 20 strain) spores were placed in the center of the dish, and consumption of E.a. leads to a clearing of the bacteria that appears slightly darker as you can see through the media where the bacteria were eaten. Also, as the Dicty grow, they make more spores that appear as wispy cotton-like structures on the surface of the Petri dish.). Importantly, these strains also consume E.a. on apple flowers, and we found one strain that cleared more than 99% of the bacteria.     Based on the outcomes of our Phase I work, AmebaGone is now in confidential talks with a potential partner at a major agricultural supply firm about testing the efficacy of Dicty spores to validate the efficacy shown in UW-Madison and AmebaGone labs.
