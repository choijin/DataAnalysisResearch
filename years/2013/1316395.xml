<AbstractNarration>One powerful way we can learn about the ancient history of Earth and other bodies in the solar system is through study of the magnetization of planetary materials. Earth's internally-generated magnetic field is a defining characteristic of our planet that shields us from dangerous solar particles. When rocks form, they can record both the direction and strength of magnetic fields as a magnetization that can be preserved for potentially billions of years. Ongoing research in the Earth and planetary sciences seeks to understand whether the magnetization of extraterrestrial materials (including lunar rocks and meteorites) are the result of long-lived fields internally-generated by planetary bodies, or transient magnetic fields generated by impacts.  One of the processes advanced as an explanation of sometimes enigmatic magnetizations observed on planetary surfaces, as well as in lunar and meteorite samples, is known as shock remanent magnetization. Meteorite impacts lead to high pressures and the short duration shock can lead to the acquisition of new magnetization in the presence of a magnetic field. This context provides strong motivation to understand shock magnetization within impact basins on Earth both in relation to its acquisition from Earth?s internally-generated field as well as potential impact-generated fields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most suggestive evidence for the presence of naturally occurring shock remanent magnetization (SRM) on Earth is from the ca. 30 km diameter Slate Islands impact structure in northern Lake Superior where there is a pervasive magnetic overprint. Advances in the understanding of SRM acquisition, in the analytical and theoretical framework of thermochronometry and of the geology of the Slate Islands impact structure and shock pressures recorded therein, make this an excellent time to test the hypothesis that the secondary magnetization within the Slate Islands is an SRM. We also seek to evaluate whether the putative shock-induced remanence is consistent with resulting from the Earth's geodynamo field or if it may record a transient impact-induced field. Stepped heating thermochronometry combined with detailed characterization of natural remanent magnetization and rock magnetic experiments on samples from high to low shock levels across the structure will help us determine if the magnetic overprint is the result of shock, or whether it could have originated as a thermal overprint from impact-related heating. This project will provide early-career training for a postdoctoral researcher and research experience for several undergraduate students. An outreach component of this project will be to generate content related to impact craters for ChronoZoom. ChronoZoom is a dynamic interactive online database that allows for the visualization of Earth history on all timescales (www.chronozoomproject.org).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Significant research efforts focus on using rocks from the surfaces of Earth and other planets to learn about the history of planetary magnetic fields. Earth's magnetic field deflects damaging particles that come from the sun and has thereby played a crucial role in the evolution of life and the habitability of our planet. Researchers are deeply interested in the histories of magnetic fields on Earth, on the Moon, on other planets and on proto-planets that are now broken up into asteroids. The magnetic properties of rocks are invaluable tools for such research because they are capable of recording the strength and direction of any magnetic fields that were present at the time when they formed. However, these magnetic properties can be modified by subsequent processes that lead to high temperatures, high pressures or chemical reactions that create new magnetic minerals. One of the most significant processes in the evolution of the surface of planets that can cause such changes are impact cratering events. Impact craters form on Earth and on other planets when meteors strike the surface at very high speeds. One of the ways magnetic properties are thought to be modified during an impact cratering event is by the passage of the shock wave that occurs right after a meteor strikes&mdash;which may result in what is known as a shock remanent magnetization. While this type of modification can be experimentally produced in the lab, conclusive identifications of it in nature are rare to nonexistent. The most suggestive evidence for naturally-occurring shock remanent magnetization on Earth comes from the 20 mile wide Slate Islands Impact Structure. The center of this crater rises above the surface of Lake Superior as islands. This research project sought to better understand the processes of the impact event and pinpoint the mechanism responsible for the observed change to magnetic properties of rocks in the Slate Islands. To do this research, we went to the impact structure to study its geology and collect samples for analysis back in the laboratory. Samples from inside and outside of the crater were analyzed and subjected to a variety of magnetic experiments primarily in the UC Berkeley Paleomagnetism lab. In addition, we used computer models to simulate the impact event and contextualize the results of our experiments.</p> <p>The two most significant findings to come out of this research are that: (1) We determined that broken-up rocks known as breccias that formed at the time of the impact had their magnetic directions completely reset by being exposed to very high temperatures during the impact. The uniform directions we measured from these breccias, in conjunction with modeling the cooling rates of these breccias just after they formed, allowed us to determine that the main structure of the crater formed very rapidly---in a matter of minutes following the initial impact. (2) We determined that heating from the impact shock wave and the transport of hotter rocks from far under the surface during the formation of the crater led to the recording of a thermally-induced magnetic overprint from the time of the impact within rocks that survived the impact largely intact. Our experiments also revealed that shock remanent magnetization does not generally lead to strong overprints. This interpretation that impact-related heating rather than physical disturbances following the passage of the shock wave led to the magnetic overprint in the Slate Islands Impact Structure adds to a growing body of evidence that shock remanent magnetization is rarely preserved. In aggregate, these results will also guide future interpretations of impact-related magnetism observed within other craters on the Earth, the Moon, Mercury, and beyond.</p> <p>This project provided training for a postdoctoral researcher and multiple students (at the undergraduate level and graduate level) at UC Berkeley. It also supported the development of the new UC Berkeley paleomagnetism laboratory and the research programs of the early-career Principal Investigator. The researchers partnered with Wilderness Classroom while in the field to develop materials that broadly shared the science that was conducted in the Slate Islands.
