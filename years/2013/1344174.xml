<AbstractNarration>This INSPIRE award is patially funded by PRIME in the Directorate for Education and Human Resourses and REE in the Directorate for Engineering. The overall goal of the project is to create theoretical and assessment models of 21st century competencies as they relate to engineering and computer science. The PIs are conducting research and a domain analysis to establish domains within the context of Engineering Design and Computer Science Principles. The domain analysis and models provide the foundation for developing assessment frameworks in general research, education, engineering, and computer science communities. Developed models will lay the groundwork for the greater research community to develop and test human and automated methods to effectively and efficiently assess a range of competencies through portfolio and assignment analyses.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is its potential to advance interdisciplinary evaluation and assessment and inform the field about new methodologies. The research will create a foundation for automated scoring by developing a framework to systematically dissect student work documented within an e-portfolio or computer science work assignment&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will address broader impacts and benefit society through the development of assessments that are universally designed, thus impacting a broad range of learners.  The research will address real gaps in portfolio-based assessment systems that currently lack comprehensive and standardized methods to assess 21st century skills.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report of NSF 052913  INSPIRE  The Development Diagnostic Assessment Strategies for e portfolios based on the alignment of the Design Process Rubric to 21st Century Knowledge, Skills and Abilities (KSAs)     INSPIRE (NSF 052913) built upon three prior (NSF PRIME DPL -1119110; NSF EEC &ndash; 0743029 AND NSF EEC -1009823) that focused on developing a model for defining and assessing student attainment of Engineering Design (ED) knowledge, skills and abilities (KSAs).  The purpose of the body of work to which INSPIRE research contributed was to advance efforts to create valid, reliable and scalable measurement of ED that could lead to a universal credential in ED.  The body of research drew from the disciplines of educational measurement, engineering and computer science and involved a large and diverse group of researchers and practicing professionals in engineering and education.      Intellectual Merit:   The work conducted under INSPIRE focused in three broad areas: 1.Classify and model key Engineering Design skills and competences to develop consensus around a set of core competencies and performance descriptors that could be mapped over a range of students’ representations in the context of project-based portfolios through performance based assessments (i.e., portfolios).; 2) Improve the efficiency and reliability of scoring project-based design portfolios and 3) Develop and pilot effective professional learning activities for high school and teachers in analyze student assignments in terms of the specific Engineering Design domain models.     The scoring tool, The Engineering Design Portfolio Project Scoring Rubric (EDPPSR), previously developed under NSF PRIME DPL -111in collaboration with Project Lead the Way (PLTW) was the foundation of INSPIRE. Specifically, the lack of "standardization" in the PLTW student portfolio pointed to a need for both content or domain and performance "standards" that could define introductory ED and be systematically and reliably assessed. Ultimately the intent was to lay the groundwork for a standard "universally" recognized credential that could be accepted for undergraduate credit in engineering programs. Also developed under PRIME as part of the effort to make teacher scoring of student portfolios more efficient and reliable was a beta version of MyDesign Learning Management System that incorporated the key categories of the EDPPSR.     Impacts     INSPIRE was an ambitious project that was conducted simultaneously in three tracks: One strand focused on gaining broad stakeholder consensus about the design content domains and performance expectations; concurrently, the EDPPSR tool and MyDesign tool required refinement to increase usability among high school teachers by simplifying the scoring rubric and enhancing features such as increasing number of third-party applications and longitudinal student tracking and 3) Developing professional development "modules" for high school teachers that would build teachers’ knowledge of Engineering design through use of the EDPSSR and MyDesign.     A draft "Engineering Design Curricular Framework" that defined the key knowledge domains and key measurable descriptors was developed by convening experts and practitioners in education, engineering and workforce development, alignment with the Next Generation Science Standards and introductory engineering design syllabi.      Continued development and testing of MyDesign increased student applications and demonstrated that the platform had the capability to collect and map a student’s design portfolio to specific engineering knowledge domains and performance descriptors.  An automated scoring system was explored involving "tagging" small bits of student representations of key design content.        Professional development using both online and face to face sessions began with high school teachers selected from 4 school systems in MD. Teachers practiced using the MyDesign platform and assessment rubrics and implemented in selected classrooms. Ultimately over 30 teachers from 3 states participated in the pilot professional learning. Feedback from these users resulted in creation of separate versions of the MyDesign platform, a student version and a teacher version.  Teacher pilot tests further reinforced the need to simplify the EDPPSR language and scoring process.  Icons and visual representations were substituted for some text and artifact/data organization was simplified. Even with a simplified EDPPSR, scoring proved to be a very time intensive process that could also be subjective.     Recommendations for further refinement of the EDPPSR and were obtained from two performance assessment experts.
