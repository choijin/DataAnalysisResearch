<AbstractNarration>This program will study particle energization and radiation in relativistic jets and accretion flows.  It will apply particle-in-cell (PIC) kinematic simulations to astrophysics, in particular to the shear flow boundary layer in gamma ray bursts and quasar jets, and to the magneto-rotational instabilities in low-luminosity active galactic nuclei. The goal is to enhance magneto-hydrodynamic computer codes to include `subgrid physics'.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students, and development of advanced simulation methods that will be useful across many disciplines, from astrophysics to laser plasma interactions and fusion.  High school students will be mentored during the summer.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report for NSF grant AST1313129  Particle Energization and Radiation in Relativistic Jets and Accretion Flows     This project investigates magnetic field generation, particle energization and radiation in astrophysical jets in the context of relativistic shear flows.  In classical hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), the shear flow interface is unstable against the Kelvin Helmholtz instability, leading to the development of vortical turbulence, which cascades down to the smallest scales and thermalizes into heat.  Past MHD simulations show that dissipation via MHD turbulence in the boundary layer persists in the relativistic regime.  However, the turbulent magnetic fields saturate at a low level, with the magnetic energy density much less than one percent of the kinetic energy.  This picture changes fundamentally and dramatically when the fluid is replaced by a collisionless plasma, where the ions and electrons interact only through their collective electromagnetic fields, while individual Coulomb encounters can be ignored. Collisionless plasmas are best modeled using particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations.  Over the past three years, we modeled the microphysics of relativistic shear flows using PIC codes and explored their applications to astrophysical jets.  Because electrons are lighter and more mobile than ions, they easily stray from one side of the shear flow onto the opposing flow, while ions stay on straight paths.  The stray electrons cancel part of the electron current comoving with the ion current, leading to the development of net currents on both sides of the shear boundary. This generates magnetic fields transverse to the flow.  Such seed magnetic fields then deflect more electrons to the other side, enhancing the net currents on both sides and strengthening the transverse field.  This robust electron counter-current instability (ECCI) eventually leads to the formation of a slab of monopolar or dc magnetic field along the entire shear boundary.   Magnetic pressure from the slab field pushes the ions away from the shear interface, creating an ion vacuum gap.  But the more mobile electrons are not fully evacuated at the interface, leading to the formation of three separate charge layers: two ion-dominated positive layers sandwiching an electron-dominated negative layer.  This "triple layer" gives rise to strong electrostatic fields orthogonal to the magnetic field.  The crossed E, B fields together trap electrons near the shear boundary, forcing them into "bounce" trajectories, while accelerating them along the flow direction due to parallel electric fields induced by &part;B/&part;t.  The bulk of the boundary electrons eventually get accelerated to the ion energy.   At late times, electromagnetic fields account for about 12% of the total energy, while ions and electrons each account for about 40 - 45%.  This picture of a dc field-dominated  shear boundary layer is robust when we vary the initial bulk flow speed, plasma density and temperature, transition layer thickness etc.  In contrast to the MHD picture, no turbulent mixing occurs between the opposing flows after many light crossing times of our simulation box.  When electron-positron plasma is added to the electron-ion plasma, nonlinear electromagnetic waves develop in the zones just outside the boundary layer.  These waves scatter the electrons and positrons to form a power-law tail, resembling the power-law tails observed in the astrophysical jets of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and Gamma-ray bursts (GRB). The highest energy electrons are narrowly beamed along the shear boundary, with beam angles much smaller than Doppler boosting of isotropic sources in the comoving frame.  Such narrow beaming may explain some of the unsolved mysteries associated with AGN and GRB emissions, such as rapid variability.  When the bulk flow Lorentz factor is increased, the boundary layer gets wider, the fields get stronger, the electrons get more energetic and more narrowly beamed.  However, shear flows between electron-positron and electron-ion plasmas show less beaming when observed in the electron-positron plasma frame.   We have made some attempts to apply the above PIC simulation results to model the observed high-energy emissions of AGNs and GRBs.  The models for GRB prompt emissions seem to work reasonably well for long bursts.  The models for AGN jets seem to work for AGNs with low-frequency synchrotron peaks (LBL), but not for AGNs with high-frequency synchrotron peaks (HBL).  In future works, we will continue to investigate the radiation processes of shear boundary layers using PIC simulation results, and confront them with astrophysical data.  We will also attempt to bridge the microphysics of PIC simulation with the macrophysics of non-ideal MHD simulations using new hybrid algorithms.  During the course of this 3-year research, we have provided training to one postdoctoral fellow, two graduate students, and several undergraduate students, in both plasma physics and high-performance computing.  We have made several movies of PIC simulations for public consumption.   PI also gave public talks to nearby schools, colleges and the Houston Astronomical Society.  Movies, powerpoint presentations and journal publications related to this NSF-supported research are available for download from our website: http://spacibm.rice.edu/~liang/picsim.
