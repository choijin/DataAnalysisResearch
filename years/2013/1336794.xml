<AbstractNarration>CBET - 1336794&lt;br/&gt;Overview:&lt;br/&gt;The PIs seek to develop methodology to quantify, fingerprint, and distinguish natural and engineered&lt;br/&gt;carbonaceous nanoparticles using thermal separation techniques and metal content signatures.&lt;br/&gt;Building on well-established thermal methods to quantify black carbon (BC) soot, the PIs&lt;br/&gt;propose a technique that distinguishes non-nanoparticulate natural organic matter, single-walled&lt;br/&gt;carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), and BC (the most ubiquitous, natural carbonaceous nanoparticle)&lt;br/&gt;based on their distinct thermal stabilities. Preliminary results suggest that natural organic&lt;br/&gt;matter, SWCNTs, and BC have unique oxidation ranges and could be distinguished and quantified&lt;br/&gt;following sequential oxidations coupled with elemental analysis. Here, we aim to demonstrate&lt;br/&gt;that these thermal stabilities are preserved in complex mixtures of air, water, sediments,&lt;br/&gt;and soil, and as a result, can be used to quantitatively delineate the nanoparticles (e.g.,&lt;br/&gt;natural vs. engineering) in environmental matrices. Furthermore, bulk metal contents determined&lt;br/&gt;via complete acid digestion and mass spectrometry should provide a route toward source apportionment.&lt;br/&gt;Advantages of this approach include the low cost, accessibility, high-throughput capabilities,&lt;br/&gt;and minimal sample processing (e.g., extraction) required for this method, which reduces the&lt;br/&gt;potential for analyte loss and transformation during analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit :&lt;br/&gt;The National Research Council 2012 EHS Nanotechnology Research Strategy report listed analytical&lt;br/&gt;techniques as the first research priority. Current approaches for measuring carbonaceous&lt;br/&gt;nanoparticles (CNPs) in the work place (and atmosphere) primarily rely on light-scattering&lt;br/&gt;particle sizers, which provide a bulk measure of nano-sized particles. However, as synthetic&lt;br/&gt;approaches to form engineered carbonaceous nanoparticles (i.e, carbon nanotubes and graphene)&lt;br/&gt;are known to co-produce natural nanoparticles (i.e., soot), current results are reporting&lt;br/&gt;natural plus engineered nanoparticle exposure. Thus, it is not possible to quantitatively&lt;br/&gt;determine occupational exposure to engineered nanoparticles. In addition, there are no methods&lt;br/&gt;to assess release of engineered nanoparticles to the atmosphere, which is a likely vector&lt;br/&gt;for CNP transport to the environment. This has severe consequences for ongoing nanoparticle&lt;br/&gt;research: (1) fate models lack validated source data, (2) occupational exposure can be neither&lt;br/&gt;assessed nor enforced, and (3) environmental release can not be mitigated where necessary.&lt;br/&gt;Upon project completion, quantitatively differentiation of natural and engineered carbonaceous&lt;br/&gt;nanoparticles (NPs) will be possible for the first time, allowing accurate assessment of exposure&lt;br/&gt;to engineered NPs, which have unique properties, morphologies, and toxicities compared to&lt;br/&gt;natural NPs. These goals are within the team?s reach and rely on affordable, accessible technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts :&lt;br/&gt;The PIs and their research groups are actively involved in the outreach efforts hosted by&lt;br/&gt;the Center for the Environmental Implications of Nano-technology (CEINT) at Duke University,&lt;br/&gt;as well as other science enrichment activities there, including Females Excelling More in&lt;br/&gt;Math Engineering and Science (FEMMES) (100% females from underrepresented groups) volunteer&lt;br/&gt;science workshops. As part of the proposed work, the PIs will establish a nano-analytical&lt;br/&gt;K-12 education module (Is CSI for real? Rapid Nano-forensics?), and this will be taught as&lt;br/&gt;part of NanoDays, FEMMES, and later distributed to the CEINT network of K-12 educators. Additionally,&lt;br/&gt;the program will be modified for a more advanced audience (e.g., public library and senior&lt;br/&gt;center), delivered live, and videotaped for web distribution.</AbstractNarration>
