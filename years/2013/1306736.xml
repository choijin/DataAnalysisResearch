<AbstractNarration>All astrophysical and cosmological data now point convincingly to a large component of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) in the Universe, but a dark matter particle has yet to be directly detected.  A well-motivated possible candidate is a light axion.  Should axions constitute the dark matter of our Milky Way halo, they may be detected through their conversion into a narrow microwave signal by an apparatus consisting of a microwave cavity resonator permeated by a magnetic field.  Using this concept the Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX) has performed a search for such axions within the mass range of a few micro-eV.  Recently a smaller microwave cavity experiment was constructed called ADMX-HF (High Frequency), specifically to explore higher ranges of axion masses.  ADMX-HF also serves as a test-bed for innovations in microwave cavity and amplifier technologies that could be migrated to the larger ADMX platform.  ADMX-HF and ADMX operate as "one experiment, two sites", sharing expertise, technology, and data.  This award will expand the collaboration to accelerate the construction of ADMX-HF as well as dramatically expand its initial capability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  ADMX has proven to be a technology driver as components such as the SQUID amplifiers developed for ADMX are already being used for other purposes.  Innovations to be developed by ADMX-HF have similarly broad potential.  Both PI and Co-PI are committed educators with long experience in involving undergraduate students in their research and engaging the public.  The research funded through this award will inform additional education and outreach initiatives with which they are involved.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Surprisingly, 80% of the matter in the universe is composed of some unknown substance. With certainty, we know only that this "dark matter" attracts other matter via gravity but otherwise must interact with ordinary matter only very weakly. A hypothetical particle called the axion is a good candidate for composing the dark matter.  This project contributed to the construction of a new instrument that searches for the axion particle. Specifically, the axion hypothesis implies that these exotic particles can be converted into feeble microwave-frequency electrical signals inside a specially designed metal enclosure called a "cavity." We built and installed the extraordinarily sensitive detectors of microwave-frequency electricity for the axion search apparatus. They are currently acquiring data and performing well.  The apparatus searches by adjusting its cavity to be resonant at a certain frequency and waiting for a time sufficient either to detect the axion or to be confident of its absence at that frequency. This process is repeated many times to cover a range of frequencies. The exceptional sensitivity of the amplifiers fabricated as part of this project greatly reduce the time required to cover a range of frequency. These detectors, known as Josephson Parametric Amplifiers (JPAs), were originally developed in the effort to process information in an essentially quantum manner.    The primary achievements of this project are:  1.) enabling the first high-sensitivity search for axions in the scientifically promising 4 - 8 GHz region.  2.) the first use of quantum of information technology in a fundamental particle search experiment.
