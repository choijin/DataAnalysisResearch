<AbstractNarration>Matrix-variate models provide a way to analyze complex multivariate datasets in which meaningful relationships may exist among both the variables and among the observed units.  This is an extension of the more standard setting of multivariate statistical analysis, in which the variables are dependent, but the observations are viewed as being independent.  The primary motivation for treating the data as a single high-dimensional sample is the potential for increased power when estimating parameters that are sensitive to relationships among the experimental units.  Recent advances in high-dimensional non-asymptotic theory, convex analysis, and algorithms allow such models to be fit to the very large data sets that arise in critical scientific areas such as genomics and neuroscience.  A major goal of this project is to assess the extent to which accounting for relationships among samples allows more accurate estimates to be made of relationships among variables.  An example of how this might be applied is in the assessment of associations between rare genetic variants and a phenotype.  The Sequential Kernel Association Test (SKAT) uses a kernel matrix which is essentially a covariance matrix of the genetic features.  The investigators will evaluate the use of the covariance matrix obtained from the recently-proposed Gemini approach to matrix-variate analysis as a kernel for the SKAT procedure. Three scientific applications have been identified to which the Gemini framework may be usefully extended.  In addition to conceptual and algorithmic challenges, these applications require the theory and methodology for the Gemini estimators to cover new settings, for example, due to SNP genotypes being highly non-Gaussian, and due to brain connectivity graphs changing over time.  The investigators will adapt the baseline Gemini models and algorithms to these new settings, and study their statistical and computational properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent technological breakthroughs in instrumentation allow large and detailed data sets describing living systems to be efficiently collected.  Researchers in biology and health science have embraced these technologies, but have sometimes been frustrated by the fact that such data must be interpreted conservatively, to guard against making non-reproducible claims.  Research progress would be accelerated if it were possible to analyze such data in a way that provides more statistical power, without expensive increases in the sample size.  One path to doing this is to move beyond the paradigm of treating the observed units in a study (e.g. human research subjects or laboratory animals) independently.  The investigator and his colleagues have developed a new type of statistical procedure that uses inferred relationships among the units of observation to more accurately estimate physical and biological unknowns.  They plan to develop the theory behind their technique, to develop software for carrying out the analyses, and to work with scientists in cancer biology, genomics, and neuroscience to assess the potential for using this approach to obtain novel scientific insights.  The project will focus on three scientific problems: identification of DNA lesions involved with cancer incidence and progression, identification of inherited genetic variants associated with human diseases, and characterization of neural connectivity changes induced by changes in consciousness state.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many forms of scientific data, especially those resulting from contemporary types of assays and sensors, contain large numbers of inter-related parameters, for example, parameters characterizing a physical or biological system.  This type of data often exists at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and exhibits very little independent replication of the form assumed by many classical statistical procedures for data analysis.  In this project, we have developed and evaluated multiple novel methods for analyzing large-scale data with this characteristic. 1) Undirected graphs can be used to describe matrix variate distributions. In this project, we developed new methods for estimating graphical structures and their underlying parameters, namely, the row and column covariance and inverse covariance matrices, from matrix variate data. In a foundational work,  we show under sparsity conditions that one is able to recover the graphs and covariance matrices with a single observed matrix from the matrix-variate distribution.  We establish consistency and obtain the rates of convergence in the operator and the Frobenius norms. Although replicates are not required, our method extends to the setting with replicates, where we show that the replicates allow one to estimate more complicated graphical structures and achieve faster rates of convergence. One subsequent important contribution is a new method for jointly estimating the two-group mean structure and covariance matrices of matrix variate data with no replication.  Our theoretical work on joint mean/covariance estimation is the first that considers covariance estimation in the presence of unknown mean structure (to the best of our knowledge).    As an application of this theory and methodology, we considered the way in which unmodeled dependencies can produce misleading evidence for mean differences, including increasing the likelihood of false positive (non-reproducible) findings.  Thus, our method provides fundamental insights into one possible root cause of non-reproducibility, and provides a rigorous method for addressing it.  We illustrated the applicability of our approach to this issue by considering the challenging problem of identifying biomarkers for ulcerative colitis. 2) In the context of errors-in-variables regression with dependent data, we have developed a model using the Kronecker sum structure. This model is substantially different from those analyzed in the existing literature, in the sense that we allow the measurement error for each covariate to be a dependent vector across its n observations. This work was motivated by a challenging problem in neuroscience where the goal is to identify "neural encoding" -- associations between neural firing and behavior that may reflect the basic neurological mechanism of the behavior.  Such correlations have proven difficult to characterize, partly due to difficulties in accurately measuring complex behaviors that are often of interest in neural encoding studies.  To address this from a statistical perspective, we asked whether the behavioral data could be separated into two components, one of which is primarily noise.  If this is possible, then the true neural encoding relationship is obscured by this noise. We also developed a unified framework for dealing with computational and statistical aspects of nonconvex loss functions and possibly nonconvex penalties under complex data dependencies, missing values and time varying covariance structures. We have proved rates of convergence using first-order methods, while deriving sharp statistical convergence rates using random matrix theory.  3) For analyzing time-varying dynamical space-time data, we have developed an additive model that splits the data into a temporally correlated component and a spatially correlated component. We then modeled the spatially correlated portion using a time-varying Gaussian graphical model. Under assumptions on the smoothness of changes in the graphical model structure, we derived strong single sample convergence results, confirming our ability to estimate meaningful graphical models as they evolve in time. We apply our methodology to  discover time-varying spatial structure in human brain fMRI images.  Finally,  we have developed a novel tensor graphical Lasso estimator for estimating multi-way dependencies for tensor data, based on parsimoniously modeling the precision matrices based on the Cartesian product of graphs; statistical and computational convergence properties for the estimator have also been derived.  We applied this model and method to analyze climate data.   The line of work produced from the current grant has made fundamental contributions in developing new models, methods, algorithms, and theoretical foundations for analyzing data with complex dependency as elaborated above. The results are of interest to other disciplines; for example, concentration of measure bounds based on subgaussian distributions, including novel sparse analogs of the Hanson-Wright inequalities have been derived in various contexts of our project.   When we apply this methodology to the neuro-encoding analysis as mentioned above,  we obtain insights about the performance of the approach, leading to rates of convergence that justify its use in many practical neuroscience experiments.  These projects provided training opportunities for five graduate students in statistical and computational theory, methods and data analysis.  Three Ph.D. theses incorporate work from the projects described above.             Last Modified: 10/30/2017       Submitted by: Kerby A Shedden]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
