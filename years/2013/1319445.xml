<AbstractNarration>This Cyberlearning: Transforming Education project brings together leading-edge researchers in computational linguistics and computer-supported collaborative learning to explore feasibility issues in designing an intelligent conversational agent that interacts with groups of learners as they are working together and provides cognitive, meta-cognitive, and social advice to enhance their collaborations. The conversational agent is being designed to enhance group dynamics by providing supportive advice as well as promoting awareness of the dynamics.  Design of the agent is informed by theories of meta-cognition, collaborative learning, and accountable talk. In addition to investigating how to design such agents and testing their effectiveness, investigators are exploring how learning develops when a conversational agent is available to help with productive talk, the influences of conversational behaviors on developing understanding and actions, and ways of influencing understanding and behaviors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the biggest limitations of online education, especially massive online courses (e.g., MOOCs), is personal contact with instructors and peers. While much of formal education focuses on faculty interactions with large groups of students in lectures, much student learning depends on interactions with teachers and teaching assistants and discussions, study sessions, and project work done with peers. Massive online education will be broadly successful only after we know how to provide these kinds of supports to online learners.  This project focuses on designing an interactive agent that can provide conversational support for small groups of collaborating students to help them productively solve problems and learn together.  The agent is being designed to provide the kinds of advice that a teacher or teaching assistant would provide if such a human mentor were available. The researchers conjecture that with such support available, online students can provide for each other the kinds of social supports for learning that contribute in integral ways to students' learning experiences in higher education. The agent is being deployed and tested in several different online courses. Results are expected to be applicable to massive online education as well as to blended educational environments such as flipped and project-based classrooms.</AbstractNarration>

Rethinking how we support online learning in the age of isolation and information abundance: An introduction to The CREATE system.&nbsp;<em>International Journal on Innovations in Online Education.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;[Accepted September 2017].</p> <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p> <p>Technology is making us increasingly interconnected, pushing us to collectively think about and make sense of this information together.&nbsp; As a result, the ability to search for, evaluate, and make sense of information with others in order to build new knowledge is becoming increasingly important. Yet, people largely lack these skills and formal education does not place enough emphasis on helping students develop them.&nbsp;This is a big problem with negative consequences for our society. Thus, there is a need to develop new ways to prepare students for the information age: (a) to prepare them to think about and discuss information with others in ways that lead to higher-order collective thinking, (b) to teach them strategies to guard against isolated ways of thinking, and (c) to help them develop habits of mind that question the credibility of information regardless of who shares it, especially when the information aligns with their world view.</p> <p>To address this need, our team developed a generalizable method for helping students learn how to improve collaborative sense-making processes, and then designed and tested a system based on the new method. The system is called CREATE: Collective Regulation &amp; Enhanced Analysis Thinking Environment. The aim of the system is to go beyond providing a place to collaborate towards ensuring for the development of necessary collaborative sense-making skills.</p> <p>As part of this work we identified six key collaborative sense-making processes from research literature, known to impact collective sense-making processes: (1) ensuring that all members contribute ideas, (2) extending shared ideas with evidence and examples, (3) checking for shared understanding by rewording, rephrasing, or asking for clarification, (4) ensuring that the team provides searches for and provides alternative perspectives to suggestions and claims, (5) ensuring that the team provides logical, fact-based claims to support ideas, and (6) maintaining constructive discourse during evaluation of ideas to ensure that team members feel respected and valued by the team.</p> <p>As part of our work we created concrete examples of more to less sophisticated behaviors for each of these six items that students could understand. We then used technology to help students manage these processes, by building the CREATE system. CREATE is a collaborative training system that helps students learn how to manage collaborative processes and improve them. Typical discussion instructions in CREATE include the general topic to be covered, a description of the different required parts and length of the discussion, and when and how to use the reflect and monitor tabs (see Figure 1). After students complete a discussion activity, system features help each person reflect on the six key processes associated with high quality collaborative sense-making activity (see Figure 2 for example of one item). After all finish reflecting, the system provides a summary of scores and prompts them to select strategies to improve (see Figure 3).</p> <p>Our studies have shown that teams can significantly improve the quality of their discussions when using the activities in the CREATE system. Most students also enjoy the CREATE activities:</p> <p>&nbsp;&ldquo;The discussions in CREATE made us push, made us uncomfortable, made us grow in ways that we typically don&rsquo;t engage, because it is awkward and other courses allow us to hide from our tendencies to not want to engage in structured dialogue by way of giving us tasks that do not involve others as means of testing our comprehension of materials.&rdquo;</p> <p>Though the system provides support to help students monitor and regulate ongoing collaborative discourse, the instructor plays a critical role in the learning process. Students are quite inaccurate with their self-assessments. However, when an instructor gives them a more realistic assessment, students can work to make sense of the discrepancy in scores and improve deficient processes.</p> <p>As part of our work we also examined the possibility of automated assessment using machine learning techniques, but the current method of discourse evaluation proved too difficult for a computer to reliably compute without human support. However, it might be possible to automate some aspects of the assessment to reduce time spent by the instructor and also increase instructor awareness of teams that are in need of extra coaching and support.</p> <p>&nbsp;In partnership with the Teaching and Learning with Technology unit at Penn State University, Penn State is currently in the process of expanding the CREATE prototype into a multi-user, university-wide system with added usability for the administrative features.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/03/2017<br>      Modified by: Marcela&nbsp;Borge</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1319445/1319445_10274929_1509728053109_ScreenShot2017-11-03at12.53.37PM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1319445/1319445_10274929_1509728053109_ScreenShot2017-11-03at12.53.37PM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1319445/1319445_10274929_1509728053109_ScreenShot2017-11-03at12.53.37PM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1.
