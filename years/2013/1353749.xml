<AbstractNarration>Outbreaks of disease continue to increase in wild populations, and understanding this increase has become a major environmental challenge. A popular explanation is that loss of biodiversity, and particularly of species that are resistant to disease, encourages disease epidemics. Thus, enhancement and preservation of species diversity might reduce disease and associated negative effects on host populations. This project combines new mathematical models with experiments to challenge this explanation in a food web/community context, using Daphnia (an aquatic invertebrate) and a fungal pathogen, to explore how the dilution effect of multiple pathogen hosts plays itself out in the face of ecological (interspecific competition) and evolutionary dynamics. The PI's propose that key traits determining transmission also affect interactions with other community members, exploitative competitors and their shared prey in this case, which may alter the details of host-pathogen dynamics, particularly the dilution effect. Models and experiments together will determine whether competition among hosts also influences the spread of disease, whether nutritional value of the food for which hosts compete influences susceptibility to disease, and whether rapid adaptation of hosts to disease can counteract the loss of biodiversity, potentially reducing disease outbreaks. An interdisciplinary team of researchers will tackle these issues using common freshwater organisms that are infected by a virulent pathogen. The Daphnia-fungus system is ideal for asking elegant theoretical questions, and the proposed ambitious experiments will generate empirical data to test the theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This multi-disciplinary project will produce new insights into a provocative option for disease control. This project will also enhance training opportunities for students and postdoctoral researchers, with particular focus on members of underrepresented groups and undergraduates working with mathematics and biology. Additionally, the investigators will work through non-governmental organizations, high schools, a children's museum, and a program for middle school girls to disseminate results and train future scientists with hands-on projects.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Disease ecologists and managers alike worry that disease epidemics can depress host populations. Such outbreaks may even cause extinction of hosts species. However, other species can reduce disease prevalence. Through a ‘dilution effect’, these species can lessen the harm caused by parasites and improve health of hosts. Based on this idea, many have advocated thatd disease control strategies should include maintenance of host species &ndash; but this idea has generated immense controversy because it does not always work. We help to address the controversy with mechanistic approaches. In particular, these ‘diluters’ often compete with hosts suffering epidemics. In the face of such competition, do these ‘friendly competitors’ actually always reduce disease? Can they exert a double form of harm to hosts already suffering epidemics? Using a combinations of mathematical models, experiments on individuals and populations, and field surveys of a planktonic zooplankton-fungus system, we arrived at the following conclusions in this grant:     (1) ‘Friendly competition’ can produce a variety of predictable outcomes, ranging from success (reduced disease prevalence), failure (uncontrolled epidemics), and irrelevance (hosts who did not suffer large epidemics see no reduction).     (2) The major mechanism by which hosts control epidemics involves reduction of host density by the ‘friendly competitor’ (seen in experiments and field surveys, and supported by mathematical models). The other mechanism, called ‘exposure reduction’ (where diluters remove parasite propagules) proved much less important.     (3) Faced with competition from diluters and virulent epidemics, hosts can suffer immense harm. However, if genetic variation supports it, hosts can rapidly evolve increased competitive ability to both harms. (We illustrate this phenomenon in a series of papers). Additionally, during epidemics without competitors, hosts can evolve increased susceptibility when hosts create larger trophic cascades &ndash; when they cause major increases in resources of hosts.     (4) Parasites can depress feeding rate of hosts. This finding can completely change predictability of host evolution during epidemics, and it can create ‘hydra effects’ (where host density can actually increase during epidemics).     (5) Parasites can shift host populations towards juvenile life stages of hosts. Solar radiation can control disease epidemics. Warmer temperatures can improve the ability of a parasite propagule to infect hosts, but extremely warm temperatures can inhibit epidemics.     This grant used a zooplankton host, a fungal parasite, and algal resources. These lake organisms provided an ideal model system to (A) provide the field patterns underlying these conclusions, (B) parameterize mathematical models with experiments on individuals, (C) create experimental epidemics that lasted many host generations, with more or less evolution, and (D) test predictions of mathematical models. Using our results provide mechanistic understanding of the dilution effect.
