<AbstractNarration>This project focuses on the problem of information acquisition, state estimation and control in the context of cyber physical systems. In our underlying model, a (set of) decision maker(s), by controlling a sequence of actions with uncertain outcomes, dynamically refines the belief about stochastically time-varying parameters of interest. These parameters are then used to control the physical system efficiently and robustly. Here the cyber system collects, processes, and acquires information about the underlying physical system of interest, which is used for its control. The proposed work will develop a new theoretical framework for stochastic learning, decision-making, and control in stochastically-varying cyber physical systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to obtain analytical insights into the structure of efficient design, we first consider the case where the actions of the cyber system only affect the estimate of the underlying physical system. This class of problems arises in the context of (distributed) sensing/tracking of a physical system in isolation from cyber system control of the physical system's state. Joint state estimation and control for cyber-physical systems will then be considered. Here the most natural first step is to obtain sufficient conditions and/or special classes of systems where a separated approach to the information acquisition and efficient control is (near) optimal. To demonstrate its utility in practice, our theoretical framework will be applied in the specific context of energy efficient control of data centers and robust control of the smart grid under limited sensing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this work will be to develop a theoretical framework for the design of cyber-physical systems including information acquisition, state estimation, and control. In addition, separation theorems for the optimality of separate state estimation and control will be explored.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of broader impacts, significant performance improvement of control systems closed over communication networks will impact a wide range of applications for societal benefit, including smart buildings, intelligent transportation systems, energy-efficient data centers, and the future smart-grid. The PIs plan to disseminate the research results widely through conferences and journals, as well as by organizing specialized workshops and conference sessions related to cyber physical systems. The proposed project will train Ph.D. students as well as enrich the curriculum taught by the PIs in communications, stochastic control, and networks. The PIs have a strong track record in diversity and outreach activities, which for this project will include exposure and involvement of high school and undergraduate students, including under-represented minorities and women.</AbstractNarration>

These sensor measurements are commonly modelled as vector autoregressive (VAR) processes where the current measurement depends on the past few measurements and a stochastic innovation process. It is of interest to perform system identification of the time series in order to identify the subspace in which these often high dimensional measurements lie in, identify causal relationships between sensor measurements, control these processes or predict future values of the time series in tracking applications.</p> <p>In the high dimensional setting, there may be computational or communication barriers to collecting measurements from all sensors at all time instants. One workaround to both these barriers is to sample measurements and process them at a central fusion centre while another is to perform these computations in a distributed manner. In this work, we focus on the former approach and present formal high probability convergence guarantees for system identification when either a fraction of measurements are available at each instant or there is multiplicative or additive noise to sensor measurements. The model includes the possibility of missing values due to measurement failures.</p> <p>The first step in estimating the time series is to estimate the covariance matrix. An estimator which is the running sum of a scaled version of the empirical covariance matrix was proposed and its convergence properties analysed. We proved that sampling measurements has a quadratic effect &ndash; if we halve the number of samples at each time instant, we would be four times slower in estimating the covariance matrix to the same precision. The error in the covariance matrix scales as the square root of the dimension which can be very high. When we place structural constraints on the system which results in sparse, tapered, sparse inverse, or low covariance matrices, we obtain errors that do not scale in the dimension. Employing the covariance matrix, we can now estimate the transition matrix of a VAR process. Estimators in the case of dense matrices or with structural constraints like sparsity were analysed. Finally, estimators and performance guarantees for the case where the time series is itself time varying were provided. These methods can be used in joint state and system identification when we have an initial unknown input to a stable but unknown linear dynamical system which is a variant of the blind deconvolution problem.</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Integration of Renewable Energy in the Smart Grid</span></strong></p> <p>With states like California setting high targets on the implementation of renewables like Wind and Solar energy, it is increasingly important to guarantee stability and reliability in the face of uncertainty that these sources of energy are inextricably linked with. We consider the problem of a single wind power producer (WPP) which is a price taker on a dual settlement power market which is a widely implemented energy market model.</p> <p>A WPP makes an energy contract on the futures day ahead market based on its wind forecast. If there is excess or deficit generation, energy is sold or purchased on the real time market which can work out to be expensive for WPPs and also will rely on conventional power sources such as natural gas. Energy storage devices can be used to enhance reliability of power supply and reduce dependence on real time markets but are expensive to install.</p> <p>Our work assesses the value of energy storage devices in order to guide installation capacity. We first formulated the problem as an infinite horizon stochastic control problem and analysed structural properties of the optimal energy use policy to show that adding greater energy storage capacities would be accompanied by marginally reducing benefits. This allowed us to bound the utility of storage by focussing on the incremental benefits of an infinitesimal amount of energy storage. We proved that the optimal policy in this regime is to simply charge when there is excess and discharge when there is a deficit without changing the amount contracted on the futures market. We also provided a competitive achievable scheme based on model predictive control, our possibly erroneous forecasts for the varying wind and price processes, and a terminal cost function based on the well understood Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control process.
