<AbstractNarration>The Targeted Infusion Project at Tennessee State University will produce mechanical and electrical engineering graduates with knowledge and skills in renewable/alternative energy systems through a selection of undergraduate elective courses and research experiences. The project deploys an effective pedagogy for delivering coursework in renewable/alternative energy systems, develops a laboratory for instruction and research to promote engineering education and research solutions in energy storage devices and fuel production, and enhances faculty expertise through collaboration with university and industry partners in advanced energy systems. Partner institutions include Wayne State University, University of Tennessee, the University of Michigan, Nissan Corporation, Pennsylvania State University and the US Air Force Research Laboratory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The establishment of a renewable/alternative energy systems laboratory at Tennessee State University represents the efforts of an alliance of universities, representation from industry, and federal agencies with shared interests in the development in advanced energy systems. This unique partnership informs curriculum development efforts in mechanical and electrical engineering. Over 150 African American students directly benefit from enhanced coursework and undergraduate research experiences.  The project provides engineering students with critical skills and knowledge for the automotive industry and federal organizations by addressing workforce demands in the emerging technologies of energy storage devices and bio-fuels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Developing A Renewable Energy Systems Laboratory For Education &amp; Research at Tennessee State University (TSU)  The objective of this project was to introduce the fundamentals of renewable energy systems in the engineering curriculum, and engage students and faculty in a specific applied research area related to renewable energy to promote learning and the field for career opportunities.  Renewable energy is a viable alternative to the traditional use of fossil fuels for energy production, and has the potential to reduce US dependency on petroleum based products.  The project developed three (3) multi-disciplinary courses for electrical and mechanical engineering students that included an introduction course in renewable energy, an advanced course, and a special topics course for research.  The courses were supported by the development of a Renewable Energy Laboratory that consisted on two experimental configurations for teaching and research.   The first configuration included multiple components for energy and power generation such as solar, wind, sensors, micro-controllers, and hydrogen fuel cells that were integrated with a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems for experimental design with students in a laboratory setting.  The experiments were designed to complement the course material.  The second configuration was the development of a hybrid micro-grid system for energy storage via wind, solar, or with an energy storage device such as a lithium ion battery.  The design and construction of this configuration was part of the special topics course, a graduate course, and research students.  The intellectual merit of this project was the engagement of students and faculty in introducing the emerging and growing topic of renewable energy in the electrical and mechanical engineering curricula, and the applied research with a new hybrid micro-grid developed by students and faculty.  The courses and research engaged more than 300+ mnority students in the College of Engineering at Tennessee State University, and increased awareness of careers in energy.
