<AbstractNarration>The project team plans to further develop a new enabling technology for groundwater modeling - one that has the potential to substantially reduce the costs of groundwater sustainability investigations and could change how groundwater is managed, how data is collected, and even how people collaborate. Under this initiative, the project team has developed a cloud-based groundwater simulation system, that  is delivered as a service, not as a product, and is live-linked to a massive pre-processed spatial database, allowing one to zoom in anywhere covered by the database to make a preliminary prediction of groundwater flow and contaminant transport. Additionally, the software allows users to add their own data to that provided by the service, refining model predictions and allows aggregating user data, essentially turning users into co-developers/collaborators and building value as a side-effect of their use of the application.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As sustainability is among the greatest challenges in the 21st century and recent IT and data revolution offers unprecedented opportunities for potential breakthroughs in the ability to understand and manage complex systems, interactions, and sustainability. These possibilities, however, are largely unrealized, primarily because the technologies to produce big data are not matched by technologies to analyze them. The project team recently partnered with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality to develop this integrated computational infrastructure in groundwater science and engineering. The collaboration takes advantage of existing programs - statewide database development and data integration from a network of state, federal, and other institutional storehouses on the part of the State and computational advancements, specifically in hierarchical GIS-based modeling, stochastic modeling, and real-time visual simulation and data analytics, on the part of the project team - and exploits the synergies of integrating these efforts to significantly improve our knowledge-creating infrastructure to understand, characterize, model, and visualize complex groundwater systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Working with a paradigm-changing goal in mind, Dr. Li and his team at Michigan State University have developed &ndash; through eight NSF awards, a major Michigan Department of Environmental Quality initiative &ndash; an advanced modeling and data analysis infrastructure that supports knowledge-creation through modeling, visualizing, characterizing, and ultimately understanding complex aqueous environmental systems. The emerging technology has received resounding endorsements from environmental and groundwater experts in both the public and private sectors.

We foresee the service being used to increase public literacy in environmental sciences and thus attract more and diverse individuals to the study of science in general.

The project focused on three main issues: 1) developing a technology demonstration for potential customers and partners, 2) defining a clear go/no go decision regarding viability of products and services, and 3) should the decision be to move the effort forward, a transition plan to do so.         The team developed a live demonstration of the service and used this as an introduction to the service at the 100 interviews that were conducted with potential customers. From the discussions with the customers, the team was able to develop numerous important insights that ultimately allowed the team to understand a number of important factors, including: the value of the service to the customer, the issues the customer is having that causes them the value the service, understanding the demand for the service and ways that it can be increased, defining the methods through which the service would be delivered to the customers based upon their preferences and needs, defining the revenue generating characteristics of the service and projecting a number of possible scenarios, identifying essential partners and the strategies for coo...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
