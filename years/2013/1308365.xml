<AbstractNarration>Climate change is having a profound effect on many organisms.  The purpose of this project is to develop, analyze, and use a new class of mechanistic models, integrodifference equations, that include growth, dispersal, and climate-driven range shifts in order to study and predict the effects of climate change on animal and plant populations.  Integrodifference equations reduce the problem of determining the persistence of a population in a changing environment to a simple eigenvalue problem.  Researchers will analyze the effects of climate-driven range shifts on age- and stage-structured populations with complex life histories, perform analyses of two-dimensional range-shift models on realistic geometries, build and analyze models with explicit habitat quality functions, and build and analyze range-shift models that contain interspecific interactions.  Sensitivity analyses will be performed in order to determine which demographic stages have the strongest influence on persistence in a changing environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Earth is getting warmer.  In response to this warming, many species have shifted their ranges poleward in latitude or upward in elevation.  The purpose of this project is to develop mathematical models and tools that will help us determine which species can continue to keep pace with climate-driven habitat shifts and which species are at risk.  Researchers will start with models that include growth and demography, dispersal, and climate-driven spatial shifts and extend these models to include age and stage structure, complicated life histories, population interactions, habitat quality, and realistic geometries.  These extensions will help us more accurately assess the effects of climate change on animal and plant populations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The Earth is getting warmer.  In response to this warming, many species have shifted their ranges poleward (in latitude) or upward (in elevation).  Whether species can continue to keep pace with climate-induced range shifts is an important ecological question.    During this project, my students and I took simple population range-shift models that we had previously developed and extended these models to make them more realistic. In particular, we included factors such as complicated life histories, age- and stage-structure, population interactions, and realistic geometries.  For each extension, we developed new tools and methods for estimating the maximum climate velocity compatible with population persistence.  We also worked to discover which aspects of  life history and geometry most strongly affect the maximum allowable climate velocity.   The most obvious outcome of this project is a series of five published papers (and two additional submitted papers) that outline our models and analyses. The first published paper describes the formulation and analysis of age- and stage-structured moving-habitat models and uses these models to analyze the effects on increasing rates of climate change on four dissimilar plant species.  The second paper introduces new methods for quickly determining maximum-speed curves for moving-habitat models. The third paper looks at two-dimensional moving-habitat models and shows how dispersal kernels determine the best geometry for population persistence. The results in this third paper were applied to butterfly populations The fourth paper models the spread and interaction of a pathogen, white pine blister rust, with its host, whitebark pines.  The fifth published paper is a tutorial and survey of moving-habitat models that also contains web-based tools that allow ecologists to study populations on moving habitats in the presence of Allee effects, variable range limits, and a variety of biotic interactions, including predation, competition, mutualism, and infection.     The first submitted paper provides tool and metrics for studying transient dynamics in simple and stage-structured moving-habitat models.  The second submitted paper uses methods developed for moving-habitat models to study persistence in models with asymmetric dispersal kernels.    Together, these papers provide new analyses and tools that will help scientists determine the effects of climate-driven range shifts on animal and plant populations. They will also help scientists to identify at-risk species.    Another valuable outcome of this project was the support and training of two graduate students at the interface of mathematics and biology.  One of these students recently defended his Ph.D dissertation on work associated with this project.  (This student recently moved on to a postdoctoral research assistantship at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.)  The second student is well on his way to finishing his Ph.D.       Last Modified: 08/11/2017       Submitted by: Mark Kot]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
