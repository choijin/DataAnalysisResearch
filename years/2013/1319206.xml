<AbstractNarration>Computational inefficiency is a common experience: the computer cannot complete a certain task due to lack of resources such as time, memory, or bandwidth. Computational complexity theory classifies -- or aims to classify -- computational tasks according to their inherent inefficiency. Since tasks requiring excessive resources must be avoided, complexity theory is often indispensable in the design of a computer system. Inefficiency can also be harnessed to our advantage. Indeed, most modern cryptography and electronic commerce rely on the (presumed) inefficiency of certain computational tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of the proposed research is to make progress on several mutually enriching directions in computational complexity theory, including problems at the intersections with algorithms and cryptography. Building on the principal investigator's (PI's) previous works, the main proposed directions are:&lt;br/&gt;- computational tasks whose inputs are distributed among several computers which communicate either by broadcast or through a dynamic network,&lt;br/&gt;- structures that store data compactly while allowing efficient answers to queries,&lt;br/&gt;- linking the inefficiency of computational tasks by establishing reductions among them, and&lt;br/&gt;- compiling any cryptographic protocol into a circuit that remains secure even when in the hands of an adversary who observes it during execution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is closely integrated with a plan to achieve broad impact through education. The PI is reshaping the theory curriculum at Northeastern on multiple levels. At the undergraduate level, the PI is working on and using in his classes a set of lecture notes aimed towards students lacking mathematical maturity. At the Ph.D. level, the PI is including into core classes current research topics including some of the above. Finally, the PI will continue to do research working closely with students at all levels.</AbstractNarration>

Computational complexity theory classifies -- or aims to classify -- computational tasks according to their inherent inefficiency. Since tasks requiring excessive resources must be avoided, complexity theory is often indispensable in the design of a computer system. Inefficiency can also be harnessed to our advantage. Indeed, most modern cryptography and electronic commerce rely on the (presumed) inefficiency of certain computational tasks.  The objective of the proposed research was to make progress on several, mutually enriching directions in computational complexity theory, including problems at the intersections with algorithms and cryptography.  Some of the main outcomes of this project are as follows.  A new bound was obtained on the complexity of performing multiplication in certain mathematical structures (certain types of groups). This result is of independent interest in mathematics, and enables an application in cryptography.  A new bound was obtained on the complexity of decoding error-correcting codes (including Reed-Solomon codes -- which are codes that with certain parameters are used in CD players), as part of a general study of distributions with limited independence.  New types of graphs have been constructed which are very well connected (expander graphs) yet the neighbor of a node can be computed very efficiently.  The results from the project are disseminated broadly. They appear in the top venues for research in theoretical computer science. In addition to researchers in theoretical computer science, the results have also influenced researchers in mathematics. The PI also maintains a blog which regularly features expositions and discussions of technical results.  The team working on the project included several Ph.D. students as well as one postdoctoral scientist.       Last Modified: 09/06/2017       Submitted by: Emanuele Viola]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
