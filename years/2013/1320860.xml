<AbstractNarration>Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are widely regarded as a&lt;br/&gt;revolutionary innovation; however, traditional instructional&lt;br/&gt;techniques do not scale to MOOCs with tens of thousands of students.&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to design a set of algorithmic tools to partially&lt;br/&gt;automate three of the most basic instructional processes - grading&lt;br/&gt;assignments, giving students personalized feedback, and creating new&lt;br/&gt;assignments - in MOOCs that teach computer programming. Such tools&lt;br/&gt;have the potential to significantly raise the productivity of&lt;br/&gt;instructors in these courses, and give students a far more effective&lt;br/&gt;educational experience than what they currently receive. They can also&lt;br/&gt;guide the development of future MOOCs on programming, and play a role&lt;br/&gt;in making the MOOC model reach its full potential.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The algorithms developed in this project draw on ideas from several&lt;br/&gt;different areas of computing. They leverage advances in automated&lt;br/&gt;reasoning about software like automatically finding bugs in&lt;br/&gt;student code and suggesting fixes, and exploit statistical learning&lt;br/&gt;techniques that mine databases of previously-completed assignments and&lt;br/&gt;infer aggregate statistics about a class. Finally, the research has a&lt;br/&gt;dimension of human computation, for instance seeding logical and&lt;br/&gt;statistical analysis techniques with data obtained through peer&lt;br/&gt;evaluation. These methods apply to any programming course; however,&lt;br/&gt;the investigators will evaluate them by deploying them in a specific&lt;br/&gt;MOOC on Python programming that they teach.</AbstractNarration>
