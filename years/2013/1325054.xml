<AbstractNarration>The recently established "clumped isotope" paleothermometer is based on the Carbon 13 - Oxygen 18 bond abundance in carbonate minerals. Although this technique is becoming more widely used, there are still many questions about the underlying processes that control geochemical signatures in bio-minerals and non-biologically formed minerals. This project will address several of these outstanding questions. Investigators will compare results from theoretical calculations and experiments to observations, including from slowly-grown naturally occurring samples such as the Devils Hole speleothem and deep-sea corals of variable mineralogy. This work should improve the ability to employ clumped isotopes in surface and subsurface systems, and identify the limitations of this technique. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work will be highlighted in UCLA's annual Physical Sciences Outreach Day that brings 2000-3000 members of the public to the campus and a few hundred people to the exhibits. All of the participants in this project will also conduct a mineral precipitation activity with school children as part of a regular outreach program the PI runs. Support of this project will benefit an early career PI who is establishing a NSF-supported state-of-the-art isotope lab and is committed to recruiting, mentoring, and supporting outstanding early career scientists from diverse backgrounds, thus furthering NSF's goals to support underrepresented groups in the Earth Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
