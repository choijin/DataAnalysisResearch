<AbstractNarration>Birds are living theropod (carnivorous) dinosaurs and the suite of plumage and wing features that enable bird flight are well known to have evolved first in non-avian dinosaurs. Because brains do not directly fossilize, however, our evolutionary understanding of the neurological control system for flight has lagged far behind. Fortuitously, advanced imaging techniques, such as Computerized Tomography scanning ? which images the interior of bone and fossils for digital recreation ? and Positron Emission Tomography scanning ? which measures brain activity during prescribed behaviors ? now make it possible to pair anatomical changes in the size and shape of the brain with behavioral patterns of brain use. This project will adapt these tools to address how the evolution of flight-active parts of the modern avian brain contributed to the dinosaurian transition to flight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The highly integrative nature of this research will be transformative as it addresses a major transition in vertebrate evolution, and impacts neuroscience and paleobiology. Dissemination will occur in both English and Spanish through the researcher?s website, designed as a platform for encouraging young women and minorities to pursue scientific careers. Additional, broad outreach will take place through the American Museum of Natural History and collaborating institutions (Columbia University, Brookhaven National Laboratory).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of this project was to decipher, using high-resolution imaging techniques, which parts of the brain birds use to fly. We used positron emission tomography scanning to image the brain of flying starlings and found that the areas they use are the anterior Wulst and the entopallium. These two areas are used for visual processing, specifically for alerting the animal of short-term conflicts, such as obstacles in a flight path. The activation of these areas for flight makes evolutionary sense as flight probably arose through the acquisition of other volant behaviors, like wing-assisted incline running, where birds flap their wings to help them run up steep or vertical surfaces. Once they ran up a surface, they could use the entopallium and anterior Wulst to help guide them back down, slowly increasing the importance and physical size of these regions. The Wulst first appears in <em>Archaeopteryx</em>, which could indicate the beginning of volant behaviors in Avialae and more derived theropod dinosaurs. This project is the first use of PET for motor behavior studies in birds, the fifth to use PET in bird studies, and the first paleontological study to employ PET in living animals to better understand evolutionary transitions. The Co-PI developed a research website in both English and Spanish to help disseminate the information to a broader audience.
