<AbstractNarration>Astronomy is a fully international endeavor. To participate in the international scientific community, American researchers must meet and collaborate with researchers from around the world, and to do this they must attend international scientific meetings. These meetings provide a forum for interacting with other researchers, forming collaborations, presenting new results and participating in the international scientific community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will provide support for approximately 150 US astronomers, postdocs, and students to participate in international professional meetings. This award will be especially important to early-career scientists and those from less-endowed institutions as it will help give them the opportunity to actively participate in these important meetings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Astronomy is an inherently international research discipline.  Not only are astronomers scattered around the world, but the telescopes, research centers and space system control centers are as well.  Further, many research efforts, are fundamentally partenerships between nations, with shared effort and shared funding.  The American Astronomical Society has long recognized that astronomy is international by nature and has sought support from the NSF for a number of decades to ensure that US astronomers can be present and engaged in international scientific conferences.  It is important that they be present, not only so they can share their own results and learn about the results of astronomers from other countries, but also so that they can build partnerships and collaborations internationally.  The US plays an important and outsized role in astronomy research, with roughly 25% of the members of the International Astronomical Union coming from the US.  This represents only 1/3 of the active researchers in the US, so our impact worldwide is even larger than the IAU membership numbers convey.  This grant, which supports the international airfare expenses for US-based astronomers to travel to international scientific conferences ensures that each year a wide range of international meetings benefit from US astronomer participation.  We are proud to continue operating this grant on behalf of our Nation's astronomers and to ensure that the US continues to lead and fully collaborate with the international astronomical community.
