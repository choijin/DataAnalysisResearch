<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a software system that transparently and dynamically offloads computations from mobile devices to the cloud for the purpose of accelerating mobile applications.  The need is clear, as software requirements are already outstripping the hardware capabilities of smartphones and tablets.  However, such a system has remained out of reach since current technologies cannot practically achieve the tight device-cloud coupling required for high application responsiveness, especially under the processor, battery and network constraints of modern mobile devices.  Compressive replication, a novel continuous data replication method based on compressive sensing, can fill this technology gap by enabling just such a tight coupling.  To elevate compressive replication to a level suitable for use in a commercial product and service, technical work will be undertaken to survey and improve its encoding/decoding mechanisms, tailor efficient network protocols to it, and evaluate its real-world performance in a prototype.  The anticipated result of this feasibility study is a system that will demonstrate significant speed-up of mobile applications through transparent cloud acceleration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be a transformation of the mobile computing landscape.  Application developers will be afforded a simple, principled method and a general, reusable framework for developing mobile applications that are tightly coupled to the vast resources of the cloud.  In turn, this will unleash a new generation of mobile applications that rival, and even surpass, current desktop or web-based applications in sophistication, features and engagement.  For end-users at large, it could mean greater productivity through more sophisticated business apps and higher quality entertainment through more immersive games.  For disabled persons, cloud acceleration would make assistive user interfaces -- particularly those that combine computationally intensive natural language processing, gesture recognition, and predictive algorithms -- practical on mobile devices.  The proposed system will also be a key driver of new economic activity in the mobile space, as real-time synchronization with the cloud opens up new opportunities in an extensive array of market verticals including, e.g., mobile user engagement analytics, mobile advertising, and even machine-to-machine (M2M) platform development.  In short, the proposed cloud acceleration technology will have significant societal and economic impacts on many fronts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Even as smartphones and tablets have become indispensible in our daily lives, they remain devices with limited computing capacity and battery budgets.  Application developers today run up against these constraints all the time but can do little but wait for the next generation of slightly faster hardware to be rolled out.  Unfortunately, the incremental performance improvement provided by new hardware has not kept pace with increasingly compute-intensive demandsof popular software features such as voice recognition, recommendations, and image/video processing, just to name a few.  The impact of these limitations is broad and not just faced by application developers alone; it manifests as less capable mobile apps and a leaner user experience for hundreds of millions of end-users.  UpShift Labs, Inc. imagines an alternative approach: instead of incrementally improving mobile device hardware, we dynamically and transparently offload difficult computations to high-performance servers in the cloud.  Such an approach would require fundamental advances in how mobile devices interact with computing resources inthe cloud.  Our NSF SBIR Phase I research grant enabled us to investigate and develop new technologies that are key to dynamic cloud acceleration for mobile apps.  Specifically, we developed a new data synchronization/compression technique -- based on recent advances in the field of compressive sensing theory -- that is tailored to provide frequent, low-bandwidth, and battery-efficient communications between mobile devices and the cloud.  This breakthrough technology enabled us to implement a prototype cloud acceleration system in which we demonstrated a more than 60% battery savings in and a six-fold speedup of a handwriting recognition application for the iPad.    This outcome is an important commercialization milestone for UpShift Labs, as we have successfully demonstrated that the performance benefits of cloud acceleration can be substantial and, more importantly, are realizable.  Our example handwriting recognition app serves as a broader indicator of the kinds of compute-intensive tasks (e.g., those required by sophisticated assistive user interfaces) that could benefit our technology platform.  And as a proof-of-concept, it represents the first step towards a developer-friendly and scalable cloud acceleration platform that would give mobile apps direct access to the raw computing power of the cloud, without the need for developers to use multiple programming paradigms or operate their own cloud infrastructure.  New, richer features could thus find their way more quickly into mobile apps across a broad swath of market segments, ranging from games to home automation to the enterprise.
