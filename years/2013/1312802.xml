<AbstractNarration>This award supports science and operations of the Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) as a community facility. EOVSA is a solar-dedicated radio interferometer array, located at Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO), and is under construction for completion in 2013. EOVSA will provide the community open access to the most comprehensive, physics-based radio spectral measurements of solar and space-weather phenomena to date, together with a strong program of night-time science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;EOVSA opens a new era in astrophysics research, while providing a stepping stone to the future Frequency Agile Solar Radiotelescope (FASR). As a university-based, solar-dedicated instrument, the array provides opportunities for young scientists and engineers to obtain hands-on experience in constructing and operating hardware, which when combined with traditional data analysis skills creates better, more capable researchers.</AbstractNarration>

Our talented team of researchers and graduate students,  based at New Jersey Institute of Technology, in Newark, NJ, work hard to keep the California-based array in operation using its highly automated, remote operations capability.

Our goal is to provide the solar scientific community with high-quality, multi-frequency radio images of the solar disk, active regions, and flares (radio bursts) for a wide variety of science studies.  These include monitoring the Sun's activity to assess how the Sun affects the Earth's atmosphere and magnetosphere, effects on communication and navigation systems (including cell phones and GPS), measuring magnetic fields in the solar corona above sunspots, and measuring high-energy particles accelerated in solar flares.  Although some of these topics are addressable with data at other wavelengths, EOVSA marks the first time that the combination of imaging and spectral coverage has been available at radio wavelengths.  This unique view of solar activity provides a new ability to detect formerly hidden or unrecognized phenomena that are essential to our full understanding of the Sun and its effects on the Earth.  In addition to taking and analyzing these multi-frequency images, our scientists have developed a modeling framework for combining the radio observations with X-ray, Extreme Ultraviolet, and optical observations of the Sun, to aid researchers in our group and elsewhere to understand the complex relationships among the miriad phenomena of solar activity, as revealed in these multiple wavelength domains.  Our detailed studies of more than 100 solar radio bursts, observed since April, 2017, are just beginning, but already they have been used to develop the 3-dimensional view of solar flares and active regions of the Sun that is yielding some surprises, as well as providing confirmations of existing theories.
