<AbstractNarration>The objective of this Rapid Response Research (RAPID) proposal is to better understand people's immediate response to the June 16th - 17th, 2013 flash floods in the hilly state of Uttarakhand in North India. This event has claimed over 1,000 lives with over 5,700 still reported missing and presumed dead as of early August. Data will be collected through field observations and semi-structured interviews of over 300 flash flood survivors from six affected villages. The interviews with survivors will examine their traditional knowledge about floods and landslides and actions they take, their understanding of how the environment changes, number of floods they have experienced, their sources of warning, the actions they took prior to evacuating, their emotional state at the time of the flash floods, and their responses related to protecting themselves, their family and friends. The project activities will advance the state of knowledge about people's response to flash floods and provide a foundation for cross-cultural comparisons of flash flood response. This will be extremely significant because there are few studies of flood response and virtually none on flash flood response in developing countries. Adopting questionnaire items from previous surveys used will provide a basis for comparing responses to the Uttarakhand flash floods with responses to other rapid-onset hazards (the Mt. St. Helens mudflows, the Christchurch and Hitachi earthquakes, and the American Samoa earthquake and tsunami). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;University contacts made in India during the data collection stage will be of value in catalyzing future collaborations for faculty and student exchanges and research endeavors between UNT and Delhi University. The project activities will advance teaching, training, and learning in the US as the project findings will be incorporated into course modules by the PI. Lectures and exercises will be developed in undergraduate and graduate classes such as Special Populations, Sustainability and Emergency Management, Foundations of Emergency Management, Disaster Response Planning and Disaster Research Methods, reflecting the findings and challenges of disaster management in a developing country. This study will also provide field research and data collection experience to five Indian graduate students and data coding, analysis, and publication experience to a doctoral student at UNT.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong><em>Background:</em> </strong>Flash floods are some of the most dangerous weather-related disasters, as they are involuntary risks where individuals are unaware of the onset of the event and have no control over how the event will affect them. Consequently, people&rsquo;s immediate response is very likely to determine whether they survive the event. Unfortunately, there is nonexistent literature on this topic in developing countries of the world where official flash flood warning systems are lacking. The major goal of this research funded by the US National Science Foundation is to fill this gap and inform policy by understanding people&rsquo;s immediate response to the June 17th 2013 flash floods in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand in North India.

It is posited that the outcome of the protective action decision-making process, together with situational facilitators and impediments, produces a behavioral response that can help save lives and reduce losses.</p> <p><strong><em>Sample selection: </em></strong>Flood survivors were identified and interviewed face-to-face in the local language (Hindi) between October 16 and November 1, 2013 by a five-member research team of students (Delhi University), led by the PI, four months after the disaster.&nbsp; A convenience snowball sampling strategy was adopted to identify respondents.&nbsp; Interviews were conducted in respondents&rsquo; homes, in the central market by the side of the highway, or at government or nonprofit-sponsored tent shelters.

The modal education level was less than 9th grade. Seeing the flash flood coming (37.3%), understanding that torrential rains would cause flash flooding (23.1%), and observing unusual changes in the mountains (5.4%) were people&rsquo;s primary environmental cues.
