<AbstractNarration>This award is to support the California-Arizona Minority Partnership for Astronomy Research and Education (CAMPARE) program, led by Cal Poly Pomona, for their student internship program in the Summer of 2014. CAMPARE is designed to advance undergraduate Astronomy research and education among Hispanic and other minority students, in order to promote their participation and advancement in Astronomy and closely related fields, and increase their numbers in Ph.D. programs in those fields. Undergraduate students from their home institutions (mainly in the Cal Poly system) spend a summer working at one of four research sites (University of Arizona Steward Observatory, SETI Institute, JPL, and Caltech) on research in Astronomy, Planetary Science, Space Science, or Astrobiology. Through robust mentoring and support, the program aims to significantly enhance the recruitment and retention of students from diverse backgrounds.</AbstractNarration>
