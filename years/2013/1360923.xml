<AbstractNarration>This grant funds student travel to the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2014), to be held in June 2014 in Hyderabad, India. This is the flagship conference in the Software Engineering field for researchers, practitioners and educators to present and discuss the most recent innovations, trends, experiences, etc. Funding for student travel has significant broader impacts because of the the opportunity it gives the students to become part of the research community, discuss their research with others, meet leaders in the field, and have experiences toward building the future, global workforce. The funds are for US-based students with attention to broadening participation from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
