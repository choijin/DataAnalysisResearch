<AbstractNarration>Geoscience and environmental science software is crucial for data analysis and generating new knowledge and understanding about the Earth. Because reproducibility of operations, calculations, and predictions done with this software is important for science, commercial, and regulatory applications, it is important that the software generated by geoscientists and their colleagues be captured, curated, managed, and made available to all interested parties upon request. This project initiates that process by building partnerships between computer scientist, software developers, and scientists across all geoscience domains with the goal or creating a software ecosystem and a culture of software stewardship that will empower geoscientists and others to make their software accessible and manage it as a valuable scientific asset. This work will examine the possibility of creating effective on-line tools that will guide users through best practices in software use and development, including componentizing codes, describing and documenting their codes, licensing their programs, and maintaining reusable code. It will also explore the best and most effective means for training geoscientists and providing appropriate educational/training materials to dramatically improve the ability of geoscientists to more effectively develop and curate software generated by themselves, their students, and others. Broader impacts of the work include building infrastructure for science, engagement of early career professionals in both computer and geoscience, and increasing cyber sophistication of geoscience practitioners. The project supports a core team that is geographically distributed (California, Pennsylvania, and Colorado) and partners with a nation-wide consortium of academic organizations dedicated to advancing geoscience geospatial needs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Geoscience and environmental science software is crucial for data analysis to generate new knowledge and understanding about the Earth. Because reproducibility of operations, calculations, and predictions done with this software is important for science, commercial, and regulatory applications, it is important that the software generated by geoscientists be captured, curated, managed, and shared with their colleagues.  The goal of the GeoSoft project is to encourage scientists to share the software that they develop as part of their science.  In some cases software captures mathematical or physical models, in other cases software implements small data conversions or visualizations that are also important to do science.  The GeoSoft project brings together computer scientists, geoscientists, and social scientists to assist scientists to describe basic characteristics of their code and share it.  This project developed interactive tools to help scientists describe their software, so it is easy to share it with other scientists.  These descriptions help other scientists understand what the software does, and incorporate it in their work.  This saves them time because they do not have to reimplement the software.  GeoSoft helps scientists adopt best practices to release open source free software, use intelligent interfaces to describe how software works, and form productive communities around software projects. This research has the potential to fundamentally transform geosciences by making scientific software readily available to researchers and citizen scientists for efficient data analysis.
