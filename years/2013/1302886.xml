<AbstractNarration>This project will involve the study of finite and algebraic groups and in particular their actions on linear spaces and varieties.  One important aspect of the project is to improve bounds for the sizes of low degree cohomology groups.  This should lead to profinite presentations of the finite simple groups with two generators and a very small number of relations.  There will also be a study of discrete presentations of the finite simple groups building on earlier work of the proposer and others showing that with the possible exception of one family, every finite simple group has a presentation with at most 50 relations.  The project will also consider the notion of adequate representations of finite groups. This is a weakening of a condition used by Taylor and Wiles to prove certain representations are automorphic (and used in the proof of Fermat's last theorem).  The idea is to show that many representations do satisfy this condition (and also constructing others that do not).  This notion has already been used to great effect by Clozel, Thorne, Gee, Dieulefait and others.  Another part of the project will be to attempt to generalize the Tits alternative.  The conjecture is that any finitely generated Zariski dense subgroup of a semisimple algebraic group contains a strongly dense free subgroup.  Here strongly dense means every nonabelian subgroup is Zariski dense in the algebraic group.  Finally, certain problems related to mappings of smooth algebraic curves will be studied using the group theory results.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the major motivations for this project has been the major advances in computational group theory.  These advances are not just based on improvements in computing power but very innovative programs which use the theory in a crucial way.  The presentations mentioned above are already being implemented into MAGMA (a very powerful computational algebra software package) and is used to recognize groups.  The results on adequate representations have already been used in some significant advances in showing representations are automorphic and should help in the fundamental Langlands program. The results on strongly dense subgroups have already been used in proving new results on expander graphs.  These are graphs that are relatively sparse but are also very highly connected.  These have sparked a revolution in computer science in the last decade.  The new results will have even more applications to this field.  Deep results in group theory have led to major advances in basic problems about bijective polynomials over finite fields (viewed as mappings on a smooth projective curve) and has had applications to cryptography and solved problems over a century old.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project was about fundamental questions about permutation and linear represetnations of finite and algebraic groups.   Results of this nature have applications to geometry, number theory, physics and many other areas.  We discuss below some of the highlights of this research.  A fundamental notion for an algebraic group acting on a variety is that of a generic stabilizer.   A generic property is one that holds on a nonempty open (dense subset) -- i.e. it holds for most vectors.  We especially considered a simple algebraic group acting linearly.  Over the complex numbers, Richardson showed that most stabilizers are a single conjugacy class.  In joint work, we show the same is true in positive characteristic by actually computing them and showing typically the generic stabilizer is trivial.   This was used to get precise results about the essential dimension of a simple algebraic group (this has a technical defintion but is an important intrinsic property of the group).  In related work, we (with Garibaldi) proved that in the same setup, if G preserves some polynomial function on the vector space, then it usually is the stabilizer of that function.  This was motivated by a particular degree eight polynomial on the Lie algebra of E8.   This was a question from the thesis of Cartan and more recently was considerd by physicists.   We prove a very strong result in this setting.   In other work on algebraic groups and quantum groups, we (with Garibaldi and Nakano) show that E8 acting on the Lie algebra has other unique properties.  This answered a question of Dick Gross about globally irreducible representations for algebraic groups.   Another fundamental classical problem in number theory is whether every finite group is a Galois group over the rational numbers.   In two papers, we show that this is true for two families of Chevalley groups over prime fields using what is called the rigidity method.    Another area of considerable interest in the last twenty years has been the construction of expander graphs.  This are graphs with not too many edges but which have high connectivity.  This are important in networks, computer science and various areas of mathematics.  In joint work with Breuillard, Green and Tao, we use ideas from algebraic groups to prove that random pairs of elements in Chevalley groups of fixed rank. (e.g. the family SL(n,q)) give rise to families of Cayley graphs which are expanders.     A fundamental notion in permutation group theory is the notion of a base.  A base is a subset of the set being acted on so that any element which is trivial on the base is trivial on the entire set.  This has been studied since the late 1800's.  It is quite important in computational group theory (for example one can tell if two elements in the group are equal just by computing their actions a base which may be much smaller than the set).   In a series of papers with Burness and Saxl, we have been computing the base size (i.e. the minimal size of a base) for simple finite and algebraic groups acting primitively.   In the case of algebraic groups, we have essentially complete answers and this gives results for the finite groups as well.  Typically the base size is 2.   Another basic notion in the theory of permutation groups is about fixed point free permutations.  It goes back to Jordan that any finite transitive group contains derangements.  Indeed, as far  back as 1708, this was studied by Montmart in analyzing some card games.   Answering a question posed independently by Shalev and Boston,  the PI and Fulman showed that the proportion of derangements when a finite simple group is acting is bounded away from zero.   Rather surprisingly, this fails if the simplicity hypothesis is weakened at all.   This result has had numerous applications already.   The project also resulted in many other related and fundamental results in the area motivated by problems in group theory and other areas of mathematics.   Guralnick also gave quite a number of talks about these works to broad audiences (at the ICM in Korea, the British Mathematics Collquium, a PIMS distinguised lecture and a dstinguished lecture series at theTechnion).    Guralnick also has supported numerous graduate students (two continuing and one who just finished).  He also has been active in publishing as a Managing Editor and editor and was elected to be a fellow of the American Assocation for the Advancement of Science.
