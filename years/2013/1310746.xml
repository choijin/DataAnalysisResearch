<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to investigate the evolution dynamics of a class of nonlinear diffusion equations that appear as mathematical models in life and social science: &lt;br/&gt;(1) Analysis of existence and long time behavior of solutions of a free boundary problem in one and two dimensional space;&lt;br/&gt;(2) Study of the regularity of solutions to a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation coupled to a Fokker-Planck diffusion equation;&lt;br/&gt;(3) Analysis of long-time behavior of parabolic equations with nonlinear singular sources. &lt;br/&gt;These equations present several difficulties due to high differential order as well as the underlying nonlinear structure, and new analytical tools need to be developed: some key techniques involve combination of classical partial differential equations technique with methods from statistical mechanics, optimal control and kinetic theory. Of particular interest is the study of stability and finite time blow-up phenomena in the model: in case of stability, behavior of solution for large time will be investigated (possible bifurcations or convergence towards equilibrium state). In case of blow-up, relation between formation of singularities and blow-up of the related quantities will be analyzed.          &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Complex, real-life systems in sociology, economics, and life sciences often contain a large number of individuals that interact and can develop a collective behavior; these are exactly the areas of sciences where this project draws the topics from and where mathematics could offer great insights and contributions. The understanding of diffusion processes and collective behavior is essential in many areas of science. The project focuses on investigating a class of mean field and kinetic models that can describe very well interactions among agents, collective behavior and averaging processes. Applications of such a study range from game theory (decisional strategies, behavior of investors), socio-economic (opinion formation, population dynamics), to biology (tumor growth, flocking) and neuroscience.   The project will also provide education and training through research to undergraduate and graduate students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The outcome of this project focuses on the qualitative study of solutions to nonlinear partial differential equations that appear as novel mathematical models in various applications, such as game theory, socio-economic science and neuroscience. The problems are quite complex due to the fact that the nonlinearity of the system allows for highly nontrivial interactions. Understanding these interactions is fundamental not just in mathematics but also in physics, engineering and social sicence. In the past years several progresses have been made in settling fundamental questions on existence of solutions, as well as their long time behavior, singularity formation and interactions.          The PI studied several models, including linear and nonlinear systems of partial differential equations with nonlinear singular sources. Analysis of these systems face common difficulties caused by nonlinearity and high differential order, and consequently the potential lack of maximum and comparison principle. Furthermore, some of the proposed models involve coupled equations with some data posed at initial time and some other at the final time. Hence new techniques were required. The new developed techniques encompass several approaches: (i) the kinetic approach, based on the entropy-entropy dissipation method, which has been used for scalar linear and nonlinear equations as well as for systems of diffusion equations, (ii) techniques from statistical mechanics and particle systems, which give additional informations on qualitative properties of the solutions by analyzing the underlying particle model, (iii) variational techniques, where generalized Csiszar-Kullback inequalities are used to estimates the dissipative effects in the system, (iv) geometric theory for non- linear evolution equations, which allows for the study of asymptotics behavior of the solutions by investigating the spectral properties of the linearized equation, and (v) functional analysis and semigroup theory approach, where decay estimates on semi- groups are proven via estimates on the resolvent of the operator.      The PI has mentored several graduate and undergraduate students, developed new and interdisciplinary courses, published her research funding in several journals, and has been strongly supporting a very diverse group of young people interested in mathematics.
