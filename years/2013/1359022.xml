<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) and the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) in the Biological Sciences Directorate supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site at Case Western Reserve University, led by Professors James Burgess and Blanton S Tolbert. Student groups will focus on Energy and Materials, and on Chemical Biology, the two main research thrusts in the Department. The REU program focuses on areas such as recruitment of under-represented students and women into chemical research, and addressing hurdles experienced by students (including women and minorities) considering higher positions along the scientific pipeline. The REU students should develop confidence and become further motivated to pursue a career in chemical research. Having accomplished meaningful research at Case Western Reserve University, the REU students will be more qualified to enter the scientific workforce, become educators, or enter graduate programs across the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Chemistry REU site will strive to meet the following objectives: 1) For each summer program, a cohort of six students will be recruited that is approximately 50% female and 50% underrepresented minorities. 2) The student's interest will be matched with appropriate research projects and groups. 3) The REU site will develop and implement a mentor training program. 4) The REU site aims to enhance the undergraduates' sense of participation in the research community. 5) The REU site will be evaluated and the program will track participants' post-program plans. Students having these experiences will gain laboratory experiences in chemical research and will be engaged in meaningful experiences, which contribute to each mentor's research program. Student choice of research area is an important facet of this REU site. It is anticipated that results of the experiences will lead to publications having REU students as co-authors. Additionally, many of the REU students will find the research experience to be multidisciplinary, involving collaborations among groups across the University and elsewhere. This collaborative approach will provide training in today's team oriented research environment. REU students will become part of a larger community of young scholars on campus.</AbstractNarration>
