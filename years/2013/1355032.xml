<AbstractNarration>The ultimate goal of earthquake engineering is to mitigate the adverse effects of earthquakes on the society. This requires accurate prediction of structural responses to earthquakes.  Because of numerous factors, such as earthquake intensity, material properties, and construction quality that are unknown, there exists a certain level of uncertainty in the responses of structures. In earthquake engineering, this uncertainty must be quantified and considered in design of buildings to ensure safety. Currently, uncertainties are accounted for using empirical equations in the design of buildings.  In this project, a systematic method to accurately calculate the level of uncertainty in building responses during future earthquakes will be developed and demonstrated. Once the model is developed and implemented, it will provide a mechanism to increase the accuracy of earthquake response prediction, ultimately enabling engineers to build safer buildings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Currently, consideration of uncertainty in Perfomance Based Earthquake Engineering (PBEE) is simplified, empirical, and without experimental verification. The goal of this study is to develop a quantitative framework for uncertainty propagation in PBEE and verify it experimentally using a new approach termed herein as probabilistic shake table tests. Initially, an uncertainty propagation model will be developed based on principles of probability theory and structural dynamics. Then a specially designed shake table testing procedure, which will isolate the uncertainty contributions from different sources, will be conducted to collect the necessary data to calibrate and verify this model. Finally, the calibrated model will be applied to improve uncertainty modeling in performance based earthquake design and shake table test planning. This project will provide encouragement to the next generation of students to pursue a career in engineering through a Tri-Level (8th grade, 11th grade, and 2nd year college students) Academic Partnership program. Graduate students from different institutions will benefit from a project-based competition component developed as part of this project for graduate earthquake engineering classes.</AbstractNarration>

In structural engineering, it is very important to make efficient and safe decisions when designing structures considering the uncertainty in earthquake events. Traditional ways to consider earthquake uncertainty in structural responses rely heavily on numerical simulation which provides little insight on how the uncertainty characteristics of earthquakes influence structural responses. This project developed a set of semi-closed form formulas that can be used to calculated structural response uncertainty given earthquake uncertainty characteristics. Through theoretical investigation, the researchers discovered a viable way to calculate the uncertainty in linear and bilinear structural system earthquake responses. Although the linear and bilinear systems are highly abstractive, most of the well-designed structures behave linearly under frequent earthquakes and similar to a bilinear hysteretic system in larger earthquakes. This method is different from the existing ways to predict earthquake induced uncertainty, which is either over-simplified or highly computationally expensive. Two peer-reviewed journal papers were published that summarized the major theoretical findings of this study. Through a unique testing program, the researchers validated part of their theoretical findings.
