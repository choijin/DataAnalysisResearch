<AbstractNarration>The Exploratorium?s Institute for Inquiry (IFI) has planned a 2-day conference that will examine current strategies, issues and future challenges related to teacher professional development regarding integrating inquiry-oriented science instruction and English Language Development (ELD) for K-5 students.  The conference convenes 40 researchers and professional development practitioners who examine theory and practice in inquiry-based science instruction and ELD, focusing on three overall objectives:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1.  Learn how inquiry-oriented science instruction can provide a good context for learning English and science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2.  Address the conceptual challenges and perspectives that inquiry-oriented science instruction and ELD present.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3.  Articulate the issues that the challenges of inquiry science and ELD present to professional development programs that support teachers in adapting their knowledge and classroom practice to an integrated science/ELD approach.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference keynote, delivered by Guadalupe Valdés, addresses the language demands and opportunities that are introduced in the science and engineering practices described in the National Research Council?s Framework for K-12 Science Education and the NGSS. (The framework is based on a recent article co-authored by Valdés.)  Participants include practitioners and researchers in science education, teacher education, professional development, language acquisition, and bilingual education.  The conference will combine presentations providing overviews of current research and practice, combined with the use of case studies and working sessions to arrive at overall recommendations for directions for future research, professional development and practice.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Key conference outcomes include: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;- A set of research questions.&lt;br/&gt;- A set of principles and guidelines for professional development related to ELD and science.&lt;br/&gt;- Articles submitted to journals and professional publications by conference organizers and participants that will disseminate conference ideas, as well as conference presentations.&lt;br/&gt;- Partnerships developed between practitioners and researchers.&lt;br/&gt;- Case studies published on the IFI website.&lt;br/&gt;- Continuing dialogue via blogs, webinars, and the IFI website.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference outcomes will be disseminated through research and professional development journals, conference presentations, and the IFI website.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Exploring Science and English Language Development: Implications for Teacher Professional Learning   In January 2015, the Exploratorium convened a group of fifty national experts to share their varied and complementary perspectives on the relationship between English language development and science learning. Participants represented the fields of educational and applied linguistics, classroom practice, policy, teacher education, professional learning, and educational research. The overall objectives of the conference were to:  Learn about the realized and      theorized potential for inquiry-based science learning to be a      particularly good context for supporting English learners in both science      and ELD achievement. Explore the conceptual challenges      that the science inquiry perspective and the ELD perspective need to      understand about each other in order to arrive at both strong science and      strong ELD practices. Articulate issues involved in      applying these understandings to professional development programs that      support teachers in adapting their knowledge and classroom practice to      integrated science and ELD pedagogy. Distill lessons learned and      implications for specific project designs and research that can inform the      fields of science education, second language acquisition, and teacher      preparation and professional development.   The conference included presentations, case studies, explorations, and working groups intended to further catalyze the growing interest in the overlap between science, English language development and teacher professional learning. The key questions that the conference sought to address were framed by (1) the notion that science can serve as a powerful context for language development, and (2) a shift away from traditional views of language acquisition, which focus on language as a set of forms and structures, towards current models of research and practice, which emphasize the acquisition of language through use in social interaction and meaningful engagement in disciplinary practices. Those questions included:  What do teachers need to      understand about learning science, learning language in the context of      science, and pedagogy that would support both? What design principles can guide      the creation of professional learning experiences that enable teachers to      make science a good context for language development? What research questions can      support future efforts to create professional learning experiences for      science &amp; language development?   The conference generated a series of related products, posted online to serve as resources for educators, researchers, professional learning providers, and others with an interest in how science can serve as a context for English language development.  Plenary      Sessions: Videos of the opening presentations designed to      establish the key issues of the conference. Interviews      with Participants: Videos of conversations with selected      conference participants that explore various topics related to the fields      of science education, professional learning, and English language      development. Documentation      and Resources: A synthesis of the main ideas of the conference,      a written transcription of all conference sessions, and a collection of      supporting materials.
