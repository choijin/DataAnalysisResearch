<AbstractNarration>The proposed project, which will build upon a successful NSF EAGER grant, will help arctic researchers explain the significance of their research widely to the general public?which, in today?s technologically connected world means not only in the U.S., but worldwide- and to reflect the diversity of the scientific enterprise Alaska.  As proposed, the current Frontier Scientist?s schedule of science reporting will be enhanced by a broadcast TV series titled Frontier Scientists to engage a larger viewing audience. A ?Do It Yourself? (DIY) component will help scientists to create their, professional-caliber media that will sustain the publics? interest and feedback in their research. An evaluation regime will insure appropriate quality and depth of communication, throughout the lifecycle of each science story.</AbstractNarration>

Featured scientists become better communicators, and learn to bring their research to life. When viewers see their genuine wonder, they can be motivated to ask questions and pursue more information about the topic, broadening community participation. Digital media is a community builder, an inclusive tool that lets people continents-apart engage with compelling stories and then interact.     Science for Tourists in Alaska  Frontier Scientists joined "Visit Anchorage," a tourism hub in Alaska. FS made presentations at a number of volunteer meetings to inform the volunteers about the website and broadcast programs, so they could pass the word along to tourists. The short videos were of interest to business members of the organization, who sent links to tourists before they came to Alaska to allow them to better understand the rural areas they were traveling through or visiting.  Significant Results  Over the past three years Frontier Scientists has achieved a number of results that surprised us as well as a number of other professionals.  Our Frontier Scientists web site consistently built an audience.  Our social media efforts brought in people from Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Pinterest etc.  We worked with University of Alaska Fairbanks undergraduates on building a FS App and creating a video game titled Arctic UAV?s.  Over the three year project we worked with five different students.  Liz O?Connell arranged for outside experts to phone conference with specific advice to accomplish goals.  Jay Byam, upon graduating, secured a job with one of the companies we consulted.   The broadcast programs in the Frontier Scientists series began building an audience on public TV in Alaska.  The Nielsen ratings Frontier Scientists received indicates there is a public audience appetite for science programs about the Arctic with not so famous scientists. Three woman scientists we created videos with have significant achievements: Gwen Holdmann and Tamara Harms, University of Alaska Fairbanks, were selected as Arctic Fulbright scholars announced, April 21, 2015. Karyn Rode, USGS wildlife researcher, will be on Science Friday sometime in March 2017.    The workshops for scientists, educators, and professionals provided hands-on learning, experience, discussion of methods and best practices for a professional product. Videos have been used as reference for grants, thesis papers, and job applications.  We believe because often times a person who has not been in the arctic has a difficult time understanding the scientists working conditions and the working capabilities of the equipment in a field situation.  The videos show and tell more than just a written description of the materials and methods.  Laura Nielsen was not a science writer before she began the Frontier Scientist project but over the past 4 years she has written most of the FS blogs and has become a quick study for the variety of science topics FS covers.  The project results have been disseminated by a final evaluation by PEER associates residing on the CAISE web site.
