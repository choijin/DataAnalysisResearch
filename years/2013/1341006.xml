<AbstractNarration>Syracuse University's OrangeGrid uses the HTCondor High Throughput Computing System and a custom virtual machine manager to allow idle computers in offices and student labs to run research-computing tasks. With over 7000 CPU cores, and growing, OrangeGrid is used by Syracuse University's research and teaching community for science and engineering applications.  Science drivers for OrangeGrid come from a diverse range of projects, including gravitational-wave astronomy, biological physics, theoretical condensed-matter physics, computational fluid dynamics, high-energy physics, Earth sciences, soft matter physics, and biomedical and chemical engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CC-NIE Networking Infrastructure project at Syracuse University upgrades the campus network infrastructure to support data-intensive research computing on OrangeGrid. This project increases the campus backbone bandwidth from 10Gbps to 40Gbps and provides 10Gbps links to the buildings providing the largest number of OrangeGrid cores. This project directly affects the usability and productivity of OrangeGrid, opening it to a wider-range of science and engineering projects from SU researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;OrangeGrid is an important resource for Syracuse University's faculty and students. The combination of easy access and power make OrangeGrid especially important to beginning researchers and small groups who do not have their own computing resources.  Undergraduate and graduate students from the College of Engineering and Computer Science and the College of Arts and Sciences have access to OrangeGrid, giving them early experience with high-throughput research computing.  The experiences gained from running OrangeGrid provide a road map for other universities who wish to leverage unused cycles from desktop computing for scientific research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project provided funding to upgrade the Syracuse University campus network backbone from 10 Gigabit to 40 Gigabit links, and to upgrade building connectivity from 1 Gigabit to 10 Gigabit. These network upgrades were targeted to support OrangeGrid, a high-throughput computing grid constructed from idle cycles on Syracuse University's desktop computing. Scientists from a variety of disciplines at Syracuse University have been using OrangeGrid for science and engineering projects.   Over 75 scientists have made significant used Orange Grid computational resources in the last two years. The total number of CPU hours provided to the projects listed in last year's report by the infrastructure enabled by this project is:  Soft Matter Physics: 10 million CPU hours Gravitational-wave Astronomy: 158 million CPU hours Fluid Mechanics Research: 1.8 million CPU hours Computational Chemistry: 7.8 million CPU hours Computational Biology: 19 million CPU hours Quantum Gravity: 1.2 million CPU hours   During the two years of this award, this computing has led to 22 peer-reviewed publications, with more publications in progress.  In addition 60 million CPU hours have been comitted to citizen science projects and 54 million CPU hours to the Open Science Grid.  Use of OrangeGrid has been integrated into the graduate and undergraduate teaching curriculum at Syracuse University, allowing students to learn the methods of high-throughput computing for use in their research. 50% of the scientists making high use of OrangeGrid were graduate students. Two undergraduate students consumed over 2.6 million CPU hours on research projects that led to scientific publications.
