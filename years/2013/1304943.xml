<AbstractNarration>Fossil insects provide a unique deep-time record of ecological and evolutionary response to past environmental changes and therefore are invaluable for understanding the impacts of climate change on the current biodiversity crisis.  Given current models of future climate change and the important role that insects play in human society (biodiversity, pests, pollination, vectors of disease) the ability to access these data and make predictions about future insect populations becomes even more urgent. The Fossil Insect Collaborative will make available all the major collections of fossil insect specimens in the United States by creating electronic specimen records consisting of digital images and associated collection data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The digitized fossil insect collections will be made broadly accessible to the research community, K-16 education, government and industry, the general public, and the media through the project website and a central site integrating all the paleobiological Thematic Collections Networks called iDigPaleo.  Mobile apps and activities that allow a wide variety of users to experience and interact directly with the collections data will be developed. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).</AbstractNarration>

On land they have unique ecological significance, as the premier pollinators; as disease vectors; and as the main parasites and predators of insects that feed on forests and crops -- effects estimated in value to hundreds of billions of dollars yearly.&nbsp; Insects are also ancient.&nbsp; Is their great success just due to a steady accrual of species over 420 million years?&nbsp; Or do insects form species (diversify) more quickly than, say, mammals, birds, or reptiles?&nbsp; Are they less prone to extinction?</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the natural history collections of a consortium of U.S. museums and universities there reside over 100,000 specimens of fossil insects preserved in shale, limestone, and amber from around the world, which collectively provide data essential to answering questions about why insects are so diverse.&nbsp; At the American Museum of Natural History, in the course of two years of NSF funding and two additional years, 16,540 fossil insect specimens were databased and more than 5,000 of them imaged.&nbsp; Particular strengths of the AMNH collection are from the Cretaceous Period (66 to 145 million years ago [mya]), primarily of Brazil, Burma, Lebanon, and New Jersey; and from the Cenozoic (66 mya and younger) of Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Wyoming, Dominican Republic, Mexico, the Baltic Region, and India.&nbsp;&nbsp; A complete inventory facilitates research on the collections by scientists around the world, and has already revealed some preliminary results.&nbsp; For example, insect species do seem to diversify more rapidly than vertebrates, and many groups of them appear less prone to extinctions.&nbsp; Some insect families have become extinct in the past 145 million years, but relatively few.&nbsp; Also, climate change can actually allow certain types of insects to greatly expand their ranges, the best example being 40 myo tsetse flies from Colorado.&nbsp; This obviously has profound implications for the modern spread of diseases carried by all sorts of blood-feeding arthropods, like mosquitoes and ticks.&nbsp; Lastly, fossil deposits that have yielded the largest amount of specimens also have the most number of (extinct) species, showing that sampling effects are extremely important.&nbsp; But many of those species are very rare ones, and represent the earliest records of many families.&nbsp; The more you dig, the older insects seem to become.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Broader Impacts</strong>.&nbsp; AMNH accomplishments in this area are primarily in student training and public outreach.&nbsp; Over a two-year period four NYC high school students in the AMNH Science Research Mentoring Program (SRMP) were involved in screening rough amber from various deposits (especially 52 myo India amber), to examine for insects and other organisms preserved inside.&nbsp; They prepared pieces, did photomicrography, identified and studied the inclusions, studied the concepts and context of their findings, and at the end of the year prepared posters for presentation at the annual SRMP symposium.&nbsp; In the experience of the PI, this sort of laboratory exploration is a highly effective way to engage students from grade school to grad school, in earth history, evolutionary biology and other facets of science.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another educational outreach by the PI during the grant was as a Visiting Curator at the Houston Museum of Natural Sciences in 2016, preparing an exhibit "Amber Secrets from the Age of Dinosaurs."&nbsp; Over 110 display-quality pieces of 100 myo Burmese amber were selected, for appeal and interest, ranging from fungi and plants, to insects and small vertebrates.&nbsp; The PI wrote all label copy, prepared photomicrographs, advised on lighting and design, and provided 3-d renderings of CT scans of select pieces for the exhibit;
