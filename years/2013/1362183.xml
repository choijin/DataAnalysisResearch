<AbstractNarration>With this New award, the Chemical Synthesis Program supports Professor Erin T. Pelkey of Hobart and William Smith Colleges in a study of the synthesis of cyclic molecules with nitrogen in their rings. Since these structures are ubiquitous in compounds of biomedical significance, the development of new selective and efficient methods for their synthesis is an important goal.  These methods will expand the repertory of tools available to synthetic chemists seeking to develop new routesto wide range of biologically important natural products, drugs, and related compounds of medicinal interest. The research will involve extensive collaboration with undergraduate research students, including those from historically under-represented groups, and will provide these young scientists with valuable training in organic synthetic techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate convergent routes to 3,4-diarylpyrrolinones from tetramic acid precursors. In particular, the project will investigate the convergent stepwise attachment of aromatic and heteroaromatic groups to C-3 and C-4 positions of tetramic acid by a variety of cross-coupling reactions. Subsequent intramolecular aryl-aryl couplings leading to dibenzo[e,g]isoindol-1-ones will be studied. These investigations, which will take advantage of the ready availability of tetramic acids, will focus on maximizing convergent synthetic methodology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[      The majority of pharmaceutical agents contain at least one heterocyclic ring due to their tunable electronic properties, conformational rigidity, and bioavailability.  Developing efficient, selective, and flexible methods to prepare heterocyclic-containing compounds from simple starting materials is an important goal in organic chemistry.  One strategy for improving the efficiency of a synthesis involves increasing the overall convergency.  Convergent synthetic approaches involve combining major structural parts of the final target molecule at or towards the end of the synthetic sequence.  Conversely, traditional approaches to heterocyclic-containing molecules often involve long, linear sequences where structural parts are added one-by-one along a path; the drawback being that an entire sequence often needs to be repeated in order to make changes to the target.  Therefore, the benefit of a convergent approach is the simplified preparation of different molecules (or analogs) as the structural components are added at the end or towards the end of a sequence, eliminating the need to repeat an entire sequence.       Small heterocycles that contain multiple aryl group appendages are attractive synthetic targets given their wide range of reported biological activity.  During the course of this funded investigation, we developed two convergent synthetic strategies and applied them to the synthesis of a wide range of aryl and heteroaryl-substituted heterocycles (pyrrolinones and furanones).  Both strategies involved the use of aryltetramic and aryltetronic acids as linchpin building blocks.  The first strategy involved converting the enolic moiety of the tetramic/tetronic acid into a triflate and applying Suzuki cross-coupling reactions to add on benzene rings.  The second strategy, and one of the key findings of this work, involved the direct replacement of the enolic moiety with indole rings, which was achieved through the use of a Lewis acid mediator. These approaches represent significant improvement to the preparation of these types of molecules over previous approaches.       Over the past four years, 16 undergraduate students have been engaged in developing and carrying out the synthetic strategies that have allowed for the preparation of dozens of analogs with four different substitution patterns (benzene?benzene; benzene?indole; indole?benzene; indole?benzene).  We also initiated a collaboration with a biologist at our institution to evaluate the biological activity of these compounds in cancer cell lines.  Given the flexibility of our synthetic methods, we were able to explore a variety of structure-activity relationships within these diversely-substituted heterocyclic molecules.  We have recently found analogs that have demonstrated sub-micromolar potency in U937 leukemia cells.  Future plans for this work include the synthesis and biological evaluation of analogs containing new substitution patterns.      Funding this work contributed significantly to the professional development of undergraduate scientists who are embarking on wide range of careers that include synthetic organic chemistry (via graduate school), medical school and related health professions (e.g., nursing), pharmacy, and other professional careers (law school).   These students have been trained to work collectively as part of team in addition to developing their technical and critical thinking skills in the organic chemistry lab context.  Advanced students typically are involved in the project for 2 years, and thus become intimately involved in the planning of experiments, interpretation of spectral data, and the writing of the manuscripts describing our results. These students are poised to help contribute to the betterment of society through both their understanding of the importance of science and through their actual contributions to advancing the state of the art in the field of organic chemistry (four publications and counting).
