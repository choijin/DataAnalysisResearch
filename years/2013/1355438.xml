<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  IIA-1355438&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Powering the Kentucky Bioeconomy for a Sustainable Future &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Institution:   University of Kentucky Research Foundation&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Description&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to develop new technologies for energy generation and storage in addition to new membranes that can be used in environmental remediation. Three interlinked research activities are proposed in the areas of Advanced Bio-Inspired Membrane Technologies, Chemical Biology for Advanced Materials, and Electrochemical Energy Storage. Research activities will lead to batteries that are self- repairing, lower cost and more efficient than currently available. These sustainable energy technologies can support manufacturing efforts and create employment in Kentucky. This project develops research and education activities to engage a wide number of constituents.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;Kentucky EPSCoR addresses sustainable energy and power provision, a topic of national importance as greater focus is placed on transitioning energy demand from non-renewable resources (for example, coal) to renewable resources. Efforts under this project could completely re-invent engineering membranes to be selective chemical pumps and construct nano-architectures that harness the capabilities of complex bio-molecules. Also examined are biochemical lignification pathways, lignin chemistry, and deconstruction strategies to engineer biomass feedstocks and processing methods for direct conversion of lignin, with a significant focus is on diverse value added and fuel products. Energy generation and storage will be explored with a goal of creating a decreased environmental footprint. The use of novel bio-based battery materials will also be explored. Efforts are focused on inventing new material systems for self-healing electrodes and creating high area conductive nanostructures from biomass resources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will train a modern STEM workforce. New STEM programs, mentoring, and research opportunities will specifically recruit females, first generation college students, rural students and low income students from the Appalachian regions of Kentucky. Other initiatives include student research internships, workshops and the creation of a statewide Wiki Collaboratory to disseminate information about research and education activities and events. High school teachers will also be supported to receive STEM training related to renewable energy research. Significant ties are developed between academic research and industrial research leading to increased commercialization and economic development opportunities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award was fundamental in advancing our understanding of emerging technologies in three areas: (1) advanced bioinspired membranes to enable low-cost, low fouling separations that are useful in a number of practical applications such as removing salt and toxins from water to make it potable, and separating lignin in plants from other plant material, which allows for the isolated lignin (when converted to lignin sulfonate) to in turn be incorporated into cellulose membranes, for example, to enhance their antifouling behavior, (2) electrochemical energy storage advancements to enable low-cost batteries with longer lifecycles and advanced features such as self-repair and components constructed from alternative natural  materials such as plant lignin, and (3) understanding the biological pathways in plants to increase lignin content and convert lignin chemically into high-value chemicals and products while also understanding the economics behind introducing these important plants on a large scale to ensure their abundant supply.  The researchers on this project developed 288 scientific journal publications detailing their advancements in these three areas. The award was also responsible for supporting numerous education, outreach, and diversity events to give tens of thousands of Kentuckians a better understanding of how scientific advancements in these areas of economic importance to the state can impact their lives both financially and with a better quality of life.  A few novel outcomes of the research include:  A novel technique for pre-treating non-edible crop residue material (such as walnut shells and peach pits) that resulted in a significantly higher amount of lignin being separated from the plant waste material, which in turn can be converted into biofuels and other high-value chemicals.  An advanced understanding of the mechanical behavior of silicon-based negative electrodes, which have ten times higher capacity compared to the graphite electrodes used in today's popular lithium ion batteries.  Identifying and genetically mapping candidate genes in plant samples that show promise in resistance to lignin inducing compounds, which offers the promise of novel new natural herbicides.    This award supported the research and advancement of 18 new faculty hires at Kentucky's postsecondary institutions at both research institutions and primarily undergraduate institutions.  These faculty members were enabled through the award to develop their research labs and advance their academic careers.  The award had a measurable impact in establishing competitive research infrastructure in Kentucky as measured by the increase in funded proposals from the National Science Foundation (the mandate of the program) - Kentucky's percentage of NSF's awarded research budget increased from .35% to &gt;.50% over the five years of the project.  The participants on this project also introduced 43 new patent applications into the state's intellectual property pipeline over the course of the award.  Finally, the award also had a very important measurable impact in promoting diverse participation and increasing participant students' retention and graduation rates.  For example, undergraduate student participants in this program from Kentucky State University, the state's only Historically Black College/University, demonstrated a retention rate 26 points higher than that of their institutional peers and a six-year graduation rate three times higher than the University's rate for its entire student body.
