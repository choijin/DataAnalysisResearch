<AbstractNarration>The project aims at  supporting the U.S. participation in a conference organized jointly by a group of scientists at Bar-Ilan University, Hebrew University, ORT Braude College and the University of Miami in the US to be held in Nahariya Israel on May 19-24, 2013. The participants will be prominent scientists, young researchers and students from the US, Canada, the European Union, Eastern Europe and Asia. Recently, techniques from complex analysis (e.g., the concepts of Schwarz function, quadrature domains, complex harmonic maps) have given new lines of attack on some long standing problems in physics, e.g., Hele-Shaw flows, gravitational lensing, Laplacian growth, etc. The presentations at the conference range from plenary lectures describing recent breakthrough results in Complex Analysis, Dynamical Systems and Mathematical Physics, in a form accessible to advanced graduate students and young researchers, to more specialized talks on more focused research topics. Each of the past conferences attracted a significant number of US Ph.D. students and postdoctoral researchers. The proposal's main goals are to build on the development of collaborations between mathematicians and mathematical physicists from all over the world, young and experienced.  The project strives to increase the existing momentum and bring in another group of young US researchers and graduate students into collaboration with colleagues worldwide,  initiate US young researchers and graduate students into an active research scene worldwide and introduce them to most of the active researchers in complex analysis from all over the world.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Supporting the travel of young researchers and graduate students to such a conference where scientists from North and South America, Europe and Asia, old and young, prominent and just beginning, are spending all their waking hours together in an inspiring and congenial environment will inspire many beginning researchers. There are already several graduate students and young post-docs that will be participating in the conference. The project aims to significantly increase the participation of young students and researchers. One of the most important broader impacts of the project is also to increase participation of women and minorities in the event and insure their inclusion into a larger group of scientists working in the areas of the conference.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project supported U.S. mathematicians and mathematical physicists who attended the conference on Complex Analysis and Dynamical Systems that was held in Nahariya, Israel, May 19 &ndash; 24, 2013. The subject matter covered by the topics of the conference incorporated a broad territory between complex analysis, dynamical systems and physics. Quite recently, techniques from complex analysis  have given a new line of attack on some of the classical problems in physics, such as Hele-Shaw flows, gravitational lensing, Laplacian growth problems and many others. The goals of the conference were to accelerate scientific advances in the areas covered in the workshop by joint efforts of mathematicians and physicists working together;  increase internationalization of newly developed and existing collaborations of researchers in these areas; foster longer term collaborative projects; give young researchers and students, especially those from underrepresented groups and minorities, the unique opportunity of a close and informal contact with prominent mathematicians and physicists from both continents. Supporting the travel of promising young researchers and graduate students to such a conference where scientists from North and South America, Australia, Europe and Asia, old and young, prominent and just beginning, were essentially spending 24 hours together in an inspiring and congenial environment, discussing appealing and important problems in mathematics and physics, will have a lasting impact on the future research careers of many younger scientists.
