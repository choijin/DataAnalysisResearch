<AbstractNarration>The advent of sophisticated photo editing software has made it increasingly easier to manipulate digital images.  Often visual inspection cannot definitively distinguish the resulting forgeries from authentic photographs.  In response, forensic techniques have emerged to detect geometric or statistical inconsistencies that result from specific forms of photo manipulation.  The PI aspires to develop new forensic methods based on geometric content analysis, which focus on finding inconsistencies in the geometric relationships among objects depicted in a photograph.  The geometric relationships in a 2D image correspond to the projection of the relations that exist in the 3D scene; if a scene is known to contain a given relationship but the projected relation does not hold in the photograph, then one may conclude that the photograph is not a true projective image of the scene.  With this in mind, the PI's goal in this exploratory project is to build a set of testable constraints that must be satisfied in real images, so that an unsatisfied constraint constitutes definitive, objective evidence of image manipulation.  Fundamental challenges of this work include: developing tools for analysis from incomplete lighting information, building testable models of skin reflectance, accounting for structured uncertainty in feature comparison, and establishing method guidelines for forensic image analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  This project will create tools for objectively detecting image manipulation, which will help reporters, law enforcement, scientists, and others differentiate between legitimate photographs and forged images.  The products of this research will be communicated via academic publications and online source code.  Collaborations with industrial partners will allow the research to have practical impact as well.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Advances in photo editing software have made it possible to create visually compelling photographic forgeries. The ubiquity of manipulated images has undermined our trust in photography, and impacts law enforcement, national security, the media, advertising, commerce, and more.      We have developed  forensic techniques for measuring the consistency, or lack thereof, of shading and cast and attached shadows. Unlike previous approaches, instead of explicitly trying to estimate the lighting in a scene, we seek to extract and combine a multitude of partial constraints on the projected location of the light source. This approach allows us to contend with situations in which the lighting is under-constrained and cannot be explicitly estimated, a common problem in a forensic setting in which only a single image of uncertain origin is available.      The goal of this work is to provide methods that can be used to objectively detect certain type of manipulation in images by testing geometric constraints.  When the conmtratints are not mutually consistent, they provide an objective proof that the image is not authentic.  When combined with other complementary methods for testing different aspects of an image, the results is a series of tests that can be applied to validate an image.  These tests make it compoundingly more difficult for forgers to successfully create manipulated images that escape detection.
