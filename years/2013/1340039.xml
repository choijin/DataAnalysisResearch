<AbstractNarration>Clark Atlanta University's (CAU's) Robert Noyce Capacity Building project is supporting CAU's effort to build a K-12 science educator preparation program based on partnerships between CAU STEM departments, the School of Education, and the Atlanta and Clayton County Public Schools.  New curriculum is being developed for undergraduate STEM majors and STEM graduates wishing to earn certification for high school teaching with a particular emphasis on developing highly qualified, culturally competent science educators for high need school districts.  The curriculum under development is responsive to state, district, and national professional associations science education standards.  This teacher certification program is based on a strong STEM subject matter curriculum, leading to a B.S. degree in a STEM field, such that the developing educators are fully prepared to teach the subject matter without trepidation and to keep up with advances in their chosen science field.  The new curriculum provides opportunities to test hypotheses about science achievement in urban 7-12 classrooms and translate these findings into a district specific set of "best practices" for teaching and learning science.  Broader impacts of this project include enhanced STEM teaching at the secondary level where STEM majors and non-majors alike benefit from STEM classes taught by faculty with knowledge, skills, and cultural competence.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF Robert Noyce Capacity Building project has supported Clark Atlanta University's (CAU's) efforts to develop its K-12 science educator preparation program.  Faculty from the departments of chemistry and mathematics have worked with faculty form the School of Education to map the align current STEM curriculum and course content with State of Georgia and national professional associations high school chemistry and mathematics teacher training standards.  Course syllabi have been updated as necessary to reflect these standards and student learning outcomes.  Four-year degree plans incorporating STEM B.S. degree requirements, and the necessary education courses and field experiences (practicums) have been developed and submitted for approval that allow students to complete a B.S. in chemistry or mathematics, respectively, with the potential for teacher certification in four years.  These degree plans have been developed with an emphasis on preparing highly qualified, culturally competent science educators for high need school districts while maintaining all content necessary to earn B.S. in chemistry or mathematics, respectively, such that the developing educators are fully prepared to teach the subject matter without trepidation and to keep up with advances in their STEM major.  Through this project most of our chemistry and mathematics faculty have been exposed to culturally competent teaching pedagogy and the development of rubrics for the assessment of student learning outcomes; skills the support our training of the next generation of teachers.  As CAU is a comprehensive, private, urban, coeducational institution of higher education with a predominantly African-American heritage, the broader impacts of this project include the preparation of a secondary STEM teachers of color that implement culturally competent teaching methods and are trained to be successful in high need schools which will help to ameliorate the chronic shortage of science teachers - particularly at high need schools and foster greater participation in and improved achievement in science by students of color.
