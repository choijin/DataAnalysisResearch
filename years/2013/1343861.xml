<AbstractNarration>Collaborative Research: The effects of river regulation on lateral and integrated longitudinal mass and energy transfers in coupled terrestrial-aquatic systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Rivers and shallow groundwater are inter-connected and continuously exchange water; river water temporarily circulates through the beds and banks of rivers. The lateral exchange zone (LEZ) in the banks affects instream water quality since microbial communities in the LEZ consume water-borne nutrients and solutes. We know little about how local LEZ processes integrate to impact instream water quality for large rivers. Globally, 60% of major rivers are regulated by dams and some dam-regulated rivers are subject to periodic (daily) floods. This study will examine and understand how flow and dynamic biogeochemical regimes in regulated rivers impact nutrient and thermal energy transfers through the river corridor. It will lead to understanding of biogeochemical processes in human-impacted surface-subsurface hydrologic systems. Through field observations along a 90-km section of the 6-th order Lower Colorado River in Texas and through coupled numerical simulations of instream and LEZ processes, we will determine how the dynamic expansion/contraction of the LEZ during flooding/recession controls chemical reaction rates and heat transfer within the LEZ, and how this in turn impacts instream water quality and downstream delivery of solutes and energy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will generate knowledge that is useful for the management of dam-regulated rivers. Texas has the most dams amongst all states with many more planned as part of a recent state bill that allocates resources for water infrastructure. It is critical that the trade-offs and potential effects of river-regulation on LEZ processes, groundwater and instream water quality, and river ecology be understood. This has seldom been studied and this investigation will help fill this knowledge gap. Further, the study will train the next generation of hydrologic engineers and scientists and increase public awareness of the importance of river-groundwater interactions, particularly within the context of regulated rivers. Students from K-12, BS, MA/MS, to PhD level, and K-12 teachers will participate in the research. Field trips to the site will be organized for K-12 students. Outreach lectures will be presented to the public.</AbstractNarration>

The research team investigated how flooding produced by controlled dam releases impact the exchange of water, heat and chemicals between the river and the shallow sediment of the riverbed and the riparian zone. The study involved extensive measurements at different locations on the Lower Colorado River (LCR) in central Texas, from Austin to Bastrop. The measurements included monitoring for discharge and flow in the river, water levels and pressure within the sediment and the banks, water temperature, and sampling for water and gas samples for chemical analyses. The investigators also developed and implemented a collection of novel mathematical models to describe and further interrogate the processes of interest, particularly the chemical reactions in the water that take place as water infiltrates from the river, flows through the river bed and bank sediment, and then reverses and returns to the river after the flood has passed.

This supports little denitrification of river water since there is minimal hyporheic exchange and mixing; (2) Large floods rapidly change the temperatures of riparian zone sediment with effects that last over several days to a few weeks; (3) Floods from typical dam releases in the LCR lead to substantial bi-directional exchange of water between the beds and banks and the river. This infiltrating and exchanged water undergoes chemical reactions which can reduce the concentration of nutrient pollution; (4) When river stage fluctuates, and when these fluctuations are accompanied by stream temperature variations, the streambed area adjacent the bank experiences the largest temperature fluctuations, whereas the range of this temperature variation is damped towards the center of the river channel; (5) In reaches below dams, pronounced reversing water exchange in bank occurs well beyond 100 km downstream of dams.
