<AbstractNarration>Planning is one of the key technologies in robotics. Yet, robots are deployed in only a small number of niche areas, and most deployed robots have very minimal planning capability. This workshop discusses how the field of robot planning should progress to make robots deployable more widely, performing more novel tasks and relying less on human supervision. It brings together researchers from robotics, artificial intelligence, and related research disciplines to discuss the state of the art in planning, its use in various robotic applications and current research challenges. By studying planning research across different applications, analyzing planning challenges as part of complete robot architectures, and discussing the interaction of planning with other robot modules (such as perception, control, and user interfaces), the workshop participants will gain new insights into how planning can help robots become more robust and efficient. The workshop consists of invited talks, breakout sessions, panels and a final discussion aiming to converge on the roadmap for the field of robot planning that will be summarized in a report. The report and all presentations will be posted on the workshop website. The workshop is expected to stimulate future research towards robot planning in the real world and have strong potential to enable advances in all areas of robotics, from home assistance to medicine to exploration to manufacturing.</AbstractNarration>
