<AbstractNarration>The overall goal of this project is to advance the computational theory and algorithms for equilibria and fixed points.  Many problems from different areas can be formulated as the problem of computing a fixed point of a suitable function F. Examples include the computation of Nash equilibria of games, price equilibria in markets,  the value and optimal strategies for stochastic and other dynamic games, the analysis of various basic stochastic models (branching processes, stochastic context-free grammars, recursive Markov chains, and others) that arise in many areas. In some cases (e.g., Nash and market equilibria) one wishes to compute any fixed point, while in several others (e.g., stochastic models and games), the function F is monotone and one wishes to compute a specific fixed point, the least fixed point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The  project will build on recent progress to advance the theory and algorithms on two fronts: market equilibria, and least fixed point problems. In the first area, it will seek to develop a more systematic methodology and show general results that characterize what features make the market equilibrium problem hard and what features make it easy; it will advance our understanding of the computation of  equilibria, both on the hardness side and on the algorithmic side;  and it will try to resolve open questions regarding specific types of markets,  and limitations of price adjustment schemes. In the second area, the project will leverage recent powerful positive results to address and solve in a unified way basic problems on stochastic context-free grammars, quasi-birth-death processes, and other stochastic models that require the solution of more general classes of monotone fixed point equations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problems and models studied in this project are fundamental in various disciplines (including economics, game theory, biology, and various areas of computer science such as verification and natural language processing), and they have been studied and are used extensively. The research of the project will provide a systematic,  unified treatment of the underlying fundamental questions,  and will result in algorithms and insights that are useful in the various relevant areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project resulted in advances in the computational theory of fixed points and equilibria, and the development of new algorithms for computational problems in the analysis of basic stochastic models used in a variety of fields. A polynomial time algorithm was devised for the qualitative and quantitative reachability analysis of Branching Markov Decision Processes, a dynamic evolution model where entities of different types reproduce according to given probabilistic rules that can be affected by the actions of a controller who seeks to maximize or minimize the probability of eventually reaching a desired or undesired type. The optimal reachability problems can be formulated as greatest fixed point computation problems of systems of probabilistic polynomial equations with the max or min operator. Polynomial-time algorithms were developed for the solution of such equations to any desired precision.  Algorithms were developed  for some problems on stochastic context-free grammars, a fundamental model used in various areas. An algorithm was developed for the maximum probability parsing problem for general stochastic grammars and a close connection was established between the complexity of this problem and a number-theoretic conjecture.  The project studied also a connection between geometric programming and the computation of least fixed points of monotone polynomial equations, and the analysis of stochastic models, and showed positive and negative results on the power and limitations of geometric programming in this regard. A connection was established also between simple stochastic games (a well-studied model whose solution remains an open problem) and unique equilibria in 2-player games.  The project developed also graph theoretic methods for problems concerning power grids, in particular methods for information recovery following a joint cyber-physical attack, and for partitioning a grid into attack-resilient zones; and algorithms for balanced partitioning of a network into connected parts that balance approximately also supply and demand within the parts.
