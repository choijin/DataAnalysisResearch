<AbstractNarration>Nontechnical Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A full understanding of mountain-building and earthquake processes requires knowledge of three-dimensional variations in flow strength of continents. Measurements of flow strength are among the major goals of EarthScope, because they are key to understanding the timing and spatial distribution of earthquakes and volcanism, as well as the evolution of North America through time. Characterizing flow strength is challenging, however, because strength is very sensitive to three independent physical properties -- temperature, rock-type, and water content -- whose effects are not easily distinguished using commonly-used geophysical imaging techniques. This project identifies several diverse geophysical measurements that can be combined to separate the effects of temperature, rock type and water in the Earth's crust and upper mantle. In addition, this project is supporting the education of three graduate students and the development of software tools for use in graduate classrooms.  Finally, this project is providing maps and other data products that are widely useful to scientists working to understand such diverse topics as likelihood of future earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and the potential for economic mineral deposits at depth.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to determine the relative effects of temperature, water and lithology on strength of the North American continental lithosphere. The investigators are estimating temperature variations using uppermost mantle seismic velocities and surface heat flow measurements; characterizing crustal lithology from a combination of gravity and seismic receiver function data; and combining these with measurements of lithospheric flexural rigidity (an integral measure of bending strength) to assess the remainder effects of water on flow rheology. This novel approach to characterizing physical property variations enables in situ estimation of fully three-dimensional flow rheology of the lithosphere, and lends new insight into the dynamical processes of heat and fluid flux that determine mobility versus stability of continental lithosphere. When combined with new constraints on lithospheric mass density variations, these properties promise to revolutionize the Earth Science community's understanding of lithospheric evolution, deformation and dynamical processes. The grant supports research efforts by three graduate students. The Colorado State University PI and two M.S. students are estimating geothermal variations and associated uncertainties, and also developing a series of teaching tools to demonstrate concepts of lithospheric flexure and rheology to undergraduate Earth science students. The Utah State University PI and student are estimating anisotropic flexural rigidity, crustal lithology and thickness, and using the combined measurements to model the water content and rheology of the lithosphere.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Broadly speaking, understanding the causes of mountain ranges and many other large scale geologic processes involves knowing the forces that cause deformation, and the strengths that resist deformation.   In this project we focus on the latter, and have examined the role of temperature on the strength of the North American plate.   We find that not only is much of the western U.S. portion of the plate very hot and weak, but it is significantly weaker than just high temperatures would predict.   We infer that water from past subduction has been incorporated into the mineral structures in the western part of North America and weakened the plate.  Results have been presented at several meetings and faculty seminars, and will be submitted for publication soon.   Additionally, the study develped useful techniques, not only for calculating the temperature of the plate, but also for looking at the strain history of the plate and the deforming material below it, that can be used in a variety of different settings.  Our project also has economic relevance.   We have estimated temperatures within the plate for the western half of the U.S.  Knowing the thermal structure of the plate is important for understanding the temperatures hydrocarbon reservoirs have been subject to, which is needed to infer the type of hydrocarbon (such as tar, oil, or gas) within these reserviors.   It is also important for geothermal resources, and many places within the western U.S. have high geothermal potential.  Finally and importantly, the project provided opportunities and practical training for three graduate students, each involved in separate aspects of the study.
