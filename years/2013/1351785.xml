<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to design, fabricate and optimize ultrasensitive solution-processed polymer photodetectors with spectral responses ranging from 350 to 2600 nm that operate at room temperature. The objective will be accomplished by tuning the electronic functionality of the materials and optimizing the inverted device performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit includes the development of ultrasensitive inverted infrared polymer photodetectors that possess significant advantages over state-of-the-art inorganic photodetectors.  These advantages include solution processing methods for device fabrication and energy savings from ambient temperature operation. Polymer photodetectors that do not require cooling to obtain high detectivity would be a transformative breakthrough. Moreover, low-cost multi-color, high sensitivity and high-speed response over a broad spectral range would have a number of applications across multiple technology platforms. This program will advance the fundamental understanding about the chemical and morphological properties of the electronic materials and the inverted device architecture in the enhancement of device performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this program are found in the development of ultrasensitive inverted infrared photodetectors, which offer resolutions and sensitivities currently unachievable. The development of this technology at The University of Akron will increase the participation of the students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics disciplines by engaging K-12, high school and undergraduate students using inquiry-based methods. Hands on learning activities including Science Olympiad rocket design and "plastic" electronics modules mimic the proposed research outcomes. The highly interdisciplinary research provides a stimulating environment ideally suited for the education and training of graduate students, undergraduate students and high-school students.</AbstractNarration>
