<AbstractNarration>The partnership of the New Mexico Alliance for Minority Participation (New Mexico AMP, Senior Alliance) represents the state's public two-year postsecondary institutions and the state-supported four year universities. New Mexico AMP?s continuing goal is to increase the quantity and quality of minority students who complete B.S. degrees and who are currently underrepresented in the STEM disciplines. Specific attention is given to ensuring these students are well prepared to enter the STEM workforce and providing then with the encouragement, incentive, and motivation to pursue graduate education. Program activities attend to individual student retention and progression as well as to understanding the aggregation of student progression to graduate school entry and promoting the replication of best practices both within New Mexico and nationally through dissemination efforts. The Project Goals are as follow: &lt;br/&gt;-Increase the number of STEM students transferring from 2-year to 4-year institutions.&lt;br/&gt;-Refine and incorporate academic, curricular, and co-curricular enrichment activities designed to increase the quality of STEM graduates and increase the motivation, performance, and progression of talented students in preparation for graduate studies.&lt;br/&gt;-Provide direct student support for academic year and summer enrichment activities.&lt;br/&gt;-Increase URM STEM graduates by 23% over the previous five-year average of 528 to 650 per year.&lt;br/&gt;-Demonstrate an increase in the progression of undergraduate students to graduate school entry.&lt;br/&gt;-Maintain and continue to build meaningful partnerships with colleges and universities, school systems, government agencies, national laboratories and centers, industry, private foundations, and STEM professional organizations to support student development and success.</AbstractNarration>

NM AMP makes a strong contribution with other programs with a common visiion in the state to increase the number of baccalaureate degrees for underrepresented minorities in STEM. Underrepresented students earned 44% (N=665) of all STEM degrees in 2013-14, and in 2017-18, underrepresented students earned 52% (N=981) of all STEM degrees, with a total of 13,372 STEM degrees over the life of the program (up to 2018).awarded to underrepresented minority students.&nbsp;</p> <p>NM AMP gives specific attention to ensuring these students are well prepared to enter the STEM workforce and provided with the encouragement, incentive, and motivation to pursue graduate education.

Formative assessment activities will provide unique perspectives on student and faculty experiences, which will continuously inform project development. These processes and outcomes, together with summative evaluation data, will be shared and disseminated to the New Mexico AMP community as well as to additional regional and national audiences through publications and presentations designed to encourage replication of best practices. &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p> <p>New Mexico AMP contributes to the improved retention, graduation, and professional success of participating underrepresented STEM students, offering training and research experiences that influence and direct students? decisions, promote their intellectual growth, and broaden their global perspectives. These experiences also enhance institutional infrastructure for teaching and research, with previous successes in institutionalizing effective changes in STEM education and fostering a research environment that actively seeks opportunities to engage undergraduates in their disciplines. Significant impacts of the program contribute to economic development and improved living conditions for the citizens of New Mexico.

State-level efforts include development of leadership of faculty and students, in addition to value-added programs that assist students in transferring information to the classroom and beyond. These initiatives influence growth and change in the state directly and indirectly.&nbsp;<em>(The following analyses were prepared by Dr. James Peach, New Mexico State University Economist and Regents Professor, and his colleagues at the Arrowhead Center in the 2015-16 NM AMP Project Impact Statement for NSF.
