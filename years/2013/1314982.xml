<AbstractNarration>By combining single-photon technology with semiconductor electro-optical devices we investigate a scheme for a quantum CNOT gate. Such a gate is a fundamental building block of quantum computers and quantum communication systems. Nanofabrication and material-growth concepts will be implemented to create optical micro cavity structures with embedded artificial atoms in the form of a nanoscale semiconductor structure, called a quantum dots. A quantum dot, if positioned at the center of the cavity and at the cavity resonant frequency, will interact with an incoming photon in such a way that the photon polarization will become entangled with the electronic state of the quantum dot. This interaction establishes the quantum CNOT gate; the quantum state of the photon is changed depending on the quantum state of the electron.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research topic directly relates to the micro optoelectronics industry as well as to fundamental studies of confined electron properties in semiconductors. Potential applications in classical and quantum information storage and processing are expected to follow from this project. Since the interactions are at the single photon level, the devices will in principle be very energy efficient. It should however be mentioned that this study does require low-temperature operation conditions. Alternative implementations based on different cavity designs and different optical emitters that remain active a room temperature will also be considered.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have developed novel optoelectronic devices in which the quantum state of a single trapped electron spin determines the optical properties of the devices. The electron spin is trapped in a semiconductor quantum dot that is embedded in a high quality optical cavity.  Such systems are very interesting for quantum information processing and are based on the highly advance semiconductor technology developed for classical communication and computation. Since a single photon can change the state of the quantum dot which in turn will change the resonance condition for the cavity there is a strong effective photon-photon interaction, or photon nonlinearity. A series of papers have been published in which the sample properties improved to the point that a spectacular photon nonlinearity was demonstrated. This is essential for high-quality high-rate single photon sources and for implementing a quantum CNOT gate.  The design, fabrication, characterization and investigation of the novel devices has been a very elaborate process involving the growth of the material, consisting of approximately 100 different semiconductor layers,  the fabrication of the actual samples using advanced clean room techniques, the electronic and optical characterization, and the final investigation using cryogenic equipment and quantum optics tools.  The NSF funded activity covered the cleanroom fabrication and sample characterization and complementary funds enabled the growth of the materials and the quantum optics studies at cryogenic temperatures. Several graduate and undergraduate students have been involved in the research and obtained very valuable training in the design and fabrication of semiconductor optoelectronic devices.  The ultimate goal of the research is to have the spin of a single electron determine whether or not a photon with a specific polarization will be transmitted or reflected by the system. This will lead to quantum entanglement between a single photon and a single electron spin, which is an essential resource for future quantum information technology. We have seen the onset of this behaviour but the electron spin is still decohering to quickly to claim a quantum CNOT operation.
