<AbstractNarration>Non-technical summary:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Environmental stresses (from conditions such as drought and high or low temperatures) are significant and ongoing concerns for crop productivity. Plants, including crops, respond to cues from the environment in many ways.  Among these responses are changes in the ways that genes are expressed.  Understanding and manipulating these changes are likely to be profitable means for improving crop productivity.  The subject of this research is a protein (termed AtCPSF30) that is important for the responses of plants to environmental stresses, as well as to other cues (or developmental signals) that guide development from a seedling to a mature and productive plant.  The goals of the research are to understand how this protein helps the plant to discriminate between different cues, so that subsequent changes in gene expression are appropriate to the respective stress or developmental signal.  This research will lead to a better understanding of how plants respond to environmental stresses, and to how stresses affect different aspects of growth and development.  This understanding will allow scientists to develop improved crop varieties, and will help producers to make informed decisions regarding crop and variety choice, as well as production management.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical description of the project:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The subject of this study is a hypothetical hub that transduces cellular signaling cues into differential poly(A) site choices and phenotypic outcomes. This hub, the 30 kD subunit of the so-called Cleavage and Polyadenylation Specificity Factor in Arabidopsis (AtCPSF30), is regulated in vitro by two distinctive chemical or biochemical signals (calcium and redox signals), and is involved in a range of developmental and physiological responses. The goals of the research are to determine how these different signaling cues are transduced to specific outcomes, potentially through alternative polyadenylation (APA) during pre-mRNA processing. The goals will be accomplished by testing these three hypotheses:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Different signaling inputs are processed, through AtCPSF30, into differing sets of APA events and outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;2. AtCPSF30-mediated APA alters mRNA functionality for some of the numerous direct targets of the protein.&lt;br/&gt;3. AtCPSF30-mediated APA affects gene expression early in lateral root development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extensive use will be made of systems approaches - both high-throughput DNA sequencing and computational analyses of large datasets. These will be complemented by genetic, transgenic, cellular, molecular, and biochemical studies, all of which will be brought to bear on tests of the stated hypotheses. The outcomes of this research will further an understanding of how RNA processing integrates signaling cues into distinctive molecular outcomes, and how these outcomes affect genetic networks that in turn impact essential growth processes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data from this project will be incorporated as appropriate into classes to give the students first-hand information on how the research process works, and how large-scale datasets are collected and analyzed.  The laboratory and computational expertise and the datasets that will be generated in the course of the proposed studies will be made available to a consortium of colleges and universities that has the goal of facilitating the development of laboratory and classroom exercises intended to familiarize undergraduate students with high-throughput DNA sequencing. Other outreach activities include: a collaboration with faculty at regional HBCU and highs schools and participation (by Dr. Li) in a project intended to recruit and mentor minority students in research in cell and molecular biology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview  In eukaryotes, a necessary step in the production of a mRNA involves the formation of a polyadenylated RNA 3? end; this step is termed polyadenylation, and the position along a primary transcript at which the RNA is polyadenylated is known as the poly(A) site. Most genes possess more than one possible poly(A) site, and the choice of site that is used has a great effect on the functioning of the eventual mRNA.  Poly(A) site selection is a step at which gene expression is regulated, and the usage of different sites (alternative polyadenylation or APA) has a sizeable impact on numerous processes.  Polyadenylation (and APA) is mediated by a large complex of proteins.  In plants, one of these - CPSF30 ? has been linked with the usage of numerous APA sites.  CPSF30 plays roles in root development, and in the responses of plants to a number of growth regulators (such as ethylene and auxin) as well as abiotic and biotic stresses.  CPSF30 is also a conduit that links APA with the environment, via its interactions with calmodulin and with disulfide remodeling agents.  The goals of this project are to better understand how CPSF30 functions as a conduit.  The expected results will provide important new insight into the connections between the environment and a central step in gene expression.     Intellectual Merit  CPSF30 possesses several domains that have distinct biochemical activities. To understand the roles that these domains play, plants that express mutant forms of CPSF30 with defects in one of these domains were produced and analyzed.  Interestingly, for the most part, regardless of the domain affected, mutant plants exhibited the same phenotypes as plants that do not express CPSF30.  This result indicates that the different domains of the protein are all required for functionality of the protein.  This is an important result, since it rules out CPSF30 as a factor that helps plants to differentiate between different environmental or developmental inputs.  Instead, it supports a model in which CPSF30 mediates so-called crosstalk between different signaling pathways.  These alternatives are depicted in Figure 1.  One model that explains how CPSF30 functions holds that CPSF30-mediated APA might lead to a destabilization of target mRNAs, thereby reducing overall levels of gene expression. This hypothesis was tested by examining the stabilities of CPSF30-dependent mRNAs.  The results show that CPSF30-mediated APA in fact does not impact the stabilities of mRNA isoforms, or general levels of gene expression. This argues against the stated model.   CPSF30 is required for normal lateral root development. To better understand this, gene expression and poly(A) site choice was studied in the cells that are destined to form lateral roots; this was done in wild-type and CPSF30-deificient plants.  A number of genes were identified that have the potential to explain the role of CPSF30 in this process.  These will be further studied, with future experiments guided by other results of this project that rule out possible modes of action.  Taken together, the results of this research support a general model in which CPSF30 helps to promote crosstalk (or cooperation) between lines of communication involving different stimuli. They also argue against the proposition that CPSF30 acts by altering the expression of a broad range of genes, and thus supports an alternative in which CPSF30 acts selectively on a small set of mRNA targets. This is an important outcome since it stands CPSF30-mediated APA apart from similar phenomena in other systems (such as mammals).  It also raises new questions regarding the functioning of this protein.     Broader Impacts  In plants, CPSF30 has been linked with lateral root development, tolerance of abiotic stresses, and resistance to bacterial pathogens.  These processes are all crucial for crop productivity.  The understanding gained in this project will help to refine strategies whereby crop plants might be better tailored to survive stresses, and to acquire more favorable root characteristics. (For example, lateral root proliferation is important for water use, and the detailed understanding of CPSF30 should help to craft strategies to improve drought tolerance in crops.)  This project supported the training of several undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral scientists in the two laboratories.  In addition, it supported outreach wherein faculty at minority-serving and undergraduate-focused institutions received training in the bench and computational aspects of high throughput DNA sequencing. In these ways, this project impacted more than twenty institutions and upwards of 1000 undergraduates across the country.
