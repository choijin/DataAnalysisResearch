<AbstractNarration>The objective of this collaborative research study is to improve the reliability of social vulnerability indicators by reducing uncertainties in input data and methods, and validating output metrics.  Social vulnerability has been receiving increasing attention by disaster planners at local, state, and federal levels as they seek to reduce adverse impacts of natural hazards.  Yet far too little is currently understood about the robustness of the leading vulnerability indicators, both in terms of the approaches used to build them and their ability to adequately represent real world conditions.  There is a critical need for methodological advancements to improve the precision and accuracy of social vulnerability indicators.  Without such advancements, the use of social vulnerability indicators in disaster mitigation, preparedness, and recovery could mislead decision-making.  Based on a study area of the Southeast U.S., the project will develop novel regionalization routines and apply global sensitivity analysis and multiple regression to census data inputs and output vulnerability indicators.  The research is expected to generate new understanding of the critical inputs and decision points in social vulnerability modeling, the level of agreement of resultant indicators with observed disaster outcomes, and the influence of uncertainty in social vulnerability modeling.  By narrowing the existing gap between vulnerability models and real-world practice, improved social vulnerability indicators will allow for better disaster planning and interventions that account for the most vulnerable populations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has great potential to transform dominant approaches for the measurement of social vulnerability to hazards.  The finalized methodology will be made widely accessible to both researchers and the public through an internet-GIS application that generates user-customizable vulnerability indices.  The improved vulnerability metrics will also be shared with state and federal disaster planners through existing relationships with the research team.  The study contributes to training the next generation of hazards researchers through the direct involvement of graduate and undergraduate students, including those from groups historically underrepresented in graduate research and education.  The project findings will be integrated into the classroom through the development of learning modules for existing courses that explore urban geography and interactions between hazards and society.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In terms of intellectual merit, the completed work advances understanding of the determinants of social vulnerability to natural hazards, and the validity of data and models used to quantify it.  Specifically, it focuses on the attribute uncertainty of demographic data, and the degree of alignment between social vulnerability indices and disaster outcomes.  At a conceptual level, our work enhanced understanding of the context specificity of the precursors, processes, and outcomes of social vulnerability.  This knowledge is important for customizing social vulnerability indicators to account for temporal context, measurability, and indicator interrelationships.  At a methodological level, we developed new methods to compute a margin of error on a composite indicator.  Prior work had documented challenges of measurement uncertainties of census demographic data for the modeling of individual indicators.  Our work creates the capacity to also quantify data uncertainties for composite indicators, for example, indices used to measure multidimensional constructs such as social vulnerability, resilience, and sustainability.  Our findings highlight the need for more empirically-driven research to better characterize the explanatory power of social vulnerability measures.     In terms of broader impacts, the results will guide the application of social vulnerability measures.  Social vulnerability indices are becoming more commonly deployed by state and local governments, in support of resource allocation and project prioritization in disaster mitigation and recovery.  From discussions at academic conferences, the need for research evaluating the validity of these indices is palpable, but research efforts remain nascent.  This work is likely to presage a wave of index validation work over the coming years.  Knowledge produced through this project has been disseminated via ten peer-reviewed journal publications, a book, a book chapter, a master?s thesis, and a website.  We also organized sessions and delivered numerous presentations at prominent academic conferences, such as the Annual Meeting of the Association of American Geographers and the Natural Hazards Research and Applications Workshop.  In conducting and disseminating the research, we supported the STEM training of four doctoral students, a master?s student, and four undergraduate students.  Two of the undergraduates were participants in a summer research program for members of groups traditionally underrepresented in graduate education, and both were later accepted to graduate school.     As one of the principal investigators on this collaborative project has remaining grant funds, multi-investigator research on the project continues.  Ongoing work is focused on the testing of disaster impact measures from FEMA?s Individual Assistance program, including variables such as the number of applicants, housing damage, property loss, affected renters.  The work should yield additional publications and presentations in the coming year, primarily focused on the robustness of social vulnerability indices to variations in input modeling parameters and the degree to which social vulnerability measures are able to statistically explain disaster impacts.
