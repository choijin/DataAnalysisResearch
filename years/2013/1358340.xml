<AbstractNarration>The Psychology Research Experience Program (PREP) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison provides intensive mentoring and experience in scientific research and in professional development to undergraduates from historically underrepresented populations: racial and ethnic minorities, low-income, and first-generation college students -- who have expressed and demonstrated an interest in a career in scientific psychology. Pedagogically, PREP has been designed within the framework of social constructivist models of learning, whereby students participate in a broad range of activities with others who are more capable and, as a consequence, appropriate (internalize) the outcomes produced by working together. It features a balance of mentored laboratory research (approximately 30 hrs./week) and a curriculum of scientific instruction, professional development, and networking opportunities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual focus of PREP for the years 2014-2016 is plasticity and processes of change. Over the past several years it has become increasingly evident that these are factors that no scientific psychologist can ignore, regardless of sub-discipline, and PREP provides a thorough grounding in the principles of plasticity and processes of change from the perspectives of five traditional sub-disciplines within psychology: biological; clinical; cognitive and cognitive neuroscience; developmental; and social.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The explicit motivation of this program is to address the well-documented achievement gap whereby members of the targeted populations (1) apply to PhD programs in psychology and (2) successfully complete their doctoral training in proportions far lower than their representation in the overall population. PREP?s combination of intensive research experience and training in professional development and networking is designed to equip its participating students with the skills that are necessary for a successful career in academic psychology. Thus, it will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in many branches of psychological science. In addition, PREP contributes quantitative and qualitative survey research to The Student Assessment of their Learning Gains (SALG) instrument, an NSF-supported project to improve teaching and mentoring in the STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During the summers of 2016 the Psychology Research Experience Program (PREP) brought 7 students to the University of Wisconsin-Madison for 9 weeks of mentored summer research in scientific psychology.  All students were from populations historically underrepresented in psychology (racial and ethnic students of color, students from low-SES backgrounds, and/or first-generation college students), and had demonstrated interest in a research career in psychology.  Many also attended undergraduate institutions lacking a substantial research infrastructure.  PREP provided students with the opportunity to participate in cutting-edge research in biological, social, clinical, developmental, cognitive, and perceptual psychology.  Each PREP student engaged in intensive mentored research with a UW-Madison Department of Psychology faculty member, with day-to-day mentoring and supervision provided by a graduate student or postdoctoral researcher working in that professor?s laboratory.  Beyond the laboratory research, PREP students were exposed to a broad variety of research questions and techniques faculty lectures, lab tours, and shared coursework.  In addition, PREP provided professional development and networking opportunities, both within the UW-Madison Psychology Department and across UW-Madison departments.  Both in the lab and in the classroom, each PREP student gained experience with all aspects of the research process: literature review, experiment design, data collection, statistical analysis, scientific writing, and oral presentation.  PREP culminated with a department-wide symposium, during which PREP students each gave a research talk about their projects.  Benefits were observed at the individual-student, department, and institutional levels.  In post-program surveys, PREP students universally reported gains in both ability and confidence on a large variety of research skills, as well as a strong desire to continue in the field of scientific psychology.  Several PREP students have formed lasting professional relationships with their mentoring faculty, which have resulted in continued collaboration and offers of graduate admission to UW&ndash;Madison.  PREP students who have not yet graduated from their undergraduate institutions have generally succeeded in further psychology research at their home institutions.  In terms of Intellectual Merit, PREP has trained students in essential research skills and instilled confidence in their ability to succeed in scientific psychology.  With regard to Broader Impacts, there are two important highlights. First, PREP alumni have used their skills and confidence to continually succeed at subsequent steps of the scientific psychology career path, thereby increasing the participation of individuals underrepresented groups in the field. Second, graduate-student and postdoctoral mentors have participated in a carefully developed Research Mentor Training workshop that has been demonstrated empirically to generate lasting benefits both for the mentor and for that mentor?s mentees, as measured by long-term retention in STEM disciplines and by career satisfaction and effectiveness.
