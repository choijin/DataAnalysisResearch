<AbstractNarration>PI: Erickson, David &lt;br/&gt;Proposal: 1343058 &lt;br/&gt;Title: INSPIRE Track 2: Public Health, Nanotechnology, and Mobility (PHeNoM) &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This INSPIRE award brings together research areas traditionally supported by: the Biophotonics and Nanobiosensing Programs in the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems Division (CBET) of the Engineering Directorate (ENG); the Communications, Circuits and Sensing Systems Program in the Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems Division (ECCS) of the ENG Directorate; the Science, Technology and Society Program in the Social and Economical Sciences Division of the Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences Directorate (SBE); and the Smart Health and Wellbeing Program in the Information and Intelligent Systems Division (IIS) of the Computer &amp; Information Science Engineering Directorate (CISE). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Significance &lt;br/&gt;The science and technology enabled by the Public Health, Nanotechnology and Mobility (PHeNoM) project may ultimately lead to widespread access to health information obtainable from lab-on-chip technology. This research project could alter the domestic healthcare landscape by enabling earlier-stage detection of disease, reducing the cost of public healthcare delivery, and allowing individuals to take better control of their own well-being. Such advances require the integration of the social and technical contexts of health care device deployment. This integration is accomplished by gathering feedback on early versions of the technology and modifying future designs based on that initial feedback. Iterations between feedback and design are facilitated by research efforts that interpret the feedback and guide the development process. The ultimate transfer of the technology to the marketplace is enabled by a new education effort that involves a unique combination of coursework, business plan development, pre-seed grant workshops, and collaborations with existing start-ups in the mobile health space. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description &lt;br/&gt;Advancements in nanotechnology and microfluidics have enabled the development of lab-on-chip devices that can detect and quantify protein, genetic, and other biochemical markers of diseases with precision. Currently-available personalized diagnostic devices are limited to conditions that require either frequent monitoring (e.g. glucose for diabetics) or "binary" results (e.g. pregnancy). The goals of the PHeNoM program are to demonstrate that deployment of lab-on-chip technology can be fundamentally altered by taking advantage of ubiquitous smartphone technology and show that the fusion of physical sensing and molecular assays on mobile platforms enable healthcare diagnostics that are more informative than either technology alone. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To meet these aims, the investigators are focusing their efforts on developing and deploying three systems that may have an immediate impact on advancing personalized healthcare in the United States: a Stress-Phone for long term stress management, a Nutri-Phone for bloodwork-enabled nutritional awareness, and a Hema-Phone for monitoring viral loading in HIV+ patients. Beyond the immediate merits of these technologies, the broader merit of this project is the demonstration of new "bioinfo-mobile" diagnostics that intertwine the advantages of mobility, computation, physical sensing, and biomolecular assays.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of the PHeNoM program were to show that that the fusion of physical sensing and biomolecular assays on mobile platforms could enable more in-depth healthcare diagnostics than would be possible using either technology alone.  To meet these goals we originally set out to develop and deploy three systems that can have an immediate impact on advancing personalized healthcare in the US: a Stress-Phone for long term stress management, a Nutri-Phone for bloodwork enabled nutritional awareness, and a Hema-Phone for monitoring viral loading in HIV+ patients.  Over the course of this program we had several major accomplishments  Developed and validated the Universal NutriPhone that can work with any mobile platform and operating system.  Diagnostic tests were developed numerous nutritional deficiencies including vitamins D3, B12, &amp; A and other related markers like ferritin (Iron), CRP, &amp; AGP.  A multiplexed version of the NutriPhone testing for vitamin A status, Iron deficiency, and inflammation was also developed and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences during this project year.  The Nutriphone system was validated on multiple human populations both domestically and abroad. In addition to development, the NutriPhone technology was also commercialized.  Our start-up company VitaScan (http://vitascan.me) has licensed the bulk of the NutriPhone IP from Cornell and continues to pursue path towards commercialization. We developed and validated on humans the StressPhone ? which combined alertness measurements with salivary cortisol analysis.  This technology was enhanced throughout the program by the development of additional physical sensing platforms like the: HydroImp, EmotionCheck, and a Contactless Transdermal Alcohol Sensing. We developed a portable pre-diagnostic blood-plasma separation system, H.E.R.M.E.S ? a useful peripheral technology for both the NutriPhone and HemoPhone.  The H.E.R.M.E.S team brought the technology through the national NSF iCORPS program to better develop its commercial aspects.  This resulted in the formation of a start-up company - https://www.hermeslifesciences.com/ - which is funded by a Phase I NSF SBIR.  Created a label-free mobile enabled HemoPhone like sensing platform for specific detection of Herpes Simplex Virus using both viral immuno-specificity and the physical size range of the viruses.  A similar technique was also used to develop a high-throughput method for detecting nanoparticles in liquids on a disposable chip using an acoustically actuated lens-free holographic system with a wide-field sensor. Developed a series of software components and methods that will allow future PHeNoM based sensor innovations to be: (1) tested and incorporated into mobile research studies and interventions conducted by the larger community, and (2) integrated with other digital trace data to increase the overall utility of digital biomarkers.  We founded a new institute at Cornell entitled INSIGHT ? Institute for Nutritional Science and Global Health Technologies.  The goal of this institute is to promote fundamental science, translational engineering, and educational outreach for technologies such as those developed under PHeNoM.
