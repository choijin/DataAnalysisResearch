<AbstractNarration>Simulations of galaxy formation generically predict that all luminous galaxies are embedded in extensive tidal debris fields, caused by occasional major mergers and the continuous accretion of small satellite galaxies.  These debris fields are curiously missing around actual galaxies.  While this may indicate that revisions to the standard cosmology are needed, a more mundane explanation is that we have not yet obtained sufficiently deep observations to detect the debris fields.  This award provides support for the Dragonfly Project that will attempt such a detection.  The project is an ultra low surface brightness imaging survey with the Dragonfly telescope of all luminous galaxies within a distance of 30 megaparsecs (Mpc) that are visible from New Mexico.  Over the award period of 3 years, the investigators will obtain 40 hr deep images of a complete sample of 72 luminous nearby galaxies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Recent simulations suggest that the debris mostly lives at surface brightnesses of 29 to 31 mag per arcsec^2, fainter than the typical deep imaging limit of  about 28 mag per arcsec^2.  The investigators have constructed a telescope for the specific purpose of determining whether all galaxies have ultra low surface brightness tidal debris around them on scales of 30--100 kpc.  The collected data will reach about 30 mag per arcsec^2  on 3 arcsec scales.  The Dragonfly telescope is an array of telephoto lenses coupled with standard charge-coupled device (CCD) imagers.  The latest generation of these lenses has nano-fabricated coatings that minimize scattered and reflected light.  Together, these lenses constitute a perfectly baffled telescope with extremely fast, all-refractive optics and better scattered light control (by an order of magnitude) than existing reflecting telescopes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigating team will make the fully processed and calibrated images publicly available through a web interface.  The project integrates education and research in the following ways: (1) The project is complementary to multi-year instrumentation efforts on large telescopes and is well-suited for graduate student training in astrophysical instrumentation. (2) The straightforward remote operation model lends itself well to classroom teaching and demonstrations.  The telescope will be integrated into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum at Yale University and will also be used as a science demonstration tool for high school students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project used a newly developed type of telescope to study the night sky. The telescope, called the Dragonfly Telephoto Array, consists of an array of commercial telephoto lenses. These lenses have superb optics, and are very well suited for studying large, faint structures in the night sky.  With Dragonfly, we looked at the light around nearby galaxies. These galaxies had been studied before, but we were looking for extremely faint emission that is beyond the detection capabilities of previous telescopes.  One of our findings is that galaxies show a large variation in their accretion histories. It is thought that galaxies grow by accreting other, smaller, galaxies. The Milky Way and our nearest large neighbor, the Andromeda Galaxy, have recently accreted several small dwarfs. Surprisingly, we found that the Milky Way and Andromeda may be unusually active in this regard, and that most galaxies had more quiescent lives.  We also found previously unknown dwarf galaxies around the nearby galaxy M101, and studied how the M101 group is different from the Local Group that contains our own Milky Way.  Finally, we found an entirely new population of galaxies, with sizes as large as the Milky Way but less than 1% of its stars. These Ultra Diffuse Galaxies seem to almost entirely made of dark matter.          Last Modified: 09/25/2016       Submitted by: Pieter G Van Dokkum]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
