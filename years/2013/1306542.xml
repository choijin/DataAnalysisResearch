<AbstractNarration>Technical Description: The objective of this project is to synthesize and investigate iron oxysulfide, in particular sulfurized hematite, with the goal of replacing critical components in the current solar cell technologies for next-generation photovoltaics. Sulfurized hematite, with an appropriate concentration of sulfur, will potentially meet the cost and efficiency requirements for terawatt photovoltaics. The scientific tasks of the project include: 1) First-principles studies of iron oxysulfide and copper oxysulfide as solar photovoltaic materials; 2) Development of deposition and sulfurization methods for sulfurized hematite; 3) Investigation of its electrical and optical properties as a function of sulfur content; and 4) Development of solution-based n-type and p-type doping methods for hematite. The major innovations in this project include: 1) the use of three Earth-abundant elements, iron, oxygen and sulfur, for bandgap engineering to create a semiconductor better suited for solar photovoltaics; 2) the use of largely solution-based processes for film deposition and doping to ensure low-cost solar cells in the end; and 3) a multidisciplinary approach, where first-principles studies and experimental studies are joined to push forward the technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Description: The success of this project will enable a sustainable solar cell technology, which is capable of low-cost, high-efficiency and most importantly terawatt-scale deployment, allowing solar electricity to become a major source of energy in our future. In addition, this project includes a targeted effort to increase the representation of American Indians in science and engineering as well as increase the awareness of local Arizona tribes on photovoltaic technologies. The principal investigators work with entities such as the American Indian Science and Engineering Society and Arizona Department of Commerce to promote photovoltaic technologies in remote tribal communities, provide research opportunities to American Indian science and engineering students, and engage and interest American Indian youth about science and engineering in general. This project also provides synergistic support to the newly-established U.S. Photovoltaic Manufacturing Consortium (PVMC) for its mission to facilitate a robust domestic solar cell industry. The success of this project will provide a technology pipeline for PVMC, while PVMC provides industrial connections for this project.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>It is ironic that while we pursue solar energy over fossil energy for sustainability, many of the solar technologies we have today are neither scalable nor sustainable. Availability of raw materials used in solar modules, energy consumption in producing solar modules, recyclability of end-of-life solar modules, and storage of intermittent solar electricity can all prevent or hinder sustainable deployment of solar modules. This project attempts to address several of the roadblocks to sustainable solar technologies including 1) an earth-abundant metal oxysulfide for the p-n junction in solar cells, 2) earth-abundant metal oxides for optical management and surface passivation in solar cells, and 3) recycling technologies for end-of-life solar modules. &nbsp;For the p-n junction, we focused on iron oxysulfide and titanium oxysulfide. For optical management and surface passivation, we focused on zirconium oxide and aluminum oxide. To prepare thin films of these materials, we developed a low-cost synthesis method, i.e. spray deposition. It is an open-air, continuous process as compared to vacuum-based batch processes currently used in solar cell fabrication such as plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition and atomic layer deposition. We have demonstrated crystalline hematite films by optimizing spray deposition conditions, which is important in achieving a higher efficiency in solar cells made of this material. We have also demonstrated bandgap engineering in anatase by sulfurization, which makes the material more suitable for applications in solar cells. Another significant result is the demonstration of a low-cost earth-abundant zirconium oxide film for antireflection in solar cells. The current antireflection coating is silicon nitride. It is prepared by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, which is a vacuum-based batch process. Spray-deposited zirconium oxide promises a significantly lower cost than silicon nitride, with electrical and optical properties very similar to silicon nitride. This suggests that spray-deposited zirconium oxide is suitable candidate to replace silicon nitride without any degradation in solar cell efficiency. The project provided training for students at both graduate and undergraduate levels. In particular, four undergraduate students from underrepresented groups (Hispanic and African American) participated in this project as summer interns between 2014 and 2018. The project also provided a platform for international collaborations with Mexico and Belgium. A Ph.D. student from Instituto de Energias Renovables, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico in Morelos, Mexico spent a year at Arizona State University to conduct research on spray deposition of earth-abundant metal oxides for applications in solar cells.
