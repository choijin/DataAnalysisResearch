<AbstractNarration>This project develops the science of teaching engineering ethics by engaging students as expert witnesses in a litigation role play experience. Standard pedagogies expose students to broad ethical dilemmas that they may encounter in their careers and provide valuable practice in ethical reasoning related to these problems. Expert witness role plays have the potential to expand on this base of knowledge to help students develop awareness and practical skills to deal with the ethical challenges of maintaining scientific objectivity as an expert witness in their specifica area of study.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this research comes from extending an anecdotally successful role play experience based on reconstructing a traffic crash by developing five complete expert witness role plays and evaluating the efficacy of this approach in two institutions using both formative and summative evaluation techniques. The broader impact of this work includes developing a framework to aid other educators in developing expert witness role plays on additional engineering expert topics and disseminating the result of this project on commonly used ethics web portals to incorporate expert witness role plays in their own classrooms.</AbstractNarration>

Ethical Standards &ndash; a professional organization has ethical guidelines for member?s behavior. These codes of ethics can be obtained from organizations like the National Society of Professional Engineers.  Incentive Structure &ndash; What prize, or perceived benefit exists for the students to want to do a good job and satisfy the person pressuring them regarding the ethical challenge.  Feedback &ndash; A session or discussion regarding the experience should use to help students who participated in the role-play scenario make sense of the experience and understand the value of the exercise.     Using these concepts, instructors with a passion for teaching engineering ethics can be highly effective in their educational efforts.
