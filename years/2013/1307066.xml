<AbstractNarration>Under the joint support of the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program and the Electronic and Photonic Materials Program, Prof. Holmes and Prof. Blank of the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities investigate how excited state relaxation processes impact the rate of excitonic energy transfer and diffusion in organic semiconductors.  This work is directed at better understanding the complex relationship between the molecular excited state dynamics and the observed exciton diffusion length (LD) and aims to provide design principles required for a substantial enhancement of LD in materials and devices such as organic photovoltaics.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work has potential impact in the design of excitonic organic devices, including improvements in the efficiency of both light emission and conversion of sunlight to electricity, which has a direct impact on the critical issues of energy conversion and consumption. This project also provides interdisciplinary research opportunities for graduate, undergraduate and high school students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Modern optoelectronic devices, including solar cells, light-emitting devices, and lasers, are based on a class of electronic materials known as semiconductors.  Conventional semiconductors are often crystalline and inorganic, requiring energy intensive fabrication processes. Silicon is a common example. This project was concerned with an emerging, alternate class of semiconductors known as organic semiconductors.  These materials are made up of loosely bound organic molecules, and are compatible with low energy processing methods that exploit roll-to-roll processing on flexible substrates.  Consequently, the production of solar cells based on these materials has received considerable interest in order to realize low-cost solar cells on flexible substrates.  In organic semiconductors, a key process limiting efficiency is the inability for energy to travel over large distance.  This project has allowed us to develop a better understanding of the factors that impact energy transport in organic semiconductors, while also developing new device paradigms to improve energy harvesting in organic solar cells. Funding has permitted the support of seven graduate students to realize their Ph.D., as well as several undergraduate and high school student researchers.  Through the Energy and U program, thousands of primary school age children have been taught the basic principles of energy science. The program targets students from disadvantaged backgrounds, bringing them to the University for a choreographed theatrical performance built around the first law of thermodynamics that includes music, dancing and several interactive live demonstrations introducing different forms of energy and transformations between them. Finally, outreach to industry has been realized through the University of Minnesota Industrial Partnership for Research in Interfacial and Materials Engineering, connecting Ph.D. students and researchers with members of industry for the exchange of ideas.  This has allowed Ph.D. students to obtain valuable perspective on their Ph.D. research.       Last Modified: 08/24/2018       Submitted by: Russell J Holmes]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
