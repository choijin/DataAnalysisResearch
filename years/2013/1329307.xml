<AbstractNarration>Oregon Security Day is an annual one-day event at the University of Oregon, focusing on trends and challenges in computer security as faced by industry, academia, and government and targeted to participants throughout the Pacific Northwest and particularly within the state of Oregon.  Building on the 2011 and 2012 events, the funding from this grant will support student travel from more remote areas within Oregon to be able to come to Eugene for the event.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Security Day event is an opportunity for students and members of the community to be exposed to trends and new topics in computer security and to discuss ongoing research initiatives. It is also an opportunity to form new collaborations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Exposure to nationally-recognized speakers in security for students and others throughout the state of Oregon, particularly from underserved areas who would not be able to receive this access otherwise, aids in the pedagogical and outreach mission of the university and can be an encouraging factor for more students to consider graduate-level study in the area of computer security.</AbstractNarration>
