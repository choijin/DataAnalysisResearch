<AbstractNarration>Overview: &lt;br/&gt;This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the Electronics, Photonics, and Magnetics Devices Program in the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems in the Directorate for Engineering; and the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms  program in the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences. &lt;br/&gt;Objective: &lt;br/&gt;Recently predicted autonomous oscillations in virus-like particles are investigated via simulation and experiment. Types of biological systems displaying such oscillations will be identified, and implications for pure and applied sciences drawn.  Novel multiscale theoretical methods will be developed for the simulations, and nanofluidic coupling structures will be fabricated for high-sensitivity high-resolution GHz-to-THz detection of the oscillations.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit: &lt;br/&gt;At the boundary between the microscopic and macroscopic worlds, sustained autonomous structural oscillations in nanostructures will be investigated. As the phenomena of interest involve both long- and short-temporal scale processes, novel concepts in multiscale theory will be developed.  Coarse-grained variables will be coevolved with the positions and momenta of the N atoms using Trotter factorization with attendant accuracy control. &lt;br/&gt;Innovations include: (a) discovery of sustained autonomous oscillations in equilibrium mesoscopic systems; (b) methods in multiscale theory; (c) biosample presentation and spectroscopic identification of autonomous oscillations in virus-like particles; (d) methods for viral threat detection and nanomedical design; and (e) autonomously oscillating molecular circuit elements. &lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;A successful investigation will revolutionize structural biochemistry and the electromagnetics of biological systems, and could provide a radical change in viral sensing for threat-detection and human health.  Methods for computer-aided design of nanostructured materials for molecular electronics and nanomedical systems are developed. Opportunities for under-represented groups in STEM education are created.&lt;br/&gt;Why Inspire?&lt;br/&gt;Electrical engineers understand the importance of nondissipative oscillatory circuit elements. Chemists and physicists have expertise in multiscale theory. Biologists understand the responses of virus-like particles.  Few scientists appreciate all these topics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The experimental portion of the project started with the hypothesis that vibrational resonances may occur in viruses, such as the human papillomavirus strain 16 (HPV-16).  Such resonances were predicted in transient molecular-dynamic simulations conducted by P. Ortoleva's group at U. Indiana.  But their ability to be measured experimentally was unknown due to their weak dipole moment and transient nature.  So custom microfluidic chips (Figure 1) were designed and fabricated that could measure steady state resonances using a vector network analyzer and a coplanar waveguide structure fabricated immediately above the channels.  Unfortunately, no definitive resonances were observed up to 40 GHz.  So then nanofluidic chips were also employed that allowed free-space coupling up to 1.0 THz and beyond in sub-micron scale channels defined in silica and coupled to a high-resolution THz frequency-domain spectrometer (Figure 2).  Although the nanofluidic chips did not yield signatures from the HPV-16 either,  they did produce distinct resonant absorption signatures in nucleic acid samples ranging in size from 17 base pairs (si-RNA) to 48,502 base pairs (Lambda DNA).  Three or four distinct resonances were observed in four different nucleic-acid solutions between ~800 GHz and 1.1 THz.  These are perhaps the most definitive absorption signatures ever observed in biomolecules at frequencies below 1 THz.  The computational portion of the project continued developing a multiscale molecular-dynamics framework with multiscale factorization which: (1) preserves collective modes, (2) provides statistical information on the rapidly fluctuating molecular state, (3) avoids the need to conjector and calibrate coarse-grained governing equation, and (4) provides much greater efficiency than conventional molecular dynamics.  The focus shifted to epitopes - the short residue sequences that the immune system uses to identify a pathogen.  It was shown that epitope identification could made through analysis of residue structure fluctuations.   In multiscale factorization, all atoms are taken into account, so that the full intensity of fluctuations is captured, unlike in coarse-grained approaches.  This is important for computer-aided design of vaccines against viruses.  As a demonstration of this overall capability, Figure 3 shows a structural transition simulation of the Vault nanoparticle under heating from 283 to 663K, which occurs on the sub-microsecond time-scale.
