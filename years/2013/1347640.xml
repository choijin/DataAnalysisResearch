<AbstractNarration>This Widening Implementation &amp; Demonstration of Evidence-Based Reforms (WIDER) planning grant provides STEM faculty at Florida Gulf Coast University with training in evidence-based practices and course design. By participating in the STEM Professional Academy for Reinvigorating the Culture of Teaching (SPARCT), faculty are learning guiding principles for change in STEM instruction. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: By applying Rogers' Diffusion of Innovation, a change theory, SPARCT is creating ongoing changes among SPARCT faculty and within the larger university climate. The project encompasses all main STEM disciplines and includes faculty participants from the Colleges of Arts and Sciences, Education, and Engineering.   Combining content experts with educational experts, SPARCT is strengthening pedagogical understanding and serving as a model program for other universities.  Training for SPARCT faculty includes participation in a three-week (4 hours per day) STEM Summer Academy followed by an academic year-long faculty learning community, training in peer observation, and participation in a seminar series.  As SPARCT faculty measure and assess the effects of their teaching practices, they also evaluate the program.  Both disciplinary and program findings are disseminated throughout the STEM learning community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: By involving at least 25% of Florida Gulf Coast University's STEM faculty, SPARCT is creating a community of STEM scholars, reinvigorating interdisciplinary connections, developing learning threads, and increasing the university community's potential to transform the teaching culture. SPARCT targets introductory STEM courses, thereby positively impacting student recruitment, retention, and learning among STEM and non-STEM majors. Moreover, SPARCT is helping to develop a more "STEM-literate" population, therefore enabling a stronger, more competitive STEM workforce in Southwest Florida.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Beginning in 2014, Florida Gulf Coast University?s (FGCU?s) Whitaker Center for STEM Education in coordination with the Lucas Center for Faculty Development instituted the STEM Professional Academy to Reinvigorate the Culture of Teaching (SPARCT) Program. This year-long faculty experience focuses on STEM faculty teaching introductory level courses and was developed in response to concerns about students? persistence and completion rates in STEM courses and programs at FGCU and across the nation.  The expected outcomes for the program include 1) enhanced scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) by SPARCT faculty, 2) improvement of evidence-based practices in introductory STEM classrooms, 3) development of long-term Faculty Learning Communities (FLCs) in STEM instruction, 4) development of professional peer-observation strategies for STEM classroom teaching practices, and 5) enhanced student learning in introductory STEM courses as a result of SPARCT faculty development.  The program integrates a May academy with an academic year FLC to create a framework for implementing evidence-based teaching methods, participating in peer classroom observations, and fostering long-term community dialogue and personal reflection. Evidence-based teaching methods in SPARCT programming include: lessons from the Science of Learning and the multimedia principle; active learning inquiry methods, including Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL); Project and Problem-Based Learning (PBL); Team-Based Learning; flipped classroom practices; and SCALE-UP learning design.  Researchers on the project?s planning committee were able to document successful outcomes for SPARCT participants in the following areas: 1) changing instructional practices in the introductory STEM classroom, 2) sustaining a culture of evidence-based teaching, and 3) enhancing student learning in the SPARCT classroom as indirectly measured by student surveys.  Over the past four years, SPARCT has engaged 45 faculty members from mathematics (15), physics &amp; geology (4), chemistry (7), engineering (7), environmental and marine sciences (8), and biology (4). This represents more than 50% of the faculty in mathematics, more than 40% of the faculty in physics and geology and chemistry, and approximately one third of the overall STEM faculty engaged in teaching introductory STEM courses at the university. Results from the first three cohorts indicate that all 36 participants introduced evidence-based practices into their classroom strategies, the most common success being in the areas of integrating formative assessment, using the science of learning to support student comprehension, and recognizing that lecture alone was not an optimal classroom practice.  Broader impacts of the program include 5 participants (11%) engaging in additional evidence-based teaching workshops and more than 26 STEM-SoTL presentations at professional conferences from 16 (44%) participants in the past 3 years. SPARCT has had a positive effect on the broader university through Whitaker Center programming which has enabled the transfer of many of the activities developed for SPARCT to the K-12 community.  SPARCT remains sustainable after the grant period at FGCU through joint efforts between the Whitaker Center and the Lucas Center with annual offerings of the May academy to new SPARCT faculty and the continuing SPARCT-FLC activities for all previous (and future) participants.
