<AbstractNarration>Statistical conclusions from research studies may often be misleading due to a variety of reasons including small sample sizes for the studies or confounding factors which are unknown to the investigators of the study.  One way to reduce the possibility of misleading conclusions is to combine the results of multiple research studies using a technique referred to as "meta-analysis."  Meta-analysis is one of the most widely used techniques to infer knowledge from data in science.  The idea behind meta-analysis studies is that the combined statistical conclusions from multiple research studies reflect the information in all of the studies and are more likely to be accurate.  The conclusions from meta-analyses are considered "better" or "more likely to generalize" than conclusions from single studies.  However, this notion is not well formalized and formalizing this question is a goal of this project.  In addition, existing meta-analysis methods do not take into account any knowledge of the similarities and differences between the studies.  Taking advantage of these similarities and differences can improve the effectiveness of meta-analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project takes advantage of recent developments in the area of "causal inference" which is the study inferring cause and effect relationships from data.  These types of inferences utilizes a type of graph called a causal graph which graphically represents cause and effect relationships.  This project develops an alternate framework for meta-analysis based on a novel type of causal graph, a selection graph.  A selection graph formally represents the similarities and differences between the studies.  This project provides a unifying framework and powerful powerful methodology for meta-analysis.  The methods developed in this project are applied to genetic studies where meta-analyses have discovered thousands of variants involved in common human disease in the past few years.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Causal graphs have had a major impact on the way causality is taught and understood in cognitive science, statistics, and the health and social sciences. The proposed research promises to have similar impacts by transforming the approach to meta-analysis, one of the work horses of statistical inference in the physical, life and social sciences.  The resulting techniques will be used to perform meta-analyses of genetic studies which can lead to the discovery of variation involved in disease.  The results of the project, including publications, software, data sets, and course materials will be made freely available through the project web site: http://zarlab.cs.ucla.edu/causal-meta-analysis/.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Meta-analysis is one of the main workhorses of scientific discovery.  The basic idea of meta-analysis is the combination of different studies with the idea that the combination of the studies provides more robust findings.  The major goals of this project were to:  1.  To propose an alternate framework for meta-analysis based on a novel type of causal graph, a selection graph, and show that it provides a unifying framework for meta-analysis and leads to more powerful methodology.  2.  Demonstrate the utility of this novel framework in applications to genetics.     We made progress on both of those goals and also during the project we made a connection between these techniques for meta-analysis and the concept of "heterogeneity" which allows for taking into account differences in studies.   Genetic association studies can differ from each other in terms of environmental conditions, study design, population types and sizes, statistical noise, and analytical use of covariates. These factors produce different effect sizes between studies, a phenomenon called between-study heterogeneity. Correctly interpreting and accounting for heterogeneity in genetic association studies would give us a more accurate model of the true effects genetic variants have on traits under specific conditions. We developed frameworks and software tools to improve the accuracy and power of meta-analysis methods. These methods include refinement of causal graphs that aid in the identification and interpretation of effect sizes in genetic association studies. Second, we demonstrated how these methods can be applied to mouse and human genetic data while taking into account fundamental differences in genetic studies.  Our techniques were applied widely to research in genomics.   The project also had an impact on the educational programs at UCLA.  Many students were exposed to interdisciplinary research through this project.  In addition, some of the developments in this proposal were incorporated into a course on Computational Genetics at UCLA.
