<AbstractNarration>The award provides funds to develop continuous high-resolution hydro-climate records from diatom assemblages (algae with glassy shells), over the last millennium, in lake sediment cores from the Adirondack region of northern New York.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A central aim of the research is to clarify the nature and causes of northeastern precipitation variability and extreme events, particularly in relation to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and global to regional temperatures, and to evaluate conflicting climate model projections of precipitation trends.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts involve potential improvements in understanding regional precipitation patterns and water availability in the populous northeast as well as helping to clarify the influences of the NAO and temperature on climate. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate students will participate in field work and sediment core analyses, representing an important enhancement of the academic environment at a college that serves an under-represented rural region of upstate New York.  Collaborations with regional stakeholders will enhance access to research facilities, professional networks, and expertise for both the research and students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results of the research will be presented at science conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals with student co-authors.  The analytical data resulting from the research will be archived at the NOAA World Data Center and physical sediment samples will be archived at Queen's University and Paul Smith's College.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, the PI (Curt Stager), along with his students and investigators at other institutions, studied the layered bottom sediments of lakes in the Adirondack uplands (NY) and also, for comparative purposes, at Walden Pond (MA) in order to reconstruct climatic changes of the last millennium in this relatively under-studied region.  The main goal was to use the known ecological preferences of different species of diatom (single-celled algae with glassy shells) in sediment cores to infer how regional hydrology has varied in the past with an eye toward the future.  Samples that were collected in the field further strengthened this use of diatoms as climate "proxies" which, when applied to fossil diatom assemblages in the cores, helped to produce detailed hydro-climate records spanning the last 1600-1800 years.  During a natural warm period in Medieval times, for example, prolonged droughts were more common and severe, which might indicate that future warming could bring aridity to the region rather than the increased rainfall that many climate models anticipate. However, the timing of the warm period droughts appeared to vary between sites, which might reflect errors in methodology or a true regional variability in precipitation that could be of major importance both historically and for planning purposes. Ongoing studies by the PI and associates will help to clarify this issue.   In addition to the climate reconstructions, the sediment records also yielded insights into environmental issues of practical importance on local to regional scales, including a long-term decline in water quality at Walden Pond (MA) due to heavy recreational use, the exceptionally pristine "heritage" status of remote Wolf Lake (NY),  and the early stages of recovery from acidification in Bear Pond (NY) following passage of the Clean Air Act.  In addition to publishing the results of these and related studies in peer-reviewed journals and archiving the data online, Stager used a diverse selection of outlets to enhance the broader impacts of this study for a wide range of audiences.  Several dozen undergraduate students from Paul Smith's College, which serves a rural underserved region of upstate New York, were directly involved in the field and laboratory work through a Paleoecology course, senior capstones, and independent study projects, and three students were co-authors on peer-reviewed papers. Stager published overviews of the research in an op ed in The New York Times and in a book for lay audiences ("Still Waters: The Secret World of Lakes," W.W. Norton), co-produced a video documentary on student participation in sediment core research, co-produced a graphic novel describing the Walden Pond research, aired and podcasted several episodes of a weekly science program ("Natural Selections") on public radio, and collaborated with NSF-funded composer Glenn McClure to convert a sediment core dataset into a musical score for an Adirondack folk opera that was performed in Saranac Lake in 2018 and filmed for public television.
