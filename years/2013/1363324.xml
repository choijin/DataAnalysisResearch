<AbstractNarration>Mathematical research aims to discover universal mathematical laws that apply to any possible phenomenon that can be accurately described or modeled through mathematics. Fundamental physical laws are often expressed through the principle that a system minimizes or maximizes (that is, extremizes) some quantity. Light rays, for instance, follow paths that minimize travel time through media with varying indices of refraction. Systems minimize various actions or energies. Other physical laws are encoded in partial differential equations. Mathematical analysis provides tools that can be used to understand both such differential equations, and the extremization of many types of functionals. This project is concerned with development of techniques for the analysis of functions and sets that extremize, or nearly extremize, inequalities that are closely tied to the underlying algebraic and geometric structures of classical (nonrelativistic) physical space. Characterization of near-extremizers provides a more robust understanding of exact extremizers, which takes into account small imperfections and perturbations. Among the inequalities to be studied are some of the most fundamental and widely used inequalities of mathematical analysis, including inequalities governing the Fourier transform, convolutions, and sums of sets in Euclidean space. Each of these inequalities is multilinear, involving products or other pairwise interactions, or has underlying multilinear aspects. Multilinear functionals lie on the frontier between linear and fully nonlinear phenomena. Other multilinear inequalities will also be investigated as part of this project, including variants of the Fourier transform. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fundamental multilinear inequalities in Lebesgue space and related norms will be investigated. Prototypes include inequalities of Riesz-Sobolev (concerning integrals over symmetrizations of sets), Brunn-Minkowski (concerning sums of sets), Hausdorff-Young (concerning the Fourier transform) and Young (concerning convolutions).  In a major part of the project, attention will focus on the nature and quantitative properties of  functions and sets that nearly, but not exactly, extremize such inequalities. This will establish more robust versions of existing characterizations of exact extremizers. Methodology for establishing compactness for extremizing sequences, based on additive combinatorial considerations rather than on concentration, will be developed. These tools include characterizations of sets with small sumsets, of sets with sumsets of moderately large but controlled size, and of sets with large additive energies. Refined inequalities will be formulated and established,  incorporating second terms measuring structure, rather than size.  Arithmetic progressions, intervals, ellipsoids, convex sets, and Gaussian functions will provide the context for such measurement. An improved understanding of the interplay between approximate group structure and near extremality in affine-invariant multilinear inequalities is a primary goal. The principal investigator will also apply discrete multilinear inequalities to computer science.  Rigorous lower bounds for  communication between elements of memory hierarchies will be proved, and methods for computing  these bounds will be devised.  Other research problems to be investigated include an inverse problem concerning the off-diagonal behavior of Bergman kernels associated to high powers of positive complex line bundles,inequalities for multilinear oscillatory integral operators related to the Hausdorff-Young inequality,and a possible characterization of equality in a class of multilinear inequalities previously analyzed by Holder, Rogers, Riesz, Sobolev, and Brascamp-Lieb-Luttinger.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on inequalities in mathematical analysis, with emphasis on functions and sets that nearly maximize certain functionals, and on the role of symmetry in determing maximizers. Multilinear functionals, which express the most fundamental types of nonlinear interactions, were especially emphasized.    One of the most fundamental operations of mathematical analysis is the Fourier transform, which expresses a complex sound as a superposition of pure tones, expresses the duality between position and momentum in quantum physics, and has countless applications throughout mathematics and science.  The Hausdorff-Young inequality expresses a limitation on the size of a Fourier transform in terms of its input, and it has been known which functions have largest Fourier transforms. The PI used techniques developed in the study of additive combinatorial problems to characterize functions whose Fourier transforms are nearly largest.   The Riesz-Sobolev inequality is concerned with the degree to which additive relations a+b=c are present between elements of three sets in Euclidean spaces of arbitrary dimensions. It has long been known that among sets of prescribed sizes, the greatest number of such relations are present for round balls, and more generally for certain ellipsoids, and in no other cases.

In further work, some of it in collaboration with a graduate student researcher, techniques were developed which led to an extension to inequalities involving an arbitrarily large number of sets. One element of this work was a family of multilinear inequalities involving spherical harmonic functions, fundamental objects which encode aspects of the rotation symmetries of Euclidean spaces.  Some of these techniques were applied by other authors to an analysis of flocking models.   The PI also refined Young's convolution inequality, another fundamental inequality dealing with weighted counting of additive relations. This involved the development of certain trilinear inequalities for Hermite functions.    With a group that included two computer scientists, an applied mathematician, and a mathematical logician, the PI developed aspects of the theory of Holder-Brascamp-Lieb inequalities to supply theoretical underpinnings for work on lower bounds on the amount of communication between fast and slow memory elements required in a class of computer algorithms.     With a postdoctoral researcher, the PI analyzed maximizers and near-maximizers for an analogue of the Riesz-Sobolev inequality for tori and related groups.  The underlying techniques included both additive combinatorial and deformation-based elements.    Broader impacts were of two kinds, firstly the training of young researchers, and secondly, applications to mathematics and to theoretical computer science.  The first three graduate student researchers whose dissertations were supervised by the PI participated in the project, developed related dissertations, and completed their PhDs. They moved on to entry level faculty positions at UC Davis, NYU Shanghai, and MIT, respectively.
