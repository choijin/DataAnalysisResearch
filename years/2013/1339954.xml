<AbstractNarration>This project is studying the scholars from the Phase I project UT3 (UToledo. UTeach. UTouch the Future) Noyce Scholarship Program. UT3 prepared 40 STEM professionals to become science and math teachers in middle and secondary school, culminating with Ohio Alternative Educators License (OAEL), a fast track license developed by the state to address an expected teacher shortage. Full licensure is earned after two years of novice, mentored full time teaching. The State of Ohio revised their licensure structure and requirements and eliminated the OAEL as of January 2012.  As a result, the last cohort from UT3 was enrolled in the university's one-year Licensed Alternative Master's Program (LAMP), a one year residency program that culminates in full licensure.  This change provided the project information for comparing the two pathways to licensure.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project's primary goal is to study the data that compares the LAMP program with the OAEL program.  It is modifying and expanding the original plan to better fit the university's redesigned program and allow for the collection of more detailed information to provide insight as to the unique process the scholars have experienced from recruitment through employment.  The project is investigating why some scholars are more successful than others in obtaining a teaching position and what qualities and strategies are essential in the process of obtaining a teaching position and, once employment is secured, the development of teaching practice through the novice stage (first three years).  The project is examining the effects the scholars have on their students and is expanding the evaluation to compare scholar outcomes based upon program participation LAMP vs. OAEL.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;An in-depth examination of the UT3 program is providing insight as to the process STEM professionals engage in as they transition to teaching. This project is studying recent STEM education graduates as they seek employment in the teaching profession at a time when teaching positions are competitive, as they retool through the completion of additional coursework, and as the novice teachers experience their first three or more years of full time teaching.  This study is also comparing professionals who have taken different paths to reach their goal of teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Findings are being shared with the University's teacher preparation program and the broader community with the goal of improving teacher preparation for the non-traditional student. The result is a program that provides a vibrant system of supports for the new teachers entering the challenging, ever changing teaching job market. As scholars are placed in high needs districts, the effects on children from underrepresented groups as a result of learning from high quality STEM teachers who have been STEM professionals is being documented. Project findings are shared with other STEM teacher preparation programs and with K-12 school districts as the data provides a rich description of the journey from teacher recruit through professional teacher.  Findings also inform policy makers as to the strengths and weaknesses of alternative teaching licensure programs.</AbstractNarration>

One was an Ohio Emergency Licensure program (OAEL) and the other was a year-long Residency program (called LAMP).  We answered the questions, "Why are some Noyce scholars more successful than others in obtaining a teaching position; what qualities and strategies were essential in the process of obtaining a teaching position; and, once employment was secured, what was the process of the development of teaching practice."   We explored teaching practice development through a comparison between two fast track methods of STEM teacher preparation funded under the Noyce Scholarship Program--a six month alternative licensure program and a one year residency program.   Overall, licensure type was unassociated with a) impact on self-efficacy regarding instructional practices, classroom management, and student engagement; b) beliefs that bridge teacher-focused and student-focused views of teaching; c) preference for a combination of active direct and guided inquiry with more emphasis on the guided inquiry; and d) experiences with student misbehavior.
