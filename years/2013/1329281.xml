<AbstractNarration>A recent analysis by the National Academy of Sciences revealed that there are major leaks in the pipeline as women proceed in to the upper echelons of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematic (STEM) domains. Dr. Chad Forbes (University of Delaware) proposes one reason for this is that continuous exposure to stereotype threatening contexts, i.e., stressful performance situations where negative stereotypes about women's math ability are salient, may initiate a biological stress response that enhances encoding and recall of negative emotional memories associated with STEM domains. These memories ultimately facilitate learned STEM aversions to undermine tactics people normally employ to ensure perseverance in challenging domains. With support from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Forbes and colleagues will conduct four experiments on men and women who are highly identified with STEM domains. Incorporating longitudinal, genotyping, and simultaneous EEG and startle probe methodologies, these studies will assess how subcortical and cortical responses to negative information encountered in stereotype threatening contexts predicts women's memory for negative information (Study 1), STEM aversions (Study 2), and ability to self-enhance in STEM domains (Study 3). Genetic polymorphisms known to influence neural regulatory processes will be assessed as moderators of these relationships. The final study will attempt to counteract women's basic STEM aversions to motivate sustained engagement with STEM domains. Together, these studies will identify key factors that both repel women from STEM domains and promote their retention. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The underrepresentation of women in STEM fields has deleterious ramifications on the nation's economy, academic and corporate diversity, national productivity, innovation and quality of STEM products, services and education, and overall quality of life. Identifying ways to increase the representation of women in STEM fields will have broad impacts on future intervention programs, advancement in science, and prosperity of our nation. By disseminating findings from these studies to hundreds of women STEM majors and public forums, this project will create opportunities to educate these groups about the deleterious consequences of stereotype threat on women's STEM engagement and the dire need to promote their retention in STEM fields. Furthermore, dozens of students, including women and underrepresented minorities, will be trained in cutting-edge neuroscience methodologies and have the opportunity to present findings at national and international conferences.  Finally, the project will generate a very large EEG and genetic database. Dr. Forbes will contribute to the big data effort by making the data available to support other coordinated NSF efforts that aim to make use of real data in teaching STEM related courses, developing EEG-based source imaging methods, and enabling participation in discovery science by those who would otherwise have no access to such data.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><span>To date, only 30% of Ph.D. degrees in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematic (STEM) fields are awarded to women and only 25% of all positions in STEM fields (e.g., laboratory technicians or principal investigators) in general are held by women. Even when women do manage to obtain their Master&rsquo;s or Ph.D. degree in a STEM field, they are still more likely to report job dissatisfaction and are thus much more likely to leave STEM faculty positions or careers compared to their male counterparts. Such patterns have clear ramifications for university and corporate diversity, but also national productivity, innovation and quality of STEM products and services. Currently, however, it is entirely unclear why women choose to cease once valued pursuits in STEM fields. The goals of this project were to understand why women who are initially the most invested and motivated to succeed in STEM domains, are ironically the most likely to leave, or disidentify with, these domains. We examined how continuous exposure to social identity threatening contexts, i.e., stressful, physiologically arousing performance situations where negative stereotypes about women&rsquo;s math ability are salient, may initiate a biological stress response that enhances encoding and recall of negative emotional memories associated with STEM domains. These negative emotional memories, in turn, may promote a learned aversion towards STEM domains that undermine tactics people normally utilize to remain invested and motivated to persevere in domains they value (eg the degree to which people feel they have the ability to succeed in challenging classes or self-enhance). </span></p> <p>The outcomes of four large scale studies largely provided support for primary hypotheses and key insight into heretofore unknown factors that alter STEM identification and self-enhancement among women in STEM fields. Findings from Study 1 revealed that in addition to undermining performance in general, stereotype threatening contexts, and stereotype-based stress specifically, prompted women to exhibit stress (non-linear startle responses to negative feedbcak) and encode negative, stereotype confirming feedback via emotional memory encoding processes (increased amygdala activity, i.e., startle responses predicted better memory for negative feedback to the extent it facilitated better communication among emotional memory brain regions during a memory test). These patterns were not evident among men in general, or women in the control condition. This suggests the encoding of negative feedback was uniquely coupled with amygdala-based emotional memory processes in stereotype threatening contexts only.</p> <p>Women's emotional memory bias towards negative feedback, in turn, had downstream consequences on their perceptions within the math domain. Stereotype threatened women reported having less math ability in relation to their STEM peers and subsequent decreases in the importance of the math domain to their self-concept (who they are as a person) to the extent they encoded negative feedback more accurately via an amygdala-based emotional memory encoding process. These patterns were not evident among non-threatened women or men in either condition, suggesting stereotype-based stress has particularly deleterious consequences for women in STEM domains.&nbsp;</p> <p>These findings highlight a potential mechanism for why women report more negative math attitudes, less interest in STEM domains and less math confidence in general compared to men. If stereotype-based stress biases women towards encoding information that is consistent with the negative group stereotype, which then undermines the importance of the valued domain to the self as well as self-enhancing strategies that are necessary to cope with variations in performance in valued domains, it is clear to see how these mechanisms can foster more negative perceptions and interest in STEM domains over time in relation to men.</p> <p>Using a task designed for the purposes of this grant, results from additional studies indicated that only stereotype threatened women (including female STEM majors) exhibited aversive like responses in STEM contexts, which, in turn, predicted decreases in performance, more negative STEM autobiographical memories over time (after one week and throughout a semester) and even worse science grades among high school students.
