<AbstractNarration>This grant supports student participation in a doctoral mentoring consortium at the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS).   The ICAPS Doctoral Consortium (DC) is a primary method for broadening participation and improving retention of doctoral researchers in the field of automated planning and scheduling. This DC at ICAPS 2013, June 2013 in Rome, Italy, is the eleventh occurrence of the event.&lt;br/&gt;This symposium is carrying on a multiyear tradition of holding DCs and summer schools, providing an important venue to encourage students and junior researchers in automated planning and scheduling.  Activities include research panel discussions, lunch with mentors, and poster session held as part of the main conference. The DC brings together a broader community of researchers in planning and scheduling, promoting integration with other areas of AI and computer science, and encouraging junior researchers with a more focused attention to this area than is otherwise possible in other venues.  Of particular note is the potential to involve participants who might not have attended an AI conference before. This is especially true for those outside of the usual AI research community: those at smaller institutions who use AI in teaching but not in research; those from smaller/liberal arts institutions; and those from institutions that are poorly represented in STEM disciplines. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
