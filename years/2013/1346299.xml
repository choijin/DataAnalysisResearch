<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project will develop world?s first commercial diode pumped mode-locked titanium sapphire fiber laser based on visible laser diodes pumping a titanium sapphire fiber. By using direct semiconductor laser diode pumps as the engine, and fiber as the gain medium, this two stage fiber laser design approach represents a paradigm shift away from conventional fragile, expensive bulky four stage solid state crystal laser cavities, which utilize diode pumped second harmonic green lasers for pumping titanium sapphire.  Therefore, this project has substantial technical merit because it aims to pioneer and commercialize a new class of visible laser diode pumped fiber laser technology and provide substantial learning into laser and fiber optic materials technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project for the biomedical imaging community would be transformative, expanding the adoption of advanced nonlinear imaging techniques beyond the elite research institutions, and making them available to the broader biomedical imaging community in hospitals and commercial companies conducting bio-research.  The laser enables a multi-photon absorption and single photon emission process for deep, high resolution live tissue imaging that provides insights into study stem cell biology, the cellular effects of human disease, physiology, neurobiology, embryology and tissue engineering.  Additionally, the laser?s high peak powers has ablative that can be leveraged to address ophthalmic and ablative surgery, precision materials processing, and tattoo removal.  This system is designed to address the needs of the large and growing multi-photon imaging and biomedical systems market segment, and replace the excessively expensive and complex modelocked titanium sapphire lasers systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The STTR Phase I program was a critical step in the development of an innovative laser source for deep, high-resolution, live-tissue imaging, withlonger term applications in ablative surgery, ophthalmology, tattoo removal, and high-precision materials processing. Specifically, the program aims to develop the worldÃ†s first commercial, diode-pumped, mode-locked, fiber laser to employ visible laser diodes (LDs) to pump a Ti:Sapphire single crystal fiber (Ti:Al2O3 SCF).   The Phase I program was a significant effort involving effort teams at Lumany, at Rutgers University and at Clemson University. The Phase I program was successful in significantly advancing the design, with critical new learning around the SCF gain element in particular, both as a resonator component and in terms of growth and fabrication. This learning, along with the exploration of other component technologies involved in mode- locking, was crucial to detailing the proposed Phase II laser design.  Looking ahead to Phase II, Lumany has identified the laser design, laser diode pump architecture, and methods of fabrication for Ti:Sapphire SCFs to meet the requirements of the Phase II laser, including assembling, drawing and annealing of Ti:Sapphire SCFs. Therefore, the risk associated with this central aspect of the Phase II Program is now considered low-to-moderate.      Ultra-short pulsed Ti:Sapphire lasers in the &lt;150 fsec regime are the critical and enabling technology in advanced nonlinear microscopes and spectroscopy systems. The multi-photon absorption and single photon emission process enables deep, high resolution live tissue imaging that provides insights into study stem cell biology, the cellular effects of human disease, physiology, neurobiology, embryology and tissue engineering. The impact of achieving the project goals to the imaging community would be transformative, expanding the adoption of advanced nonlinear imaging techniques beyond the elite research institutions, and making them available to the broader biomedical imaging community in hospitals and commercial companies conducting bio-research.
