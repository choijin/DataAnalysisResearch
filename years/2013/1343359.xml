<AbstractNarration>There is growing demand for spectrum that cannot be met without new and more efficient approaches to spectrum use. Professors Jon Peha and Pedro Ferreira of Carnegie Mellon University are examining the technical, economic, and policy issues of cellular television, an unconventional approach to the delivery of over-the-air broadcast television that some believe could free up vast amounts of spectrum for other purposes while fundamentally transforming the television industry. Cellular television includes both single frequency networks (SFNs), and networks using efficient multicast over cellular data services for delivery of broadcast over-the-air television. This project is assessing the potential of cellular television, and its implications for policymakers and regulators. Using models that consider the propagation of wireless signals and realistic demand distributions for video content, researchers are investigating the infrastructure required to efficiently support cellular TV, and the corresponding short and long-term engineering-economics of providing broadcast services with this new approach. They are looking at how these architectures could affect spectrum availability and performance of other wireless systems, such as broadband cellular systems and TV white space devices. Researchers will use data on actual user behavior derived through empirical observation of a cable TV system to develop and assess algorithms that allow even greater spectrum sharing and efficiency by considering the programs that users watch, and how these vary in popularity over time and space. Researchers are also examining a variety of laws and regulations that could affect or be affected by the emergence of cellular TV.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This study has explored the potential impact of next-generation television, including how improved spectrum efficiency could enable the government to make television spectrum available for other purposes, and how technology envisioned as part of the ATSC 3.0 television standard could create efficiencies that reward market concentration.   We evaluated two possible ways to improve spectrum efficiency over today?s noise-limited single-transmitter approach to broadcast television. We considered increasing the transmit power of each broadcaster?s only transmitter, and found that it could reduce the amount of spectrum required by up to 30%, making it cost-effective in regions with population densities above 30 per square km.  We also considered replacing that single transmitter with a multi-transmitter single frequency network (SFN), and found that it could reduce the spectrum required by roughly 60%, making it cost-effective in regions with population densities over 120 per square km.  Using 2015 U.S. spectrum assignments and population densities as a baseline, we found that 54 MHz of spectrum could be freed nationwide if TV broadcasters adopted SFN technology, even when less than half of TV stations adopted the new technology.  While the benefits of these approaches to improving the spectrum efficiency may far exceed their costs, today?s spectrum policies provide no incentives to adopt the new technology, as the benefits do not go to those who incur the costs.  There are ways to address this problem, and policymakers should consider them.  We also examined the implications of using a mix of broadcast and broadband wireless unicast to disseminate content, as has been proposed in the ATSC 3.0 television standard to support the distribution of targeted advertising in next-generation television.  We showed that it is theoretically possible for this approach to give a significant competitive advantage to a broadcaster, consortium of broadcasters, or other entity that controlled advertisements on a large number of broadcast channels.  This could create incentives for market consolidation. However, we found that larger entities will not gain this competitive advantage in the scenarios that we consider to be most likely.  It would require viewing of TV on mobile devices to be greater than currently expected, and the cost of unicast to be lower that currently expected.  Thus, we conclude that regulators should be skeptical of any arguments to relax traditional pro-competition broadcast ownership limits if those arguments are made based on these hypothetical efficiencies.
