<AbstractNarration>This grant provides support for two workshops that will investigate the potential of empirical/statistical downscaling, a method to estimate how local climate is affected by regional and/or global conditions, to help develop a robust knowledge platform for decisions regarding adaptation to environmental change. This approach will bring together the research community, stakeholders and practitioners to establish a more rigorous foundation for the evaluation of data generated by this technique and to investigate the efficacy of including the data in outputs targeted at the needs of the adaptation and impact communities. The workshop will bring together an international community that will contribute a strong scientific base to a broad range of ongoing and proposed stake-holder relevant adaptation activities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal of the project was to develop an empirical statistical downscaling (ESD) component for the World Climate Research ProgrammeÆs (WCRPÆs) Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX). Downscaling entails producing regional information on climate change at scales too fine to appear in simulations by the main climate projection method, global climate models.  ESD has lagged behind numerical regional climate model (RCM) downscaling activities within CORDEX. To fix this shortcoming, an international science team conducted a sequence of three ESD workshops of 2-3 days each to close this gap and leverage the benefits of ESD to complement the RCM-based work.

The workshops brought together scientists active in ESD in order to establish a standard framework of ESD activities that contribute to CORDEX and complement the equivalent RCM product suite and, specifically, build on existing climate activities in Africa.  The specific merit of the program has been a foundation for a more cohesive global community among the wide diversity of ESD practitioners, and the establishment of a more rigorous foundation for the evaluation and uptake of ESD outputs by the scientific community and by stakeholders. The workshops have also developed a pathway for assessing all downscaling methods though a multi-model, multi-method evaluation framework that fits within CORDEX goals.  The broader impact of the ESD workshops is the contribution of ESD work directly to a range of other ongoing and proposed stakeholder-relevant climate adaptation and policy activities in developing nations, including those of various country aid agencies (e.g., UK DFID) and development agencies (e.g., World Bank). By advancing the role of statistical downscaling in CORDEX, the workshops are broadening the basis for analyzing climate downscaling and the provisioning of information for climate change studies in vulnerability, impacts and adaptation. The statistical downscaling participants are becoming more attuned to the needs and concerns of the stakeholder community through planning discussions at the workshops.  The workshops have thus started the foundation for sustained, globally coordinated end-to-end analysis from climate change simulation to ESD downscaling to societal responses, one of the goals of CORDEX.
