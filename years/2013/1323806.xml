<AbstractNarration>This research project led by the Exploratorium will use a combination of tracking and timing, cluster analysis, and focus groups to seek to answer the research question: To what extent and in what ways do female-responsive designs more effectively engage girls at STEM exhibits? This project addresses the need for more research in this area by pioneering the study of potential female-responsive design (FRD) principles for exhibits across a wide variety of STEM topics and exhibit types.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project includes four phases that will build from the work of the PI that developed an initial Female-Responsive Design (FRD) Framework regarding female engagement and learning in STEM -- based on extensive literature review and practitioner interviews. This project will expand on and validate this FRD Framework, with the ultimate goal of having a set of criteria for female-responsive designs (FRD) that effectively engage girls at STEM exhibits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The four phases of the research project are:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 1: Track whole museum visits to identify, which exhibits engage boys and girls equally, and which are less engaging for girls. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 2: A panel of experts and girl advisors identify additional female-responsive design principles, expanding on those identified to date in literature and practice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 3: Combining results from the first two phases, the third phase employs statistical analyses to reveal the most effective combinations of design principles for engaging girls across STEM topics and exhibit types. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Phase 4: This qualitative phase conducts focus groups with girls to explore how the final FRD Framework works to better engage them, and how their learning differs at exhibits that exemplify the principles in the Framework.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Exhibit Designs for Girls? Engagement (EDGE)  Intellectual merit.  The EDGE project is an NSF-funded research project that investigates and helps address gender gaps in science museums. Studies show that girls visit science museums less frequently than boys, and often avoid or spend less time at certain exhibits once in the museum. Yet limited research has focused on how museums can design interactive exhibits to be more appealing and engaging for girls. EDGE addresses this critical need by spearheading a large-scale study of female-responsive exhibit designs at STEM exhibits. The EDGE project entailed three major phases aimed at finding ways to better engage girls in free-choice learning environments:      Phase 1: The first phase of the project generated a framework for Female-Responsive Design (FRD), developed iteratively with two sources: 1) a review of the literature, and    2) input, expansion, and validation from various advisors (including the Girl Advisory Committee depicted in Image two). Through this process we identified patterns and preferences for and across females? STEM learning, identifying female-responsive strategies and adaptations of those approaches to exhibit design.      Phase 2: The second phase, a large-scale exploratory research study, determined which of the design attributes from the FRD Framework were the most important when designing for 8-13 year-old girls? engagement. The team began with 55 exhibit design attributes, along with variations on those attributes, that had the potential to better engage girls. To test those attributes and their relationship to girls? engagement, we studied over 900 children at more than 300 physics, engineering, math, and perception exhibits across three US science centers. This study winnowed the initial list of design attributes to a subset of nine that had consistently strong and positive relationships to girls? engagement: the EDGE Design Attributes (Image 1).     Phase 3: In this final phase, the research team worked toward a more nuanced, qualitative understanding of the EDGE Design Attributes through a series of focus groups. The results further support the findings from the large-scale quantitative study: focus group girls were more engaged when the attributes were present at exhibits. Girls expressed largely positive responses to the EDGE Design Attributes, while also expressing surprise about two of the attributes, Image of a person and Multiple stations or sides, reinforcing the notion that not all attributes will work for all girls. The focus groups also began to investigate the learning afforded by the EDGE Design Attributes. Of the kinds of learning evidenced across the focus groups, repeating and varying activities at exhibits (Skill Building) emerged as the most differentiating between exhibits with and without the EDGE Design Attributes.     Supplemental: Finally, the EDGE team obtained supplemental funds to reanalyze the EDGE study data to support ISE researchers in identifying important studies for further advancing the field. The reanalysis provides the relationships between all of the FRD Framework exhibit design attributes and the four measures of children?s engagement (use, time spent, returns, and behavior). The reanalysis also provides children?s engagement base rates across exhibits for the four engagement measures, which can inform exhibit development practice in addition to future research.       Broader impacts. As the nation is heralding the need for more STEM professionals from underserved audiences, museums can play a critical role in inspiring and preparing more girls in STEM. The EDGE project was designed to advance informal STEM learning by building museum developers? and educators? capacity for creating exhibits that better engage girls. The project outputs were developed to directly inform and impact practice.      The team co-created a freely available Guide to the EDGE Design Attributes (Image 3) with practitioners to provide an attractive guide to the research, its findings, and many examples of these attributes at exhibits. The project team also designed professional development workshops. Through the workshops we engaged over 150 practitioners directly with the project and in applying the findings (Images 4 &amp; 5). An ASTC Webinar gave a wider range of practitioners an introduction to the research, results, and application of the EDGE Design Attributes. These resources can be found on our project website: https://www.exploratorium.edu/education/research-evaluation/edge).
