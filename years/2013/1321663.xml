<AbstractNarration>This project lays the academic foundations for collaborations between researchers and indigenous American Indian community-based language practitioners for the purpose of developing a socio-technical means of, in parallel, preserving ancient indigenous languages and traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), and helping indigenous youth learn traditional languages and knowledge. The projected plan is to engage indigenous youth in the design of augmented reality immersive experiences for others (ARGs) that incorporate social media and immerse others in the culture and languages of the community as a means towards addressing these goals. Such an approach places youth in the position of being producers of immersive experiences for others and active collaborators with elders who they can share with and learn from. During the course of this Cyberlearning Capacity-Building Project (CAP), the PIs are convening a set of workshops involving researchers, indigenous language practitioners, and indigenous elders and youth to lay the foundations for later collaborative research and planning. Indigenous participants are being introduced to what is known about how people learn and about designing experiences for promoting learning; researchers are being introduced to the resources, needs, and knowledge of the indigenous people. American Indian participants are from four separate but linguistically-related tribal communities in the Midwest. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The next generation of indigenous peoples is faced with an awesome burden: how to sustain local ecosystems, languages, and lands in the face of rampant language, culture, and policy shifts. Existing theories of language and learning do not address these issues, and project participants are laying the groundwork for both developing theory around indigenous language and cultural learning and exploring the roles technology might play in drawing youth into these activities and helping them learn and preserve traditional languages and culture. Finding new channels for the transmission of indigenous languages and traditional ecological knowledge is both a practical and intellectual enterprise.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Partnerships in Indigenous Knowledge and Digital Literacies project aimed to develop projects involving augmented reality mobile indigenous language learning (ARMILL) digital games and applications, where the indigenous participants were the producers and were provided the means to create pedagogical tools in ways consistent with their linguistic, cultural and educational needs and to build capacity for community engagement with both the academic team and with each other beyond the scope of this project.</p> <p>Outcomes: The key project activities occurred during a range of ARMILL game development workshops for building capacity for participants from Ft. Mojave and several other indigenous groups&mdash;Hualapai, Maricopa, Mojave (Mohave) from the Colorado River Tribes Reservation, and Tohono O&rsquo;dham&mdash;held in June 2014, June 2015, and June 2016 and during a site visit in February 2015 to Aha Macav charter school in Ft. Mojave to work with teachers in their own classroom/school context. A variety of complementary symposia, talks, and sponsored workshops were also held between from November 2013 and June 2016. The project has resulted in the creation of a permanent website (http://indigenousdiglit.wordpress.com) that is accessible to individuals interested in the project into the future, with reference to two demonstration games and self-study materials for developing ARMILL games, independently (Several ARMILL digital games were produced during the project period and remain the property of the creators). The project also sponsored scholarships for indigenous educators to participate in AILDI (http://aildi.arizona.edu) workshops for technology-enhanced indigenous language documentation, revitalization and learning and the project has been presented and shared at several institute and conference talks.</p> <p>Intellectual Merit: The key intellectual questions addressed through this project were, how does the new technology of ARMILL digital games would help meet the education needs of small, rural indigenous communities?

The technology employed allows for the creation of educational materials in the indigenous languages themselves and with content appropriate for each community. There is a strong desire in targeted small communities to take steps to preserve their highly endangered languages and cultures. Opportunities to pass on linguistic and cultural knowledge in the traditional ways have been unavailable due to the lack of fluent speakers or of a pool of elders who are able to teach.

Trainings included community-based teachers and some high school students, fostering the ability of the students, as well as the teachers, to construct ARMILL games for use in educational environments. The content of ARMILL games allows the creators to lean heavily on cultural and linguistic information that supports the community need to preserve their highly endangered languages and cultures.
