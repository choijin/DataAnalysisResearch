<AbstractNarration>Virtualized infrastructure is becoming increasingly routine, and so the ability to manage it well is important.  Cloud computing is built on virtualized computing infrastructure.  Software Defined Networks are virtualized data networks.   The combination of virtualized computing and communications constitutes the next wave of innovation in  provisioning bespoke infrastructure.  This project addresses ways of making such virtualized infrastructure more reliable, by planning and managing the migration of the virtual network structure and associated computation from one set of supporting physical infrastruture to another. Triggers for VN migration include attacks, massive failures, performance collapse or degradation, or changes in the service demands that require an increase or decrease in resource allocation in order to both satisfy users and reduce power consumption. This ability to adapt to network dynamics is referred to as VI migration (VIM). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are many challenges in deploying VIM for the applications above. First, different network agility objectives might require different VIM models and techniques. For example, the trigger to migrate for proactive defense to defeat reconnaissance would need to be time based , whereas, for power management the trigger would be signi&amp;#64257;cant change of network traf&amp;#64257;c load. Second, VN migrations may need to be planned in advance (for example, in the case of proactive defense) but in some cases they cannot be planned in advance and need to be deployed in real time (in response to faults, for example). Third, although most existing theories permit reasoning about correctness of network operation only once as the system stabilizes to a static state, investigating formal frameworks that support migration strategies that are correct-by-construction under continuous movement is a prime research task. To address these challenges this project will develop a VIM architecture that is designed to work in the context of the GENI and PlanetLab virtualization technologies, but which could be used as the basis for other industrial systems. The architecture consists of two main components: a Strategy Synthesizer block and a Migration Mechanism block. The inputs to the Strategy Synthesizer block uses models of the VI and the Migration Mechanism block interacts directly with the substrate to implement the desired migration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;VIM is a powerful technique for energy control in Cloud infrastructure and effective tools for managing VIM are expected to facilitate significant savings in IT energy consumption.   In addition to the potential commercial and network security impacts of the work, the PIs have identified local and outreach activities that further the participation of women and minorities.  The experimental and evaluation aspects of the work will be incorporated as project elements in graduate courses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A virtualized infrastructure (VI) in the context of data networks is a substrate made up of interconnected network components on which virtual networks (VNs) can be constructed. Most if not all usage of the substrate is through these virtual networks with little or no applications running natively on the substrate.  This VI architecture enables a number of flexibility features.  Our work deals with the flexibility in resource allocation made possible by the potential for VN agility which is enabled through VN migration mechanisms that change a VN?s placement. Our investigation considered several security and performance motivations (or triggers) for VN migration, developed migration strategies (or policies) that correspond to these motivations and developed and prototyped migration mechanisms tailored to specific substrate virtualization technologies. This was a collaborative project between Georgia Tech and the University of North Carolina, Charlotte. Our work also included significant collaboration with researchers at La Spienza University in Rome, Italy.  Our accomplishments in this project included:  1-       The development, prototyping and evaluation of VN migration mechanisms on two specific experimental substrates (PlanetLab and GENI).  Re-affirming our initial hypothesis that migration mechanisms are highly dependent on the substrate technology and that current experimental networks could benefit from specific enhancements to enable efficient VN agility.  2-      The development and evaluation of the use of VN agility through migration as a technique for defense against network attacks. This uses VN agility as a form of "moving target defense". Our investigation demonstrates the merits of this approach.  3-      The development and analysis of a framework for deriving optimal VN migration policies that aim to minimize the energy consumption of a VN as traffic demands vary.  4-      Extension of VN migration ideas to virtual network function (VNF) migration. Network function virtualization (NFV) implements network functions in software running on a pool of shared commodity servers.  As such, NFV represents a generalization of network virtualization.  5-      Development and evaluation of an optimization framework for VNF dimensioning, allocation and migration to meet performance as well as energy consumption goals.  6-      The development of a new network connectivity paradigm dubbed "Zero-Hop Networking" that is based on network virtualization and the flexibility that it enables.  The broader impacts of our research include:  1-      The support and training of two female PhD students. One of the students completed her PhD during the three and half years of this project and joined AT&amp;T Research at the completion of her degree.  2-      Facilitation of international collaboration with La Sapienza in Rome which included two Italian PhD students spending one semester each at Georgia Tech (while supported by their home university).  3-      The recognition of the applicability of VN agility to Network Function Virtualization has the potential to add a new dimension to this important emerging area of research.  4-      The insights we gained from investigating VN agility have led us to define a vision for Zero-Hop Networking. This has the potential to enable novel network connectivity paradigms.       Last Modified: 05/02/2017       Submitted by: Mostafa H Ammar]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
