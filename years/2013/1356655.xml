<AbstractNarration>Identifying genetic variation underlying complex phenotypes aids the understanding of their biology. Complex phenotypes characterized by a variety of features are often associated with substantial phenotypic variation. Current statistical methods are ineffective to address this phenotypic heterogeneity, and hence lack of power to associate genetic variants with the phenotype. This project aims to design new algorithms that differentiate homogenous subtypes of a complex phenotype that are most informative in genetic analysis, and identify genetic variants that are associated with the subtypes but cannot be detected by the non-differentiated phenotype. The validity of the subtypes will be proved in multiple scales including the evidence from genomic structure and phenotypic features. The new algorithms will be validated in the areas of genetic selection for complex traits of agriculturally-important animals and plants. This project serves a vehicle to train graduate students in the multidisciplinary methods involving computer science and biology, and allow them to apply the methods in a variety of biological fields. A new course in the bioinformatics field will be developed for senior undergraduate students. High school educational materials will also be developed to educate high school students about how to mathematically model biological data so it solves biological problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will derive novel analytics based on quantitative genetics theory and machine learning theory to refine complex phenotypes for enhanced discovery of genotype-phenotype correlations. Using empirical and statistically rigorous methods, this project will derive composite traits, as functions of multiple phenotypic features, that are optimized with respect to narrow-sense heritability, and that map readily to specific genomic regions. Two statistical models for estimating narrow-sense heritability will be considered: one based on sample pedigrees, and the other directly uses the whole-genome markers. To identify multi-scale evidence of a subtype that is characterized by a composite trait, a new machine learning framework will be derived to jointly analyze genotypes and phenotypes. By testing the algorithms in the analysis of large-scale biological databases, the new algorithms will derive highly heritable composite traits for feed efficiency of dairy cattle and adaptive traits of soybean to improve their genetic selection. The algorithms developed in this project will also advance the machine learning field by defining and addressing new research problems, such as the joint model inference using data from multiple sources, probabilistic clustering based on matrix decomposition, and quadratic optimization for heritability estimation. This project will yield user-friendly software tools that can be broadly deployed to biological research areas that study genetics of complex phenotypes. The validated methods and software will be disseminated through the PI?s laboratory website http://www.labhealthinfo.uconn.edu/home/ which provides more information of this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Because multivariate and multifactorial phenotypes often exhibit great phenotypic heterogeneity that hinders the understanding of their genetic basis, the subject of this project is the design of effective methods for subtyping or classification of a complex phenotype. The project was successful, and findings were reported in six journal articles and over ten juried conference papers.  (1) We integrated machine learning principles into statistical genetic theory to develop (restricted) maximum likelihood methods with sparsity-driven regularization to identify the principal components of a multivariate trait (i.e., a trait defined through multiple indicators or features) that have high heritability either in terms of pedigree-based narrow-sense heritability or chip heritability computed from genome-wide DNA markers.  (2) We developed new machine learning algorithms for multi-view cluster analysis that cluster subjects on the basis of two views - phenotypic parameters and genetic markers so that a subtype can be recognized from both of the views.  (3) We developed new machine learning algorithms based on multi-task learning principles to perform association tests simultaneously with multiple subtypes or subcategories of a disease phenotype.  (4) We coped with the complex nature of phenotypic observations (e.g., a phenotype may be evaluated by repeatedly measuring multiple parameters over a time window). We proposed longitudinal data analytic methods and graph learning methods to account for the intercorrelation between the observed data records and/or between the phenotypic parameters.  (5) Because the missing data problem is common in most phenotypic observations, we proposed an imputation method based on matrix completion techniques to impute the missing values of phenotypic features. Unlike standard matrix completion methods, this method no longer assumes that the data matrix is low rank which does not necessarily hold in practice.  This project partially supported two postdoc researchers and seven PhD students' research, including three students' dissertation research.
