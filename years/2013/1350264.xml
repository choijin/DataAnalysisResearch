<AbstractNarration>Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are being envisioned to monitor health and vitals of the nation?s critical infrastructure, e.g. bridges, roads, and buildings. Other applications include monitoring remote space stations and off-earth structures, e.g. the inflatable lunar habitats. A significant challenge in making remote monitoring a reality is data collection from the sensors, as their batteries do not allow long-range transmission. This research enables data collection and inspection via Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), invoking subsequent investigation in dynamic task allocation, distributed path planning, and collaborative navigation in GPS-denied/indoor settings. In particular, this study develops the theoretical foundations for autonomous monitoring and inspection, where WSNs operate in a complete harmony with a network of UAVs. The WSN provides intelligible information to the UAVs for responsive and diagnostic actions; while the UAVs coordinate (and may also bring outside directives) to adapt the WSN to the environment and application demands.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To undertake this effort, this research casts the predominantly nonlinear UAV control, navigation, and planning problems in a completely linear framework. The linearity of the underlying dynamics builds upon some of the classical work in convex geometry and Euclidean metrics. Subsequently, the distributed control problem is formulated using structured systems theory, by which efficient graph-theoretic controllability and actuation methods are developed. These features play a significant role in establishing rigorous analytical arguments and in implementing a fully functional remote monitoring and inspection prototype. The transformative approach adapts to the application needs and is robust to imperfections in the underlying communication and environment uncertainties. The study further involves several outreach efforts via social coding platforms and workshops for minority, women in engineering, and K-12 students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project is to develop the theoretical foundations of monitoring and inspecting a structure of interest, instrumented with a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), with the help of autonomous (aerial, ground, or both) vehicles. The outcomes of this project are provided in the following divided into research and education.   Research Outcomes  We developed the foundations of the distributed fusion (control and estimation) protocols implemented over WSNs and autonomous (ground, aerial, or both) vehicles.  We developed fusion algorithms for multi-agent systems with autonomous vehicles including task allocation and localization/navigation algorithms.  We developed robustness in the above fusion and navigation algorithms in order to account for the communication noise, interference, disturbances, and other imperfections.     Education Outcomes  We enabled undergraduate participation in research by developing in-house prototypes based on the theoretical research. These prototypes were developed over the Dowling Hall footbridge at Tufts and the lunar habitat at U-Maine. We developed research courses to expose undergraduates with the state-of-the-art research and to expose graduate students with advanced theoretical concepts.  We developed outreach activities towards underrepresented communities, undergraduate recruitment, and K-12 outreach.     Outcomes sumamry  Over the course of this project, 20+ undergraduate students and 10+ MS students were involved in addition to 4 PhD students (note that the funding only supports one graduate student per year). The major activities have resulted into 20+ journal articles that have been published already, with multiple articles, in addition, under review, and 20+ peer-reviewed conference publications. Some highlights are described below:  A peer-reviewed conference publication won the best student paper in the Networks track at IEEE Asilomar, Nov. 2014; A peer-reviewed conference publication received the best student paper award at IEEE ISNSC, Apr. 2014; A journal paper was highlighted on the cover of IEEE JSTSP: A peer-reviewed conference publication won the best student paper in the Networks track at IEEE Asilomar, Nov. 2016, and third prize in the conference Best student paper contest; The project resulted into several special issue articles including one in IEEE Signal Processing Magazine and another in the Proceedings of the IEEE; The PI is leading a Special Issue in Proceedings of the IEEE on Optimization for data-driven Learning and Control to be published in late 2020.    The project was highlighted on several technical news and media outlets including an NSF special report on CPS, twice on IEEE Spectrum, ACM News, ASCE Mag., RFID journal, and on several Tufts internal channels and numerous other technical blogs. Several REU undergraduate projects were completed, all of which are directly related to the goals of this project.

An email received from a parent highlights the workshop impact:  "My son James and I attended this weekend’s CTY program.  I just wanted to send you a quick note thanking you.  The day was a lot of fun for both of us.  James loves technology and has a true passion for programming and engineering.  The high school that he currently attends does not offer much in the way of those two disciplines.  I feel like academic achievements in his school are often overshadowed by the sports programs, and as a parent that can be a bit frustrating. On Saturday I saw James with a group of students and teachers that share his interests and passions.  It was very heartwarming for me to see my son in that environment."
