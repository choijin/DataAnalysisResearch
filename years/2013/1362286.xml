<AbstractNarration>With this New award, the Chemical Synthesis Program supports Professor Matthias Brewer of University of Vermont &amp; State Agricultural College in a project investigating new chemical syntheses that will provide routes to a variety of structurally complex molecules. Several of these new transformations will follow unique routes that are not accessible by current synthetic methods. The new organic molecules that will be prepared will be of fundamental importance to researchers seeking to develop new pharmaceuticals and other molecules of biological interest. These studies will provide a mechanism for the training of developing scientists in the areas of synthetic organic chemistry, reaction design, total synthesis and complex structure elucidation. This project will also give a summer research experience to an economically disadvantaged high school student.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will investigate the intramolecular reactions of in situ-generated 1-aza-2-azoniaallene salts in the synthesis of nitrogen heterocycles. Aspects of these novel heteroallene salts that will be explored include C-H insertion reactions, reactions involving aziridinium ion intermediates, cycloaddition reactions and the use of this methodology for the total synthesis of (+)-ibophyllidine. This work will provide new ways to prepare structurally complex nitrogen heterocycles under mild, low temperature, conditions.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Our research program focuses on developing new reactions in organic chemistry that can be used to prepare nitrogen containing heterocycles &ndash; structural motifs that are common in biologically active molecules. The work conducted under this grant focused on studying the reactivity of a reactive intermediate known as a 1-aza-2-azoniaallene salt. These highly reactive species can react by several mechanistically distinct intramolecular pathways that lead to structurally distinct products. Under this grant, we conducted experimental and computational studies that shed light on how these reactions occur. These studies also gave a better understanding of the factors that determine which reaction pathway is taken, and thus which product is ultimately formed. For example, we developed a mechanistic understanding of how 1-aza-2-azoniaallene salts can insert into C-H bonds, and we determined why some systems react by C-H insertion, while other similar systems react by a chloroamination pathway. 1-Aza-2-azoniaallene salts can also react in a third and unrelated reaction known as a [4+2]-cycloaddition, which gives structurally complex systems. Over the course of this grant we developed an improved procedure to effect these cycloaddition reactions, and showed that the products formed can be used in subsequent complexity-building reactions that give polycyclic products. We also conducted preliminary studies to apply the [4+2]-cycloaddition to the synthesis of an alkaloid natural product. Overall, these studies provide a rational understanding of the reactivity of 1-aza-2-azoniaallene salts, which will enable synthetic chemists and biomedical researchers to take advantage of these useful species. The research of three graduate students (all of whom completed their Ph.D.), a postdoctoral fellow, and two undergraduate students was supported by this award. In addition, the research of an economically disadvantaged high school student was supported by this award through Project SEED; a program designed to encourage young students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds to pursue careers in science by providing a paid summer research experience.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/27/2018<br>      Modified by: Matthias&nbsp;Brewer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
