<AbstractNarration>The American Mathematical Society (AMS) has created the Mathematics Research Communities (MRC) as a national program to support and guide young mathematicians as they begin their research careers.  In 2014, there are four MRC conferences proposed, all to be held in Snowbird, Utah:  Cluster Algebras, June 8 - 14, 2014; Algebraic and Geometric Combinatorics in Applied Mathematics, June 15 - 21, 2014; Mathematics of Quantum Phases of Matter and Quantum Information, June 25 - July 1, 2014; and Network Science, June 25 - July 1, 2014. The topics of the conferences to be held in 2015 and 2016 will be determined later by the MRC Advisory Board, which evaluates proposals submitted by senior mathematicians who wish to be organizers.  Each of the MRC conferences will bring together a diverse group of young mathematicians. The organizing committee for each conference is composed of leaders in the field of the conference and includes individuals with previous experience in organizing successful workshops and conferences. The conferences will bring together senior and junior researchers in an ideal environment to establish connections, which often last for many years after the conference itself.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of the Mathematics Research Communities program is to create research cohorts of young mathematicians that will sustain themselves over time, fostering joint research and coherent research programs that will, eventually, reach all areas of mathematics. The Mathematics Research Communities program strives to achieve this goal through the following activities in addition to the summer research conferences: Special Sessions at the annual AMS-MAA Joint Mathematics Meetings, mentoring and a discussion network. It is the formation of research cohorts that sets this program apart from any other (national) professional development programs for mathematicians that currently exist. The creation of three to four new cohorts per year has the potential to lay a foundation for decades of research, and will have an extremely positive effect on mathematics research in the U.S. Most importantly, this program will focus on mathematicians who are beginning their research careers; all program components will help to train and connect the next generation of researchers in, eventually, all research areas of mathematics.  This proposal is requesting support for an additional three years of this unique program. Conference topics will include both pure and applied mathematics areas of research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The American Mathematical Society (AMS) developed the Mathematics Research Communities (MRC) as a national program to support and guide young mathematicians as they begin their research careers.  The goal of the MRC program is to create research cohorts of early-career mathematicians that will sustain them over time and to foster the development of productive, collaborative research programs that will, eventually, reach all areas of the mathematical sciences.  The MRC program strives to achieve this goal through the following activities: intensive, hands-on summer research conferences; Special Sessions at the annual AMS-MAA Joint Mathematics Meetings; guidance in career-building; and follow-up small-group collaborations.  Ongoing mentoring is a fundamental aspect of all parts of the program.  NSF grant DMS-1321794 supported the Mathematics Research Communities summer conferences held in 2014, 2015 and 2016, along with the activities for each group of participants that followed the conferences.  Forty-seven senior mathematicians, leaders in the fields of the conferences, organized the eleven summer conferences held during those three years.  The topics covered a wide range of pure and applied mathematics, as well as statistics, and included such subjects as financial mathematics, algebraic statistics, network science, and the mathematics of physiology and medicine.  The participants comprised a diverse group of 358 graduate students and recent Ph.D. recipients.   About 150 of the participants and organizers took part in follow-up collaborations that were partially funded by the grant.  During the time period since September 1, 2014, the participants in these three MRC cohorts and previous ones have reported the publication more than fifty books, book chapters, and scholarly papers emanating from the research projects that were launched in the MRC program.   Thirty-two percent of the participants during these three years were women, roughly mirroring the percentage of women among new Ph.D.'s in the mathematical sciences.  Of those who reported their race or ethnicity, 27 (about 8%) identified as Hispanic/Latino and 10 (about 3%) as Black/African-American.  The corresponding percentages for new Ph.D.'s in the mathematical sciences are about 4.8% and 2.8%, respectively.  The Mathematics Research Communities provides significant opportunities for early-career mathematicians to engage in research in their chosen fields.  The conferences and Special Sessions at the Joint Mathematics Meetings brought together senior and junior researchers in an ideal environment to establish connections, which often last for many years after the conference itself.  Most importantly, this program has focused on mathematicians who are beginning their research careers; all program components have helped to train and connect the next generation of mathematical scientists.  It is the formation of research cohorts that sets this program apart from any other national professional development program for mathematicians that currently exists, and it is this aspect of the program that has the potential to lay a foundation for decades of mathematical sciences research in the United States.
