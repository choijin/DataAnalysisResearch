<AbstractNarration>The project involves analysis of two types of stochastic dynamics. First, the PI will study solutions to stochastic differential equations which undergo rare, random transitions between two or more regions of the state space.  The goal of this work is to understand the statistics of these transitions, especially in the small-noise regime: what are the typical pathways by which the transitions occur? what is the typical time required for a transition?  These issues are very relevant to problems in chemistry and molecular dynamics, as well as many other physical systems exhibiting metastable behavior. The second type of stochastic dynamics which the PI will study has to do with stochastic interacting particle systems.  Specific systems to be studied involve random motion, growth, and selection, as in models of evolution, population genetics, adaptive dynamics. The PI will study continuum limits and large-time limits for such systems. In particular, this will illuminate new relations between interacting particle systems and continuum free boundary problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;When viewed at a certain scale, many physical and biological systems seem to behave randomly or are influenced by small random fluctuations. Mathematical models of such systems involve probability theory.  Nevertheless, it is very difficult to use these mathematical models to efficiently predict the system behavior over a long period of time or over a large spatial region.  Therefore, a fundamental scientific and mathematical problem is to understand how random dynamics or interactions at one spatial or temporal scale influence a system at another spatial or temporal scale. This research project develops mathematical tools for predicting and describing the macroscopic behavior of certain systems which behave randomly at a microscopic level.  The specific systems to be studied are motivated by problems in chemistry and by models of biological evolution. One common feature in these systems is the appearance of random, perhaps rare, transitions: a chemical reaction occurs or a cell produces a mutation. The educational component of the project includes the training of graduate and undergraduate students at the intersection of probability, analysis, and applications, preparing them for careers in STEM-related disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    This project involved fundamental research and student training in the areas of probability and asymptotic analysis.   There are several physical and biological phenomena that can be modeled mathematically by many particles or individuals that change their state and interact with each other in a random way.  Because of the randomness of these interactions and the many particles involved, it is impossible to accurately predict the behavior of the entire system.   For this reason, a fundamental mathematical problem is to characterize statistics of averaged quantities and the macroscopic-level behavior of these systems when the number of particles is very large.  How does the nature of the random interactions effect the macroscopic-level behavior of the system? Can we describe the statistics of these systems after a long time?  With students and collaborators, the PI has analyzed particle systems that evolve by branching and selection, by reaction with other particles, and by diffusion.  The PI has derived quantitative estimates on how well some particle systems are described approximately by simpler non-random models involving partial differential equations (PDEs).  Some of the main research achievements include:  (1) A quantitative description of propagation of chaos in stochastic reaction-diffusion models involving multiple species in mass-action chemical networks.  Reaction-diffusion PDEs, which are deterministic, are commonly used as approximate models for such systems, and they arise in biochemical applications; the project results give some quantitative measure of the error in such approximations.  (2) Derivation and analysis of a novel nonlinear free-boundary PDE arising from a system of diffusions undergoing branching and a fitness-dependent selection. This work gives a mathematical description of how the fitness landscape may shape an evolving population through selection of the least-fit particles.  (3) Branching Brownian motion is a classic model for spatially-extended branching processes, and it has a rich mathematical structure.  This project produced a sharp description of some statistics of branching Brownian motion as time passes and the system grows.  This gives a better understanding of the distribution of the extremal particle in a Branching Brownian motion and on statistics of the particle density in spatially-variable environment.   (4) Rigorous derivation of the macroscopic behavior of a particle system known as Stein-variational gradient decent, used in statistics and machine learning applications to sample from a given probability distribution with unknown normalization. This gives some understanding of how these sampling algorithms behave with large numbers of particles.   The results of the project have been disseminated through publication in mathematical journals and through presentations given at mathematics conferences and university seminars.  The project has contributed to the training and professional development of several students and postdocs.  In particular, the project has supported the work of graduate students contributing to the research, and provided training for them in the area of stochastic analysis.  The PI developed an undergraduate course on using differential equations and probability to model various human diseases.  The PI has also supervised teams of undergraduate students in summer research projects and taught graduate mini-courses on related topics in probability.
