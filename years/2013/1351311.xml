<AbstractNarration>The main research objective of this 5-year CAREER project is to provide new constraints on solar dynamo models, so that a better understanding of the Sun and solar-cycle dynamics becomes possible.  Over the course of the project, the PI will focus his research on achieving the stated science objective by completing tasks such as: (i) measuring the meridional and zonal flows at the surface and in the solar convection zone as functions of depth and latitude; (ii) quantifying the time variations of these flows over almost two solar cycles; and, (iii) understanding and correcting the systematics in helioseismic data sets, in part by using numerical simulations.  A diverse cohort of graduate and undergraduate students will carry out this research, which will ultimately: (i) produce two PhD graduates in helioseismology; (ii) provide ten minority undergraduates the opportunity to engage in meaningful research experiences; and, (iii) stimulate relevant 6th-grade learning activities about the Sun and high-level content-based professional development training for K-12 instructors.  The research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.</AbstractNarration>
