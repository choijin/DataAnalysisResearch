<AbstractNarration>This goal of this proposal is to develop advanced techniques designed to place precise constraints on cosmological parameter estimates through weak gravitational lensing analysis of ongoing and future galaxy surveys, in particular the Dark Energy Survey. This will be achieved by improving weak gravitational lensing shape measurement algorithms and data calibration techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of a graduate student, and sharing of lensing computer codes through the GalSim project.   The work will contribute to the future success of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant primarily supported work on the Dark Energy Survey (DES), a 5-year survey of 1/8 of the full sky jointly funded by the NSF and Dept of Energy, with the primary goal of measuring the nature of the dark matter that dominates the normal matter in the Universe, and the dark energy or possible errors in General Relativity that are causing the expansion of the Universe to accelerate.  One grant outcome was to develop a much improved new method to measure the slight distortion of distant galaxy images that occurs when their light rays are slightly deflected by the gravity of dark matter lying near the path of the light to Earth.  Applying this "gravitational lensing" method to the first of five years of DES data has shown that the behavior of gravity and dark matter over the past 13 billion years is consistent with a Universe filled with cold dark matter particles and the "cosmological constant" first proposed by Einstein.  DES continues to produce many new results across the range of astrophysics, and the DES data are being released for public use.   This project contributes at many levels to DES: the PI is also Project Scientist of DES, coordinating and guiding many of the operational and scientific aspects of the project.  He has also led the basic understanding of how to convert the signals from the camera into highly accurate measurements of the positions and brightnesses of the stars and galaxies seen on the sky.  The techniques developed for DES will have broader impacts in being used by the whole community of astronomers using the same NSF-funded observatory, and this experience with DES guides the planning for the even larger sky survey to be conducted by NSF's upcoming Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST).    A broader impact of this project is the training of one new PhD astronomer - she will soon graduate and embark on a career of science education and outreach. Three undergraduates were introduced to scientific research by working on aspects of DES analyses, and are moving into graduate programs in physics and astronomy research.  The PI and graduate student have worked to bring DES and other astronomical research to the public through community events, press releases and other media postings, and museum and classroom visits and presentations.
