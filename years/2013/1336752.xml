<AbstractNarration>This project will utilize analytical and numerical modeling to study how shallow sills in channels and straits impact incident coastal Kelvin waves. It is motivated by measurement programs over the past two decades in the passages carrying the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF). Kelvin waves generated in the equatorial Indian Ocean have been shown to penetrate these passages episodically, often reversing branches of the ITF for up to a month at a time. Recent measurements have revealed a vertical structure to these reversals and evidence of vertical phase propagation within the straits associated with passing Kelvin waves. Speculation at present connects the vertical propagation observed within the straits to vertical propagation of the incident waves, but the project will demonstrate that the situation can involve considerable complexity. The work will provide a dynamical foundation for understanding the observations in the ITF passages. A preliminary analytical model has been developed which shows promising results. An incident wave of a single baroclinic mode will be scattered into vertical propagation in the channel and in the basin past the channel. A strait will alter the frequency content of an incident vertically propagating pulse, resulting in vertical propagation characteristics of the transmitted and bypassed pulses that are different from those of the incident pulse.  The project will develop the preliminary analytical model, providing justification for the foundational assumptions, error estimates and validity limits. The model predictions will then be analyzed for the most intuitive physical understanding of the various effects. Numerical process models would be used to understand the effects on the model predictions of more realistic dissipation, boundary conditions and bottom topography. Finally, a regional numerical model will be used to attempt to reproduce observations in the ITF passages and explain these in terms of the underlying dynamics revealed by the more idealized models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  This study will advance the theory of geophysical fluid dynamics by clarifying the effects that sills in straits and channels have on the baroclinic structures and vertical propagation of incident coastal Kelvin waves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The Indonesian Throughflow is a vital link in the upper branch of the global oceanic overturning circulation, which in turn is an important component of Earth's climate system. The Indian Ocean Kelvin waves are known to episodically impact the ITF to the extent of frequently reversing the flow direction, yet the complex vertical and temporal structure of these effects is only now beginning to be understood and they are poorly parameterized in global models. Although this study does not aim at improving the parameterizations of global climate models, its contributions will at least improve the knowledge of what must be parameterized in order to successfully model the global system. The project will provide support for a graduate student and will train the student in analytical and numerical modeling techniques necessary to make further contributions in oceanic dynamics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A special class of waves exists at periods of days to months, which can propagate for long distances along coastlines without radiating offshore.  These waves can affect the coastal water temperature through upwelling or downwelling, they can produce anomalous coastal currents and sea levels, and they can signal the occurrence of far-distant events.   Coastal sea level anomalies triggered by the onset of El Nino in the equatorial Pacific, for instance, have been seen to travel up the North American coast as far as the Gulf of Alaska.  This project demonstrates that irregularities in the vertical structure of the coastline can scatter the incoming coastal waves into vertically propagating waves that emanate from the top of the irregularity, and which have increased current shear relative to the incoming wave.  The irregularities can include channels or straits that open onto the coastline but which are shallower than the adjacent ocean, or subsurface ridges that project out from the coastline.  The scattering that we demonstrate alters the vertical profile of alongshore currents, and it can produce increased turbulence both within the water column, and at the surface and bottom far down the coast from the scattering feature.  This can have impacts on nutrient supplies for coastal fisheries, and on air-sea interactions in the coastal zone.  We demonstrate the above phenomenon with numerical models, and provide an analytical technique for clarifying the basic physics involved.   We apply the results to an interpretation of observations along the west coast of India, an important fisheries region, and within the straits of Indonesia.  The latter comprise the major connection between the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and flow through the straits (which can be impacted by the phenomenon we demonstrate) can influence the global-scale climate patterns generated in these major oceans.  The irregularity of coastlines is fairly common, however, and our results are likely to apply in many more locations.
