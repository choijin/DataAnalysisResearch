<AbstractNarration>The seafloor serves and the primary conduit for mass and heat transfer between the sub-seafloor and the overlying ocean water column, with both operating on vastly different time and mass scales.  Dynamics at this interface drive global biogeochemical and geochemical elemental cycles, control global ocean chemistry, and shape the atmosphere and climate systems. Deep sea ecosystems also host some of the most diverse and extreme ecosystems including those inhabiting hydrothermal vents, cold seeps, mid-ocean ridges, ridge flanks, and plate margins.  Without data from a wide variety of disciplines, such as geology, petrology, geophysics, hydrogeology, and micro/macro/evolutionary biology, it is not possible to realistically model these important systems and understand the complex interactions between their various physical, chemical, and biological components. Instrumental to understanding processes and dynamics of the deep sea requires integration of the disparate datasets and models that represent and predict the behavior of the components of this complex, important system.  The goal of this workshop is to surface requirements in the field of deep sea processes for a major new NSF data and knowledge management initiative (i.e., EarthCube) that is dedicated to revolutionizing geoscience by providing easy access to, discovery of, and visualization of data from across the geo- and environmental sciences. This workshop will bring together ~55 oceanographers from across the relevant disciplines. It will also include cyber/computer science experts.  Together workshop participants will collectively define future science goals in this important scientific area and focus on identifying the most critical, widespread cyberinfrastructure and data management issues and problems presently holding back scientific advances in deep sea science in order to guide the development of NSF EarthCube cyberinfrastructure. The workshop will also focus on strategies that help scientists and data that they need to cross sub-discipline barriers to enable more interdisciplinary research to take place.  Workshop participants will address topics such as science drivers in deep sea process research in the next 15 years, data and data management needs and problems, and software and visualization needs to help model and understand data. Broader impacts of the work include support of an organization in an EPSCoR state, support of two PIs whose gender is under-represented in the sciences and engineering, and engagement of early career scientists. A virtual component of the workshop will be held to help broaden participation beyond those present on-site.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award supported a workshop focused on the data management and cyberinfrastructure needs of geoscientists who work in deep-sea environments.  A total of 61 scientists from all career stages participated in the workshop either in person or through the online broadcast of the meeting.  As a group we identified (1) several scientific drivers that we anticipate will be guiding our work over the next decade, (2) the current challenges we face that impact our ability to do high-impact interdisciplinary science, and (3) next steps we can pursue as a community to advance our ability to create and make use of high-quality open access digital data.  Challenges/Opportunities we identified include:  1.  Data integration challenges:  Spatial and temporal co-registration of high-quality data sets is critical to enabling data integration, but is difficult to achieve in the deep-sea environments. This is further complicated by discipline- and project-dependent data quality needs.  2.  Data acquisition and completeness:  Data in the deep sea are sparse in both space and time, making it difficult to obtain datasets of adequate size, scale and quality to address global research questions.  3.  Ensuring that data are available and fit for re-use requires training and awareness coupled with easy tools that can be integrated into established scientific workflows.   4.  An online resource of searchable, quality-controlled, co-registered deep-sea data will foster the development of new and exciting data science and analysis tools and ultimately lead to unprecedented exploration and discovery opportunities in deep-sea science.  We recognize that several tools and databases already exist to support our community, and better training throughout the community is necessary to take full advantage of these resources.  The incorporation of data management practices into established scientific workflows across the broad community of deep-sea researchers is essential in current and future research projects. We identified several cost-effective rapid solutions to overcoming many of our data management obstacles, but are unsure of funding mechanisms despite the recognized impact these solutions would have on our community. Finally, we recognized the growing need for a "data wrangler" to participate in field programs to facilitate and optimize data and metadata acquisition and curation, ensure compliance with data management standards, and facilitate contemporaneous data documentation. The role of the data scientist who sits at the intersection of domain science and geoinformatics is growing, but resources are necessary to ensure good data management practices and to better integrate data scientists with disciplinary geoscience workflows.
