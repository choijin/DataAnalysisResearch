<AbstractNarration>1303269 Project Abstract:&lt;br/&gt;Modular steps towards broadening expertise in Critical Infrastructure Protection&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This multi-partner project addresses an identified shortcoming in Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) education by developing curricular materials and expertise at the high school and undergraduate levels. Partnering on this project are three institutions: (1) Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), a Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education (CAE-IAE) since 2003, with a multidisciplinary team of faculty representing expertise in critical infrastructure, computing, engineering, technology, and security; (2) Corning Community College (CCC); and (3) Greater Southern Tier Board of Cooperative Educational Services (GST BOCES), a program for high school students serving 21 schools in New York's Southern Tier counties. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has four major goals. First, the project develops and embeds a set of flexible CIP course modules, such as labs or teaching components, in existing high school and courses without requiring major course or program modifications. Second, faculty expertise in CIP is developed through cross-disciplinary collaborations within and between the partnering institutions. Third, the developed curricular materials are disseminated through presentations, tutorials, panels and workshops. Finally, project effectiveness is comprehensively assessed using both external and internal evaluators.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has identified 16 critical infrastructure sectors whose non-functioning in whole or in part would debilitate the national security and economic security of the United States.  Among these sectors are critical manufacturing, financial institutions, public health and safety, energy, dams, and much more.  This critical infrastructure faces a variety of ongoing threats, some of which are natural, such as earthquakes and hurricanes, while others are man-made, such as chemical plant explosions or terrorist attacks.  Protecting the nation?s critical infrastructure is, therefore, a national priority, and all US citizens need to become aware of the challenges facing such infrastructure and become trained to protect it.  While general informational materials on the 16 critical infrastructure sectors are available, curricular materials for educating high school and undergraduate students were not.     This project directly addressed the lack of resources available to teach Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) at the high school and college levels.  It was led by principal investigators from the Rochester Institute of Technology, collaborating with Corning Community College and the Greater Southern Tier Board of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES), an agency that provides educational leadership, services, and support to meet the needs of K-12 students and school districts in New York?s southern tier. As part of the project deliverables, the investigators designed, developed and embedded a set of reusable CIP curricular modules for high school, community college and university students; developed faculty expertise in CIP across computing and non-computing disciplines through cross-disciplinary collaborations within and between the partnering institutions; disseminated the CIP curriculum; and also assessed the effectiveness of the developed materials.     During its lifetime, the project helped to design, develop, teach and assess eight CIP course modules across all three partnering institutions: Rochester Institute of Technology, Corning Community College, and Greater Southern Tier BOCES. These course modules were embedded and tested in 16 courses: seven at the high school level, three at the community college level and six at the university level. The materials were delivered to students in both computing and non-computing disciplines. Over 15 peer-reviewed research articles were published and presented at national and international computing conferences covering computing and engineering education, as well as disciplinary conferences in this space. Over 269 high school students, 233 college students, 25 faculty members, and around 50 CIP professionals directly benefited from the curricular materials during this project, and the ongoing use of these materials after project completion will continue to impact additional students, faculty, and professionals.     In summary, this grant has had a wide-ranging effect on different aspects of our society. The developed curriculum supported by the grant has helped to educate American students on strategies for protecting our critical infrastructure and safeguarding our personal, societal and national resources. Second, through the participating institutions, the project impacted students living in rural areas where opportunities are limited in comparison to large urban centers.  The ideas and artifacts generated and disseminated by this project are applicable to other regions of the nation.
