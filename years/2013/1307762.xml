<AbstractNarration>The objective of this collaborative research between FIU and Georgia Tech is to achieve simultaneous powering and communication of implantable and wearable sensors through novel Highly Efficient, Misalignment-Insensitive, and Broadband (HEMIB) Strongly Coupled Magnetic Resonance (SCMR) systems that cause reduced biological side-effects. Intellectual Merit: Our research will generate the required fundamental and technological knowledge for deriving the first HEMIB SCMR designs with unprecedented power transfer efficiency, bandwidth and alignment-insensitive characteristics for homogeneous, lossy, dispersive and non-homogeneous media.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: Our research is expected to yield significant societal benefits because of its impact to health and quality of life, as it will be able to support the powering of safe and smart implantable systems that will enable next generation applications; including, implantable or wearable biomonitoring of senior people in assisted living, pacemakers, drug delivery, artificial organs, bionics for people with disabilities and injured military personnel, and novel treatments for cancer and brain disorders.  Our work is expected to advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning through integration of cross-disciplinary themes from our research with education. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
