<AbstractNarration>With this new award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A Program (CSDM-A) of the Division of Chemistry supports Professor Christian B. Hilty of Texas A&amp;M University in a project that will use magnetic resonance techniques to examine the structures of proteins in solution. These investigations will allow a determination of the way solvents such as water affect the shape and functions of the proteins they interact with. Since proteins play crucial roles in life processes and often carry out their functions in water solutions, these studies will impact research in molecular biology and the biomedical sciences.  The investigator will also develop a series of web-based modules, aimed at middle school to high school students, which will highlight the importance of molecular structure in chemistry and biology.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will employ nuclear hyperpolarization based NMR techniques to investigate site specific and time dependent solvent-protein interactions. NMR spectra acquired after mixing the protein with hyperpolarized solvent will reveal polarization transferred to sites on the protein. The distribution of polarization on the protein will be used to derive solvent binding sites, contact areas and protein structure.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project developed methods for measuring protein structure, molecular interactions and structural changes upon folding. Proteins are biological macromolecules, which attain a well-defined, functional three-dimensional structure through a folding process. The project used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy with hyperpolarization, which can strongly enhance NMR signals. Nuclear spins of hydrogen atoms in different molecules, including water and other molecules binding to proteins were hyperpolarized. Upon interaction with a protein, hyperpolarization was transferred between and within molecules. These processes occur within several seconds or less, and on the same time scale allow to infer molecular structure and local dynamic motions. Information on structure and dynamics was obtained by comparing and fitting simulations of nuclear spin polarization transfer to experimentally measured signals. In the case of a ligand that binds to a specific site on the protein, polarization transfer occurs through direct spin-spin interactions, and was used to determine the ligand structure in the binding site. In the case of water molecules interacting with a protein, polarization transfer occurs through direct exchange of hydrogen atoms followed by a distribution of polarization through spin-spin interactions within the protein. The observed signals indicate parts of the protein that are exposed to and interact with water. The figure illustrates this measurement for RNAse SA, which served as a small model protein. Hyperpolarization transfer from water to select amide groups of the protein can be seen, compared to all amide groups of the protein. Changes in signals that occur as proteins are undergoing the folding process are indicative of different dynamic motions and molecular contacts. By providing strong signals, hyperpolarization shortens the time needed for the measurement of these spectra to several seconds. The methods developed can further the basic understanding of folding of proteins on this time scale.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/08/2019<br>      Modified by: Christian&nbsp;B&nbsp;Hilty</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1362691/1362691_10319640_1573260747388_rnase2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1362691/1362691_10319640_1573260747388_rnase2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Transfer of Hyperpolarization from Water to RNAse SA"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1362691/1362691_10319640_1573260747388_rnase2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Transfer of Hyperpolarization from Water to RNAse SA"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Top: NMR spectrum showing the selective transfer of hyperpolarization from water to amide groups of RNAse SA (blue signals), compared to all amide groups (gray).
