<AbstractNarration>An individual person's pronunciation and speech processing are not constant, changing with contextual factors like who they are (or think they are) talking/listening to, what the topic is, and even subtle shifts in dialect expectations based on associative priming. What is not established is whether and how these contextual factors affect different people, and whether they affect speech production and perception processes in the same way.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this study, Ms. Abigail Walker will investigate how identity, linguistic experience and linguistic prestige constrain the effects of topic of conversation and associative priming on linguistic processing. The study focuses on the behavior of American and English expatriates, and fans of English Premier League (EPL) soccer and American football in the U.S. and the U.K., and measures shifts/ adaptations between Standard American English (SAE) and Standard British English (SBE). Walker uses experimental techniques (a naming task and sentence intelligibility in noise) combined with rich interview data to see how different associative primes of SAE and SBE affect people with different identity relations to the primes, and different levels of exposure to the primed dialects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results will critically lead to tighter predictions on when we expect to see intraspeaker shifting, and could prompt the serious incorporation of identity into cognitive models of speech processing. Critically, by comparing production and perception shifts within speakers, Ms. Walker can compare whether identity affects production and perception in similar ways (i.e., do positive identity relations to a prime result in both production shifts and perceptual adaptations to that dialect?), which has implications for the production-perception interface. Funding this proposal will enhance the training of a promising graduate student.</AbstractNarration>

What is not established is whether and how these contextual factors affect different people (for example, do bidialectal speakers shift more than monodialectal speakers?), and whether they affect speech production and listening in the same way (if a prime causes a shift in a person's pronunciation, will it also cause a shift in how they listen?).

Data from 97 English and American nationals was collected in Columbus, OH, and London, U.K., critically allowing Walker to compare experimental behavior across participants who had varied amounts of transatlantic dialectal exposure, and varied personal-identity relationships with the two countries.   In the production data, Walker ?nds evidence of second dialect acquisition: independent of topic, participants with more exposure to the second dialect sound more like native speakers of that dialect than speakers without that experience (i.e., an American who lives in London sounds more English than an American in Columbus). This is the case for all three of the pronunciation variables Walker investigated (rhoticity ("cart"), intervocalic /t/ ("water") and BATH-class ("dance")) in American participants, including non-migrants (Americans in Columbus) with substantial second dialect contact. English participants, however, only show effects of acquisition for intervocalic /t/. Based on the qualitative comments of participants collected in post-experimental interviews, this asymmetry appears to be at least in part due to the relative prestige of British and American English, which motivates one group of speakers to maintain, and one group of speakers to lose, their native dialects.  Walker ?nds a robust effect of topic on rhoticity for all speaker groups, and weaker effects of topic on intervocalic /t/ and BATH. Short and long term shifts between dialects do not show signs of being related.

Walker ?nds no direct relationships between performance in the reading task and performance in the listening task, though indirectly, she argues that it is again Americans moving more towards British English than vice versa, this time perceptually.  In sum, this dissertation shows that second dialect contact, even non-migrant contact, involves changes to production and perception, and that it is not symmetrical in cases where there are clear differences in dialect prestige. The fact that there is no relationship between contextually-based shifts in the moment (shifts due to the ambient topic) and long term shift...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
