<AbstractNarration>The hydrological cycle has a central role in Arctic climate change, and is coupled to alterations of terrestrial, aquatic and cryosphere processes, including shifts in biogeochemical cycles. Monitoring these changes is a central part of the NSF Arctic Observing Network (AON), a consortium of projects with site-specific responsibilities and measurement packages. The next frontier for AON is facilitation of approaches that better quantify landscape and regional ecohydrological process by employing new analytical technologies (laser spectroscopy based water isotope analyzers) and integration of platforms, such as aircraft and satellites. This transformation of AON will initiate studies that quantify and integrate the heterogeneous landscapes of the Arctic tundra, while developing parallel capabilities to the NEON (National Ecological Observatory Network) program, thereby extending the relevance of AON to the continental-scale. We propose an EAGER project that applies a novel interdisciplinary approach by combining isotope geochemistry with boundary layer processes and measurements to monitor and measure the ecohydrology of tundra ecosystems and landscapes. This is a high-risk approach because it is a novel use of this particular instrument and it will change how Arctic ecohydrology is monitored and assessed. EAGER is the correct venue for our project because this novel application of water isotope spectroscopy in an aircraft is ?high risk, high reward? research and represents a radically different approach from laboratory-based studies that are the status quo. The intellectual merit of this project will be accomplished by addressing these primary questions: a) What are the spatial and temporal patterns in water vapor isotopes during the growing and shoulder seasons across the tundra ecosystems in the Arctic Foothills and Foothill-Coastal Plain boundary in Northern Alaska? To a more limited extent, we also ask: b) What is the ET isotope signature associated with different ecosystem types and disturbances (fire and thermokarst) relative to background moisture? c) What is the strength of the ecosystem ET signal in the overlying atmosphere (above the ecosystem boundary height)? The first question focuses on flight measurements, the second on ecosystem tower easurements, and the third on integrating the two measurement scales. The broader impacts and outreach of our project will be accomplished by initially sharing our findings with the scientific community at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union and with students as part of our teaching and seminars at the University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA) and the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF). We will also collaborate with AON colleagues on data sharing and data posting after post-processing our flight data and information. Our primary aim with this AON EAGER is to take the transformation step in our capacity to quantify hydrological processes at the landscape and region scale by: a) collaborating with Picarro Inc. (http://www.picarro.com/) in modifying the L2120-i for aircraft and thus landscape scale purposes and b) conducting a series of field/aircraft campaigns on the North Slope of Alaska. Our program would transform the measuring and monitoring of the terrestrial hydrological cycle beyond the point-based measurements of the past and that are currently in place with AON support (ie. Oberbauer and Welker at Toolik, Bret-Hart and Shaver at Imnaviat Creek). Our EAGER project would also provide a critical linkage between AON and NEON as the Alaska network of sites are planned to come on-line in 2013. Landscape-scale monitoring is critical for stitching together the intricacies of the changing ecohydrolgy in the north. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical abstract: &lt;br/&gt;The water cycle has a central role in Arctic climate change, and is coupled to alterations of land, rivers and lakes as well as permafrost processes, including shifts in the cycles of nutrients.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes   The water cycle of the Arctic is central to the health of planet earth as it controls the delivery of freshwater to northern and temperate communities in rural and urban settings.  Today, we are seeing important changes in the Arctic water cycle that are raising our awareness including:  more freshwater delivery from Arctic landscapes to the Arctic Ocean, a reduction in sea ice and more open water, shifts in storm track patterns that deliver warmer air from the tropics to Alaska and cold, snow-laden Arctic air to the Eastern US.  How and why these changes are occurring is central to this research project which is focused on: a) understanding the modern Arctic water cycle using isotope tracer techniques at the individual site scale and over larger areas using aircraft and b) use this understanding and monitoring of the water isotope cycle to investigate past Arctic climates as a way to forecast the future Arctic water cycle.  We measured the water vapor isotopes (chemistry of the water molecule) using a new device (laser-based) that continuously pumps air from a fixed station into a instrument that measures the ratio of heavy to light oxygen and hydrogen once a second and then displays and records this information.   This high frequency sampling was exceeding useful and showed us how rapidly changes can occur in the source of water and the effects of an Arctic cyclone.  What we discovered was that the chemistry of the water vapor at our site, 130 miles south of the Arctic Ocean at Toolik Lake, AK, is very sensitive to major changes in Arctic Ocean sea ice.  When the cyclone fractured the intact sea ice, there was a very quick change in the water vapor isotopes that we measured at our site, as the storm front passed over our station.  This rapid change in sea ice and the corresponding changes in the water vapor isotopes are not however without prescient in the Arctic.   We took this new understanding of how sea ice changes (ice covered to more open water) effect the chemistry of water vapor and thus precipitation, and examined whether there are records of rapid changes in the Greenland Ice Sheet cores over the past 100,000 years reflected in the water isotopes of the ice layers.  We discovered similar events in the ArcticÆs water cycle history, that reflect warmer periods of more open water as the source of moisture for Greenland (i.e. Atlantic Ocean) as opposed to period when Greenland Ice sheet moisture sources were from higher ice covered conditions.  Collectively, these discoveries and measurement techniques provide real-time information as to the patterns and processes governing the modern Arctic water cycle and insight as to the mechanism that have governed the Arctic water cycle over 10,000 of years.  Our program has shared the findings with the media, with colleagues at national meetings, with society in the form of publications and in the classroom in university lectures.  The project provided a job and training for a postdoctoral scientist whom has grain immerse technical and intellectual training.
