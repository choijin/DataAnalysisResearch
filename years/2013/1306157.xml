<AbstractNarration>Title:   RUI: Application of Plasmonic-Metal Nanoparticles to Increase the Efficiency and Photostability of Luminescent Solar Concentrators&lt;br/&gt;Principal Investigator: Wittmershaus, Bruce P. , Pennsylvania State Univ. University Park&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research Objectives and Approaches:  The objective of this research is to design and fabricate highly efficient and photostable luminescent solar concentrators with usable lifetimes of at least 10 years.  The approach is to use metal nanoparticles to cause metal-enhanced fluorescence from organic dyes thereby increasing fluorescence yield and photostability.  Different shapes and sizes of nanoparticles will be tested in single and multiple-dye luminescent concentrators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  Photodegradation is a major and often overlooked problem of luminescent concentrators preventing their commercialization.  Metal-enhanced fluorescence is a unique solution greatly improving photostability by increasing a dye?s radiative rate.  It also increases fluorescence yield.  Infra-red dyes with poor yield can be made into viable materials for concentrators.  This improves concentrator efficiency by extending the range of converted sunlight beyond the visible.  Improving both the photostability and yield of fluorescent materials will benefit other important applications such as dye-sensitized solar cells, biological fluorescent labels, and light-emitting diodes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The potential development of affordable solar energy conversion will benefit our society through less reliance on fossil fuels.  Necessary training is provided to undergraduates on performing and presenting interdisciplinary research in the critical target areas of nanotechnology and solar energy.  Outreach programs for middle and high school students inform the public about our work and get students excited about solar and nanotechnology research.  Our research presentations to student organizations and participation in college mentoring programs encourage underrepresented students to consider study in STEM fields by showing that it is accessible to them as undergraduates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Luminescence solar concentrators (LSCs) are plates made of highly fluorescent materials.  They absorb sunlight, change it into fluorescent light, and then concentrate that fluorescence to the edges of the plate, like a flat fiber optic channels light through total internal reflection.  At the plate?s edges, small strips of photovoltaic cells absorb the fluorescence changing the energy into electricity. The commercial viability of these devices rests on their potential of being lower in cost compared with covering the same area with traditional semiconductor photovoltaic cells.   Unfortunately, LSCs have been hindered by their low efficiency and short usable lifetime.  The intellectual merit of our research focuses on exploring the use metal nanoparticles to improve LSCs and showing how large white plates under an LSC increases its power output.         For the first time, highly fluorescent silver nanoclusters (particles made of approximately twelve atoms of silver) were incorporated into polymer films for use as an LSC material.  The nanoclusters were synthesized using DNA as a template.  On average, the nanoclusters we examined were about as fluorescent and photostable as the traditional organic dyes used to make LSCs. While continuing to look for new ways to make the nanoclusters even more fluorescent and stable, our current research does not indicate that nanoclusters offer any significant advantage over organic dyes except that they are easy to make and it is easy to adjust their optical properties.       In different experiments, large silver nanoparticles (40-70 nm in diameter) were synthesized and placed near fluorescent organic dye molecules to attempt to increase the dye?s fluorescence and photostability, thereby improving LSCs.  This improvement can occur through an interaction called metal enhanced fluorescence.  Mixing spherical nanoparticles with dye in solution only improved the dye?s fluorescence slightly, contrary to earlier studies.  It was discovered that only a small amount of dye very close to the nanoparticles is affected.  We switched to actively trying to anchor dye molecules close to the silver nanoparticles and use nanoprisms instead of spheres to make the metal enhanced fluorescence effect stronger.       When sunlight first passes through an LSC plate, some of it does not get absorbed.  Placing a white scattering material under an LSC will reflect this missed light back into the LSC for a second chance of absorption.  Past studies have only used white backgrounds that are the same size as the LSC and placed directly underneath it.  In a new direction, we proved that using white backgrounds larger than the LSC, and spaced further below it, can significantly increase the absorption of sunlight by the LSC making them perform better.       Our research is highly interdisciplinary, encompassing solar energy conversion measurements, device automation, scanning electron microscopy sample preparation and imaging, and the synthesis and optical characterization of a variety of metal nanoparticles.  Fourteen undergraduates, including five women, majoring in physics, chemistry, engineering, and math, were trained in conducting and presenting their research under this grant.  They were first authors on 8 abstracts presented at national conferences and 12 abstracts presented at local conferences.  Four students completed their undergraduate honors thesis projects working in our lab.  Students wrote and were awarded over $14,000 in undergraduate grants and fellowships from Penn State during the granting period to support their research and enrich their training.        Improving the cost and efficiency of converting sunlight into electricity is critical to supplying the world?s need for energy now and into the future.  LSCs are one type of device worth exploring due to their potential for being a very inexpensive way to harness solar energy.  Our research primarily investigated applying nanotechnology in trying to solve some of the problems with LSCs and bring them into the arena of commercially viable solar energy devices.
