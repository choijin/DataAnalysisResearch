<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the University of North Carolina Charlotte, located in Charlotte,&lt;br/&gt;NC, will support the training of 10 students in a 10-week program during the summers of&lt;br/&gt;2015-2017. The REU program is open to all undergraduate students who are citizens,&lt;br/&gt;nationals or permanent residents of the United States. Students trained in the program&lt;br/&gt;will gain skills in lab research, develop their critical thinking and problem-solving skills,&lt;br/&gt;understand the process of science, and be able to communicate their research results to&lt;br/&gt;their peers and the general public. Students will have an opportunity to present their&lt;br/&gt;results at a national conference. The REU program provides an experience to students&lt;br/&gt;that is typically not available to them at their home institutions. Students from schools&lt;br/&gt;with limited opportunities for research and from underrepresented groups are encouraged&lt;br/&gt;to apply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU Site program will focus on research in biology and biotechnology in a&lt;br/&gt;traditional research experience while conveying how basic biotechnology research leads&lt;br/&gt;to business creation and industrial development. Example projects include bioinformatics&lt;br/&gt;and whole genome analyses to understand drought resistance of potato crops, generation&lt;br/&gt;and study of transgenic soybeans for agricultural use, study of microbial populations for&lt;br/&gt;biofuel development or water treatment, use of nanoparticles in bioavailability or&lt;br/&gt;environmental impact studies. During the 10-week program, students will participate in&lt;br/&gt;activities including workshops on Research Ethics, Applying to Graduate School, Career&lt;br/&gt;Opportunities, Biotechnology Innovation and Start-Ups, and a program at NC Research&lt;br/&gt;Campus and David Murdock Research Institute featuring research and employment&lt;br/&gt;opportunities. At the end of the program, students will present their research in a poster&lt;br/&gt;and/or oral presentation at the UNC Charlotte Summer Research Symposium.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division&lt;br/&gt;of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to&lt;br/&gt;determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students are required to be tracked&lt;br/&gt;after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting&lt;br/&gt;system. More information is available by contacting the PI (Dr. Christine Richardson at&lt;br/&gt;C.Richardson@uncc.edu) or co-PI (Dr. Sharon Bullock at sbulloc8@uncc.edu).</AbstractNarration>
