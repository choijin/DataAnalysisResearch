<AbstractNarration>This Research award in the Sustainable Chemistry, Engineering, and Materials program supports work by Professor Linda Doerrer at Boston University to develop new C-X bond forming reactions with the earth-abundant metal copper. The local impact of funding this proposal will increase the number of well-trained young scientists that can pursue education and careers in STEM fields with a particular focus on recruiting and retaining women. A new bilingual outreach program is being designed which can potentially impact many young students outside the Boston area. A wide impact on the chemical community is envisaged as this work uses Cu, an abundant and environmentally sustainable metal, to break C-H bonds, with and without O2, and make a variety of new bonds. The strategy uses copper to replace the expensive and more toxic metals currently used for these chemistries.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Developing new reactions for chemical bond formation requires considering not only the desired product, but all the products formed, the energy balance of the process, as well as the overall environmental cost. Earth-abundant metals are excellent candidates for new bond forming processes. In previous work, a new family of molecules with the sustainable metals Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu was extensively developed. The metals contained ligands that are effectively teflon-coated with fluorinated groups that make them highly resistant to decomposition reactions that non-fluorinated molecules can be prey to. Two unexpected and exciting discoveries made with Cu provide an understanding for common reactions forming C-C, C-O, and C-N bonds that are being pursued. The overall impact of this work is to provide an improved understanding of materials and methods for synthesizing high value carbon-based compounds for use in numerous processes of societal relevance.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant has enabled the continued exploration of oxidation chemistry in a particular system. Oxidation chemistry, the removal of electrons from one molecule or substance by another, is a fundamental chemical process in both biological and non-biological systems.  Maintaining the correct balance of oxidation reactions (with their counterparts, reduction reactions, that add electrons) in living systems is one of the critical parts of homeostasis.  Imbalances can lead to diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer?s.  Oxidation chemistry is also the process by which all human civilization, from the most primitive to the 21stcentury western world gets its energy.  A fire is oxidation chemistry, as is burning petrochemicals, or part of the drawing of energy from a lithium battery.  Therefore fundamental studies of oxidation reactions have the potential to impact every aspect of our lives and the world around us.   The particular molecules under investigation herein are "Teflon-coated", which means that the outermost portion of themselves that they present to the world "looks like" Teflon. Teflon, as is well known from its myriad uses in coating cookware and making tight seals between threaded metal connectors, is very chemically inert. The basic formula of Teflon is C2F4, therefore no hydrogen atoms are present, and that is a large part of its inertness.  The oxidation of hydrogen in molecules with carbon and hydrogen is a source of energy. But to use such a reaction in a useful way requires that it be controlled by a special type of molecule, namely a catalyst.  This grant has investigated the development of molecules as catalysts for the oxidation of carbon-hydrogen bonds, beginning with candidate catalysts that themselves have no carbon-hydrogen bonds.  Many current oxidation catalysts are limited in their lifetime and effectiveness because they can themselves be oxidized and are thereby destroyed or handicapped beyond their ability to function.   We studied molecules having three basic parts: copper (Cu), Teflon coated ligands called alkoxides, and potassium (K).  Several different molecules were prepared by using (1) different alkoxides and (2) different ratios of alkoxdies.  These so-called Cu-alkoxides were allowed to react with oxygen (O2) in different amounts to generate reactive intermediates that had the potential to do oxidation chemistry.  These reactive intermediates were subsequently exposed to molecules for oxidation and the proucts of those oxidation reaction analyzed in detail. Data collected included the speed of the reaction, the composition of the intermediates, as well as the amount and nature of the oxidized products.  As a result, we now understand how to combine the four components, including O2, in the correct sequence and ratios to effect two different types of oxidation reactions.   More broadly, this grant has had a significant impact on the students who have worked on the project. Early on, we were fortunate to receive a supplement enabling the international collaboration with the Herres-Pawlis group in Aachen, Germany.  Two graduate students each made two trips to Aachen for detailed studies of the rates of these reactions, for approximately six weeks in each trip. The students worked with the Herres-Pawlis group and their work has been published in peer-reviewed journals.  The older student is now a technology specialist at an intellectual property firm in Boston, and the second will defend her thesis toward the end of 2019.  Two undergraduates were also part of the project, both of whom wrote senior theses and graduated from Boston University With Distinction.  One student is now a PhD student at the University of Delaware, and the other is a PhD student at the University of Michigan.  These students may or may not study oxidation reactions in their future careers, but will certainly use their sound scientific training wherever they go.
