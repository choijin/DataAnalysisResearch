<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Frank E. McDonald of Emory University is developing the efficient preparation of structurally complex marine natural products, exemplified by brevenal, a non-toxic inhibitor of airborne toxins naturally produced by red tide events in tropical and subtropical marine regions, including the Gulf of Mexico.  To decrease the large number of steps required to construct such structurally complex compounds, the research plan addresses this challenge by exploiting a new sequential cyclization strategy for the chemical synthesis of polycyclic ethers, with brevenal as the principal target structure.  Broader impacts of this research include a collaborative exercise in which students, including those working on this project, improve their scientific communication skills to better explain to the general public what scientists do, and why what they do is important. Students make short presentations on an ongoing or recently completed research experience, directed to diverse audiences, including an educated adult non-scientist, and an elementary school-age child and receive feedback on presentations by peer students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In order to efficiently prepare fused polycyclic ether natural products, the Emory group is working to harness stereo- and regioselective cascades of ring-forming reactions. The proposed work shifts the paradigm of cascade cyclizations for fused polycyclic ether synthesis from a narrow focus on the difficult endo-mode polyepoxide cyclization, to other cascade cyclization approaches including the exo-mode oxacyclization strategy in this project.  The proposed work includes exercises in improving scientific communication skills, both for students working on this project and for other students taking advanced coursework in chemistry.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many naturally-occurring compounds with potentially beneficial biological activity are quite complex in their molecular structures.  The target compound inspiring the work of this NSF grant is brevenal, a naturally occurring inhibitor of the neurotoxic activity of the red tide toxins (native to the Gulf of Mexico) and with additional potential for the treatment of cystic fibrosis.  Although microorganisms reproducibly generate small quantities of brevenal, the naturally occurring material must be painstakingly separated from many other components, some of which are highly neurotoxic.  Human chemists have struggled through dozens of steps to prepare small quantities of brevenal.    We have taken a two-pronged approach to address this research problem: 1) developing a new strategy for brevenal synthesis, based on previously unexplored cyclization processes for the cyclic ethers composing the core structure of brevenal, and 2) inventing a new reaction for brevenal synthesis, reducing to practice a conceptually simple idea, yet an idea that had not been previously documented.  For the strategy component of the grant, we have demonstrated that the strategy is viable, but for the strategy to be more generally useful, we will need to invent a new reaction in a future grant application.  For the new reaction component of the grant, we have discovered that dual catalysts are required, namely a transition-metal catalyst and an acidic catalyst: the reaction does not occur with transition-metal catalyst unless the acidic co-catalyst is present, and the acidic catalyst gives poor results on its own, but the combination gives excellent results.   We have now described this work in three peer-reviewed publications.  This grant has supported the dissertation work of two recent Emory University Ph.D. degree recipients, both of whom are now working as research associates at other top research institutions.    The broader impacts activity of our proposal have developed verbal scientific communication skills among a group of first-year graduate students taking one of the principal investigator's courses.  Our aim has been for our students to explain their research, or an aspect of their research, to educated adult non-scientists, and to children, avoiding the excessive use of jargon, and encouraging analogies to common experience or observations.  This has further developed into a proposal-writing course for all first-year chemistry graduate students in our program, to remedy the historical problem of our students receiving little if any formal mentoring in generating, developing, and effective defending their independent scientific ideas.
