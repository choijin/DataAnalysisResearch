<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program award is to build a theoretical framework for transitional bridging - bridges that can be rapidly deployed for immediate disaster relief and can be transformed in-situ for higher load capacity to support long-term, sustainable development. Following natural and anthropogenic hazards, rapidly deployable bridges are critical to restoring vital transportation arteries. The long recovery times following the 2010 Chile earthquake and tsunami demonstrate the need for bridging solutions that can provide an immediate response but also serve as permanent infrastructure. To this end, the project will test the hypothesis that novel adjustable connections can increase efficiency of rapidly erectable bridging systems by enabling a diversity of structural forms which can more effectively carry load using less material. The research plan will also test the hypothesis that novel adjustable modules can provide transitional capabilities. The efficiency of the transitional bridging framework which integrates the adjustable connections and modules will be verified numerically and experimentally.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will be translated to industry through collaboration with a leading design firm. Integrated with this research objective, educational goals include (1) training the next generation of researchers and designers in bridge engineering and deployable structures and (2) increasing the participation and retention of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. The Principal Investigator (PI) plans to develop a new, interdisciplinary, co-taught Deployable Structures for Disaster Relief course for undergraduate as well as graduate curricula in the College of Engineering and the College of Arts &amp; Letters. The PI also plans to collaborate with a local high school to implement "BRIDGES (Building Relationships to Inspire and Drive Girls to pursue Engineering and Science): an enrichment environment for young women".</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p><strong>Overview:</strong></p> <p>The long-term research goal of the PI is to mitigate the impact of damage to civil infrastructure in the immediate aftermath of disasters and to support long-term reconstruction of reliable, resilient, and sustainable structures after these events. In pursuit of this goal, the research objective of this CAREER award is to build a theoretical framework for transitional bridging - bridges that can be rapidly deployed for immediate disaster relief and can be transformed for a higher load carrying capacity to support long-term, sustainable development. Research was also expanded to investigate grid shells for schools, warehouses, stadiums, and other large buildings.</p> <p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong></p> <p>This research introduced a new strategy for the rapid fabrication and erection of resilient bridges and grid shells: modular joints. Modular joints are steel nodal connectors for truss-like bridges (Figure 1) and grid shells (Figure 2), where the connector is the module and the members are standard rolled wide flange sections. Flanges and webs are connected independently through bolted splice connections, forming a moment-resisting connection that provides enhanced resiliency as member loss can be tolerated. Variability in depth is achieved through the novel adjustable bolted steel plate connection (Figure 3). The adjustable connection is a slip-critical, splice connection comprised of flange plates that are cold bent by press brake to a set of angles. Adjustability is achieved by further cold bending the plates in the field through bolt tightening, to achieve the desired angles and/or compensate for tolerances. This is a modular approach, as identical joints and connections can be used repeatedly throughout a structure and among many structures. It harnesses the benefits of modularity (cost/time savings through mass-production) and the topologies of truss bridges and grid shells (high efficiency, ease of design, longevity), while overcoming the deficiencies of conventional systems (high fabrication cost, lack of safety).</p> <p>Research on the modular joints included (1) conceptual design of the joints, (2) developing and integrating form-finding methodologies to achieve rational structural forms that are consistent with the modular joints, (3) performing structural optimization for minimum self-weight while meeting structural performance and geometric criteria, and (4) investigating the redundancy of the system under sudden member loss. The behavior of the adjustable connection was experimentally and numerically investigated, including (1) strains induced in the plates due to pre-bending via a press brake, (2) plate and bolt strains due to installation via bolt tightening, and (3) slip and ultimate behavior of the connection under load.</p> <p>The rigorous research into the behavior of the modular joints and the adjustable bolted steel plate connection culminated in a unified, novel approach for the rapid fabrication and erection of resilient steel bridges and grid shells. It represents a paradigm change in design: begin with modular joints that can be easily fabricated and members that are standards sections, and then develop rational structural forms. This is opposite to the state-of-the-practice, which starts with the form and ends with connection design, leading to unique, expensive, and difficult-to-fabricate connections. This research was conducted in collaboration with Ted Zoli, National Bridge Chief Engineer of HNTB, to ensure industry relevance. Products include six peer-reviewed journal publications, three journal papers in review, four issued utility patents, one PhD dissertation, one PhD dissertation in progress, one Master's thesis, one conference paper, and 11 presentations.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></p> <p>This research addresses the societal need of rapidly replacing bridges and buildings damaged by disasters, with applications also for accelerated construction to replace our nation's ageing infrastructure.</p> <p>Integrated with her research goals, the educational goals of the PI are to (1) train the next generation of researchers and designers in bridge engineering and deployable structures and (2) increase the participation and retention of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Toward the first goal, this award has contributed to the research training and development of four graduate students (three women). A total of 44 undergraduate and eight graduate students have taken the PI's Bridge Engineering course, which includes a semester-long research project that is reviewed by practicing engineers. Field trips facilitated industry interaction and understanding of built structures (Figure 4). Toward the second goal, the PI and her students led annual "Bridges over Troubled Waters" workshops at the Expanding Your Horizons Career Conference for Middle School Girls, including lectures and hands-on activities (Figure 5). A total of 152 girls have participated in the PI's workshop. The PI developed and implemented BRIDGES (Building Relationships to Inspire and Drive Girls to pursue Engineering and Science), an outreach program for young women at Riley High School. Each year, this program included 8-9, 40-minute before-school meetings with lectures and hands-on activities, as well as field trips to construction sites (Figure 6). A total of 153 women have participated. Student Leaders, mentored by the PI, developed the curriculum and led the activities, contributing also to their development.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/30/2020<br>      Modified by: Ashley&nbsp;P&nbsp;Thrall</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351272/1351272_10291846_1598554715549_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1351272/1351272_10291846_1598554715549_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1 -
