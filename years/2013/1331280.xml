<AbstractNarration>The proposed work seeks to investigate event-based modeling to deal with high-dimensional and heterogeneous data environments in order to enhance prognostics design with adaptive control of data collection and rapid maintenance decision-making to apply data analytics to the software development process. The event-based approach is explored given its potential to reduce temporal redundancy while preserving the machine dynamics. Event-based approaches have not been fully explored for prognostics applications with continuous signal inputs, such as sensor measurements. The proposed approach represents a paradigm shift in data modeling prognostic system design and holds the potential to help address the fundamental issues of big data in the areas of volume, velocity and variety. Results will be validated using various data collected from a fleet of electric vehicles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outcomes of the proposed work have the potential for significant impact in the manufacturing sector in the area of prognostics and health monitoring. The resulting approach has the potential to create more efficient systems that can more rapidly adapt and respond to critical issues. The work is supported by the Industry Advisory Board as well as individual industry members of the center and has the potential to extend the centers portfolio through expansion into the area of event-driven modeling, big data reduction and mining for improved industrial efficiency. The center will involve graduate students and undergraduates in the work. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focuses on the investigation of event-based modeling to deal with high dimensional and heterogeneous data environments thereby enhancing prognostics design with adaptive control of data collection and rapid maintenance decision-making. Event-based modeling considers a sequence of events wherein no change in the system is assumed to have occurred between consecutive events. The primary advantage of using event-based approach is it reduces temporal redundancy while preserving the machineÃ†s dynamics. The use of event-based features for PHM design will be a departure from the traditional use of uniformly sampled features. The purpose of this research is to investigate event-based modeling to deal with high dimensional data environments thereby enhancing prognostics design with adaptive control of data collection and rapid maintenance decision-making.  Multiple methods and techniques have been developed to support Rapid Decision-making for Integrated Operations and Maintenance, which can be further divided into two main studies:  (1) Multi-level Scheme Design for Maintenance Decision-making (from component/machine level to factory/system level) (2) Rapid Maintenance Decisions for resilient systems  The results of the machine-level predictive analytics help to advance the prediction accuracy of remaining useful life and degradation trend of a component/machine under variable operating condition. The hybrid technique for PHM use the physics-based model and multidimensional monitoring data in a collaborative way, so that both information can be leveraged to provide higher prediction and estimation capability.  The results of the system-level maintenance and operation decision integration technology show that by properly building in redundancy and flexibility can mitigate the faults-induced disruptions in manufacturing systems. More specifically, various analytical modeling methods such as transient analysis and markov chain models have developed to achieve the goals of resilience.  The developed methodologies for Event-based Analytics for Enhanced Prognostics Design in a BigData Environment, has incredible potential for impacting a wide range of application domains forwhich such an exceptionally large amount of heterogeneous data exists that it is a hindrance to identifying, understanding and responding to detrimental events in critical assets in a timely manner.This methodology's focus on only relevant data for the most critical and issue prone assets canlead to a reduction in the amount of data that needs to be acquired, stored, processed, analyzed andinterpreted as well as the level of instrumentation and complexity of monitoring solutions--in terms ofboth sensors as well as processing and storage assets--thus creating more agile, efficient systemsthat can more rapidly adapt and respond to critical issues.
