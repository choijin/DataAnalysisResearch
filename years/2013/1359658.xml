<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This report represents projects that are funded by United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and awarded through the National Science Foundation (NSF) Cooperative Agreement to the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR) for the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). NCAR provided scientific and technical assistance to the USDA in support of new climate initiatives originating from the USDA's Office of the Chief Economist's Climate Change Program Office.  NCAR and USDA worked together on the analysis of climate change and climate change effects on agriculture through the creation and release of climate change documents and information products, publication of documents, arranging briefings on climate change science, including providing expert speakers for such briefings.  The USDA and NCAR cohosted several workshops on improving access to climate projections and forecasts by USDA regional climate hubs. The workshops provided initial assessments of the existing scale and scope of regional climate projections and forecasts available to support the mission of the USDA Regional Hubs for Risk Adaptation and Mitigation to Climate Change, and its relevant coordination with other federal agencies and the research community.  NCAR researchers also conducted diversity workshops to broaden participation in agricultural related research and decision-making.  These workshops provided an opportunity for the participants to embrace an interdisciplinary approach to scientific and societal challenges by offering a variety of daily sessions on topics of weather and climate-related impacts, vulnerability, and decision-making across spatial scales with an emphasis on the impacts of climate change on global food security and the U.S. food systems. With the help of geospatial technologies (i.e., GIS and remote sensing), the participants learned how to integrate spatial information about weather, climate change, agriculture, and society in a meaningful and innovative way.  This grant also supported the output of two written documents for the USDA Office of Chief Economist Climate Change Program Office.  NCAR provided both expertise in climate science and logistical support for the production of the two USDA reports.  The first publication was an update of the USDA Strategic Science Plan for Climate Change and the second was for writing the USDA Agricultural Climate Indicators report as a part of the next U.S. National Climate Assessment.  These reports have been dissimenated to the broader community through publication on the USDA website. The reports provide knowledge and tools to inform and enable agricultural producers to make decisions based on climate change indicators relevant to their product and region.
