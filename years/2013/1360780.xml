<AbstractNarration>Firms that buy and sell products across international borders often must make important decisions without full information about future government policies.  For example, an exporting firm may have to decide whether or not to invest in a new production technology even though the firm is uncertain about future trade policies that will affect its customers.  This award funds a research project that seeks to measure the effects of uncertainty about trade policy on firms' investment and export decisions.  The data will allow the team to measure the effects of such uncertainty during two recent events:  the Great Recession and the recent global integration of the Chinese economy with the rest of the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project builds a basic framework for modeling and estimating the impact of trade policy uncertainty on investment and export decisions.  The framework incorporates several key factors:  (i) general equilibrium effects of policy reform; (ii) a set of investments that is broad enough to incorporate innovation and input choice; (iii) the interaction with pure economic uncertainty and (iv) endogenous trade policy uncertainty. The model is estimated with firm microdata.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our research highlights the potential impacts of changes in trade policy uncertainty on economic outcomes. Among these we have provided evidence of how reductions in uncertainty following agreements are responsible for a substantial part of their impact on trade and export investment and can affect consumers, and conversely how increases in uncertainty about future policy can reduce trade.  Specifically, we developed theoretical and empirical approaches to measure, estimate and quantify the uncertainty impacts on trade and welfare outcomes of  -        Entry into preferential trade agreements (Handley and Limao, American Economic Journal 2015) and exit from agreements, e.g. Brexit (Graziano, Handley and Limao, NBER working paper, 2018).  -        Entry into the World Trade Organization by China and its impacts on U.S. imports and consumer prices (Handley and Limao, American Economic Review 2017)  -        Preferential agreements in providing insurance during economic crisis (Carballo, Handley and Limao, NBER working paper, 2018)     The results have been published in academic journals, disseminated widely through academic conferences and seminars and have become well known and cited.     We have also disseminated the research to a broader audience in several ways.  -        Writing on Economic Blogs: Implications of the value of trade agreements under uncertainty  -       Direct contacts with the press and through university media offices leading to the coverage listed here    -       Contributing to e-books: In ?Trade under T.R.U.M.P. policies? we explain the trade and economic implications of uncertainty over trade policies as the 45th president took office to a non-specialist audience.     We hope this research and dissemination effort will be useful in informing public views on the role of policy uncertainty not only on past events but future ones. The U.S. has threatened to renegotiate or abandon long standing agreements including the NAFTA and World Trade Organization; the United Kingdom plans to Brexit the European Union; thus firms are facing increasing uncertainty that our research has shown lowers their export investment and increases costs for consumers.
