<AbstractNarration>The proposed work aims to expand upon previous studies at Axial volcano, particularly a 2002 research cruise there, and seeks to: 1) process the remaining Axial multichannel seismic (MCS) profiles from that cruise; 2) process two "repeat" profiles from the 2002 cruise to identify any differences in overall structure after the 2011 eruption and better image the internal and basal magma chamber reflections using an additional 2 km of offset in the new data; 3) reprocess select along- and cross-axis profiles from the Endeavor and Cleft segments of the Juan de Fuca ridge to examine differences in crustal accretion using new methods; and 4) extend these methods to aging crust in poorly and heavily sedimented environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The proposed work will provide more detailed images of sub-seafloor structure along the Juan de Fuca Ridge, particularly across Axial volcano. The results will lead to better understanding of the crustal processes at the mid-ocean ridge locations.The results of the project will be used to create a "ridge to subduction" virtual tour of plate tectonics through Cascadia for the National Seismological Laboratory at the University of Nevada, Reno which is visited annually by many K-8 students. A postdoctoral researcher will be supported.</AbstractNarration>

Of course, these high performance supercomputing-based techniques applied to sedimentary basins would have to be tweaked a bit (or a lot) to work in a hard rock, volcanic and deep water environment.  To not disappoint, however, a processing flow that included redatuming of multichannel seismic data to the seafloor, full waveform inversion and reverse time migration, again common in the energy sector, provided stunning images of Axial volcano, including imaging both the top and bottom of the magma chamber (some 1.5 - 2.5 kilometers beneath the seafloor), fluid pathways connecting hydrothermal vents to the underlying magma chamber, and extremely well located seismicity from the earthquake swarm associated with the 2015 eruption.  Magma bodies associated with both the Juan de Fuca spreading center and Cobb hotspot were both easily imaged providing insight into the interaction of a hotspot and mid-ocean ridge spreading center.  Due to this interaction, the size of the magma chamber is some 20-60 cubic kilometers or an order of magnitude or more larger than magma chambers associated with just conventional mid-ocean ridge spreading centers.  Surprisingly, the size of the 2015 eruption is only a very small fraction of the overall magma available to erupt.  Results from this research is not only being used by a myriad of researchers studying various processes beneath Axial volcano (e.g., petrology, eruption dynamics, hydrothermal venting, vent biology), but is also being used for K-12 outreach at the Nevada Seismological Laboratory to highlight how volcanoes work and their importance in the development of the Basin and Range in the western US.
