<AbstractNarration>This project is being supported under a special funding focus for STEP, "Graduate 10K+," an activity of the National Science Foundation, supported in part by donations from the Intel Foundation and the GE Foundation, to stimulate comprehensive action at universities and colleges to help increase the annual number of new B.S. graduates in engineering and computer science by 10,000 over the next decade. In particular, this project team is focusing on first-time, first-year college students who are not calculus ready, and first-time sophomore students who are missing up to two courses necessary to be classified as part of their class-level cohort. Students with these characteristics are "at risk" of leaving their engineering and computer science courses of study, even though they may be in good academic standing. The intellectual merit of the project lies in its coordinated adaptation of a set of best practices: 1) dedicated counseling throughout the academic year regarding attaining and keeping cohort status, 2) an academic Summer Bridge program for non-calculus ready first-year students, and 3) ongoing retention tracking for various sub-populations within the institution. A dedicated STEP counselor is coordinating weekly individual and group program meetings designed to guide students throughout the academic year, to advise on key summer course selections, if needed to regain cohort status, and to use available tutoring and workshop services to avoid withdrawals. The project's broader impacts are being realized through the framing of the project as a research study to investigate the connection between maintaining class-level cohort status and retention, and leveraging professional opportunities at national and regional conferences to draw attention to the broader set of efforts at boosting retention in STEM and build a community of practitioners.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Data suggested that students across all majors at University of Portland who are behind in their degree progress are not retained at similar rates as their on-track cohort and can be considered at-risk. During this project, we developed a comprehensive retention program to support first-year engineering students who start behind their cohort in terms of the calculus sequence.Our original project goal also included developing programs to support at-risk sophomore engineering students in similar ways. We included some strategies for sophomore students however we found that we only had the resources to focus our research efforts on the first-year students.</p> <p>The retention program included multiple interventions targeted at increasing the persistence and ultimately the graduation of first-year at-risk students such as intentional counseling focused on community building and academic support along with various opportunities for students to regain cohort status academically. We conducted quantitative assessments that include comparisons of retention rates and graduation rates for the Precalculus cohort versus the overall engineering student population, along with comparisons of similar indicators for participants versus non-participants in the Program, and the impact of the academic summer bridge. We also used logit regression models to evaluate the impact on retention and graduation rates of both catching up by Fall sophomore year and completing the summer bridge as compared with demographic and incoming academic characteristics. An independent evaluator conducted qualitative assessments. Although the retention program evolved formatively throughout the project, we retained enough elements to a) develop what we believe will be a sustainable retention program at the University, b) draw several generalizable conclusions, and c) identify areas for more study.</p> <p>In terms of demographics, 33% to 55% of the Precalculus cohorts (2013-2017) identify as non-White and/or Hispanic, 17% to 38% are first generation college students, and 17% to 25% are female. For the Precalculus cohort students who participated in the Retention Program, between 25% to 68% identify as Non-White and/or Hispanic, 9% to 38% are first generation college students, and 19% to 27% are female. Relative to the national situation, the University has a fairly diverse engineering student population and the Precalculus cohort is similar. We did not collect formal data about socioeconomic status of students, however, summer scholarship funds were available to students with need-based financial aid and over 90% of students qualified for those funds.</p> <p>Moving forward, the retention program for those students who have to begin the engineering curriculum in Precalculus due to lack of readiness for Calculus 1 and/or who fall behind their cohort in terms of STEM courses during the first year includes the following components --- a required Fall semester first-year one-credit course for students who start behind cohort, a required Spring semester first-year one-credit course for students who fall behind cohort, a summer academic year bridge where first-year students can complete Calculus 2 (and catch up to cohort) at no cost at the University while participating in several professional development activities, the availability of partial summer scholarships so that first-year and sophomore students who fall behind cohort can catch up in required STEM courses during the summer after the first or second years, tutoring in key sophomore engineering foundational courses.</p> <p>Although we ran our study across the entire project, the data to date is limited since the interventions occur early in the academic pathway while the effect is not fully realized until four or five years later. That said, we can draw some preliminary conclusions that we suggest are generalizable to contexts beyond the University. Overall, the data supports our initial hypothesis that catching up academically with cohort is an important part of helping students to persist in an engineering major that goes beyond any impact of demographics or incoming academic metrics. Although more cohorts need to be studied, a logit regression model showed the impact of catching up to be pronounced for 1<sup>st</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> semester retention rate and graduation rate. And, the influence of catching up was more of a predictor than various demographics and incoming academic measures. This result may also suggest that categorizing a particular cohort as at-risk and/or in need of special intervention may be better achieved using objective measures of readiness for key foundational courses.</p> <p>As stated, more longitudinal data is needed to improve the robustness of our preliminary results. We suggest that another area for further study is the role of professional integration on persistence in engineering. The feedback from our study suggested that for engineering students, the professional integration component may have equal weight with the social integration component.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/28/2019<br>      Modified by: Sharon&nbsp;A&nbsp;Jones</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1317238/1317238_10244116_1559080101083_5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1317238/1317238_10244116_1559080101083_5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Catching Up with Cohort Model"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1317238/1317238_10244116_1559080101083_5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Catching Up with Cohort Model"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Logit Regression Analysis</div> <div class="imageCredit">S.A.
