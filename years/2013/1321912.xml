<AbstractNarration>The primary goal of this project is to determine how different faults in regional fault networks interact with one another to accommodate the relative motion of tectonic plates over time scales ranging from one to a few dozen earthquakes. The research team will focus on a particularly promising study area in northern South Island, New Zealand, where relative motions between the Pacific and Australian plates are partitioned amongst a set of four, parallel strike-slip faults known as the Marlborough fault system. Historical and paleo-earthquake data from the Marlborough fault system, which provides a useful analog for similar fault system elsewhere in the world (e.g., northern and southern California, Northwest Turkey, Hispaniola, parts of central and Southeast Asia, Iran-Pakistan), reveal tantalizing hints of complex earthquake occurrence, with possible temporal and spatial clustering of earthquakes that varies from cycle to cycle. But currently there are too few fault slip rate and paleo-earthquake age and displacement data to fully assess the collective spatial-temporal behavior of the Marlborough fault system. In order to document in detail how the four Marlborough faults share the tectonic plate motions, the research team will determine the rates of slip along each of these faults at a variety of time scales, ranging from a few to a few dozen earthquakes, as well as the ages and displacements of past earthquakes. Key to this effort will be the acquisition of about 300 square kilometers of high-resolution lidar digital topographic data from the four main Marlborough fault system faults. These data allow the efficiently mapping and measurement in unprecedented detail of fault offsets ranging from about 100 meters down to the smallest offsets that occurred in the most recent earthquakes. The Marlborough fault system is a particularly target-rich environment in this regard because many of the large fault-crossing rivers in the Marlborough region exhibit suites of river terrace edges that have been offset by variable amounts. Combining these offset features with age data from different geochronometers (radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence) will yield exceptionally detailed fault slip rates at a range of time scales from individual ruptures back though several dozen earthquakes. The researchers will also excavate trenches across the four faults to determine paleo-earthquake ages and displacements, allowing cross-correlation with the youngest slip rates. The resulting data, together with existing data and the results of ongoing studies by other groups, will allow documentation of the behavior of the Marlborough faults over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, providing the information necessary for systematic comparison with the earthquake behavior of similar systems elsewhere in the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary aim of this project is to advance understanding of the way regional networks of large faults store and release seismic energy, with a particular focus on determining the relative importance of so-called emergent phenomena such as clusters of large-magnitude earthquakes and periods of transiently elevated storage of seismic energy that may not be expected in the current understanding of earthquake physics and that are not accounted for in current seismic assessment strategies. The results will help the seismic hazard community to understand how regional fault networks distribute deformation in time and space - the keys to developing more accurate, next-generation seismic hazard assessment strategies, as well as the basis for future modeling efforts aimed at understanding the causes of such phenomena. This international effort will expand already strong scientific collaboration between the US researchers and their New Zealand collaborators, benefitting both groups by fostering increased interaction between the groups, both of which face similar seismic hazards in their respective countries. Specifically, in addition to working closely with seismic hazard planners at the US Geological Survey to ensure timely implementation of their results, the PIs are actively collaborating with colleagues at GNS Science, which is responsible for implementation of seismic hazard assessment in New Zealand, ensuring that the results of this project will be also incorporated into New Zealand's next-phase seismic hazard assessments.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project represents one part of a collaboration focused at understanding the behaviour through time of the Marlborough Fault Zone (MFZ) in South Island, New Zealand. This is a relatively complex region forming the transition between a single dominant transform fault (the Alpine Fault, similar in some ways to the San Andreas fault in the USA) to the south, and a subduction zone, the Hikurangi subduction, to the north and east. Each of these components, the Alpine Fault, the MFZ and the Hikurangi subduction represents a significant seismic hazard to the nearby population, with additional associated hazards such as tsunami risk and landslide triggering. Two of New Zealand&rsquo;s major cities, Christchurch and Wellington, the capital, lie close to the MFZ, and this arrangement of almost parallel strike-slip faults shares similarities to groups of faults at either end of the San Andreas fault in California, both in the Bay Area, and in Southern California between LA and San Diego. Understanding how such systems of interconnected faults behave has significant implications for seismic hazard assessment and infrastructure planning, in New Zealand, in the US, and elsewhere in the world.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The response of the New Zealand landscape to climate warming as the world came out of the last ice-age provides us with an opportunity to test the behaviour of this fault system through the last 15,000 years. During the coldest periods of the last glacial cycle, glaciers formed in the mountains of the Marlborough region, and vegetation was restricted in range by severe climatic conditions. Both of these circumstances led to a much greater input of sediment in the form of gravel, sand and silt than today into all the river systems of the region, as material was shed from steep mountainsides, and valleys were eroded more rapidly. Large fan-shaped spreads of gravel built up in the larger valleys. During the last 15,000 years, the sediment supply reduced, as vegetation extended to higher elevations, and glaciers receded and eventually disappeared from the Marlborough region, leading to gradual erosional incision into these gravel fans by the rivers that cross them. Where strike-slip faults of the MFZ cross these fans, each earthquake causes a lateral movement of several meters in the relative positions of all the features of the fan, producing a visible offset in position. Each earthquake leads to the offset movement of the active river channel plus all the older features. As time passes, the river erodes into the fan, leaving a staircase of gravel terraces (image 1), and each of these becomes offset by fault movement during earthquakes. In this way, the oldest features, preserved at the higher elevations of the fan surface, deposited by the river before significant erosional incision had taken place, are now offset by many earthquake events, while the youngest features such as the lowest terrace which was deposited within the last 2,000 years, show only small amounts of offset, as they have experienced fewer earthquakes, possibly only one event (image 2). By dating the different gravel terrace sediments deposited by the river that each record different amounts of offset by earthquakes, we are able to construct a relatively detailed record of fault slip at each of our target sites. Because we have access to these multiple staircases of gravel terraces at several sites, we can construct multiple slip rate estimates for each, and assess how uniform the slip rate was (image 3).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>There are several key outcomes of the project. We have developed a much improved way to date high energy river sediments, including novel sampling, preparation, measurement and analysis approaches, using luminescence dating. We have applied this to five sites located on the four major MFZ faults. These ages demonstrate that there are significant changes in fault slip rate through time, and that the different faults appear to trade off slip between each other. These results have significant implications for seismic hazard assessment (the way that scientists and engineers estimate likely damage by future earthquakes), both for this particular group of faults, but also more generally for other locations around the world. The new approach for dating that we developed within this project is also useful in many different situations, to help understand other aspects of natural environmental change. Within the research team at UCLA, four graduate students benefitted from the training and support provided by this award, as did eight undergraduates and one technical officer.
