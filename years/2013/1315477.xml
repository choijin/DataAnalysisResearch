<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project creates a commercial linear media handling system (LMHS) that automates the manufacturing of magnets made from new superconductor (SC) materials. SCs offer the promise of tremendous energy savings and innovative devices due to increased energy density compared to existing limitations of conventional conductors. To date the expense of manufacturing and operating SCs have limited them to use in little more than MRIs and particle accelerators. Conventional SCs require extreme environments for operation and remain prohibitively expensive to deploy. Recent advances in SC materials science, cryogenic refrigeration, and controls systems have created the possibility for modern SCs  that allow higher magnetic fields at higher temperatures, to deploy in mainstream applications such as MRIs and wind turbine generators. The one remaining challenge is physically shaping these fragile new materials into wound magnets that can replace conventional magnets, for example in motors and generators that power our world. By combining unique controls and mechanical designs not in the market today, this machine improves industrial fabrication methods for magnets that exploit benefits found in fragile materials. The result is a production capability that offers economically attractive output rates while simultaneously delivering technical reliability for dependable devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that LMHS provides the remaining piece of technology that will initiate an industrial revolution. Given the achievement of a production line for reliable SC windings, devices will be shaped by existing manufacturers that take advantage of the efficiency and energy density possible with SCs. The reason for the phrase industrial revolution is the breadth of industries affected. The benefits of SCs will rapidly spread to devices that span scientific, military, industrial, and eventually even individual consumer applications. MRIs could even be made portable using new SCs. Winding precision will create magnetic fields with greater precision and increased controlled magnetic flux densities. This will impact research from medical to material science. Military applications range from more efficient and small profile yet high power motors and generators for defense to civilian applications. It cannot be stressed enough that without the achievement of technical reliability in SC windings, none of these applications will occur. Current winding machine manufacturers rely upon human intervention and mechanical means of control. These cannot deliver the accuracy needed for the precise control of handling fragile media. LMHS is the bold innovation required to bring on an industrial revolution.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Project Outcomes Report    Nature    The Linear Media Handling System (LMHS) concept was originated by Infinity Physics with the goal of commercializing superconductor (SC) magnets.  Because of the energy density, power density, and high efficiency capabilities attainable from materials with zero resistance to the flow of electricity, SCs have long been viewed as offering great promise in advancement of technologies in electric power generation and transmission, electric motors, transformers, and other applications such as magnetic levitation trains.  After more than a century since the discovery of superconductivity, mass production of SC magnets has not been achieved.  Successful commercial applications of SC magnets are limited to a few high cost products including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners and particle accelerators.  With maturity of SC material production and cryogenic systems, the cost of and inconsistent output from producing handcrafted products have become the primary elements preventing commercialization across many industries.  Manual winding techniques remain standard for SCs because of the need for guided precision to address high thermal, magnetic, and mechanical stresses in SC device operating environments that exploit any flaws in the wound material.  The fragile nature of SC materials has also driven manual operations.  Modern SC materials that perform at the commercially feasible warmer temperatures of cryogenic fluids including liquid nitrogen are especially fragile.  To date dependence upon careful manual forming operations has limited production rates, lowered reliability, and maintained a high cost.  LMHS offers innovation to address the issues of handcrafted winding of SCs.    Infinity Physics is developing the LMHS machine and process for automatically and precisely producing advanced low temperature superconducting (LTS) and high temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets from fragile SC material windings across many degrees of freedom and without manual intervention.  These LTS and HTS magnets provide a higher power and efficiency output in a smaller package than conventional copper or even classic LTS magnets.  The HTS magnets at higher magnetic fields and higher temperatures can be produced relatively inexpensively and used without the need for low liquid helium temperature cryogenic refrigeration.  The Infinity Physics LMHS machine will enable repeatable, reliable, and automated large volume production of lower cost and higher reliability SC magnets thus making such magnets commonly available for R&amp;D and commercial applications.    Outcomes    LMHS is now being developed through an NSF SBIR grant.  During Phase I from July through December 2013, the foundation of the LMHS tool has been functionally captured.  Analyses and initial hardware prototype testing have revealed the hardware and software elements required to produce a machine embodying technology sufficient for precise motion control in the degrees of freedom needed for automation of a simple wind.  Research has been identified to add degrees of freedom for advanced winds.  Winding results from the Phase I prototype met target goals thereby exceeding currently available winding capabilities for a simple SC coil.  Sharing these results alongside plans to develop automated, reliable winding capabilities with prospective customers generated significant interest.  Their anticipation includes LMHS contributing to decreased cost and increased compactness of MRI and NMR devices, increased output and decreased cost in generation of electricity, extended range of mobile platforms such as all-electric airplanes, and increased capability of science experiments such as the large hadron collider (LHC).  From SC material manufacturers to customers in the private and public sector of various industries, both domestic and international sources are indicating that this project has a needed focus.  In October, a workshop was held at The...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
