<AbstractNarration>TITLE: Integrating acoustics, behavior, and radio telemetry to develop a novel technique of measuring acoustic amplitude in unrestricted, free-living animals&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acoustic communication plays an integral role in mediating the behavioral interactions of many species. Research aimed at connecting variation in acoustic signals to their intended functions and effects on fitness has focused almost exclusively on differences in signal structure while largely ignoring the role of variation in amplitude (loudness). Measuring amplitude is challenging because amplitude varies depending on the distance between the signaler and the microphone and the orientation of the signaler in relation to the microphone. Consequently, current knowledge of the functional significance and fitness implications of amplitude modulation is based solely on non-quantitative observations or measures of absolute amplitude collected from animals restricted to a specific location or arena in the lab or field.  Research supported by this proposal will develop a novel technique for measuring amplitude in free-living animals using microphone-transmitters, a type of radio-transmitter that enables a microphone to remain a relatively fixed distance from a mobile, vocalizing animal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fellow will be trained in the physics of sound production and propagation while developing skills for assaying the directionality of acoustic signals, computer programming, and calculating mathematical correction factors to account for changes in acoustic frequency (pitch) and the posture of the signaler. This research will contribute to the training and mentorship of diverse undergraduates in both laboratory and field techniques in biology and physics.  In addition, the research will foster a new inter-departmental collaboration between UC Davis and UT Austin. All results will be disseminated broadly through public lectures to local Audubon Societies, publications in scholarly journals, and presentations at national and international conferences.</AbstractNarration>

Previous research aimed at connecting variation in acoustic signals to their intended functions and effects on fitness has focused almost exclusively on differences in signal structure, such as frequency (pitch) and timing (rate), while largely ignoring the role of amplitude (loudness). Animals are known to vary their acoustic amplitude both in different types of social interactions and in response to changes in background noise. However, accurately measuring amplitude is challenging due to the fact that amplitude varies depending on the distance between the sound source and the microphone and the orientation of the sound source in relation to the microphone. As a consequence, our current understanding of the importance of changes in amplitude is based solely on casual observations of amplitude differences (e.g., soft v. loud song) or direct measures of amplitude collected from animals that are restricted to a specific location or arena. Thus, a persistent barrier to our ability to measure amplitude in unrestricted, free-living animals has been constraints associated with our recording techniques.</p> <p>In this project, we sought to develop a novel technique for measuring amplitude in free-living animals through the use of microphone-transmitters (mic-transmitter), a type of radio-transmitter that enables a microphone to remain a relatively fixed distance from a mobile, vocalizing animal.

These models were then placed inside a circular array of microphones and a mic-transmitter was fitted to their backs to allow us to simultaneously measure acoustic amplitude with both the traditional microphones in the array and the mic-transmitter. We found that as the frequency of sound increases, the amplitude disparity between the front and back of the bird also increases. Because the mic-transmitter must be attached to the back of the bird, these data are essential for calculating a correction algorithm to translate any amplitude measurements from the mic-transmitter on the back of the bird into an amplitude measurement from in front of the bird.
