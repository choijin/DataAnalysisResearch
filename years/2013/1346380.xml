<AbstractNarration>This STTR Phase I project proposes to develop an interactive computer game to promote interest in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) for high school students. The game will use NSF-funded technologies to teach students how to program and control robots while simultaneously maintaining student interest through the entertainment of playing a real time strategy (RTS) game.  The proposed game will be targeted at high school students with no prior knowledge of robotics programming, however could easily be adapted to include greater levels of difficulty aimed at early level college courses, extra-curricular robotics clubs, and private at home consumer use. It will enhance the STEM learning environment by having robot programs written by the student become an actual piece (sub-algorithm) of the game during play (giving the student greater satisfaction and accomplishment).  This is innovative from the point that current interactive computer games have the player select options and choices but game entities are manually manipulated with a game controller, etc.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact resulting from the proposed activity is that this effort pushes into new territory in the teaching of STEM concepts to students.  The novelty of our approach is in having the students learn how to program robots by (a) providing all of the tools of a program development environment along with (b) the ability to have the programs written by the student to be part of an entertaining game.  This is a leap beyond current educational games that merely expose the student to the desired concepts or have the student interact with the game by selecting options and choices as the process of playing the game.  The leap is that the student is not just selecting something, but she is writing the software that controls a robotic entity of the game; in short, they are programming a piece of the game.  They write a robot program; they see how it works in the game environment; and then they can rewrite and optimize their software to improve their playing of the game. The proposed game has the commercial potential to tap a huge market of organizations interested in STEM education.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project has two main educational goals, which are to teach students the fundamentals of programming through gameplaying, and to increase student interest in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). The main specific goals for phase I of the project were to design and create a working prototype of the proposed game, to design the lesson activities for students, and to perform pilot studies on the prototype. Our main objectives for the game prototype were: (1) to provide a stable, easy to program robotics software platform, and with good graphics support. (2) Reduce the amount of syntax needed to learn how to program the activities described in the proposed lesson plans. Given these two objectives, we chose to use the MORSE robotics simulator (Modular OpenRobots Simulation Engine) to create the prototype game system. MORSE is easy to program, and offers many models of robots and of environments in which robots operate. MORSE offers good graphics due to its use of the Blender 3D graphics software, and allows developers to easily add new robot and environment models. To reduce the amount of syntax novice students would be required learn, we offer a programming library that allows users to manipulate the robots by learning only a few commands. As the students become more proficient we offer more advanced libraries that they can use to manipulate robot sensors and define more sophisticated behaviors for the robots players. This gives a natural progression in the learning process, in which the student using the system learns at their own pace, and are allowed to explore their curiosity and challenge themselves. For the demonstration activities our main goals were to get students, preferably high school students, to interact with the system and give feedback on theirexperience. For the Minnesota State and Math and Science Fairs we offered maze games in which the user played against an autonomous robot in a maze, and whoever reached the exit of the maze first won the game. The users teleoperated their robots using XBox game pads, while the robots used mazesolving algorithms of varying difficulties to reach the exit of the maze. While playing the games users were challenged to guess how the autonomous robots were making their own decisions. This way the users engaged in reasoning on different possible solutions to the problem of navigating an unknown environment with limited sensors. The main idea was to show that if users enhance their problem solving skills and learn how to code, they can program the autonomous robots instead of teleoperating them. At a High School we had a more controlled pilot study. The study was comprised of two parts. In the first part students programmed a simple PIONEER 3DX robot model to move around an empty environment. The main goals were to introduce students to the motion control library the programming framework. In the second part students played our maze game and we asked students to find strategies to beat our autonomous agents. The study ran for nearly one hour, and it involved 31 students and 31 computers with our software. The study was closely monitored by the high school's teachers, who really liked that our software engaged students and allowed them various degrees of creativity. Our pilot studies showed that users are excited about learning how to program through games using our system, and that parents and teachers see value in our game system, because students change from passive technology users to active technology creators. We believe that further enhancements from the feedback we received will lead to even more excitement from students, and also their parents and teachers.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/08/2015<br>      Modified by: John&nbsp;R&nbsp;Budenske</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
