<AbstractNarration>This action funds Donald Warren of North Carolina State University to conduct a research project in the Math and Physical Sciences during the summer of 2013 at RIKEN in Tokyo.  The project title is "Simulating the Early X-Ray Afterglow in Gamma-Ray Bursts." The host scientist is Shigehiro Nagataki.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The early X-ray afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are important for understanding these events and their impact on cosmology. This project models the acceleration of cosmic rays, and emission from that population, using a Monte Carlo code that simulates particle interactions with a modified, ultra-relativistic, collisionless shock. This study focuses on the relation between observed parameters of X-ray afterglows (e.g. the total energy output, and the power law indices of energy flux in both wavelength and time), the characteristics of the shocks that generate the afterglows (e.g. flow speed, acceleration efficiency, or magnetic field strength), and the nature of the GRB progenitors (e.g. stellar type and size, or properties of the central engine powering the GRB). In addition, this project is obtaining spectral information about the population of cosmic rays, which can be compared against observations at Earth to see if GRBs and their afterglows are viable candidates for the source of the highest energy cosmic rays.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The high-energy Universe is still mysterious and exciting, even after decades of observation and theoretical work.  On a daily basis, we observe Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs): intense beams of light powered by the death and collapse of a distant, massive star.  Even more frequently, we observe very high-energy cosmic rays (CRs): protons, electrons, or other subatomic particles that have been accelerated to almost the speed of light, and that have traveled across the galaxy or Universe before crashing into Earth's atmosphere.  There is good theoretical reason to think that GRBs may produce some (or even most) of the very high-energy CRs we observe, but the conditions in a GRB are so extreme that no lab on Earth can test those predictions.  The work performed by this project links GRBs and high-energy CRs by performing numerical simulations of particles and shocks.  The particles and the shock structure influence each other in a highly nonlinear way, making numerical studies like this one a crucial tool for investigating the problem.  Additionally, simulating many different shock speeds was important in the project: the jet of a GRB will slow down as it travels outward from the dead star and sweeps up material, and the speed of the shock affects how it interacts with particles and accelerates them into cosmic rays.  The scope of the project has expanded dramatically since the start of the EAPSI award.  What was originally going to be a single chapter in a dissertation is now the entire dissertation and more.  The PI is seeking postdoctoral fellowships in Japan, to expand on the work done on the NSF award; those fellowships would place him back at the laboratory where he worked during EAPSI.  After the conclusion of the EAPSI award, the PI was invited to participate in multiple conferences.  These invitations were based on the relationships started on the NSF award, and included both oral presentations and membership on the local organizing committee.  In the future, these relationships will continue, as the PI attempts to build them into long-term international collaborations.
