<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Andrey Vilesov of the University of Southern California and his graduate student researchers are conducting experiments to study the behavior of atoms and molecules in the unique environment of liquid helium droplets.  The results from these experiments are of fundamental interest to the physical chemistry and condensed matter physics communities.  Graduate students working on this project will receive training in high vacuum science, cryogenics and laser science.  Prof. Vilesov is active in educational innovation on his campus, and he mentors a diverse group of young scientists. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Vilesov and his research group are continuing work on atomic and molecular properties of species isolated in the unique environment of helium nanodroplets.  Prof. Vilesov and his group will: (1) conduct single droplet ionization experiments; (2) study heat transfer in He droplets; (3) image very large He droplets (using x-ray scattering at SLAC); (4) study the structure, properties and formation of metal clusters confined to He droplets; (5) investigate the formation of so-called foam of Mg in He droplets; (6) study the magnetic properties of species confined to He droplets; and (7) investigate the ability of He nanodroplets to gently deposit unusual species onto surfaces.  The young researchers working in the group of Prof. Vilesov will receive training in experimental physical chemistry.</AbstractNarration>
