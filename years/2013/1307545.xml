<AbstractNarration>The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) is on the brink of making the first direct detections of gravitational waves. With the improved sensitivity of Advanced LIGO, we expect to enter an era of astronomy in which frequent gravitational-wave measurements are used to learn about astrophysical sources.  The inspiral and merger of binary neutron stars is a likely source for many gravitational-wave observations, and waveform models for the inspiral of such systems can be used to detect the signals using matched filtering. However, additional physics near merger is not captured by detection templates. As the stars coalesce, the gravitational waveforms will depend additionally on the properties of matter in the core of the stars. The relevant behavior is encoded in the equation of state of dense matter. Its effects on gravitational waveforms have not yet been fully modeled; while ever-improving analytic models in the inspiral and numerical simulations of the merger each contribute information, a complete picture remains elusive.  This award supports a program of research by the PI and her students at California State University Fullerton (CSUF) to understand the effects of neutron-star matter on inspiral and merger, both by constructing hybrid (analytical-numerical) waveforms with explicit error estimates and by developing phenomenological waveforms which incorporate tidal resonance effects. The results will be incorporated into the public LIGO Algorithm Library for use in realistic search and parameter-estimation studies with the full data analysis infrastructure.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is essential to maximize the astrophysical return on NSF's investment in LIGO. Improved understanding of measurement potential will inform configuration decisions as Advanced LIGO develops. Gravitational-wave measurements of neutron-star matter effects will potentially shine new light on the equation of state of matter above nuclear density, which is currently uncertain and a key research topic in both nuclear physics and astrophysics.  This proposal also supports active involvement by undergraduate and masters students in the Physics program at CSUF, a primarily undergraduate Hispanic-serving institution with strong integration of teaching and research.  Including students in cutting-edge research introduces them to the gravitational-wave science community, kindles future participation in science, and develops broadly applicable skills.  The PI is actively involved in LIGO outreach, and will engage students, the University, and the surrounding community in the excitement of this new field of astronomy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    This project focused on gravitational-wave astrophysics for neutron star mergers. Neutron stars host the densest stable matter in our universe, and provide a unique insight on how matter behaves in conditions unattainable on Earth. When orbiting another neutron star, they emit gravitational waves, ripples in spacetime that drive the two stars towards a collision and carry the imprint of that cosmic event to the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors here on Earth.   We worked to understand and model how neutron stars interact, collide, and radiate energy, to best understand gravitational-wave observations, and to use them to tell us new things about neutron star structure and composition.  Research supported by this grant contributed to publications that include:  limits on the frequency of double neutron star and black-hole/neutron-star mergers in our local universe from Advanced LIGO?s first observing run, an student-led assessment of how the uncertain properties of dense matter in neutron stars could impact neutron star merger searches and measurements, spanning the full range of masses considered by LIGO search template banks, the analysis of the first gravitational-wave observation of merging neutron stars, GW170817, and the first gravitational-wave limits on how the stars responded to tides as they orbit, a search for post-merger signals from merging neutron stars, and, most recently, constraints on dense matter and the size of neutron stars from the tidal response of merging neutron stars in GW170817.   Based on the research supported by this grant, the PI was invited to give 43 presentations at national meetings, conferences, and other institutions during the funded period, both to fellow gravitational-wave astrohpysicists, as well as to audiences including mathematicians, nuclear physicists, and astronomers.  Eight undergraduate students, of the fourteen involved in the PI's research group during the funded period, were directly supported by this grant. The grant also supported three Masters students. These students were involved in the research described above, developing their understanding and engagement in astrophysics. This grant also supported additional undergraduate student projects to develop and test new waveform models for neutron-star mergers, as well as tests and documentation of LIGO parameter inference and equation of state analysis code. These projects gave students research experience, developed communication skills, and built knowledge of computation and working with supercomputer clusters. Students who have graduated from the PI's group are now working in software, communications, engineering, aerospace, buisiness strategy, as adjunct faculty, or are in in higher education programs as Masters, MBA, and PhD students.         The PI co-hosted press events following discovery announcements for GW150914 and GW170817. She has been interviewed by local and national media (e.g. KCAL 9, FOX 11, KFI FM 650, Nature News, Wired, Quanta magazine, and Scientific American). She worked as a K12 teacher mentor in the NSF-funded "Transforming Academic and Cultural Identidad through Biliteracy" (2013&ndash;2016) and has coordinated school visits and outreach events on gravitational-wave science with local teachers, reaching &sim;300 students in largely Hispanic communities.
