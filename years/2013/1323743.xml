<AbstractNarration>This study will evaluate civil society's role in participatory governance and its implications for rights claims, strategies, and worldviews as related to the regulation of agrarian markets and food.  The expansion of the global food market coupled with rising food prices over the past two decades have occasioned claims concerning how regulation should proceed both domestically and internationally.  Food policy institutions on multiple scales have adopted new institutional structures to include input from multiple constituencies. &lt;br/&gt;In the United States, municipal, regional, and state governments have developed food policy councils comprised of the multiple stakeholders of the food system. This emerging form of "multi-stakeholder" or "new" governance is part of a broader regulatory reform that has also been adopted by transnational food policy institutions. This study asks how participation in these new forms of lawmaking leads constituents to reconfigure and reimagine rights-based claims within new sites of governance and ultimately transforms the politics of human rights.&lt;br/&gt;To answer this question, this ethnographic project will analyze participation in food policy councils, domestic and transnational networks, as well as global sites of food policy regulation through participant observation and social network analysis. It contributes to scholarship in anthropology and socio-legal studies by empirically examining the efficacy of new forms of regulation the emergence of a new transnational legal culture. The project will be  important to policymakers and citizens with interests in governance in multiple sites with many stakeholders</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the past three decades, food has become a powerful site of political and cultural activism in the United States. Together, small farmers, food chain workers, and urban activists have mobilized food in a symbolic and material struggle to contest the liberalization of the global food system and its effects on the farm economy, environment, and peopleÃ†s health. By imbuing food with alternative values, a new local food movement has emerged that is re-imagining social and economic organization and constructing new horizons of social justice.  As activists seek to construct new economies, they have developed new forms of regulation. These informal, participatory, and voluntary forms of "governance" seek to connect the diverse "stakeholders" of food systems and reorganize food based on shared values of economic growth and social equity. As activists engage in these new forms of multi-stakeholder governance, my study asked: (1) How are these informal, consensus-based regulatory systems re-shaping food activistsÃ† vision of social justice and rights claims? (2) How do these new forms of governance challenge, transform or reflect existing forms of power? (3) How do these practices affect activists, bureaucrats, and other stakeholdersÃ† understandings of law?  (4) How do activistsÃ† claims to "food sovereignty" reflect or reproduce the emergent logics of governance and globalization?  Based in the Puget Sound region of Washington State, a long-time hub of food activism and a national leader in local food production, I conducted ethnographic fieldwork for approximately two years. During this time, I observed various arenas of local food governance, interviewed participants of the local food movement, conducted participant-observation with food activists, and embedded myself within the larger transnational food movement.

Previous "food movements" believed that food was a "public good" that required government intervention into food and agricultural markets. In the turn to governance, however, the very meaning of a public good has been transformed. Whereas in previous models of regulation, conflicts over distinct values related to food were settled through formal disputing mechanisms and enforced by courts, contemporary conflicts over values are managed through informal governance processes that leave conflicts unresolved. This devolution from government action to individual responsibility has transformed the possibilitie...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
