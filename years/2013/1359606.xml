<AbstractNarration>The Plains Elevated Convection at Night (PECAN) field campaign will occur the Summer of 2015 in the central Great Plains.  The scientific focus of PECAN is nocturnal convection, with four separate research topics to be addressed:  1) Nocturnal convection initiation and early evolution of mesoscale convective clusters; 2) Bore and other wave-like disturbances; 3) Dynamics and microphysics of nocturnal mesoscale convective systems; 4) Prediction of nocturnal convection initiation and evolution.  The observational campaign plan calls for three research aircraft, seven mobile Doppler radars, and multiple sounding systems.  A main part of the experimental design is the inclusion of fixed and mobile PECAN Integrated Sounding Array (PISA) units which consists of a variety of profiling instruments.  The broader societal impact of PECAN is to improve forecasts of these nocturnal events for hydrology, energy, agriculture and public safety purposes.  The field campaign would include a large number of students, including efforts to broaden participation and enhance diversity.  Public outreach would also be conducted.      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Via this award, PI Gallus will serve as lead forecaster for PECAN. To facilitate this role, we will run a real-time configuration of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model using data assimilation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit :&lt;br/&gt;Elevated mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), particularly those occurring at night, are a difficult challenge for forecasters. These events are more difficult to accurately simulate, partly because of insufficient observations above ground level, but also due to deficiencies in understanding of their initiation and maintenance. Initiation of and morphological evolution within MCSs is likely influenced by features such as bores, elevated boundaries, and other elevated convergence zones that are not initialized well in the models, and thus how these features modulate convection is not well-understood. These features often coexist with low-level jets (LLJ) whose simulation is also sensitive to errors in the simulated planetary boundary layer evolution.  Tools and knowledge gained by this award will provide a better understanding of MCSs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts :&lt;br/&gt;This work will lead to both improved understanding of elevated nocturnal MCSs that should lead to improved forecasting of these challenging events, and enhanced education and training of students who will assist in conducting the research and also the forecasting in the field.  This work has the potential to directly improve safety from this weather hazard.</AbstractNarration>

In addition, the project allowed the exploration of pristine convective initiation at night to gain understanding about four different types of convective initiation, when do they occur during the night, how do they vary in location of occurrence, and at what elevation the storms initiate.   The forecasting for the project was generally very successful, much moreso than expected.  For all three phenomena for which official probability forecasts were issued, the actual events occurred slightly more often than the probability values assigned, implying forecasters could have been even more confident of occurrence.  For convective systems and bores, the forecasters evidenced an ability to tell when conditions were more favorable for these events to occur.  For convective initiation, it tended to happen a roughly equal percentage of the time whether a LOW probability was forecasted or a Moderate one.  This is not surprising since convective initiation at night is known to be a very difficult problem.   Therefore, after the field project ended, we explored that phenomenon in more detail.  It was found that four different types of convective initiation noted by forecasters tended to happen at roughly the same time during the night, with no preference in location in the Plains States either.  These types included north of a surface front within a low-level jet of wind, elsewhere within that jet of wind but away from the surface front, in a T-shaped formation ahead of an ongoing thunderstorm system, and in a region outside the low-level jet where there was no obvious reason for the storms.
