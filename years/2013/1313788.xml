<AbstractNarration>Sustainable use of tropical forests depends upon the ability of forests to regrow after clearing.  This project -- Tropical Reforestation Research Coordination Network -- will address major gaps in our understanding of the social and ecological drivers of reforestation, and the consequences of alternative methods of reforestation for reforestation or for commercial forestry. Interdisciplinary teams will be formed at an initial workshop to focus on four thematic areas: 1) social and ecological causes of forest changes in the tropics; 2) recovery of ecosystems in disturbed tropical forest landscapes; 3) interactions between climate variability and reforestation; and 4) socioeconomic and ecological costs and benefits of reforestation. Teams will review previously published, scholarly research; plan new research proposals to address knowledge gaps; produce policy briefs for governmental and non-governmental agencies and organizations; and produce teaching modules for university students and reforestation professionals. A third workshop featuring early career scientists will focus on the social and ecological challenges of managing regenerating forests. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will help guide efforts to actively restore forests on degraded and unproductive lands. Partnerships with the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Network of Conservation Educators and Practitioners, and the Environmental Leadership and Training Initiative will allow participants to transmit their findings to policy makers, students, foresters, and the general public via webinars, policy briefs, field training, and on-line courses. The network's activities will promote international collaboration and provide training for graduate students through a distributed graduate student seminar on the social and ecological impacts of climate variability on tropical reforestation.</AbstractNarration>

All of these key messages and publications are freely available on our website.  Tropical Reforestation Should Complement and Enhance Local Livelihoods, Needs, and Cultures. Participatory planning with smallholders and communities is key for enhancing local livelihoods, lasting ecological outcomes, and support (buy-in) for restoration.  Local Decision-making is Essential for Effective and Long-Lasting Tropical Reforestation. Engaging with and empowering local decision-making processes is key to creating restoration interventions that will be integrated into local lives and communities, and thereby persist into the future.   Effective Ecological and Social Outcomes Require Attention to Local Context and Seed Sources When Planting Trees. Successful active restoration - restoration that involves active interventions by people - requires more than just planting trees or increasing tree cover.    Natural Regeneration is a Cost-effective Approach to Recover Biodiversity, Ecosystem Services, and Biocultural Values in Many Contexts. Naturally regenerating tropical forests can contribute to biodiversity conservation and provide economic benefits for smallholders.  New Forests are Arising in Diverse Socio-ecological Contexts, with Important Consequences for People, Biodiversity, and Ecosystem Services. The world's tropical forests are continually in flux, and are much more dynamic than global estimates of tree cover would suggest.   Beyond Carbon: Interactions Between Tropical Reforestation and Climate Change Encompass Multiple Socio-ecological Dimensions. Forest restoration sequesters carbon and contributes greatly to mitigate climate change.   Effective and Long-lasting Tropical Reforestation Requires Holistic Vision and Innovations that Incorporate Social and Ecological Systems. Holistic vision that incorporates social and ecological components of the landscape and the connections between them is essential for effective and long-lasting restoration. Guiding Principles are Needed to Avoid Negative Consequences and Reach the Scale and Potential of Forest and Landscape Restoration. Forest and landscape restoration (FLR) is a long-term, multidimensional process that incorporates biophysical, socioeconomic and governance dimensions.
