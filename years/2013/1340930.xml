<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit: &lt;br/&gt;The proposed workshop will provide the Antarctic Earth Science research community with the opportunity to debate and prioritize scientific goals. The PI proposes to convene a workshop, the Antarctic Geologic Drilling Workshop, with approximately 42 U.S. participants at various stages of their careers, all of who bring scientific questions that could be addressed by geologic drilling in the Antarctic. After the workshop, the steering committee will complete a report summarizing the drilling targets of interest to the U.S. Antarctic community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;This workshop will foster a variety of interdisciplinary drilling studies targeting paleoclimate research and glacial modeling. This workshop will emphasize participation of early career scientists and the PI will use the outreach office at the University of Houston to promote the workshop and its outcomes. The workshop will be held at the University of Houston, described as the second-most ethnically diverse campus in the U.S. All interested students will be invited to the poster session to learn about the range of scientific research being done in the Antarctic and to meet the researchers. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The history of this region is recorded in rocks  deposited in and around Antarctica, that are reachable through a wide range of  innovative geological drilling approaches.  These rocks, formed during times that  witnessed past climate changes and associated growth and retreat of ice sheets,  offer clues to help us to understand the interplay of Earth&rsquo;s dynamic processes that  control and respond to the Antarctic cryosphere.  This history is especially relevant  to resolve ice sheet behavior under past and future high greenhouse gas levels.    The ice that is locked in the continental Antarctic ice sheets could raise global sea  level by tens of meters if it were to melt entirely.  While complete melting is not on  the near-term horizon, even modest changes in the volume of the ice sheet could raise global sea level enough to flood major cities and densely populated low-lying  regions around the world.  It is thus a critical societal need to develop an  understanding of the controls on ice sheet stability, growth, and retreat.  Much of  our knowledge of past climate changes, and inferred ice sheet history, has been  obtained from drill cores taken in low-latitude oceanic settings.  Such far-field  proxies offer a general outline of ice sheet behavior, but cannot show which part of  the ice sheet changed, or what the ocean currents, temperatures, or other  controlling parameters were in proximal settings.  Drilling in Antarctica can yield  samples of rock that were influenced directly by glacial processes and that provide  access to Antarctica&rsquo;s ice-covered geology.  Limited outcrops, short gravity cores,  and drill cores with partial recovery have been studied from many locations, but  such records cannot give the continuous temporal record needed to determine  timing and rates of ice sheet change, boundary conditions controlling that behavior,  or model future behavior.  Spatially distributed records, including transects from  onshore to distal far-field records from each major ice drainage basin, are needed to  resolve the individual histories of each area, which have large differences that are  only now being realized.  High quality seismic data linking drill sites can increase the impact of individual sites by extending the details over a broader area and  tightening the time constraints at each site.  Over-ice seismic capabilities offer a  means to identify future drilling targets in the Antarctic interior.  New approaches to  sample bedrock beneath the ice sheet and measure conditions beneath the ice will  help refine basal-bed boundary conditions that are vital to reconstructions of ice  sheet behavior.  Numerical modeling, with an eye toward the integration of model  output with geological records, can test data-driven hypotheses and link Antarctic  climate and ice sheet history with distant latitudes.   Integrated under the broad goal of understanding past environmental changes as a  means to address issues associated with potential future ice sheet changes, a group  of geoscientists met at the University of Houston, on November 7th and 8th, 2013, at  the NSF-sponsored Antarctic Geological Drilling Workshop to discuss drilling  5 targets, science questions, and appropriate tools and techniques covering a range of  goals from the South Pacific to the South Pole and from Precambrian time to modern  day.
