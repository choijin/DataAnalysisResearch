<AbstractNarration>Patterns of conflict in middle and high schools have been the topic of an enormous amount of policy and behavioral intervention, and of political and social concern, following several suicides and cases of "bullying" in American schools. How does conflict become normative for a particular neighborhood, school, or even country, to the extent that it is considered part of the group's climate or culture? Is it possible to intervene to reduce harassment, bullying, aggression and other conflict behaviors among these groups?  Previous research by Dr. Elizabeth Levy Paluck (Princeton University) and colleagues used social network analysis to measure patterns of social interaction among group members over time to understand (1) whether particular influential group members are able to alter perceptions of the entire group's social norms about conflict or bullying in positive ways, and (2) whether shifting perceptions of group norms can reduce longstanding patterns of conflict within the group's social network. This work shows that the behavior of certain highly-connected individuals in the group social network provides a salient cue to members of the social network about which behaviors are normative (i.e., typical and desirable). Targeting these individuals' conflict behavior within a social network creates perceptions of anti-conflict norms among individuals who are exposed to them in the network, and these shifts in perceived norms are accompanied by actual reductions in conflict behavior and increases in tolerance and acceptance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research tests the next critical question of this research program, specifically whether the mutually reinforcing process of changing norms and behaviors within a social network is responsible for changing enduring behavioral patterns identified as the group's social climate or culture.  The research will focus specifically on conflict behaviors in middle school and will follow up on the long term qualitative and behavioral outcomes of a randomized field experiment in a sample of 58 public middle schools. Half of the schools were randomly assigned to an anti-conflict intervention that engages a random subset of all highly connected students in the school's social network. The pragmatic and policy lessons from psychological theories of social norms and behavior rest on psychologists' ability to propose hypotheses and to rigorously test how, across situations and over the long term, a group's social norms might be shifted away from conflict and new patterns of prosocial behaviors of tolerance and social acceptance could persist. This research will provide a novel account of the social mechanisms by which large scale social dynamics change and reproduce norms, and establish behavioral patterns most often identified with climates or culture.  The outcome of this work could inform policy and future intervention efforts to reduce harassment, bullying, and other threatening behavior in schools and other group contexts.</AbstractNarration>

People use social norms as guides for their own behavior. This project tested this general theory with an experiment, testing which people in a community of students can make conflict and bullying seem less normal. We conducted a brand new anticonflict intervention with a randomly selected half of a sample of 56 public middle schools, totaling 24,191 students. After comprehensively measuring every school&rsquo;s social network, we randomly selected groups of 20&ndash;32 students from the schools that were assigned to the intervention. The anti-conflict intervention was designed to give these students a public platform to express their own personal stance against conflict at their school. Compared with control schools, disciplinary reports of student conflict (collected by school adminstration)&nbsp;at the schools conducting this intervention were reduced by up to 25% over 1 year. The effect was stronger when the seed group contained more &ldquo;social referent&rdquo; students who, as network measures reveal, attract more student attention. We hypothesized, and found that these were the students who were best able to spread ideas about what behaviors are "normal", or part of the social norm. Network analyses of peer-to-peer influence show that social referents spread perceptions of conflict as less socially normative.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/01/2018<br>      Modified by: Elizabeth&nbsp;L&nbsp;Paluck</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1322356/1322356_10259581_1525191057766_rawbehavheat--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1322356/1322356_10259581_1525191057766_rawbehavheat--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Overall school climate results: distribution of disciplinary events throughout school networks, comparing treatment, and control schools"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1322356/1322356_10259581_1525191057766_rawbehavheat--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Overall school climate results: distribution of disciplinary events throughout school networks, comparing treatment, and control schools"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Color coding reveals the average number of times each student in the school was disciplined for peer conflict; student nodes are colored red when the student was disciplined for conflict, and scaled to the number of times in the year they were disciplined.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Paluck, Shepherd, & Aronow, 2016</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Elizabeth&nbsp;L&nbsp;Paluck</div> <div class="imageTitle">Overall school climate results: distribution of disciplinary events throughout school networks, comparing treatment, and control schools</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
