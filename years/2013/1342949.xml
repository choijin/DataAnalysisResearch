<AbstractNarration>This award provides support to U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 13-country initiative on global change research through the Belmont Forum and the G8 countries Heads of Research Councils. The Belmont Forum is a high level group of the world's major and emerging funders of global environmental change research and international science councils.  It aims to accelerate delivery of the international environmental research most urgently needed to remove critical barriers to sustainability by aligning and mobilizing international resources. The G8 Heads of Research Councils developed a funding framework to support multilateral research projects that address global challenges in ways that are beyond the capacity of national or bilateral activities. Each partner country provides funding for their researchers within a consortium to alleviate the need for funds to cross international borders.  This approach facilitates effective leveraging of national resources to support excellent research on topics of global relevance best tackled through a multinational approach, recognizing that global challenges need global solutions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Working together in an inaugural call of the International Opportunities Fund, the Belmont Forum and G8HORCs have provided support for research projects that seek to deliver knowledge needed for action to mitigate and adapt to detrimental environmental change and extreme hazardous events that relate to either Freshwater Security or Coastal Vulnerability.  This award provides support for the U.S. researchers to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries and that bring together natural scientists, social scientists and research users (e.g., policy makers, regulators, NGOs, communities and industry).  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports research activities that will develop an innovative methodological approach combining the use of hydro-meteorological and socio-economic data to improve drought monitoring and early warning systems and associated drought risk management strategies. Droughts pose a threat to freshwater security in diverse areas around the globe. A range of drought metrics is often used to characterize the impacts of these events separately in the environment and in society. This project seeks to bridge these natural and social approaches to develop more effective drought management approaches. The objectives of this project include (1) compare and evaluate drought impact indicators across geographic settings and governance structures; (2) identify and compare drought indicator thresholds that define social vulnerability and drought impacts; (3) engage in social learning to explore framing, decision making, and drought practices by a diverse range of stakeholders and (4) develop pathways to drought resilient communities and ecosystems based on improved drought monitoring and early warning systems, management, and training. Researchers will engage with a diverse group of stakeholders and end-users to understand the characteristics that make communities vulnerable to droughts and improve the capacity of communities to adapt in different social, economic, and cultural contexts. These efforts will contribute toward improved freshwater security by developing a better understanding and assessment of drought impacts.</AbstractNarration>

Some places and sectors are more vulnerable to drought than others, particularly in developing countries where people depend on subsistence agriculture with little if any policy or market protections from variable weather. However, as recent drought in the United States have shown, even large urban areas with relatively well-managed water supplies are vulnerable to drought.</p> <p>Little research has been done to understand the large-scale connections between drought indicators and impacts. This project - Drought Impacts: Vulnerability thresholds in monitoring and Early warning Ressearch (DrIVER) - looked&nbsp;for ways to enhance understanding of drought indicators, impacts and experiences with the water supply sector in the U.S., Europe, and Australia. The research team included people from the National Drought Mitigation Center, based at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, USA; the Hydrology Department at the University of Freiburg, Germany; The Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Wallingford, United Kingdom; the Open University in Milton Keyes, United Kingdom; and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization in Australia. They received one of the inaugural grants from the Belmont Forum, which connects efforts of the National Science Foundation and its international counterparts.</p> <p>The U.S. effort focused on the Neuse and Cape Fear river basins in North Carolina, and included several webinars and workshops over the course of the project with representatives of federal, state and local agencies that have water management responsibilities in the region. The team produced visualizations, both descriptive and analytic, of the relationship between data from the Drought Impact Reporter (<a href="http://droughtreporter.unl.edu">http://droughtreporter.unl.edu</a>) and various drought indices, such as the Standardized Precipitation Index and the Palmer Drought Severity Index. Stakeholder said that while the information was useful for understanding past drought impacts at particular drought severity levels, there is a need for more systematically collected impact information, especially in sectors such as recreation and water quality. They also said that the collection of additional impact information would improve the predictive capability of the analyses, and enhance the value of visualizations such as timelines for use in public&nbsp;education and scenario planning.</p> <p>Overall project findings included recognition that better understanding impacts would contribute to enhanced drought early warning systems, and that impacts help get the attention of media and policy makers; that future monitoring systems should be low-cost and produce open-access data, including local drought impacts; that different sectors might need forecasts and monitoring products at different time scales; that post-drought assessments are valuable learning tools; and that decision-making and drought communication with the public is often fragmented across several agencies.
