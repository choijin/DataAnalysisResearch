<AbstractNarration>Establishing the primary body axis is fundamental to animal development. This research project builds on the discovery of a novel gene, termed panish, that establishes head to tail polarity and anterior body plan of a mosquito-related midge, Chironomus riparius. Prior to this work, the only factor known to fulfill this role in insects was the homeobox gene bicoid, discovered in Drosophila nearly 30 years ago. Bicoid is now firmly established as a fundamental model for molecular gradients and embryo patterning. Surprisingly, most insects lack bicoid and a major question in the field is how other insects establish head-to-tail polarity during embryonic development. Preliminary phylogenetic and genomic studies indicate that global body plan organizers such as bicoid and panish evolved independently multiple--perhaps even many times within the group of flies. The proposed research will test this hypothesis using high-throughput sequencing technology and will characterize experimentally the molecular nature of the panish gene product. The expected results will help to understand a fundamental mechanism of animal development in its evolutionary context. The project also provides training opportunities and is tied to a joint research project with a local high school that was initiated in 2011. In this collaboration ninth and tenth graders, under the supervision of two collaborating high school teachers with entomological expertise, seek to develop culture techniques for a specific fly species that may provide important information on the evolution of primary embryonic axis determinants in flies. The collaborating high school teachers incorporated the project into their curriculum to teach scientific methodology. Additional science-education outreach tied to this project specifically targets underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ a)  Intellectual Merit Research supported by this award has shown that different species of flies (Diptera) have evolved structurally unrelated "anterior axis determinants", even though their embryos are morphologically similar.  Anterior determinants are primarily defined by their loss-of-function phenotype: headless embryos with two mirror-image tail-ends. A transcriptome-profiling approach was developed to identify anterior and posterior localized maternal transcripts in freshly deposited eggs of six biting and non-biting midge species and a soldier fly species, providing a phylogenetic framework for the evolution of primary axis determinants in dipteran embryos. Gene knockdown experiments in two of these species, Chironomus riparius (a representative of the culicomorphan mosquitoes) and Clogmia albipunctata (a close relative of sand flies), showed that this approach correctly predicted their anterior determinants. In Chironomus, the anterior determinant is encoded by a newly evolved cysteine-clamp gene, named panish. The first two exons of panish are shared with a nucleosid kinase gene while the portion encoding its DNA-binding cysteine-clamp domain exhibits homology to pangolin/tcf, the effector gene of canonical Wnt signaling. Homologs of panish were only found in a subgroup of chironomids, indicating a recent evolutionary origin of this gene. This result demonstrated for the first time that flies use structurally unrelated genes to specify the anterior body plan and head-to-tail polarity. In Clogmia, the function of anterior axis determinant has been adopted by a  maternally expressed transcript variant of the conserved segmentation gene odd-paired, named Cal-opaMat. Knockdown of Cal-opaMat resulted in embryos with tail-to-tail polarity (as panish knockdown).  Conversely, ectopic expression of Cal-opaMat at the posterior pole resulted in head-to-head polarity.
