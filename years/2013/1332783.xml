<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division of the National Science Foundation will support the research program of Daniel Nocera at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Dr. Nocera and his students will investigate the development of catalysts for the photochemical activation of small molecules, including water and hydrogen halides, useful in the generation of solar fuels. The focus of the research is on the expansion of the reactivity of metal complexes to include multi-electron transfer processes for the activation of small molecules relevant to solar fuel production.  A combination of synthetic, spectroscopic characterization, and photocatalytic cycle development studies will be pursued.  The fundamental understanding resulting from this research will enable the development of solar based renewable energy schemes.  Students will be trained in the fundamental science and the public issues relevant to these renewable energy questions.  Outreach to the public forms a large part of the work of this research group.</AbstractNarration>

Most current methods of energy storage are characterized by low energy densities and consequently they present formidable challenges for the large-scale implementation of renewable energy sources. As the PI of this project has documented in a recent review [2], the energy density of fuels is minimally &ge;102 times larger than any other storage methods, including batteries. As the reaction of H2 with CO2 to make any fuel is effectively thermoneutral [3], the key challenge, from a solar energy conversion point of view, is to obtain H2 renewably. Members of the project team have focused on two H2-generating reactions, 2H2O + light  &rarr;  2H2  +  O2                                                 (1) 2HX + light  &rarr;  H2  +  X2                                                       (2)  Both HX and H2O splitting store approximately the same amount of energy per electron (E = 1.23 eV and 1.36 eV for H2O and HCl, respectively).
