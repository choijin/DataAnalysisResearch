<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to use an integrative experimental and computational approach to investigate the fracture toughness and the underlying fracture mechanisms of electrode materials in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). The proposed research will develop and implement an in-situ experimental setup to measure the constitutive behavior and extrinsic fracture properties of lithiated electrodes under well-controlled mechanical and electrochemical conditions. A numerical field-projection scheme will be used to extract the intrinsic cohesive properties at the crack-tip process zone from experimental far-field information. The coupled effects of mechanical and electrochemical processes on the electrode fracture characteristics will be elucidated by a micromechanics failure model, which incorporates the measured constitutive law and intrinsic cohesive parameters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the above studies will significantly advance the currently limited understanding of electrode material fracture in LIBs. Findings from this research will provide fundamental design criteria for microstructural optimization of ultra-high-capacity electrode materials with improved cycle life. The tightly integrated experimental and computational studies will expose participating students to a new field of fracture mechanics, which lies at the intersection of electrochemistry, physics, materials science and mechanics. Research results will be rapidly disseminated via open-access web-based resources, and will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate level courses. Through live demonstrations enhanced with multimedia tools, the PIs will actively educate elementary school students in the latest energy storage technologies to inspire them towards careers in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[       The use of silicon electrodes for high-capacity lithium ion batteries has been proposed over a decade ago, but these electrodes have suffered from massive cracking and capacity-fade during electrochemical cycling. This is because silicon electrodes undergo huge volume expansion of up to 300% when lithiated. In a typical battery, the silicon electrode is attached to a metal current collector, such as copper. The massive and inhomogeneous volume changes of the electrode lead to colossal cracking, delamination of the electrode from the current collector, and consequent capacity fade. The objective of this research is to obtain mechanistic and quantitative understanding of the deformation and fracture behavior of these silicon electrodes.         Our first step was to elucidate the underlying mechanisms for the cracking of silicon thin film electrodes. While previous studies have proposed that cracking occurs during the delithiation cycle, we demonstrated using finite element analysis that fracture actually initiates by a sequential cracking mechanism during early-stage lithiation. This cracking mechanism well explains the fracture patterns comprising of uniformly-sized silicon islands which were observed in experiments. The predicted island sizes from our computational models were in perfect agreement with experiments. This study demonstrated that cracking of the lithiated silicon films can be mitigated through patterning individual silicon islands. However, experiments showed that the patterned electrode, even in its uncracked state, could still delaminate from the copper current collector. In addition, experiments have suggested that sliding readily occurs along the silicon-copper interface during charge cycling. However, understanding the mechanisms of interface sliding and delamination is complicated by significant intermixing of Cu, Si, and Li atoms at the interface between a lithiated-silicon film and the copper substrate. Using ab-inito calculations, we studied the shear deformation response of an interdiffused Li-Si-Cu interphase separating the silicon electrode and the copper current collector. The originality of this research lies in the consideration of the interrelationship between the unique Li-Si-Cu phase structure and the mechanisms of interface sliding and locking, which prevents or promotes stress-build-up and delamination failure. Our uncovered mechanisms provided the first explanation on why silicon electrodes were able to retain their initial charge capacities for limited number of cycles, before abruptly delaminating from the copper current collector to cause capacity fade.         With this understanding on the fracture and delamination behavior of lithiated silicon electrodes, we focused attention the surprising ability of these electrode materials to undergo plasticity which is in contrast to the extremely brittle behavior of pure silicon. We successfully quantified the fracture toughness of silicon electrodes as a function of lithium content via a hybrid experimental-computational approach. In the process, we found that lithiated silicon electrodes could sustain very high damage tolerance, and exhibited a brittle-to-ductile transition in the plasticity behavior with increasing lithium content. Our first principle and molecular dynamics calculations have provided a mechanistic explanation of the plasticity and fracture behavior of these electrodes in terms of the bonding characteristics.        Together, our studies reflect a coherent effort to provide mechanistic understanding of fracture, plasticity, and delamination processes which are critical roadblocks to the design and manufacturing of fracture-resistant electrode materials with high cyclability. The insights provided by this research have important implications in the design and development of damage-tolerant high capacity electrode materials.
