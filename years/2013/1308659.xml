<AbstractNarration>This project is jointly funded by the Electronic and Photonic Materials Program (EPM) in the Division of Materials Research (DMR) and the Electronics, Photonics, and Magnetic Devices Program (EPMD) in the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Description: The goal of this project is to develop high-quality graphene samples on nanoscale gratings for the generation of terahertz (THz) light based on novel radiation mechanisms that so far have been the primary domain of high-energy electron beams in vacuum-based systems. Specifically, the mechanisms under study include a radically new cyclotron-like emission process, where angular motion is obtained via geometrical constraints rather than through the application of an external magnetic field, and the Smith-Purcell effect. The project activities involve a combination of nanolithography for the fabrication of highly sinusoidal nanoscale gratings, graphene synthesis via exfoliation and high-vacuum chemical vapor deposition, graphene transfer, and sample characterization via gated electrical studies, Raman spectroscopy, and THz-radiation measurements. The distinctive properties of graphene (including its linear energy dispersion, high electron velocity and mobility, and two-dimensional nature) are uniquely suited to the radiation mechanisms under study. At the same time, critical information about the underlying materials physics can be unveiled through the demonstration and investigation of these phenomena.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Description: Graphene is a two-dimensional crystal consisting of a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice. By virtue of several unique electronic, optical, and mechanical properties, it represents a promising materials platform to enable the continued evolution of electronic and photonic technologies towards ever increasing performance, miniaturization, and functionalities, well beyond the fundamental limits of traditional semiconductors. This project investigates the use of these properties to develop a new paradigm for THz light emission in compact solid-state systems. As a result, it may open the way for a new class of THz devices (including THz lasers potentially capable of room-temperature operation, unlike all existing semiconductor-based solutions), as needed for a wide range of emerging applications in security screening, medical diagnostics, and manufacturing quality control. &lt;br/&gt;In the course of these activities, education is promoted through the training of students in several areas of materials science and nanotechnology, with a strong emphasis on the involvement of undergraduates and high-school interns in addition to Ph.D. candidates. A related goal is the development of experimental modules based on the research methods and outcomes, to enhance the laboratory component of an undergraduate course on nanotechnology at Boston University (BU), and for demonstrations at local high schools (including institutes with large minority populations) by undergraduates engaged in BU Inspiration-Ambassadors program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research program has focused on the exploration of a radically new approach for the generation of terahertz light in compact solid-state systems, based on the use of electron-beam radiation mechanisms in grating-coupled graphene and other carbon-based nanostructures.  Specific examples of such mechanisms include the emission of cyclotron-like radiation from a dc current in a mechanically corrugated graphene sheet, and the Smith-Purcell effect (i.e., light emission by charges in uniform rectilinear motion near a grating).  Similar processes are well established in the context of radiation sources based on high-energy electron beams in vacuum, such as free-electron lasers, magnetrons, and orotrons.  However, they represent a novel paradigm for light emission in condensed matter, and the unique electronic and mechanical properties of graphene (including its linear energy dispersion, high electron velocity and mobility, and two-dimensional nature) are ideally suited to their demonstration.   Project outcomes include both numerical and experimental results.  First, we have developed a rigorous theoretical model for the numerical simulation of the proposed mechanisms, and applied it to a variety of novel device geometries, involving both graphene sheets as well as graphene nanoribbons and carbon nanotubes.  The simulation results indicate that technologically significant output power levels can be obtained with these structures, potentially even at room temperature if ultrahigh-mobility samples are employed (Fig. 1).  These mechanisms therefore provide a promising platform to address a key technology gap of modern-day electronics and photonics, i.e., the lack of practical solid-state radiation sources capable of operation across the THz spectrum without cryogenic cooling.  In turn, such devices could enable a wide range of critical applications, particularly in the areas of sensing and imaging for security screening, medical diagnostics, and manufacturing quality control.   Experimental work has focused on high-quality graphene samples coupled to adjacent nanoscale gratings, consisting of square-periodic arrays of either cylindrical holes patterned in the underlying SiO2/Si substrate or metallic nanocylinders fabricated over the graphene sheet.  To obtain the required ultrahigh carrier mobilities for the proposed electron-beam radiation mechanisms, graphene sheets encapsulated within highly inert hexagonal boron nitride layers have also been employed.  Pronounced THz electroluminescence spectra have been measured with these samples, whose spectral properties are in good agreement with the expected graphene Smith-Purcell effect.  Similar structures have also been employed to demonstrate the grating-coupled excitation of graphene plasmon polaritons at THz frequencies (Fig. 2), which are also promising for several device applications in THz optoelectronics.  Furthermore, extensive Raman microscopy studies have been performed with the same samples, to elucidate the nature of strain redistribution (Fig. 3) and charge screening under ultra-low doping conditions in graphene.   These activities have been carried out by four Ph.D. students at Boston University, thereby contributing to their professional development and progress towards graduation.  Several undergraduate students have also participated in related research endeavors each year, and in the process have gained valuable exposure to state-of-the-art nanoscience and nanotechnology.
