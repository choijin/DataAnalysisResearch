<AbstractNarration>Technical Description: This project is designed to utilize unique materials growth techniques to investigate the optical properties and the underlying science of metal-semiconductor hybrid nanostructures. Photoluminescence spectroscopy and photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy of quantum dots and quantum wells are used to probe the nature of the interaction between surface plasmon polaritons and excitons. The principal investigator and students use these optical techniques to observe and control the coherent transfer of energy across the interface between metal and semiconductor materials, as a function of growth parameters. In addition, frequency-resolved optical gating spectroscopy combined with spectral interferometry yield a sensitive method for temporal characterization. The material systems being studied are silver, gallium, aluminum, and indium metal nanoparticles and indium arsenide and indium gallium arsenide quantum wells and dots. The research project designs, fabricates, characterizes and investigates the origin of the linear and non-linear optical behavior of hybrid metal-semiconductor nanostructures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-technical Description: In its simplest form, a surface plasmon polariton is an electromagnetic wave that is guided and confined along a metal-dielectric interface much in the same way that light can be guided by an optical fiber. This confinement leads to an intense electromagnetic field at the interface, resulting in an extraordinary enhancement of materials properties. This is particularly true when the separation between metal and dielectric materials is at the nanoscale. In this project, using novel materials fabrication techniques, the functionality of metal-semiconductor hybrid nanostructures is increased to demonstrate control of light waves on a nanometer length scale and ultra-short optical switching times. As a result, the confined nature of propagating surface plasmon polariton waves enables all-optical integrated circuits. One can imagine tiny active photonic elements based on nonlinear surface plasmon polariton optics that allows propagation and switching of nanoscale light beams confined by the metal-semiconductor interface. In addition to the potential for technology impact, the project gives students the skills to design and fabricate nanostructures, characterize their morphology and utilize their data to question and advance the understanding of the exciton-surface plasmon polariton coupling. In this way, students uncover novel and useful optical behavior while learning exciting techniques in both continuous wave and ultra-fast optical spectroscopy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  The coherent superposition of two quantum states, which are not dipole coupled, is known as nonradiative quantum coherence. Such coherence plays an essential role in a host of novel phenomena such as lasing without inversion, electromagnetically induced transparency and entanglement. These phenomena have been investigated extensively in atomic and solid state systems, especially motivated by interest in controlling and manipulating individual quantum systems for quantum information processing. For example, the studies of quantum beats between excitons in semiconductor quantum wells have provided much insight into the coherent interaction and quantum dynamics of a canonical many-body system.  Meanwhile, plasmonics has emerged in the last two decades as a promising approach for concentrating and manipulating light at sub-wavelength dimensions. Hybrid structures that combine the metal-based plasmonic nanostructures and semiconductor-based photonic components are particularly interesting because such hybrid structures take advantage of both material platforms to achieve optical gain and nonlinear signal modulation with a smaller device footprint.  To this end, novel devices such as compact all-optical switches, single-photon transistors, and nanoscale lasers based on hybrid nanostructures have been demonstrated.  To achieve rational device design, it is essential to understand how electronic and photonic coupling between the components to modify the fundamental optical behavior.   While a number of experiments have demonsrated exciton and plasmonic coupling, few previous studies have investigated how quantum coherence is modified by the coupling.  The dephasing time determines the time scale during which electrons or excitons and plasmons can be manipulated coherently by light, and thus is a key parameter for photonic devices.  Very fast dephasing times of plasmonic resonances, on the order of tens of femtoseconds, have been reported in metallic nanostructures while the dephasing times of excitons in semiconductors and their heterostructures can be rather long. In this research, we determined the fast dephasing time of the metallic nanostructure becomes the limiting factor in a hybrid structure. Our work demonstrates that the coupling between excitons and plasmons provides an opportunity to control nonradiative quantum coherence in a hybrid system. Control of the dephasing time is by constructive or destructive interference leading to the total suppression of the spontaneous emission or the population trapping, resulting in an extremely long coherence time.  Broaden Impact:  Controlling such quantum coherence may provide a promising approach to designing active quantum plasmonic devices. In addition, two students, one male and one female, will receive their PhD this spring.           Last Modified: 01/06/2017       Submitted by: Gregory J Salamo]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
