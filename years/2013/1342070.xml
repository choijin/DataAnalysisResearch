<AbstractNarration>ECCS-1342070&lt;br/&gt;Roundy, Shadrach&lt;br/&gt;University of Utah&lt;br/&gt;BRIGE: Adaptive Vibrational Energy Harvesting Systems through Semi-Passive Control of Nonlinear Oscillators&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Vibrations are ubiquitous in many wireless sensor application spaces, and have been widely proposed as a potential source of power.  A continuing issue with vibration energy harvesters is the very tight linkage between the specific parameters of the vibration environment and the structural parameters of the harvester necessary for efficient power generation.  In reality, most vibration sources change with time, and therefore a harvester that adapts to its vibration environment could potentially operate much more efficiently and provide a stable source of power over a broad range of operating environments as does a battery.  This BRIGE project proposes a new method of providing such adaptability through control of the nonlinear stiffness function of duffing oscillators.  The research seeks to address the following questions: under what circumstances is closed loop control beneficial, and under what circumstances will active tuning of a nonlinear harvester outperform active tuning of a linear harvester?  Understanding the conditions under which closed loop control can provide a net increase in power and the relationship between the characteristics of input vibrations and the optimal type of structure to control will lay the groundwork for efficient adaptable vibration energy harvesters.  The models and data generated by this research will lead to further work on optimal control techniques for nonlinear harvesters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The field of energy harvesting for wireless sensors is accessible to and has wide appeal across age groups and levels of technological sophistication.  Leveraging that interest, this project will integrate two outreach activities with the express goal of broadening participation and interest in engineering careers among high school aged female students.  The College of Engineering sponsors an annual summer camp designed to expose young women to a variety of engineering careers with hands-on experiential learning.  A module will be developed for use in this camp in which students design, build, and test a simple piezoelectric accelerometer and energy harvester.  The second activity is to sponsor interactive kinetic energy harvesting sculpture design projects for both undergraduate students and students at a local high school.  During the first year of this grant, the principle investigator will supervise the sculpture project as part of the senior design course, and the following year he will sponsor the project at a local high school as a joint engineering / art class project.  The sculpture design has the potential to engage artistically minded students who may not otherwise be interested in careers in engineering and science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project is to increase the amount of energy that can be harvested from vibrations and human motion to replace batteries in small wireless electronic devices.  There has recently been a massive upsurge in the number of very small wirelessly enabled electronic devices.  Many of these are wireless sensing systems that make up a large part of the emerging Internet of Things.  As the number of wireless devices grows, periodically replacing batteries becomes very costly or even impossible in some cases.  Energy harvesting research seeks to harvest ambient energy to power these wireless sensors.  The goal of this specific project is to investigate approaches to increase the amount of energy that can be harvested from vibrations and human motion.  The approach we have taken is to systematically investigate what types of structures can harvest the most power from complex vibrations and human motion excitations as a function of features of those excitations.  Our group has specifically investigated structures with nonlinear dynamic characteristics and structures that can self-tune their resonance frequencies to better match the source of mechanical excitation.     Intellectual Merit  Specifically, the research project has accomplished the following outcomes:  1. We have explicitly proven the upper bound on how much power can be generated from vibrations with certain types of characteristics and established a mathematical framework that can be extended to other vibration types.  2. We have systematically characterized two large public vibration databases in terms of the characteristics (frequencies, amplitudes, stability, etc.).  This characterization has been published.  3. We have determined what types of structures would be most suitable for which classes of vibrations in the databases and confirmed this with simulation.  4. We have developed a tunable vibration based harvester architecture with a frequency tuning range of +/- 40%.  5. We have characterized human motion under several standard activities, such as walking, jogging, writing, etc. and through mathematical modeling determined the maximum power that can be generated using several different types of energy harvesting structures.  Taken together, these outcomes enhance our understanding of the theoretical limits of harvesting energy from vibrations and human motion and identify optimal energy harvesting structures.     Broader Impacts  Through this BRIGE grant we have sought to increases exposure among high school aged students, particularly young women, to the field of engineering and engineering related careers.  We have teamed up with a local charter high school, the Academy for Math Engineering and Science (AMES), to visit their engineering and art of engineering courses to both provide hands-on learning workshops and sponsor a year-long energy harvesting kinetic sculpture project.  We have also worked within existing University of Utah outreach programs to provide hands-on learning workshops.  These include the Hi-GEAR summer camp specifically for high school aged young women and the Exploring Engineering camp.  Finally, we have hosted summer interns in our research lab from AMES.  Overall, this research project has enhanced understanding of optimal energy harvesting for wireless sensors and wearable sensors, supported the education of 2 graduate students, 8 undergraduate students, and exposed well over 100 high school students to careers in engineering.
