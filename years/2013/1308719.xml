<AbstractNarration>Integrating metabolic theory and population models to predict the consequences of warming on marine invertebrates&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Managing the effects of climate change is a pressing concern, but ecological predictions are still lacking.  The idiosyncratic nature of species-specific responses to multiple stressors contributes to the difficulties associated with predicting population responses to global change.  The metabolic theory of ecology is a starting point for understanding population responses to temperature, against which other components of climate change may later be evaluated.  However, the application of metabolic theory to population-level responses is in its infancy.  In particular, the effects of warming on critical life stages have not been considered in the context of entire life cycles.  This project will apply metabolic theory to size-structured population models to forecast the effects of warming on the demographics of marine invertebrates.      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The integration of theory and modeling will aid in identifying potential outcomes of climate change beyond the lifespans of individual scientists and provide a set of testable predictions for physiological experiments in the context of entire life cycles.  Case studies will focus on ecologically and commercially important species (e.g., urchins, abalone) in temperate marine communities worldwide.  Collaborations with resource managers and First Nations partners in British Columbia will raise awareness about climate change and local impacts to kelp forests and other temperate nearshore habitats.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Coastal ecosystems harbor a wealth of biodiversity and provide valuable ecosystem services to humans.  The conservation of these communities is critical to our well being, but we have modified the oceans at multiple scales, from local to global.  Changes in oceanic temperature, carbonate chemistry, and oxygen content are complicated further by overfishing, habitat modification and pollution.  The primary aim of my postdoctoral research program was to understand the role of anthropogenic activities relative to natural variation in driving temporal change in populations and communities.   Globally, we are extirpating species, transporting others, and homogenizing communities.  I tested the hypothesis that coastal biodiversity change reflects local ecological conditions.  This novel global synthesis of recent biodiversity trends in marine ecosystems reported the surprising finding that local biodiversity has increased worldwide.  I used robust hierarchical modeling methods to infer that human activities indeed have negative and positive effects on local diversity and suggested that the large time-series datasets used for this purpose are generally biased towards un-impacted sites.    In the context of climate warming, reductions in body size are predicted to be a universal consequence of warming.  Most of the evidence for this prediction has been garnered from terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems, with little evidence in marine systems.  Thus, the universality of this prediction is still limited.  Moreover, other drivers (e.g., acidification, pollution, predator effects) may counter or exacerbate the effects of temperature on body size in marine organisms.   Given the historical nature of the data necessary for temporal comparisons of body size change, assigning causal mechanisms to observed change is challenging.  However, size-structured demographic models offer a promising approach to evaluating the contribution of individual-level vital rates (e.g., reproduction, mortality, growth) to population-level characteristics (e.g., maximum body size, population growth rate).    I documented, for the first time, field evidence for the decadal-scale decline of body size in a coral.  Beyond just documenting a size decline, I used a detailed demographic analysis that permitted inference about the underlying mechanisms.  In summary, I identified growth rate as a key demographic leverage point for changes in maximum body size, but temperature alone was likely insufficient to cause the observed magnitude of change.  Notably, the case study outlines a new template for the integration of demographic data with predictions from temperature-size theory.
