<AbstractNarration>This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) at the National Science Foundation supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Montana (UM), led by Professors Aaron M. Thomas and Earle R. Adams. The Department of Chemistry at the University of Montana is the center of a summer REU program, which is built around environmental chemistry with a primary objective of recruiting Native American students in the physical sciences and providing them with a relevant research experience. From prior REU programs at the UM campus, it is known that environmental issues often create interest among science students. This program is designed to include a writing experience, an industrial overview of a green industry, and personalized, well-focused research experiences that will broaden their depth of understanding in a STEM field. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following components are in place for the success of this program: 1.) a director for Indigenous Research and STEM Education (IRSE), who provides a leadership role to build relationships and recruit Native American students in the STEM fields; 2.) focused research projects under the broader theme of environmental chemistry which is a specialty of UM chemistry faculty and of high interest among students at the tribal colleges in Montana and Idaho; and 3.) in collaboration with the Journalism Department and a present NSF program on campus, a Science Communicator will train students in writing techniques and media platforms that effectively reach Native audiences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Three-year (2015-17) Program Summary  Program activities and outcomes include the following: 17 total students were selected to participate as summer interns in the REU   environmental chemistry internship program in 2015, 2016, and 2017. Of these students, two of whom were returning interns; 15 were Native American and two were non-Natives. Interns reported positive and meaningful internship experiences from which they gained new knowledge and research skills. This resulted in increased confidence and interest in environmental research and future academic and career plans focused on environmental chemistry and related areas of science.  Program outcomes include the following;  All of the interns are currently completing degrees (associates, bachelors or graduate).    Tribal college interns are currently completing (or have completed) associates degree requirements and are preparing to transfer to four-year degree programs in science fields.    Several interns plan to pursue bachelor?s degrees at the University of Montana.   Several interns plan to pursue graduate degrees following completion of their undergraduate degrees.    One 2015 intern, who completed a bachelor?s degree shortly after completing the REU internship, is currently enrolled in a science PhD program at the University of Montana.   Several interns reported plans for additional research experiences.       The following summarizes the central program activities and short-term outcomes that contributed to the impacts identified above:  REU coordinators facilitated a positive environment (e.g., matching interns with appropriate mentors and providing housing, meals, and social activities) for the student interns.   While working in environmental chemistry labs and in field sites, interns developed new research skills and knowledge.    Interns worked with research teams, including graduate students and/or lab staff, who provided guidance but also provided opportunities for working individually on the research programs. In the third summer opportunities were provided to two interns to work with their mentors at their field sites collecting research samples.   Interns expressed satisfaction with mentors, matching their interests as REU interns with specific summer programs, and providing consistent assistance and feedback.  Interns also reported appreciated the significant amount of hands-on activities provided by REU mentors.   Working on the research programs increased interns? confidence in their skills in lab procedures, use of instrumentation for conducting experiments, and collecting data in the labs and/or in field sites.   The journalism class enhanced the interns? abilities to use a variety of media to communicate with others about science in general as well as their specific research projects. This supported the development of their final research presentations.       Intern assessments indicated that the internships were beneficial both in terms of the science research skills they gained and in making future degree and career plans.    .  After the completion of the 2017 summer program interns from each year were contacted to request updates on their schooling status. Additionally, since several months to two years have passed since their participation, interns were asked to provide final thoughts on their REU experiences. From the responses received, two quotes summarize interns? views.

The following opinion expressed by a Native student attending a university outside of Montana also indicates a positive overall assessment of the REU program:  This past summer was so fun. I'm grateful I was able to participate in the REU. I gained educational and cultural knowledge. I was sad to hear it was the last year for the program. &hellip; Thank you so much for everything!   The summary of outcomes indicate that this program supported the broader REU goals of full participation of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM.
