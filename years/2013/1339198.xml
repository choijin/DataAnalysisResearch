<AbstractNarration>The overall goal of this project is to artificial chromosome technology in plants. Artificial chromosomes have the potential to stack genes of benefit to agriculture and basic plant genomics studies on an independent chromosome that can be made to specification.  Procedures to add new genes to pre-existing artificial chromosome platforms will be developed that can continue to make amendments in perpetuity. Secondly, methods will be tested that allow much larger numbers of genes to be added to a minichromosome in a single increment than is currently possible. Thirdly, the combination of artificial chromosomes with haploid breeding to introduce the minichromosomes into multiple new varieties more efficiently will be developed. Fourthly, a test of pollen selection to maximize the transmission of artificial chromosomes from one generation to the next will be conducted. Artificial or engineered minichromosomes have the potential to provide a pre-determined site of transgene integration into a plant genome rather than the random nature of plant transformation that is currently used. The targeted insertion will avoid the potential mutagenic effect and gene silencing that often results from uncontrolled integrations.  Moreover,  the  potential  now  exists  that  many different  genes  determining  several  plant  characteristics  can be transformed  at once onto  a minichromosome  that can be further  modified  and that is independent  of the normal chromosomes. With the use of artificial chromosomes it should be possible to introduce  whole  biochemical  pathways  to  add  new  properties  to  plants  that  would facilitate maximizing the ultimate yield or to use plants as factories for the inexpensive production of useful proteins or metabolites. For basic studies, artificial chromosomes provide the means to generate chromosomes to specification that will facilitate the study of chromosome behavior and gene expression among other subjects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The  amount  of  arable  land  on  earth  has  been  static  for  some  time  but  the  global population  continues  to increase.  If the world standard of living is to remain as is or improve, the amount of food produced by agricultural endeavors will need to increase over the coming decades. Many new developments will be needed to address this issue but novel means of manipulating plant genomes is thought to be a major contributor to this   effort.   The   development   of   plant   artificial   chromosome   platforms   and   their enhancement might help with this problem. The procedures developed should be easily adapted to other plant species and thus can serve as a model system for transfer to them.  Training will involve diverse undergraduate and graduate students in plant genomics and biotechnology.  Information about this project and its outcomes can be accessed at the project website (http://maizeminichromosomes.missouri.edu) and MaizeGDB.  These include detailed information about project objectives, results, participants, publications as well as biological resources produced such as vectors and maize lines and the protocols used to generate them.

Such chromosomes are independent of the normal chromosomes and are designed to accept new genes that confer novel properties to corn plants. Two systems were developed for the addition of combinations of genes that might confer multiple traits to maize. One system was designed to combine individual genes on the order of 15 kilobase pairs of DNA each in subsequent additions to the chromosome. A second system was developed for the addition of large cargo to the artificial chromosome on the order of over 100 kilobases of DNA. Several tests of the system indicate that the frequency of integrations is extremely high and greatly exceeds the usual frequencies of transgene transformation of maize. The target sites for incoming DNA, the carrier constructs for adding new genes, and the site specific recombinase enzymes to catalyze the integrations into the target sites were all found to be functional in maize. All reactions needed for insertion by recombination were shown to occur and were validated by DNA sequence analysis. For the large cargo system, a supernumerary B chromosome was truncated by a transgene that carried a target site for acceptance of each large cargo. Thus, it can serve as a foundational chromosome to continure to add new genes, groups of genes, or chromosomal segments with sequential recombination events. A proof of concept that B chromosomes incorporated into haploid  inducer lines could be transferred to haploids as a means to introduce  transgenes into completely homozygous lines was conducted in the  project. The transfer is at  approximately 1/25 haploids. The  demonstration that B chromosomes can be transferred to haploids at a  workable frequency indicates that artificial chromosomes could potentially be placed with the included cargo into any maize line followed by  chromosomal doubling. This process would allow the introduction of the assembled artificial chromosome carrying genes for multiple traits into any desired variety of maize. In addition to the production of artificial chromosomes, the systems developed could be used for simply combining multiple genes or groups of genes at target sites in the genome with the initial transformation of such target sites.
