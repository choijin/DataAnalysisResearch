<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Education stakeholders from advocates to developers are increasingly recognizing the potential of science games in advancing student academic motivation for and interest in science and science careers. To maximize this potential, the project will use science games (e.g. Land Science, River City, and EcoMUVE), shown to be enjoyable to students and proven to promote student learning in science at the middle school level. Through a two-phase process, games will be used as vehicles for learning about ways to change how students think about science and potentially STEM careers. The goal of the intervention is to explore which processes and design features of science games will actually help students move beyond a temporary identity of being a scientist or engineer (as portrayed while playing the game) to one where students began to see themselves in real STEM careers.  Students' participation will be guided by teams of teachers, faculty members, and graduate students from Drexel University and a local school. All science students attending the local inner city middle school in Philadelphia, PA, will participate in the intervention.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Using an exploratory mixed-method design, the first two years of the project will focus on exploring, characterizing, coding, and analyzing data sets from three large games designed to help students think about possible careers in science.  During year 3, the project will integrate lessons learned from the first two years into the existing middle school science curriculum to engage students in a one-year intervention using PCaRD (Play Curricular activity Reflection Discussion). During the intervention, the PI will work with experts from Drexel University and a local school to collect data on the design features of Land Science to capture identity change in the science identity of the participating students. Throughout the course of year 3, the PI will observe, video, interview, survey, and use written tasks to uncover if the Land Science game is influencing students' identity in any way (from a temporary to a long-term perspective about being a scientist or engineer). Data collected during three specified waves during the intervention will be compared to analyses of existing logged data through collaborations with researchers at Harvard University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. These comparisons will focus on similar middle-aged science students who used the same gaming environments as the students involved in this study. However, the researcher will intentionally look for characteristics related to motivation, science knowledge, and science identity change.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will integrate research and education to investigate learning as a process of change in student science identity within situated environmental contexts of digital science gameplay around curricular and learning activities. This integrated approach will allow the researcher to explore how gaming is inextricably linked to the student as an individual while involved in the learning of domain specific content in science. The collaboration among major university and  school partners; the expertise of the researcher in educational psychology, educational technology, and science games; and the project's advisory board makes this a real-life opportunity for the researcher to use information that naturally exists in games to advance knowledge in the field about the value of gaming to changing students' science identities. It also responds to reports by the National Research Council committee on science learning and computer games, which identifies games as having the potential to catalyze new approaches to science learning.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This project was designed to further theoretical research, educational practice, curricular design, and assessment tools and techniques around learning as a process of identity exploration. To better meet the needs of lifelong learners in the 21st century, educational praxis must shift away from promoting learning as a process of passive knowledge accumulation towards the design of learning experiences that encourage reflexive adaptation to changing needs and context across their lives and careers. One way to promote these valuable skills is through identity exploration, a process by which learners actively connect domain or career-specific knowledge (i.e. STEM) to aspects of the self, and may gradually take steps to engage with and eventually acquire STEM majors and careers. This work furthers theoretical understanding, educational praxis, and research methodologies around identity exploration with the goal of making this process more accessible and widely used in learning contexts.  First, this project supported the development of a theoretical and pedagogical model for conceptualizing identity exploration processes that can be used by researchers and educational practitioners. The Projective Reflection (PR) model frames the way learners engage in self-transformation, or identity change, in a play-based course that leveraged a virtual learning environment as reflect on or demonstration of 1) domain-specific knowledge, 2) interests and valuing of the topic, 3) patterns of self-organization and self-control (i.e. goal-setting, monitoring progress, etc.), and 4) perceptions and definitions of self (i.e. desired future career).   This model informed the iterative design and implementation of both a virtual environment and a play-based course centered on supporting identity exploration processes related to environmental science and urban planning careers. Publications on this design process offer an example for educational designers and practitioners to develop their own virtual environments and in-class curricula that support identity exploration processes that are responsive to the needs of individuals, groups, and specific learning context. For example, we learned that optimal curricular designs and implementations 1) Provide multi-modal opportunities for students to engage, 2) Allow extra time to allow for student-led inquiry, 3) Ask reflection questions a variety of ways throughout a classroom experience to help students who may struggle with self reflection, and 4) Expect that not all students will conclude an experience wanting to become urban planners or environmental scientists, but will have engaged with the identity exploration process as a valuable 21st century skill. Assessments of student outcomes also offer insight into the ways learners engage in identity exploration processes over time. Though characteristics of a specific designed experience or student cohort may result in some differences in the overall identity exploration process, trajectories of identity exploration over time manifested as increasing and statistically significant change toward student discussions of their interest and valuing of a topic. Over time, students used science knowledge to achieve personally-relevant learning goals in the situated environment, and demonstrated more detailed awareness of the relevance and value of the topic for themselves in the present and future.    Processes of identity exploration as defined by Projective Reflection are most valuable when students can enact them in an integrated fashion; that is, when students can regularly connect Knowledge gains, emerging personal Interests and Values, the enactment of Self-organization and Self-control strategies, and specific Self-perceptions and Self-definitions in a domain.
