<AbstractNarration>In this project the Foundation for Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) will provide scholarships to 34 undergraduate students enrolled full time in the Computer Information Systems program. The primary goal of the project will be to retain students in STEM disciplines so that they are prepared to transfer to four-year institutions to continue their education. Towards that end scholars will be supported for up to three years of study with a scholarship amount of up to $7,000.  New agreements with the California State University system will provide an easy path of transfer from two-year to local four-year institutions offering degrees.  The project team will work with local and regional industrial concerns, and other educational institutions to secure industry internships and research internships to provide the S-STEM scholars with additional applied experiences and career pathways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The recruitment plan will include the SBCC counselor visiting each local high school to meet with students and counselors for recruitment of talented students. Upon being accepted, each student develops an educational plan that will enable them to complete their educational program. SBCC sets high standards for students and a detailed student support plan, grounded in the applicable research literature, will serve the scholars effectively through the delivery of strong support services (e.g. working as tutors, research experiences, and internships). A major strength of this project is the depth and breadth of the management team consisting of STEM faculty and staff members who are committed to ensuring the academic success of students. The diverse team includes several STEM faculty, one administrator, the director of financial aid, the local coordinator of the nation-wide Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement Program, three advising and counseling staff, and an SBCC Foundation staff member. Broad faculty support is evidenced in the plan for project implementation which also has the backing of the President of SBCC and the Executive Director of the SBCC Foundation. The Director of Institutional Assessment, Research, and Planning will be responsible for conducting the project evaluation, carrying out both formative and summative components. Formative evaluation data supplemented with student learning outcomes assessment data will inform the summative evaluation of the final project impact.  Dissemination will occur both within the institution and externally through sharing the results of the project at faculty and staff development meetings and with student groups as well as the other colleges and, at conferences, including the annual Student Success Conference, sponsored by the California Research and Planning Group.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The "Santa Barbara City College STEM Scholars" project was a National Science Foundation S-STEM (Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) project under solicitation NSF 12-529 at Santa Barbara City College (SBCC) in Santa Barbara, CA.  Under the project, scholarships were awarded to full-time STEM students beginning in Spring 2016 until Spring 2021.  Scholarship selection criteria were based on academic merit and scholarly potential.  Eligibility requirements included full-time status as a STEM major, US citizen or permanent resident status, having a minimum of four units completed at SBCC within the major, a minimum overall GPA of 3.0, and a minimum major GPA of 3.3.  Scholarship amounts were based on financial need and ranged up to $4,300 per semester.  STEM Scholars were supported through existing programmatic support and counseling structures, as well as early intervention initiatives at SBCC that were expanded during the project period.  Additional project activities included cohort networking and mentoring activities, professional development workshops, and additional research internship opportunities.  Additional opportunities, designed to increase transfer success for STEM Scholars, were provided through linking with collaborative S-STEM awards at other institutions.  SBCC STEM Scholars were enrolled in the following majors: Engineering, Physics, Computer Science, Chemistry, Biological Sciences, Mathematics, as well as Geosciences.  Of the 59 individual STEM Scholars, 25 (42%) identified as Hispanic, 26 (44%) identified as female, and 12 (20%) identified as female and Hispanic, compared to an overall student population at SBCC of 33% Hispanic and 53% female, with the latter being as low as 8% in some of the STEM majors funded under this project.  During the project period, 47 (80%) of the STEM Scholars graduated from SBCC, with 44 either transferring to and continuing their STEM education at a four-year institution or reporting employment in a STEM field; 3 scholars were actively continuing their education in a STEM field at SBCC at the end of the grant period; a total of 9 scholars (15%) left the program throughout the award period, of which 6 (10%) notably left the program by not continuing full-time enrollment, or not continuing enrollment at all, during the last three semesters of the project, which occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Prior to the pandemic, 54% of STEM Scholars reported that the project's financial scholarship support either allowed them to no longer needing to work outside of school or to be able to significantly reduce the number of hours worked outside of school per week, which enabled them to dedicate more time to their studies, having a direct and meaningful impact on their course success.  Some of this project's successful activities and intervention strategies, including mentoring support structures, networking opportunities, and course articulation initiatives, will be embedded into an on-going S-STEM award that is a collaborative effort between the University of California Santa Barbara and four regional community colleges, including Santa Barbara City College.
