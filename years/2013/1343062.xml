<AbstractNarration>1343062&lt;br/&gt;PI: Ardekani&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant supports travel of graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, junior faculty, and under-represented participants to attend the conference entitled ?Active Fluids: Bridging Complex Fluids and Biofluids? from January 27- February 1, 2014 at the Aspen Center for Physics, Aspen, Colorado. Research in active fluids is multidisciplinary, encompassing many branches in physics, mathematics, and engineering, including fluid mechanics, hard and soft condensed matter physics, polymer physics and engineering, continuum mechanics, complex fluids, biologically inspired engineering, statistical physics, and high-performance computing. The conference will foster cross-fertilization of ideas among researchers with an interest in the areas of complex and non-Newtonian fluids on one hand, and biological fluids on the other, within the common theme of active fluids. The schedule consists of informal in-depth lectures and discussions, with a large number of contributed oral and poster presentations. The scope includes but is not restricted to addressing questions such as: How to model active fluids? How to experimentally capture the range of time and length scales in prototypical active fluids? How to adapt these techniques to the study of active matter which typically requires resolution at both the nano scale and at the continuum level?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Approximately 85-100 participants in total are anticipated. The broader impacts of the Conference include forming a nucleus of new contacts and collaborations that could potentially result in future transformative works, raising awareness in a variety of key scientific communities regarding the state-of-the-art techniques with great potential in biofluidic studies, providing novel insights about the role of fluid dynamics in biomedical applications, and envisioning new scenarios to address environmental concerns.</AbstractNarration>
