<AbstractNarration>Many complex traits?those controlled by multiple genes?are often influenced by the environment, a phenomenon called phenotypic plasticity. In many cases, the relative importance of genes and environment (i.e., ?nature? and ?nurture?) is unclear. Furthermore, species, populations, and individuals often differ in their sensitivity to various environmental cues. Theoretical work has shown that such genetic variation for plasticity should have profound implications for the evolution of complex traits in complex environments. However, both the adaptive value of plasticity and the genes underlying plastic responses are poorly understood, largely due to a lack of empirical research on the subject. This project will measure natural selection on plasticity of glucosinolates, an important chemical defense against insect herbivores, in a wild herb. Glucosinolates and reproductive fitness will be measured in multiple lineages planted in four natural habitats and a variety of controlled conditions in the greenhouse. The PIs will then map genomic regions containing genes that affect the response of glucosinolate content to various environmental stimuli.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ?nature vs. nurture? debate is not only fundamental to the field of evolutionary genetics, but also directly relevant to current research in applied fields such as agriculture, medicine, and biodiversity conservation. Examples of partially plastic complex traits include crop pest resistance, human susceptibility to diseases such as cancer, and wildlife health and behavior. Understanding the genetic architecture and the evolutionary significance of plasticity will be especially important as the natural world adapts to a rapidly changing climate. Training of students will occur.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project successfully achieved four major research goals, exploring how genes and environment interact to shape plant behavior and reproductive success in natural environments. We conducted field and greenhouse experiments with the plant Boechera stricta, a wildflower in the mustard family that is native to the Rocky Mountains.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The first goal was to determine the impacts of genes and environment on two important plant traits: (1) glucosinolates, which are important defensive chemicals; and (2) the plant microbiome, or the community of bacteria living inside leaves and roots. To solve this problem, we planted several genetically-identical sets of plants in four different natural habitats in central Idaho. We then measured glucosinolate production in their leaves, and measured bacteria in leaves and roots using DNA sequencing. We found that glucosinolate content and leaf bacteria were both genetically controlled and strongly influenced by the environment; in fact, the effect of the plant&rsquo;s genes on these traits depended on the plant's habitat.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The second goal was to identify parts of the plant&rsquo;s environment that cause changes in important plant traits. To do this, we grew genetically-identical sets of plants in the greenhouse. Each plant was grown either in (1) potting soil that had been inoculated with soil microbes from one of four natural habitats, or (2) soil from one of four field sites that had been sterilized. This experiment allowed us to separately test the effects of (1) soil microbes and (2) soil chemistry/nutrition on flowering time and glucosinolate production. Surprisingly, we learned that soil microbes can speed up flowering by more than two days; soil chemistry also strongly affected both flowering and glucosinolates.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The third goal was to ask whether the ability to change glucosinolate content depending on the environment improved plants&rsquo; survival in landscapes with lots of environmental variation. We measured the strength and direction of natural selection on glucosinolate content in four field sites, and found that glucosinolate production changes between habitats, and usually moves in a direction that is favored by natural selection. This provides important evidence that plants that are more responsive to environmental variation (i.e., plants that have a more flexible or &ldquo;plastic&rdquo; phenotype) may be better able to survive environmental change or colonize new environments.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The final goal was to ask what consequences glucosinolate variation have on the rest of the plant&rsquo;s community. We focused on the bacteria and fungi living in the plant&rsquo;s leaves. To do this, we conducted a field experiment using B. stricta plants that had been bred to be almost completely genetically identical, except for a tiny group of genes that cause major differences in glucosinolate quality. This allowed us to directly test whether glucosinolate genes caused changes in the fungal microbiome. We collected hundreds of leaf samples from these plants at three field sites, and sequenced their DNA (which contains fungal DNA as well) to measure the fungal microbiome. Early results show that some leaf-dwelling fungi are quite sensitive to glucosinolate variation, indicating that the evolution of glucosinolates could have side-effects on other organisms in the community.</p> <p>Together, these results will impact the understanding of plant behavior and evolution in complex environments, which is of interest to ecologists and evolutionary biologists as well as agricultural researchers. Understanding how plants respond to environmental variation is especially important in this era of climate change, which threatens not only the survival of wild species but also agricultural productivity. The plant microbiome has been the focus of special interest from agricultural researchers because it can have drastic effects on plant growth, disease resistance, and yield. Our findings about the effect of plant genes on these microbial communities should aid future research about the evolution of plant microbiomes and possible ways to apply microbiomes to improve crop health.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>BROADER IMPACTS: This project provided valuable research experience to several undergraduate students. In particular, one student wrote an honors thesis describing experiments she completed as part of this larger project; she has graduated and is now employed as a STEM professional (research associate).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This project also gave co-PI Wagner, who was a graduate student at the time, an incredible opportunity to improve her skills in molecular biology and bioinformatics (the analysis of DNA sequence data). Those skills, and the success of this project, led her to successfully gain employment as a postdoctoral fellow at North Carolina State University, where she is researching the effects of modern breeding techniques on the corn microbiome, and continuing to add to her skill set.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Finally, during the course of this project, co-PI Wagner developed a classroom activity to introduce middle-school students to the evolution of plant defenses, including defensive chemicals like glucosinolates. She recruited other graduate students to present this activity at Lowe&rsquo;s Grove Middle School, a majority African-American and Hispanic school in Durham, NC.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/04/2016<br>      Modified by: Margaret&nbsp;Wagner</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1311440/1311440_10243168_1475612159430_blockatSIL_MRWagner--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1311440/1311440_10243168_1475612159430_blockatSIL_MRWagner--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Field Experiment"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1311440/1311440_10243168_1475612159430_blockatSIL_MRWagner--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Field Experiment"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Plants of known genetic makeup were planted in natural habitats in central Idaho.
