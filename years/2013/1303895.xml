<AbstractNarration>This proposal addresses the feedbacks between glacier erosion and glacier dynamics. It does so by measuring the spatial and temporal patterns of sediment erosion, properties of basal till, basal water pressure, basal motion, ice deformation, surface velocities, surface mass balance, and changes in surface elevation and terminus position. This will be accomplished through a comprehensive observational program using radio echo sounding, reflection seismics, borehole observations, GPS, satellite remote sensing, and airborne LiDAR and digital photogrammetry. All observations will be interpreted with the help of numerical models that explore the effects of changing boundary conditions and the longer term evolution, taking into account the effects of sediment excavation. The work will be carried out at Taku Glacier, Southeast Alaska where all relevant processes are currently active. This project will impact model studies on glacier and ice sheet evolution, as well as interpretations of sedimentary records from past glaciations.&lt;br/&gt;This proposal will be closely coordinated with activities of the Juneau Icefield Research Program, an annual educational program for high school and college students on the Juneau Ice field.</AbstractNarration>

This indicates that sediment deformation is actively occurring and does contribute to the downfjord transport of sediments, either towards the front of the glacier or towards loci of active subglacial fluvial erosion.   Understanding the evolution of a tidewater glacier thus presents an interesting coupled problem between glacier dynamics, sediment erosion and transport, and oceanography.
