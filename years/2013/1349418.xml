<AbstractNarration>This project has implications for increasing understanding of the primary geochemical variables influencing the potential toxicity of arsenic, a carcinogen, which exists in elevated levels in gold mine wastes throughout California and elsewhere.  Human exposure to fine-grained arsenic-bearing mine wastes through the inhalation pathway is a potentially significant exposure route about which little is known. Furthermore, airborne transport processes and risks posed by airborne mineral dusts are likely to grow in importance over time with increased land-use activity and climate change, which could result in larger, drier, hotter, and windier (semi-)arid regions where such mine tailings are located.  Careful physical and chemical characterization of the tailings, in vitro simulated inhalation studies, and in vivo bioavailability studies could greatly improve the ability to predict the toxicity potential of arsenic in respirable airborne particles. Results will be disseminated to relevant stakeholders impacted by the mine sites and may also lead directly to the development of remediation strategies in areas where arsenic contamination is cause for environmental concern.  This project will also entail the training of undergraduate students in independent and interdisciplinary research.  This project has additional potential implications for understanding how to more safely mine other elements, which is of global importance given the demand for elements (e.g. rare earths and precious metals) for critical technologies such as computers and cell phones.  Understanding the potential interaction of mine-produced dusts with animal models could provide a foundation of knowledge upon which to base practices for safer harvesting of earth resources.  Given this dimension, this project is being partially supported by the NSF Sustainable Chemistry, Materials and Engineering initiative.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The investigators propose a systematic, integrated, multidisciplinary approach to determine the relationships between particle size and the physical and geochemical properties of airborne particulate matter generated in contaminated mining environments in the north-central Mojave Desert. It is expected that these relationships will improve the ability to predict the bioavailability of arsenic in the airborne size fraction and to provide a sound scientific basis for the development of effective remediation strategies to control metal(loid) fluxes and exposures from these mine sites. This approach utilizes a combination  of macroscopic analyses of both physical and chemical properties of airborne particulate matter, synchrotron-based spectroscopic studies, simulated bioaccessibility extraction tests, and animal exposure experiments.  Such knowledge is applicable and expected to be transferable to other environmentally-contaminated regions where fine-grained dusts and their associated contaminants have the potential to be mobilized and inhaled, increasing exposure to residents/visitors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ People can be exposed to toxic chemicals when their activities disturb and resuspend dust from soil contaminated with toxic chemicals.  Inhalation of the contaminated dust will expose individuals to potential health effects.  This is the case when area in the vicinity of abandoned gold mines in California became the site of recreational off-road vehicle activity.  The natural presence of arsenic (As; a known toxic agent and carcinogen) in gold deposits has led to an environmental legacy of As contamination in abandoned gold mine tailings (processed ore) throughout the western United States.  Fine-grained As-bearing particles can become airborne by both wind and human activity. The environmental risk from inhaling such contaminated particles could be effected by particle size because those particles that can be respired (&le;10 &micro;m) and especially the even smaller particles (&le;2.5 &micro;m) can deliver As  deep into the lung cavity where it can be absorbed and translocated to sensitive tissues such as the heart, liver, kidneys and even the brain. The geochemical composition of respirable particles derived from mine tailings and the particle size are important characteristics that need to be understood in order to determine how these influence the uptake of As into critical organs, which is a necessary first step in better understanding the potential environmental, ecological and health risks associated with exposure to mine tailing dusts.   We performed a study in which we (1) collected bulk and size-fractionated airborne particulate dust generated by both off-highway vehicle (OHV) and simulated dust storm activity at abandoned gold mine sites in California; (2) perfomed geochemical and physical characterizations of collected dusts to determine trends/differences in elemental concentrations and? mass distributions with respect to particle size and method of dust generation; (3) identified specific As chemical species and their distribution as a function of particle size;  and (4) examined rats that inhaled dust from mine tailings and waste rock samples under controlled conditions in our laboratory to assess As release from particles in the lung and movement, or translocation, of As from the lung to the blood and its subsequent accumulation in sensitive organ tissues as well as determining the rates of elimination of As via urine and feces.  Our key finding was that As levels were elevated in the lung, blood and liver for up to 7 days after inhaling fine dust particles from mine tailings.  About 1/2 of the As was removed from the lung after 1 day, but the remaining As was removed more slowly taking about 6 days to remove 50% of the remaining lung burden. As from waste rock material was poorly absorbed and tissue distribution data were to variable to accurately establish uptake and retention rates.   Levels of As in kidney and heart were low and variable for both mine tailing and wast rock-derived particles.  The implications are that As from inhaled dust can be absorbed in the lung and will distribute to other organs, that As from processed materials, such as mine tailings that went through a gold extraction process might be more biologically available, and might present a higher level of environmental risk, than As from unprocessed rock, such as the waste rock used in this study.
