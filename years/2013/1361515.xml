<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Richard G. Finke of Colorado State University for research aimed at determining the best catalysts for the extraction of energy from sunlight. Conversion of solar energy to usable gaseous or liquid fuels is a central scientific challenge to the development of a secure, sustainable energy future. One promising and well-studied approach uses solar energy to split water into its constitutive components of hydrogen and oxygen. In using this approach, scientists are mimicking one of the basic processes of life in which plants extract the energy from light through photosynthesis. In the laboratory, solar energy is used to split a water molecule with the help of a catalyst that can release the water's hydrogen atoms from its oxygen atom, producing clean-burning hydrogen fuel plus a safe and useful byproduct, oxygen gas. This project is focused on the development of efficient water-splitting catalysts made from cobalt. These catalysts are some of the most promising ones available, due to their abundance, low-cost and superior water-splitting ability. The work is focused on more precisely understanding how these catalysts work and, in the process, is leading to the development of better and more efficient catalysts. The project is having a broad impact through the development and refinement of a potentially crucial energy technology and also through the training of a future generation of scientists.&lt;br/&gt;The research is considering, in particular, homogeneous cobalt polyoxometalates as water-splitting catalysts. The investigators are, first, focused on determining the nature of the true catalytic species, since prior results from their lab indicated that a heterogeneous cobalt oxide was actually the dominant catalyst.  Current research involves an alternative hypothesis that heterogeneous cobalt-oxide nanoparticles are the true catalysts, formed from cobalt polyoxometalates under the catalytic operating conditions and that those heterogeneous cobalt-oxide nanoparticles are a longer lived, more active and therefore superior class of water-oxidation catalysts. The ongoing research is helping to sort out these details and, therefore, contributing to the development of new and better catalysts for the splitting of water using solar energy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Mankind?s sustainable energy future will require the capture of solar energy, using that captured energy to split two water molecules into 4 electrons and 4 protons, and then recombination of those electrons and protons to make energetic fuels such as dihydrogen or methanol, the latter from carbon dioxide reduction.  A crucial, bottleneck process in this solar-energy capture and storage scheme is the challenge of finding suitable, cheap, earth-abundant catalysts for the chemically difficult step of water oxidation to release the required electrons and protons.  Cobalt polyoxometalates have been suggested to be a superior class of water-oxidation catalysts since a key paper in the journal Science in 2010. However, a main alternative hypothesis postulate investigated by this NSF grant is that cobalt polyoxometalates actually function by leaching cobalt(II) ion to then form cobalt oxide as the true water-oxidation catalyst. This alternative hypothesis and its careful investigation serve as the main intellectual merit of&mdash;that is, the generation of reliable knowledge by&mdash;the science supported by this NSF grant.   The broad impact of this NSF-funded research derives from the finding that all of the cobalt polyoxometalates examined do, in fact, leach cobalt(II) ion and, in turn, form cobalt oxide as the kinetically dominant, fastest water-oxidation catalyst under electrochemically driven conditions in phosphate or borate buffers. Hence, one main outcome of this research is the strong support for the alternative hypothesis that cobalt polyoxometalates are actually not a superior, sufficiently robust, nor sufficiently active, nor sufficiently long-lived class of the required water oxidation catalysts for solar energy conversion, at least presently.  This important finding in turn directs future work in three more efficient, more focused, and potentially more fruitful directions: away from traditional, unstable cobalt polyoxometalates, towards the possibility of new types of more robust, more stable cobalt and other first-row metal-containing polyoxometalates, and logically also towards catalysts formed from the leached cobalt(II) ion and oxidizing conditions, for example towards cobalt-oxide nanoparticle heterogeneous catalysts.   Another main outcome with broad impact is the teaching and training of researchers able to answer the challenging "who is the true catalyst?" question, a much broader question that extends to all of chemical catalysis. Catalysis is central to society and our modern way of life as the following quote from Chemistry and Industry (2002, Jan 21, p. 22) attests: "The economic impact of catalysis is as remarkable as the phenomenon itself.  Approximately one third of the material gross national product in the US involves a catalytic process somewhere in the production chain.  Confining analysis to the chemical industry, the proportion of processes using catalysis is 80%, and increasing&hellip;". Catalysis is said to contribute to products underlying an estimated 35% of the global GDP.  Because all the key properties of any catalyst&mdash;specifically the catalytic activity, selectivity, lifetime, isolation, regeneration and poisoning&mdash;depend in a fundamental way on the identity and chemical composition of the true catalyst, the ability to be able to identify the true, kinetically dominant catalyst for any catalytic reaction is critically important with a broad impact on society.
