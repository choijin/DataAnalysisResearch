<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Robert Mathers of the Pennsylvania State University at New Kensington will study pathways to synthesize polymers from renewable bio-based molecules that also display tunable physical properties and multiple modes of degradation.  First, combinations of atom efficient reactions will be linked together to synthesize monomers from bio-based reagents.  Then, the monomers will be polymerized using free-radical chemistry and the resulting polymers will be characterized.  The broader impacts of the project involve developing a teaching module targeted towards middle and high school students on the topics of sustainability, the use of renewable resources, physical properties of materials, and chemical reactions.  This module allows students to experience the concept of a sustainable material through the preparation of a degradable and non-toxic polymer based on glycerol and citric acid. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Plastics are long chain organic molecules and are found in many facets of everyday life, including food packaging, structural materials for automotive and aerospace transportation, and lightweight electronic devices.  At present, plastics are derived predominantly from petroleum based resources.  This research focuses on developing sustainable synthetic routes into plastics based upon bio-derived feedstocks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ New methods to address sustainability have become an increasingly important topic in society.  In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Robert Mathers of Penn State transformed molecules found in nature into sustainable polymers.  This strategy provided an alternative to petroleum-based chemicals and minimized the generation of chemical waste.   As shown in Figure 1, the first part of this research project investigated pathways to convert naturally occurring plant-based feedstocks into building block known as monomers.  These monomers were then assembled into polymers as depicted by the string of beads shown in Figure 1.  This research was inspired by the 12 Principles of Green Chemistry.  In the second part of this NSF funded research, a new method to describe certain physical properties, such as whether a molecule is considered hydrophobic (oil-like) or hydrophilic (water-like), addressed a knowledge gap in the area of sustainable materials.  These results provide a roadmap to choose the optimal building blocks in Figure 1.  Since many applications throughout science require hydrophobic molecules, these results have wide ranging implications.   In summary, we have addressed the global challenge of sustainability by providing new chemical building blocks. The broader impact involved a "hands-on" module to teach students about sustainability, the use of renewable resources, physical properties of materials, and chemical reactions.  This module allowed students to experience how to design a "sustainable material" with non-toxic components based on glycerol and citric acid.  Additionally, students learned how to think about the impact of their "sustainable material" and whether the material would degrade over time.
