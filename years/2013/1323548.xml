<AbstractNarration>This is an ethnographic study of the organic chemists and flavorists who develop, manufacture, and market synthetic flavorings.  Research will involve twelve months of multi-sited fieldwork in the United States and include from participant observation and 20-35 in-depth qualitative interviews.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will result in a dissertation and trained professional. The findings should be of value to food scientists and the food industry.</AbstractNarration>
