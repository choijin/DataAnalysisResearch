<AbstractNarration>***Technical Abstract***&lt;br/&gt;This award supports experimental research in the field of spintronics. The project will be pursued on two fronts. First, spin-dependent transport in coherent structures possessing tuneable interface discontinuities will be studied using variable-temperature magnetotransport measurements to analyze the electrical and thermal properties of the interface regions and their influence on modified spin current in the material. Second, magnon spin-current coupling between ferromagnetic (FM) and magnetic insulators (FI) will be examined using the same modalities. Since FM/FI interface coupling relies on fundamentally different physics from FM/FM coupling, its study represents a unique experimental opportunity. All samples and devices will be fabricated using epitaxial chemical vapor deposition, magnetron sputtering, and submicron lithography techniques. The proposed research not only will advance the theoretical development of spintronics, but also will serve to prototype the next generations of spin-based electronics. The project will provide students with opportunities to experience advanced spintronics research, and generate new basic knowledge on novel spintronic nanostructures that can be leveraged to develop potentially revolutionary devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;This award supports experimental research in the field of spintronics. The project seeks to exploit the unique aspects of the electron's spin to explore novel physical phenomena and to generate potentially revolutionary advancements in nanotechnology and solid-state electronic device design. The proposed research not only will advance the theoretical development of spintronics, but also will serve to prototype the next generations of spin-based electronics. The project will directly affect the local community via educational outreach activities targeted at women and minorities at the high- and middle-school levels, providing individuals from these groups opportunities to experience scientific research first-hand. These individuals and graduate students that will be funded under this proposal will form the next generation of spintronics researchers in the United States, The project will generate new basic knowledge on novel spintronic nanostructures that can be leveraged to develop potentially revolutionary devices for widespread implementation in multiple arenas including information technology, medicine, and education.</AbstractNarration>
