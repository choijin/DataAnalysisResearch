<AbstractNarration>This proposal provides travel support for the NSF's annual Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) Principal Investigators' (PI) meeting, to be held in Arlington, VA, on Oct. 17-18, 2013.  The CPS PI meeting is the flagship event for the NSF CPS program.  It is conducted annually, and provides an opportunity for all CPS PIs and co-PIs to interact with NSF, other government agencies, and industry.  This particular award is to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and will facilitate travel for the PIs and co-PIs of several CPS projects that are nearing completing.  The participation of these PIs in the meeting will be of great benefit to NSF and the broader CPS community, as they will be able to describe the successes of the most mature projects in the CPS portfolio, including recent science and technology breakthroughs as well as the broader impacts that are emerging.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The original purpose of this project was to provide travel support to attendees to the 2013 National Science Foundation (NSF) Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Program Principle Investigators (PI) Meeting who were in need of such support.  However, in subsequent years, the funding provided under this project was used to cover the travel expenses of some attendees to other NSF CPS PI meetings as well as to partially offset the travel expenses of student attendees from US universities who attended CPS-related conferences.  In particular, student attendees traveling to the conferences comprising CPS Week 2015, held in Seattle in April 2015, were supported, as well as student attendees traveling to the 2016 IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium (RTSS), held in Porto, Portugal in December 2016.  CPS Week 2016 was comprised of four conferences: the 18th ACM International Conference on Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control (HSCC), the  6th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Cyber-Physical Systems (ICCPS), the 14th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Information Processing in Sensor Networks (IPSN), and the  21st IEEE Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium (RTAS).  These are all top conferences in CPS-related fields.  RTSS is the premier conference in the area of real-time systems.  In total, travel awards were made to 38 people.
