<AbstractNarration>1336893&lt;br/&gt;PI: Wu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims at creating, tuning, and exploiting a variety of anisotropic interactions in colloidal particles by a combination that consists of varying geometric, compositional, and interfacial properties of the particles and an application of an external electric field. The objective is to use a complementary experimental and theoretical approach to elucidate the fundamental links between various types of microscopically anisotropic interactions and the resulting mesoscopically assembled phases. This fundamental understanding will also be used to develop a scalable process that integrates both electric and convective flow fields to build macroscopic functional coatings that exhibit novel optical properties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In-situ manipulation of the anisotropic interactions and dynamic pathways will typically lead to micro- and nano-structures with reduced symmetry and enhanced directionality. These structures can interact with a broad range of electromagnetic waves in unique ways and exhibit collective plasmonic, photonic, optoelectronic, and magneto-optical properties that are not manifested at the level of single particles. As a result, the scalable coating technique developed in this project could lead to economical fabrication of next-generation functional materials that have great potential in energy-related applications, such as high-efficiency solar cells, photonic crystals, and energy-saving displays. The research will be fully integrated with education and outreach efforts that consist of training public school teachers in the Denver area, developing the learning modules related to colloids, and participating in summer research program for high school students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Nature assembles relatively simple building blocks into well-defined structures of exquisite complexity and functionality. Acquiring a comparable skill by scientists is a highly desirable goal for efficient production of functional materials. In this project, we have fabricated micro-scale colloidal particles with asymmetric properties. By exploiting a variety of anisotropic interactions under an applied alternating electric field, we further studied the assembly behavior of these colloids in a previously formidable phase space and developed methods to build optically-active structures in a scalable fashion.</p> <p>We first studied the assembly of asymmetric polystyrene dimers under alternating current (AC) electric fields, where the dipolar interaction between particles depends on their relative orientations and frequency. At frequencies lower than two kilohertz, several lying dimers are attracted around a central standing dimer, resulting in close-packed clusters with chirality (Figure 1). When all dimers are aligned parallel with the field above a few kilohertz, there exists an apparent attraction between oppositely oriented standing dimers. Depending on particle concentration, small clusters, linear chains, square lattices, and frustrated triangular arrays that closely resemble antiferromagnetic lattices have been observed (Figure 2). The preferential association between oppositely oriented dimers can be attributed to a much weakened dipolar repulsion, compared with a pair of similarly orientated dimers. When the additional electrohydrodynamic attraction is taken into account, the overall pair interaction becomes attractive for oppositely oriented dimers, but remains repulsive between similarly oriented ones. Monte Carlo simulations faithfully reproduced different structures observed in experiments. The unique assembly mechanism found in this project can be well applied to other types of asymmetric particles under electric fields.</p> <p>We have also found that individual colloidal dimers with broken symmetry in geometry, composition, or interfacial charges can all propel in directions that are perpendicular to the applied AC electric field (Figure 3). The asymmetry in particle properties leads to an unbalanced electrohydrodynamic flow on two sides of the particles. Moreover, the propulsion direction, speed, and orientation of dimers can be conveniently tuned by frequency. Similarly, the propulsion direction of platinum-polystyrene dimers can be tuned via a competition between the electrohydrodynamic flow along the substrate and the induced-charge electroosmotic flow along the metallic lobe. The new propulsion mechanism revealed in this project is important for building intelligent colloidal motors that can capture, transport, and deliver micro- and nano-sized cargos. Since the strength and direction of electrohydrodynamic flow surrounding each lobe can be further tuned by surface charge and lobe size (Figure 4), we further demonstrated that, by manipulating these two parameters independently through rational design during the particle synthesis stage, monodisperse clusters with chirality can be fabricated from multiple active dimers, which have potential applications in directed-assembly and meta-materials with exotic properties. This method of assembly induced by hydrodynamic attractions distinguishes itself from conventional aggregation of passive particles induced by conservative forces. The ability to tune hydrodynamic flow at the sub-particle level allows a new type of directed-assembly that is not exhibited in many active systems including bacteria cells.</p> <p>In addition to experiments, we have also worked on the computational modeling of assembly of isotropic particles under confinement. In particular, we have discovered various kinds of crystalline lattices and structures via Monte Carlo simulations (Figure 5), which not only faithfully matched our previous experimental results, but also provided practical guidance for making novel types of metamaterials and quasicrystals experimentally. The scientific understanding gained from the above studies also allow us to develop an electric-?eld assisted coating technology to fabricate two-dimensional and non-close-packed colloidal arrays (Figure 6), which has the potential to be further adopted in a continuous convective assembly fashion for scalable production of two-dimensional particle arrays.</p> <p>Overall, the unbalanced electrohydrodynamic flow surrounding dimeric particles can be a universal phenomenon that is applicable for many other types of asymmetric particles, particulate clusters, or even chains of colloids. The chiral colloids developed by in this project can be used for making metamaterials, model systems for studying the separation of chiral molecules, and propellers for microscale transport. Our computational modeling of both dipolar interactions and electrokinetic flow will also result in a more accurate quantitative prediction of the impacts of particle size, volume fraction, salt concentration, and frequency, which play a crucial role in explaining various new phenomena related to particle assembly and propulsion.
