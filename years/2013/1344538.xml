<AbstractNarration>The interaction between Earth's interior and surface occurs through complex processes and over widely varying time scales. On the geological time scale, plate tectonics and mantle overturn govern the long-term evolution of the surface, atmosphere and ocean. Conversely, on the human time scale, the rapid efflux of CO2 from burning fossil fuels is possibly best mitigated by returning it as rapidly to the mantle, through carbon sequestration in mafic and ultramafic rocks. However, carbon-sequestration is only one of many climate-change mitigation strategies, and low-emission fuels like natural gas, which bridge the decades-long transition from traditional fossil fuels to renewable energies, are important as well. These complex issues can be treated commonly with a field of material physics called damage theory, i.e., to treat weakening and focusing of tectonic plate boundaries as well as microcracking in near-surface fluid-bearing rocks. This project continues development of one such theory called two-phase grain-damage theory. This theory simply states the energy going into damage is deformational work that is stored as surface energy on micro-crack surfaces and/or the boundaries between mineral grains.  In particular, plate-generation and early plate tectonic and surface evolution will be studied using grain-damage theory, since grain-reduction during deformation (as in field observations of rocks called mylonites) is likely important for generating weak plate boundaries.  This project will seek to answer how grain-damage combines with other effects such as mantle melting and petrological changes at plate boundaries, which are important for understanding how plate tectonics originated in the ancient Archean Earth.  Secondly, two-phase "micro-crack" damage with chemical reactions will be used to address mineral carbon sequestration in mantle derived (mafic and ultramafic) rocks, along with development of transitional energy such as shale-gas. Questions we seek to answer are how carbonation reaction affects damage (e.g., stress crack-corrosion), and how chemical reactions, grain growth and permeability evolution influence seismicity during fluid injection? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves a fundamental theory that contributes to many problems of geological and environmental fluid mechanics, rock mechanics, material science (e.g., metallurgy), climate-change and energy. Although the topics of plate tectonic evolution and energy transitions cover disparate geological and human time-scales, they are approachable with similar scientific advancements. Moreover, the long-term evolution of the Earth can inform us how to mitigate short-term imbalances. For example, reducing anthropogenic CO2, without pushing the problem onto future generations, requires a geologically long-term solution, and is therefore best addressed by mimicking the Earth's natural surface evolution and cycles.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The interaction between the Earth's plate tectonic activity and climate occurs through various processes and over a wide range of time scales.  On the geological time scale, the plate tectonic cycle buffers CO2 through mountain building and weathering, providing Earth with a temperate climate.  The operation of plate tectonics, however, is not impervious to climatic conditions.  Although liquid water is thought necessary to lubricate plate tectonics, recent theories suggest that a cool surface promotes plate-tectonic-like mantle flow on Earth (but not on Venus).  On the human time scale, the rapid efflux of carbon from burning fossil fuels is possibly best mitigated by effectively returning CO2 to the mantle, i.e., by carbon sequestration in metal-rich volcanic (mafic and ultramafic) rocks.  Such processes of mantle-climate interaction, whether natural or man-made, involve complex physics of rock-fluid interaction and how rock grains evolve with time.  This project involved development of ``damage" theories of  how mantle rocks flow and deform and give rise to plate tectonics, and also allow us to understand how fluids injected underground interact with their bedrock.     A major project outcome was continued development for a theory for how rock grains evolve during deformation, which gives a predctive model for how Earth developed its unique form of plate tectonics.  Mineral grains in rocks can become smaller when the rock is deformed under the driving force of mantle convection (wherein hot material rises, cold material sinks), and this causes the rock to get weaker.  The weakness causes more rapid deformation and thus drives the grains to smaller sizes, and causes even more intense and focussed weakness.   Such a weakening feedback is what allows plate tectonics to form, since plate boundaries are very narrow focussed weak zones on which all the activity (volcanoes, earthquakes) occurs, while the plate interiors are vast and strong and barely deform.  However, damage is offset by healing of rocks, which takes place if the grains grow (much as bubbles in foam will eventually grow), and healing depends on temperature of the rocks in the near surface (hotter temperatures lead to faster healing).  The theory developed allows us to apply the basic physics of how rock grains at a sub-millimeter scale grow, deform and even mix with each other in order to understand the evolution of massive tectonic plates as well as entire planets.  We have even applied this theory to understand how plate tectonics first formed 4 billion years ago on Earth (but not Venus), and how cold subducting slabs, which sink into the mantle and drive plate tectonics, can rapidly break off and change how the plates move or collapse.    A second major outcome is understanding how rocks are damaged when fluid is injected into them, as might occur in storage of CO2,  or extraction of unconvential fuels (i.e., by "fracking").  Without damage fluid gradually diffuses into rock pore spaces. But with damage the rock near the injection site tends to be more easily deformed and absorbs more fluid, and less leaks away, which is important for storage technology.  Similar physics has been used to understand how magma is stored and transported in the surface below volcanoes, and then how the volcanoes erupt and oscillate prior to eruptions.
