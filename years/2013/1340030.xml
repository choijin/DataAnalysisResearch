<AbstractNarration>This project will measure, map and analyze economic forms of production, consumption, exchange, finance, and governing of common resources that pursue social and environmental sustainability associated with the broad range of activities known as "the solidarity economy."  Organizations participating in the solidarity economy are considered to be those that prioritize ethical commitment to cooperation, democratic participation, ecological resilience and social inclusion.  Examples of organizations in this group include worker cooperatives, such as Cooperative Home Care Associates in the Bronx and Isthmus Engineering and Manufacturing in Wisconsin; consumer cooperatives, such as REI and Lancaster Farm Fresh; community land trusts, such as the Champlain Housing Trust in Vermont; credit unions; food cooperatives; and other enterprises, such as Wikipedia and local bike-sharing programs.  This interdisciplinary research project will gather information about the solidarity economy in the United States, with its core hypothesis being that the U.S. solidarity economy has substantial and often unrecognized impacts on local communities in terms of increasing economic activity, employment, well-being, and overall socio-environmental sustainability.  The investigators will use mixed methods from geography, economics, and other social sciences, including geographic information system-based analyses, surveys, in-depth interviews, and economic impact modeling.  They expect to produce the first estimate of the spatial distribution, economic output, and locally significant influences associated with the solidarity economy in the U.S., both nationally and at local levels in Philadelphia, New York City, and Massachusetts. The project will make available a website for research, education, and participatory mapping of the solidarity economy, and it will generate a guide to enable replication of the analysis across the country by researchers, community groups, and policymakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will establish the groundwork for the solidarity economy as a new object of geographic, economic, and social research in the U.S., and it will develop methods for analysis of its nature and influence.  The mapping and measurement of the role of the solidarity economy will help identify place-based strategies for local economic development.  Project findings will contribute to efforts to create more socially and environmentally sustainable economic institutions that produce equity alongside jobs, goods, and services. With local community members participating in the project as researchers along with senior researchers and both graduate and undergraduate students, the project is expected to yield new insights regarding the efficacy with which solidarity economy organizations generate solutions to the pressing social problems of inequality, unemployment, and ecological unsustainability.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project Collaborative Research: Mapping the US Solidarity Economy aimed to ontologically produce solidarity economy in the United States as an object of theory, policy, and action. The solidarity economy (SE) is a term used worldwide to describe economic institutions, practices, and relationships that emphasize cooperation over competition as well as normative commitments to workplace democracy, social inclusion, and equity. Such organizations include, among others, community supported agriculture (CSA), worker and consumer cooperatives, limited equity housing cooperatives, credit unions, time banks and freecycle networks, community land trusts, and community gardens. Many elements of SE exist throughout the United States but they are not linked together and receive little attention from academics and policy makers. The overarching goal of this project was to develop a topology of the American SE, discover, map, measure, analyze its geographic distribution, and assess its impact on regional economies and communities. We have hypothesized that SE has a substantial and often unrecognized significance and positive impact on the cities and regions in which it is located, in terms of increasing economic activity, employment, well-being, and overall socio-environmental sustainability.</p> <p>Our research was an interdisciplinary collaboration across three sites&mdash;Worcester Massachusetts (and surrounding region), Philadelphia Pennsylvania, and New York City. In each location we gathered quantitative, spatial, and qualitative data about a range of economic organizations and practices that we have identified as SE. Further, we examined how different SE sectors are distributed across geographies of race, class, and gender. Additionally, we set out to reveal the national footprint of the SE by creating a national database and a searchable public mapping platform for researchers, policy-makers, SE participants, and interested publics nationally and across the globe.</p> <p>Hunter College team (myself, five funded graduate student research assistants, and many more undergraduate and graduate students whom I taught and mentored over the course of the project) participated in two major tasks. The first was to create and analyze the national database of SE that would become a basis for the public on-line mapping platform (<a href="http://www.solidarityeconomy.us/">www.solidarityeconomy.us</a>). Because no single registry of SE exists, we searched for, acquired from various sources, and merged many disparate datasets. While our database does not embrace the entirety of SE, it contains over 25,000 entries including credit unions, limited equity housing cooperatives, worker cooperatives, land trusts, community gardens, food cooperatives, advocacy groups, and other components. We analyzed national spatial patterns of these segments with respect to census data. We found, for example, that credit unions (not-for-profit financial institutions owned by their members) in the United States compare in their number to private banks and about 60% of the US adult population has membership in a credit union. In the years prior to the financial crisis of 2008, credit unions diverged from the overall trend towards aggressive and predatory lending because their mandate prioritizes interests of members-owners over profit maximization.</p> <p>The second task was to examine in depth, together with Drew University team, the geography of selected components of SE in New York City, a major center of capitalist economy and finance which also features, as we found, a significant concentration of the SE. We mapped and analyzed the characteristics of New York&rsquo;s credit unions and limited housing cooperatives. Credit unions, we found, offer the benefits of secure and ethical banking to a whole range of communities and groups, from municipal and United Nations employees to members of small parishes of black churches throughout the city. Their assets, however, differ widely depending on the type of the common bond which often determines the relative wealth of their membership. Policy support for credit unions in low-income and minority neighborhoods, therefore, would help spread around the benefits of ethical finance which are now mainly accessible, at least in NYC, to professional and middle class households. We also conducted a survey of NYC worker cooperatives which embrace the majority of the US worker-owners. We found that worker-owners in the city are overwhelmingly women of color.
