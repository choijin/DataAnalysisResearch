<AbstractNarration>This project is providing professional development activities to improve the quality and relevance of a community college bioscience education. Development of the program leverages two ATE Centers' expertise in professional development activities, NBC2 and Bio-Link. Biotechnology program leaders from the three partner colleges are leading the hands-on, "boot camp" laboratory component of the project. Following the boot camp the fellows participate in industry internships, and develop industry-relevant curriculum. Project collaborators supporting internships include Wake Forest University, Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, Joint School of Nanoscience &amp; Nanoengineering and Gateway University Research Park, University of North Carolina at Greensboro, David H. Murdock Research Institute, North Carolina Research Campus, Banner Pharmacaps Inc., Biogen Idec, Cook Medical, Targacept, Tengion, and TransTech Pharma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program is (1) helping instructors contextualize learning by providing real-world exposure through guided, hands-on internships in authentic bioscience industry/organizational settings; (2) demonstrating key competencies and critical bioscience workforce skills to help instructors prepare students for technical coursework geared to industry standards; (3) making meaningful associations between classroom and workplace by producing inquiry-based curriculum materials that integrate valid bioscience concepts and processes; (4) enabling instructors to generate a better-prepared workforce and highlight new career opportunities; and (5) producing a replicable model for adoption by community colleges across the country.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this initiative include developing and implementing an innovative professional development model that (1) utilizes multi-institutional partnerships to enable high-impact instructors to further understand industry principles and prepare them to guide their students toward careers in today's workforce; (2) generates and sustains collaborations among community colleges, research universities and industry to increase successful participation in technology preparation programs; (3) promotes significant and lasting improvements in the educational community's ability to meet regional workforce goals; and (4) encourages presentations at appropriate conferences and provides for replication at other community colleges across the country.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Launched in 2014, the Biosciences Industry Fellowship Program equipped 58 exemplary STEM instructors and returned veterans ( Fellows),  in six cohorts, from 42 colleges and high schools representing 18 states and three internationals, for an incredible experience that was either three or four weeks in duration of exposure to prominent biosciences assets of NC.  Thirteen companies, nine institutions and five colleges opened their doors to the Fellows. The Fellows had a wide variety of experiences which included laboratory sciences, research and development, regenerative medicine including stem cell growth, nanotechnology, medical device manufacturing; regulatory affairs, good manufacturing practices, and clinical trial methodology. These were hands on labs or lectures or participation in outcome problem solving.    Fellows were exposed to skills, equipment use and the diversity of bioscience career pathways. Fellows were then asked to present power point modules on their experiences. They were also asked to make a professional development presentation or seminar back at their institution to colleagues. Finally, they were to integrate their experiences into their curriculum.  The Fellows program meets an unmet need. It gives instructors first hand exposure to industry. Most instructors who came through the program had little to none exposure to industry.  The BIFP program  was an intense exposure focused on what industry needs in its future employees, i.e., the Fellow's students.   The Fellows self - reported they throughly enjoyed the BIFP program.
