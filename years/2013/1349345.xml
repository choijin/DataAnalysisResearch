<AbstractNarration>An award is made to the University of Florida to curate, digitize, and consolidate specimens and data housed at the McGuire Center of Lepidoptera and Biodiversity at the Florida Museum of Natural History (FLMNH). The McGuire Center houses one of the world's largest collections of butterflies and moths, including numerous scientifically important specimens. Although professional collectors developed much of the collection, many specimens came from amateur scientists and have not been properly curated or integrated into the collection. The results of this project will increase the accessibility of specimen data, making them available via the Internet to be utilized by a wide audience of scientists, educators and students. Undertaking and completing this project represents an important first step in reorganizing specimens and digitizing much of the data representing Florida's native butterflies and related organisms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Several outreach and educational activities using the collection's charismatic holdings will be developed and will include minorities and groups underrepresented in STEM programs. Existing programs at the FLMNH, such as the Summer Junior Volunteer Program, will be leveraged and will include programs for enthusiast groups, elementary school groups, and high school students. Additionally, high school, undergraduate, and graduate students will be trained in research and curatorial techniques using collections digitized in this project.

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The McGuire Center for Lepidoptera and Biodiversity (MGCL) at the Florida Museum of Natural History (FLMNH) on the University of Florida campus is one of the world&rsquo;s largest and most active centers for butterfly and moth research. The collection continues to expand rapidly via significant donations from amateur and professional lepidopterists, but many of these valuable collections remained in original storage boxes and had not been properly integrated. Before this CSBR project began, only about 2.7% of the entire collection had been databased or digitized, with remaining specimen data hidden and largely inaccessible to the global scientific community. This project significantly increased the accessibility and visibility of the MGCL. Approximately 600,000 new specimens from private collections were added to the holdings of the MGCL within the years of this project. The project allowed the smooth integration of these specimens into the museum&rsquo;s main collection, and specimens stored in substandard cardboard boxes or papered were prepared and transferred into appropriate museum drawers. The new specimens were curated with help from a community of taxonomic experts, and over half were digitally imaged through two imaging stations that were set up through this grant. The project also helped develop a much-needed new Specify database which allows users to quickly determine which specimens are in the collection and access specimen-related data. The project also acquired freezers that enabled the assembly of a DNA tissue collection, that now exceeds 50,000 specimens. More than ten research papers were written from direct activities stemming from the project. Students of all stages of schooling (high school, undergraduate, graduate students, postdocs) and volunteers from many demographic backgrounds helped pin, label, digitize and curate the collection, allowing them a window into natural history museums and education of organismal biology.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/17/2018<br>      Modified by: Akito&nbsp;Y&nbsp;Kawahara</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1349345/1349345_10303026_1510152246771_MGCL1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1349345/1349345_10303026_1510152246771_MGCL1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="MGCL_Curation"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1349345/1349345_10303026_1510152246771_MGCL1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="MGCL_Curation"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Curation by students and staff at the MGCL</div> <div class="imageCredit">Andrew Warren</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Akito&nbsp;Y&nbsp;Kawahara</div> <div class="imageTitle">MGCL_Curation</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1349345/1349345_10303026_1510152310712_MGCL2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1349345/1349345_10303026_1510152310712_MGCL2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="MGCL_curation2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1349345/1349345_10303026_1510152310712_MGCL2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="MGCL_curation2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Curation of moth specimens in the McGuire Center collection</div> <div class="imageCredit">Andrew Warren</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Akito&nbsp;Y&nbsp;Kawahara</div> <div class="imageTitle">MGCL_curation2</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
