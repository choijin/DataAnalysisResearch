<AbstractNarration>The goal of the Kalamazoo Scholars Program is to improve the success of students who are traditionally-underrepresented in STEM and to increase the diversity of the scientific workforce. The program builds on Kalamazoo College's success in attracting and retaining students in the natural sciences and mathematics and seeks to increase the likelihood that first-generation and underrepresented minority students with financial need will pursue careers and advanced degrees in STEM. To achieve these objectives, Kalamazoo College will award scholarships and provide academic and professional development support to two cohorts of 12-13 students majoring in biology, chemistry, mathematics, computer science, physics, or engineering. Students in the program will have academic experiences common to all Kalamazoo students: broad training in the liberal arts, international engagement, in-depth study in an academic major, and a capstone research experience. In addition, Kalamazoo Scholars will engage in research-based practices shown to increase the persistence and success of students in STEM, beginning with a pre-orientation program, a "Science in the World" first-year seminar cluster, and peer mentoring, and continuing with weekly mentoring lunches with faculty, STEM leadership activities, early research experiences, internships and other career and professional development activities. The leadership experiences embedded in the program will also influence other STEM students on campus and younger students, often underrepresented minorities, in the community.</AbstractNarration>

The Kalamazoo Scholars:  Attended an orientation week program of cohort building and learning how to learn event.  Participated in weekly peer mentoring activities and weekly meetings with the faculty PI and co-PIs. The weekly meetings included presentations from offices on campus, like the Center for Career and Professional Development. Were encouraged to engage in optional experiential education programs (career internships, early research experiences, service-learning, study abroad, student professional organizations, etc.)  Were supported in pursuit of internships, externships, and summer research both by programming and available funding through the S-STEM grant. Received academic support through the PI and co-PIs on the grant and paid tutors.   In the Kalamazoo Scholars Program, two cohorts of 12 students started in the program, in Fall 2014 and 2015. Of the 24 students who started the program as entering first-years, 12 completed STEM degrees at Kalamazoo. Scholars who left the program were replaced with other eligible students.
