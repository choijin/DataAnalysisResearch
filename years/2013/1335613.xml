<AbstractNarration>CBET-1335613&lt;br/&gt;Daniel Giammar&lt;br/&gt;Washington University in St. Louis&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Chromium(VI) is a toxic contaminant that has been observed in private and public water supplies as well as in treated drinking water.  Current drinking water standards are only applicable to total chromium, which can be present as chromium(VI) as well as the much less toxic form of chromium(III) that is even a nutrient at low concentrations.  It is likely that new drinking water standards specific to chromium(VI) will be implemented, and iron electrocoagulation is a technology with the potential to achieve the low concentrations that may be required.  In iron electrocoagulation a direct current is applied between two iron electrodes.  One of the electrodes is oxidized to release iron(II) to solution, and this soluble iron(II) can directly reduce chromium(VI) or be oxidized to iron(III) to produce iron oxide solids on which chromium(VI) can be reduced and adsorbed.  Iron electrocoagulation for chromium(VI) removal has multiple removal pathways that involve homogeneous and heterogeneous chemical reduction, adsorption, and co-precipitation.  The primary objective of this research project is to advance the mechanistic understanding of chromium(VI) removal by iron electrocoagulation.  The project will evaluate electrocoagulation performance over a broad range of water chemistry conditions in a laboratory-scale electrocoagulation reactor.  Analytical methods will track changes in both total dissolved chromium and chromium(VI) to the very low levels that are being considered for regulations.  The investigation will use advanced spectroscopic and stable isotope tools to identify the dominant reaction mechanisms occurring in the electrocoagulation reactor.  X-ray absorption spectroscopy, which will be performed at national user facilities, will provide insights into the oxidation state and molecular-scale coordination of chromium associated with the solids generated in the reactor.  Stable isotope fractionation of chromium can be diagnostic of specific reaction mechanisms.  A mathematical model for electrocoagulation performance will integrate the mechanistic insights and data from the laboratory-scale experiments to enable predictions of performance over a broad range of conditions.  The research will enable the optimal design of treatment strategies and accurate prediction of treatment performance for chromium(VI) removal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide scientific information that will help improve the removal of hexavalent chromium, a contaminant of critical national interest, from drinking water.  The research will determine the influence of water chemistry on the reactions involved in the process, which will enable the design of effective strategies for chromium(VI) removal for a broad range of drinking water sources.  The research activities will determine reaction mechanisms of interest in environmental engineering as well as earth science and materials science.  The project's overall application of spectroscopic characterization and stable isotope tools will advance the overall infrastructure for environmental engineering research.  The educational and outreach components of the project will enhance graduate and undergraduate teaching and promote early student interest in science and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  This project applied advanced characterization tools and process modeling to elucidate mechanisms controlling the removal of Cr(VI) from water over a broad range of conditions.  The key process in Cr(VI) removal during iron electrocoagulation was determined to be chemical reduction by Fe(II), and adsorption of Cr(VI) in the process was minimal.  The rate of reduction was significantly faster when Fe(II) reduction could occur on a solid substrate, and this enhancement was demonstrated with a model that we developed for the dynamics of iron electrocoagulation.  Dissolved oxygen had a pH-dependent effect on Cr(VI) removal, and natural organic matter affected both Cr(VI) removal rates and the colloidal stability of the particles produced.  The project advanced the infrastructure for environmental engineering research through the development of collaborative relationships to pursue mechanistic insights with an array of microscopic and spectroscopic techniques that included X-ray absorption spectroscopy.  Successful proposals for beamtime at national synchrotron user facilities were critical to identifying the molecular-scale structure of Cr(III) and Fe(III) in the solids that were produced.   Broader Impacts: New modules on water treatment were developed and offered to elementary school students in a summer science academy.  The research results were the foundation for a new experiment in a laboratory course and refinement of redox chemistry presentation in a lecture-based course.  The project was integral to the training of one U.S. doctoral student, one international visiting student, one post-doctoral researcher, and it provided a research experience for three undergraduate students and one high school student, including several members of underrepresented groups in engineering.
