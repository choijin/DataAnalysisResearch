<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award supports theoretical and computational research and education, aimed at advancing the understanding of emergent quantum phenomena in materials with strongly interacting electrons. Strongly correlated metals behave differently from ordinary metals such as aluminum or copper because the electrically charged mobile particles of which they consist are unlike ordinary electrons. When an electric current or thermal heat flow travels through an ordinary metal, to a first approximation the electrons can be treated as moving independently and interacting only very weakly with each other. However, when a current travels through a strongly correlated metal, the electrons lose their individuality and form collective excitations. Accordingly, researchers call such strongly correlated metals "strange metals." A classical analogy of a collective behavior is the complex pattern of a flying flock of birds, seemingly behaving as one unit despite comprising thousands of individual birds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A fascinating class of strange metals is harbored by the so-called "heavy fermion" materials, in which the interactions between the constituent particles are so strong that they acquire a very heavy mass, sometimes several hundred times greater than that of a bare electron. As a result of this heaviness, many material properties, including electrical and thermal conductivity, are profoundly affected. Unfortunately, the very feature that makes these materials so interesting - strong interactions between electrons - also makes them very challenging to study. This research activity is aimed at developing new, innovative theoretical and computational methods to study the electronic properties of the heavy fermion materials. In addition, the PI will combine existing methods of quantum chemistry with the state-of-the-art computational techniques to capture the salient features of these materials, in particular the interplay between magnetic and various interesting quantum mechanical properties such as the ability of materials to conduct electricity without any loss of power, called superconductivity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will allow the PI to integrate educational and outreach activities with the fundamental research. The educational component will include participation in a continuing education course for in-service teachers, with the ultimate goal of helping enrich the middle- and high-school curricula with modern physics content, centered on the concepts of magnetism and superconductivity that are central to this research. This award will also support the education of a graduate student and a postdoctoral research associate at the frontiers of condensed matter theory. It will partially support a broad outreach effort aimed at showcasing the role of electromagnetic forces in modern physics. It will reach out to the general public and schoolchildren with the goal of popularizing science and increasing public awareness of its importance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This CAREER award supports theoretical research in the so-called strange metal (non-Fermi liquid) behavior in heavy fermion materials, in particular close to quantum phase transition from a magnet to an ordinary metal. Recent experimental advances have identified a number of materials in which the quantum criticality cannot be understood in terms of the established Hertz-Millis theory. In addition, new quantum phases often emerge in the vicinity of a quantum transition, such as unconventional superconductivity whose mechanism is not completely understood. These problems will be studied in the present research program, whose objectives are fourfold: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) To analyze the nature of the strange metal state in heavy fermion materials by using a combination of quantum chemistry and existing state-of-the-art techniques to capture strong electron interactions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) To develop novel methods to treat strong electron correlations, in particular in proximity to quantum criticality. One promising approach that the PI will develop is the large-N slave-fermion approach using SU(N) Schwinger boson representation for localized moments. This approach has been demonstrated to perform well for a single Kondo impurity and the ultimate goal is to make it work for a dense Kondo lattice, which describes the low-energy sector of heavy-fermion materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(3) To address new quantum phenomena emerging from this proximity, in particular the unconventional superconductivity and its interplay with magnetism. The PI will employ the variational cluser approximation, which is particularly well suited to study ordered phases. The large-N slave-fermion approach, to be developed in (2) will also be used. The results of various methodologies will be compared to experiment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(4) Qualitatively, the heavy fermion systems can be understood in terms of the so-called Doniach phase diagram, describing the suppression of magnetic Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction between localized moments by the Kondo screening. At the same time, it has long been known that magnetic frustrations can also destroy long-range magnetic order. Recently, several researchers, including the PI, have proposed to combine these two mechanisms into a generalized phase diagram, pertinent to a number of recently discovered heavy fermion materials. The PI will study the interplay between magnetic frustrations and the Kondo effect using a variety of approaches, including the aforementioned large-N slave-fermion method. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will allow the PI to integrate educational and outreach activities with the fundamental research. The educational component will include participation in a continuing education course for in-service teachers, with the ultimate goal of helping enrich the middle- and high-school curricula with modern physics content, centered on the concepts of magnetism and superconductivity that are central to this research.

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This research has been devoted to understanding the properties of a class of materials where the interactions between electrons lead to nontrivial consequences, such as resulting in unconventional phases and superconductivity. One of the focal points of this research have been heavy fermion materials, so called&nbsp;because the electrically charged particles of which they consist, the fermions, are unlike ordinary electrons. The interactions between them are so strong that the particles acquire a heavy mass, often several hundred times greater than that of a bare electron. This heaviness profoundly affects many material properties. In particular, the electric current and thermal heat flow differently through these materials at low temperatures, compelling researchers to call them "strange metals." Understanding the nature of such a metallic state and the emergent quantum phases, such as unconventional superconductivity, is one of the major unsolved problems in condensed matter physics.&nbsp;</p> <p>One of the subjects of this research is on topological aspects of unconventional superconductivity. The PI was the first to realize, in a paper published in 2015, that the superconducting order observed in the heavy fermion material UPt<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;has nontrivial topology realized by the way in which the superconducting gap "winds around" the Fermi surface of this material. The superconducting order parameter has vanishing points (nodes), and&nbsp;&nbsp;this realization had led to the concept of topologically nontrivial nodal superconductors, developed simultaneously by the PI and independently by other researchers. We later showed that nodal topological superconductivity can also be realized in a broad class of cubic materials with biquadratic touching of bands, as realized for instance in the half-Heusler family of intermetallic compounds. One member of this family, YPtBi, was shown to superconduct, and our recent work published in 2019 raises the possibility that this superconducting state is in fact topological in nature.</p> <p>Another important branch of this research focused on the question of how the magnetism arises from strong electron correlations. In particular, when electron spins cannot satisfy all the magnetic interactions among them, this leads to the so-called magnetic frustration in the system. To elucidate the effect of magnetic frustrations on the electronic properties, we have studied the role of frustrations in a broad class of iron-based superconductors, first discovered in 2008. To this end, we have developed a unified spin model, based on effective spin-1 degrees of freedom on iron sites, that describe very well the different families of iron-based superconductors. A specific prediction of our model is that one material in particular, iron selenide FeSe, realizes a rather unusual form or magnetic ordering -- quadrupolar order. This subtle order is difficult to detect, nevertheless there is mounting experimental evidence that such quadrupolar order is indeed realized in FeSe. The relationship between this finding and the high-temperature superconductivity in this class of materials is the subject of ongoing research.</p> <p>The aforementioned study on FeSe has led us to examine an effective spin-1 model on a square lattice more broadly, and we have reached an unexpected and at first surprising conclusion: unlike its spin-1/2 counterpart, the interactions between spin-1 moments may have a higher degree of magnetic frustration. In a paper published recently in October 2019, we demonstrate that these frustrations can in fact be so strong, that they preclude the possibility of forming a magnetic ground state, and the system settles instead into a liquid-like state, where the spins are only correlated with one another at short distances. Our discovery is an example of a quantum spin liquid -- a long sought-after exotic state of matter that was believed, until our work, to arise primarily in spin-1/2 systems. Research is underway to test the possibility of such a quantum spin liquid occurring in other models. In particular, the PI was part of a collaboration with experimental colleagues at Rice University who had recently discovered a quantum spin liquid candidate in an&nbsp;<em>f</em>-electron material Ce<sub>2</sub>Zr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>&nbsp;(published in Nature Physics, 2019), which marked an important breakthrough.&nbsp;</p> <p>The principal outreach component of this project was to help create a planetarium show on the theme of magnetism with the goal of addressing very wide audience in popularizing the basic science behind the PI's research.&nbsp;The planetarium show "Magnetism," funded by NASA and NSF, was produced in collaboration with Houston Museum of Natural Science and digital graphics company Evans &amp; Sutherland in 2017 and appeared in the planetariums across the nation in 2018-2019.&nbsp;As part of the broader impacts, the PI has also incorporated the active learning techniques and flipped classroom setup into the upper undergraduate curriculum (Quantum Mechanics course taught at Rice University), and developed a new graduate course on topological physics, to reflect the growing interest in this field (including the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physics).&nbsp;This project has provided support for a female graduate student, as well as two postdoctoral scholars.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/29/2019<br>      Modified by: Andriy&nbsp;Nevidomskyy</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1350237/1350237_10312683_1572326032439_vortex_string--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1350237/1350237_10312683_1572326032439_vortex_string--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Spin vortex crystallization in a frustrated magnet"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1350237/1350237_10312683_1572326032439_vortex_string--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Spin vortex crystallization in a frustrated magnet"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A three-dimensional lattice of spin vortices realized in a frustrated cubic lattice.
