<AbstractNarration>Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;Amongst the celebrated exotic phases of condensed matter, of particular recent interest are the quantum spin liquids (QSLs). It is widely believed that extreme quantum entanglement and geometrical frustration lead to QSLs' defining properties: strong spin correlations, the absence of static magnetic moments, and unbroken crystalline symmetry. Despite the intensive studies on QSLs, the response of the QSL state to various perturbations, such as chemical pressure, site disorder, and extra magnetic interactions, has not been thoroughly studied. Moreover, one main obstacle for QSL studies is the shortage of the examples. This award supports an experimental approach for studying the correlations between the local structural variations of the Yb3+ ions and both the perturbation effects on the QSL state in different Yb-pyrochlores and the exotic magnetism of various Yb-spinels. In both cases the geometrically frustrated corner-shared tetrahedral Yb3+-network strongly influences their magnetic properties. The investigator will synthesize, and grow crystals of new Yb-pyrochlores and new Yb-spinels and study two important physical aspects: (i) the nature of their magnetic ground states by using AC susceptibility measurements and neutron scattering; (ii) the local structural variations of the Yb3+ magnetic ions by using the pair distribution function technique. The program will train two graduate students; and aims to attract undergraduate and high school students, particularly minority students, to motivate and expose to the real world of science and technology. This will be acheived in collaboration with the Educational Advanced Program (EAP) and the Tennessee Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (TLSAMP) program at the University of Tennessee. The investigator will also provide crystals and offer services for training students on crystal growth and crystal processing to a broader scientific community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The understandings of the physical properties of quantum matters have been at the forefront of modern condensed matter physics research. One recent example is quantum spin liquids (QSLs): a unique state with strong spin correlations but without static magnetic order. The geometrical arrangements of the magnetic atoms prevent them to direct their magnetic moment, the materials are magnetically frustrated. The exotic properties of QSLs appear only at extremely low temperatures, and are expected to be sensitive to various perturbations. Moreover, one main obstacle for QSL studies is the shortage of examples. This program will explore new QSL materials and study the perturbation effects on them. Single crystals of the QSL candidates will be grown in the investigator's laboratory and then will be studied by various methods under low temperatures and high magnetic fields. The program will train two graduate students; and aims to attract undergraduate and high school students, particularly minority students, to motivate and expose them to the real world of science and technology. This will be acheived in collaboration with the Educational Advanced Program (EAP) and the Tennessee Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (TLSAMP) program at the University of Tennessee. The investigator will also provide crystals and offer services for training students on crystal growth and crystal processing to a broader scientific community.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Work supported by this NSF Early Career Award has concentrated on the better understanding of the quantum magnetism on the pyrochlore sublattice. The PI's group has systematically studied how the chemical pressure, extra magnetic sublattice, spin orbital coupling, and structural deformation affect the quantum magnetism on the pyrochlore lattice. The results provide extensive new information about the pyrochlore quantum magnetism to the scientific community and help to better understand the origin and intrinsic behaviors of their exotic magnetic ground states. The accomplishment on pyrochlores as well as the knowledge gained, provided a solid foundation for extending the PI's program to study more quantum magnets. In particular, the PI's discovery on new triangular lattice and kagome lattice magnets and the exploration of their quantum magnetism such as quantum spin liquid, quantum spin state transitions, and quantum melting point caught attentions in the field of quantum materials. The main achievement under the support of this grant is highlighted by our total 95 publications on peer-reviewed journals, including 2 Nature Physics, 4 Nature Communications, 1 Proceedings of the National Academic Sciences, 1 Physical Review X, 5 Physical Review Letters, 45 Physical Review B, 5 Physical Review Materials, 3 Applied Physics Letters, 1 Nano Letters, and 1 Journal of the American Chemical Society.</p> <p>The PI has made significant achievements on education and teaching at various levels with the support of this grant. In details: (i) the PI has graduated four Ph.D students; (ii) The grant has partially supported two postdoctoral researchers; (iii) The PI has supervised more than 10 undergraduates and 1 high school students. The recruitment of these undergraduates has been focused on underrepresented groups, which included four Africa-Americans and one female undergraduate. More than half of them continued their studies as entering graduate schools; (iv) The PI has taught a summer school class, Introduction of Solid State Physics, during the Governor School program for Tennessee high school students. For this class, 20 high school students from Tennessee was selected by emphasizing minority group members. In 2019, the PI fully attended the selection process and taught the class in the Joint Institute of Advanced Materials (JIAM) building in University of Tennessee. The class included one month lectures and several field trips to Oak Ridge National labs and other labs in the campus. In 2020, the PI taught this class virtually online. The class received very positive feedback lately. Such kind of effort sure will generate high impact on these high school students' future career selections on STEM related areas. The PI also regularly attends activities to advocate science in the public. For example, he has regularly attended the open house in the JIAM to lively demonstrate the crystal growth to the public. The PI also has frequently attended local scientific affairs for undergraduate students as judge.</p> <p>Moreover, with the support of this NSF grant, a strong single crystal growth program has been established in the PI's group. A well-equipped solid-state chemistry lab has been built in JIAM, which supports various methods for single crystal growth such as floating zone method using optical furnace, flux method, and chemical vapor transport method. This strong crystal growth program is the foundation not only for the productive research within the PI's group but also for the extensive collaborations. The PI has built up a world-wide network for collaborations by providing various high quality single crystals (Fig. 1) to collaborators for their properties studies. These extensive collaborations certainly generated impacts in the materials science community. Moreover, the PI also has trained several graduate students from other groups on single crystal growth, which sure will have impact on their future science career and help to fill the shortage of workforce on materials science in USA.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/02/2021<br>      Modified by: Haidong&nbsp;Zhou</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1350002/1350002_10292230_1612296868299_Projectoutcome-2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1350002/1350002_10292230_1612296868299_Projectoutcome-2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1350002/1350002_10292230_1612296868299_Projectoutcome-2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The as grown crystals (a) YbMgGaO4 and (b)YMnO3, both were grown by using image furnaces and co-aligned on sample stage for inelastic neutron scattering experiments;(c) MnP and (d) ZrTe5, both were grown by chemical vapor transport method.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Haidong Zhou</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Haidong&nbsp;Zhou</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure1</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
