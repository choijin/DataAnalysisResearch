<AbstractNarration>The PIs request funding to acquire a spectrum-spanning (UV-NIR) raman-atomic force microspectrometric system for submicron 3-D chemical mapping of cellular, natural and synthetic materials. This instrument enables 3-D mapping of topology and chemical functional groups across surfaces, and in and around cells, as well as any other particle. The instrumentation will be used for analyses of single cells, aerosols, surfaces, biofilms, coatings, and both natural and novel synthetic materials. It will be used for projects in marine, atmospheric, environmental, biological, chemical, and materials sciences, and biomedical engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The instrumentation will benefit a broad portfolio of research fields including ocean and atmospheric sciences, material science, and medical science. The research projects have important applications toward understanding global geochemical cycling, atmospheric aerosol physics, materials development, materials degradation, and medicine. The training of students at all educational levels appears guaranteed by the track record of SBU in general, and the PIs.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The purpose of this Major Research Instrumentation grant was to create a multi-user service facility to perform high resolution 2- and 3-dimensional maps of chemical distributions in biological, geological and synthetic materials using Confocal Raman Microspectrometry (CRM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). Stony Brook University&rsquo;s School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences is home for this facility, which we dubbed the NAno-Raman Molecular Imaging Laboratory (NARMIL). The intended beneficiaries of this technology are primarily researchers in the marine and atmospheric sciences, but researchers in the basic chemical, physical and biological sciences as well as materials sciences, biomedical sciences and engineering are also served by this facility. NSF funds enabled purchase of a Renishaw InVia CRM, Bruker Innova AFM, an optical coupling accessory, a Newport vibration isolation table, a Linkam THMS600 thermal stage, computers, and peripherals (pictured in Figures 1-4). All instruments are research grade, delivering the highest available performance, and are considered state-of-the-art. To learn more, visit http://you.stonybrook.edu/nanoraman/. University cost-share provided rehabilitation of appropriate lab space, partial salary support for the principal investigators and two years of salary and fringe benefit support for a full-time technician to operate the facility.</p> <p>The CRM is the facility&rsquo;s primary instrument and uses laser light to non-destructively interrogate samples through a microscope lens (Fig. 2). Samples can be live, preserved, dried, frozen, in solution, or embedded and analysis occurs under standard lab conditions. The CRM quantifies Raman scattered photons possessing different energies (colors). Essentially, laser light of a single uniform energy irradiates a small spot on the sample and some of the laser photons that collide with individual molecules transfer a portion of their energy to atoms bound to one another and are then released with lower energy (color is shifted toward red end of the spectrum). These collisions cause the atoms to stretch their molecular bonds setting up a vibration that is characteristic of which atoms are bound together, the type of bond and the physical environment. Energy of the photons released from this interaction directly relates to that particular molecular bond. Thus, the CRM catalogs the number of photons released across a range of energies to produce a spectrum or &ldquo;fingerprint&rdquo; of the molecular bonds present within the spot (Fig. 5). The CRM can produce a Raman spectrum from a single spot or produce a 2-D map from multiple spectra acquired from sampling a grid overlaying the sample (Fig. 6). If the sample is optically transparent, a 3-D map can be produced by repeating the 2-D grid at multiple heights.</p> <p>The AFM produces images of a sample&rsquo;s surface similar to scanning electron microscopy (Fig. 3). The advantage is that AFM images can be produced under ambient environmental conditions from samples that have not been subjected to any special preparation. The instrument routinely produces high resolution (sub-nanometer) topographic images of a specimen and can also provide information on spatial variations in mechanical properties. A very unusual feature of our facility is that we have the ability to optically couple the CRM to the AFM by focusing the laser on the AFM probe tip (10 nanometer diameter) and transmitting the Raman scattered photons back to the spectrometer. This co-localization of AFM and CRM measurements improves the spatial resolution of chemical mapping about 10-fold over measurements made on the CRM microscope stage. Thus, spatially heterogeneous distributions of chemicals can be mapped down to about 20 nanometer resolution, which is important for a variety of scientific and engineering disciplines.</p> <p>Very shortly after installation and calibration of the instruments, this facility has been used productively on numerous faculty and student research projects. Furthermore, at least 12 PhD, 4 MSc and two undergraduate students have been trained to use the CRM and two students have been trained on the AFM. To name a few research areas that the facility has provided data leading to a deeper understanding:</p> <ul> <li>microbiological metabolism and biochemistry</li> <li>sea spray aerosol chemistry</li> <li>marine sediment chemical processes</li> <li>cellular responses to nanoparticles contamination</li> <li>optimization of biomedical materials</li> <li>carbon nanotubule functionalization for solar electric power</li> <li>carbon fiber self-assembly for novel filtration materials</li> </ul> <p>Thus far, data generated from this facility have appeared in six professional journal articles with many more to follow. Two new projects that rely on NARMIL instrumentation have already been funded by other programs. We also know of at least five other projects led by local PIs or those from other institutions intending to utilize NARMIL&rsquo;s instrumentation that are in various stages of preparation or consideration.&nbsp; In short, we believe that this project was an unqualified success. It enabled SoMAS to expand analytical capabilities into novel and important territory and enhanced our competitiveness in a number of research areas.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/30/2016<br>      Modified by: Gordon&nbsp;T&nbsp;Taylor</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1336724/1336724_10265039_1470752366963_2014-02-1415.07.49--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1336724/1336724_10265039_1470752366963_2014-02-1415.07.49--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1.
