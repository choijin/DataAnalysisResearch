<AbstractNarration>This action funds Amy Truitt of Portland State University to conduct a research project in Biology during the summer of 2013 at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia.  The project title is "The Role of Symbiotic Bacteria in Providing Viral Resistance in Butterflies; the Potential Implications on Conservation in the Face of Climate Change." The host scientist is Dr. Jeremy Brownlie. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates tripartite interactions among bacteria, virus, and Lepidopteran hosts to determine how this interplay will affect management decisions, especially in light of climate change, of imperiled pollinators. The project co-infects caterpillars with either nuclear polyhedris virus (NPV) or flock house virus (FHV) and a series of Wolbachia strains to garner a better understanding the role of Wolbachia in the ecology of its host. This project uniquely evaluates the fitness benefits provided by different strains of Wolbachia to its Lepidopteran host. It also adds to the potential uses of Wolbachia as a bio-control agent or as an influence on bio-control agents, such as the viral-based bio pesticides, employed to control lepidopteran pest species.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Upon completion of this project the Fellow will continue to work with the Oregon Zoo and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to integrate the findings about Wolbachia with the management plan of the imperiled Oregon silverspot butterfly. The findings from this research will be used to develop inquiry-based science projects for K-12 and informal education as well as university classes and will be disseminated to citizens, managers, and scientists. To disseminate the results of these studies, Dr. Browlie and the Fellow will submit teh results of their research to a highly ranked journal and will present the findings at both national and international conferences. Interesting advances will be communicated to the wider community via Griffith University and Portland State University marketing and communications offices, and via mechanisms such as publication in the publicly available magazine Australasian Science. The Fellow will also continue presentations at community center seminars in the United States.</AbstractNarration>
