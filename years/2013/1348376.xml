<AbstractNarration>This action supports a research and training plan to broaden participation of Native American Indians in biology. The project will support Dale C. Brunelle to complete doctoral research at the University of North Dakota in the lab of sponsoring scientist Dr. William F. Sheridan.  The goal of the research is to identify and characterize genes crucial for all aspects of maize embryo development using functional genomics as well as traditional genetics and molecular biology strategies.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training objectives include genetics, developmental biology, and functional genomics. Broader impacts include broadening the participation of Native American Indians as independent investigators with Ph.D.s in the Biological Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Dale Brunelle has made good progress on his Ph.D. dissertation research supported by the NSF research grant titled Mutational Analysis of Maize Embryo Development.  During the funding period he has characterized the morphology of the embryos of 14 maize (corn) mutants that were examined in mature kernels.  All of the mutant embryos were blocked early during embryogenesis and failed to form embryonic leaves or roots.  Consequently, the embryos did not advance sufficiently to the able to germinate and these mutations are said to be lethal.  The genes identified by these mutations must be important for maize growth and reproduction because their normal functions are essential for successful embryo development and germination.  Dale has made progress in finding out where some of these important genes are located among the 10 maize chromosomes.  This will help in the eventual analysis of the molecular features of these genes and their gene products.  In order to further the molecular analysis of the mutations Dale has transferred them from the maize inbred line (W22) into a different inbred line (B73) by repeatedly cross pollinating them into B73.  After several crosses into B73 most of the DNA of the chromosomes will contain the DNA marker sequences unique to the B73 DNA genome.  But the DNA of the embryo mutation and its closely associated flanking DNA sequences will have the DNA marker sequences unique to the W22 genome.  This process should make it possible to eventually map the mutant gene to a precise location and determine its DNA sequence and the nature of its gene product.  During the funding period we have obtained genetic stocks containing genes known to be important in the formation of maize embryo and the growth of shoots.  These genes are fused with other genes that emit a colored fluorescent light when stimulated.  Dale has combined the reporter lines with the embryo mutant lines.  This has set the stage for him to examine normal and mutant embryos during their development from fertilization until the full extent of their development in mature kernels. This will enable Dale to see at what times during embryogenesis these genes important for development are active and in what regions of the embryos are they active.  In this way Dale will be able to assess what effects the embryo mutations may have on the normal patterns of activity of the genes known to be important for the development.  These analyses will be performed by examining normal and mutant embryos with a confocal microscope.  This system of microscopy will enable Dale to obtain three dimensional images of the normal and mutant embryos; this will assist in interpreting the role of the genes identified by the embryo mutations, in their normal functions during embryo development.  Dale is a registered member of Turtle Mountain band of the Chippewa Indian tribe.  When he completes his Ph.D. studies he will be the first Native person to receive a Ph.D. degree in biology from UND.  Dale has presented his research results at several annual maize genetics conferences in the U.S. and in Beijing, China.  The research from DaleÆs research will expand the basic biological knowledge of the genetic control of maize embryo development.  These advances in knowledge may aid in the future expansion of maize cultivation by enabling maize growth and production in a wider range of environments.  This expansion may contribute to the development of sustainable agriculture.          Last Modified: 12/17/2015       Submitted by: William F Sheridan]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
