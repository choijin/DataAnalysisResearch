<AbstractNarration>Four high-need school districts and seven community colleges are partnering with the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) to recruit and prepare forty two new math and science teachers. This project targets prospective Silicon Valley career-change professionals in addition to traditional community college transfer students and UCSC undergraduates.  The Noyce funds are to support intensive K-12 field experiences for ninety students over three years to attract STEM majors and STEM professionals into the Noyce program and into teaching.  This includes undergraduate and continuing MA/teaching credential scholarships for 10 community college transfer students in two cohorts, scholarships for an additional thirty two  MA/credential students in four cohorts, and early career mentoring and induction for all forty two new teachers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project activities take place in a broader framework of support for prospective and early career science and math teachers including: UCSC's undergraduate support program for prospective math and science teachers (and parallel programs at some community colleges), UCSC's MA/Credential program, and a well-developed teacher induction programs in the partner districts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Substantive evaluation and research address a key issue: the successful development of knowledge about teaching science and math to diverse learners, especially English learners. The results are informing the current practice of UCSC and its partners and contribute to national conversation in this area. UCSC's Noyce Scholarship Program is strengthening outreach to and support of a diverse pool of prospective mathematics and science teachers and is building a closer partnerships between UCSC, seven community colleges, and four high-need school districts.  These efforts are enhancing recruitment and retention of new teachers in key areas of district shortages and developing a central piece of research on these issues.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The purpose of this project was to recruit, prepare, and retain STEM majors as outstanding math and science teachers in high-need schools (defined primarily by having a high percentage of students living in poverty) in response to a decades-long shortage of math and science teachers and the associated problem of high math and science teacher attrition. The project helped recruit prospective teachers by funding 141 one-week intensive internships in high-need school districts in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018; and a limited number of extended teaching internships in community college and high school summer programs in 2015 and 2016.

Forty-four percent of scholarship recipients were undergraduate math majors, 32% were life sciences majors, and 24% were physical sciences majors. The scholarship recipients were White (44%), Hispanic (40%), and Asian (16%); these teachers will add an important pool of teachers who "look like their students" in schools where highly qualified teachers are in short supply.

This included workshops on &ldquo;Surviving and Thriving in Your First Year,&rdquo; funding to attend professional math or science teacher meetings, and a small budget for lab and classroom equipment and supplies. This funding helped new teachers, when they were still low on the pay scale and typically carrying significant personal educational debt, to follow best practices in teaching, particularly important for teachers in high-need schools that provide minimal instructional budgets to new teachers.&nbsp;</p> <p>As a requirement of receiving the Noyce scholarship, program graduates were required to serve two years teaching in a high-need school. Nearly all of the scholarship recipients continue to teach in high-need schools today, beyond their service requirement. Calculating the amount of possible teaching service that program graduates could have completed requires accounting for the graduation year of each teacher (the first graduated in July 2015 and the last in July 2020): given their graduation dates, the most teaching service that is POSSIBLE for this group of teachers is 139 years.
