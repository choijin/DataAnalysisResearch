<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project anticipates bringing forth a disruptive mouth guard technology that answers the urgent need for better dental protection.  In the US alone, every year more than 1 million dental injuries occur, resulting in medical costs of roughly $500 million.  The proposed technology will involve novel manufacturing methods to incorporate energy absorbing solid/liquid suspensions into novel thermo-polymer mouth guard designs to achieve enhanced impact energy absorption capacity.  The specific technical objectives are to optimize the energy absorbing capacity of the formulated solid/liquid suspensions, develop the necessary manufacturing technology for incorporating such solid/liquid suspensions monolithically into the thermo- polymer, and finally to characterize the mouth guards by subjection to stress testing (chemical, physical, and thermal).  This energy absorbing mouth guard will deliver on-demand, tunable energy absorption capacity that can be specifically tailored to provide superior dental protection to users in several venues including medical, sports, industrial and military.  This R&amp;D effort will produce the first ever mouth guard made with material that adaptively absorbs impact energy, a stark technological contrast to the conventional (passive) mouth guard.   This new technology will also contribute basic understanding to the emerging field of nanorheology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is significant.  In just the mouth guard arena, realizing this technologically advanced mouth guard will likely bring a novel product into the dental protection market. Then there is the untapped market to provide much needed dental protection for patients undergoing medical procedures. Yearly about 150,000 dental injuries occur just during endotracheal intubations, required when undergoing general anesthesia.  Further, the new energy absorbing fluid-thermopolymer material technology  to emerge  could  serve  as  the  technical  groundwork  for  a  plethora  of  energy dampening products.  In addition, the research stands to seed a new body of knowledge, small- scale (millimeter) leveraged use of energy absorptive fluids.   Realizing the technical objectives of this Phase II R&amp;D effort will help foster local economic growth when the company?s new manufacturing facility opens for the fabrication of mouth guards based on this technology.  A large number of jobs will be created requiring very diverse technical skills, and the company is committed to fill these jobs with a diverse work force.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A novel mouth guard has been developed that provides significantly improved dental protection in both sports and medical applications. Akervall Technologies Inc. has combined a high-performance polymer with energy-absorbing perforations that also contain a larger cavity that houses nanosuspensions that absorb and dissipate impact energy by undergoing a process known as shear thickening when a hit occurs. The technology developed during this project has been awarded six U.S. patents. The company is now ready to manufacture the most highly technologically advanced mouth guard available that responds to high impact by augmenting its energy absorption capability, the world?s first ever ?adaptive? mouth guard.    A key feature of this mouth guard is that it is much thinner than conventional mouth guards making it very comfortable to wear and allowing unhindered breathing and even drinking with the guard in the mouth, while providing much better protection than existing mouth guards. When a hit occurs, the nanosuspension stiffens up for a brief period of time, and this stiffening process absorbs a lot of the impact energy, so that less is transmitted to the teeth.    The scientific merit of the research is that it addressed several fundamental and applied scientific questions in high-performance polymer technology and rheology of nanofluids. First, it had to be explored how non-Newtonian solid/liquid nanosuspensions could be synthesized that were chemically compatible with thermoplastic polymers. These nanosuspensions were characterized in terms of their physical properties and rheology behavior in confined geometries. Then, the optimized nanosuspensions were incorporated into a special fibrous matrix, which in turn was inserted into a cavity within the thermoplastic mouth guard. The hypothesis was that there exists an optimum interplay between the perforation patterns in the polymer and the force absorption capacity of nanosuspensions placed into cavities that provide optimal total force absorption attainable for a given impact force range. The cavities housing the nanosuspensions had to be placed in close proximity to the perforations in the mouth guard to make sure that upon impact a synergistic interplay between the shear-thickening fluid and the deforming perforations could be achieved.     The broader impact is that during the development of the adaptive mouth guard several other related products were developed, including a mouth guard with a special perforation pattern that is far superior to previous designs, a mouth guard protecting teeth during medical procedures such as intubation, a mouth guard to protect teeth against grinding, and a high-performance insole for athletic shoes and work boots. The introduction of this unique technology positions the company to reach for a significant market share and will lead to job creation as the company is expanding its manufacturing capacity.&#8239; The company is committed to hiring a diverse work force and to investing into community outreach, especially focused on increasing youth awareness of the importance and value of wearing a mouth guard during sports activities.
