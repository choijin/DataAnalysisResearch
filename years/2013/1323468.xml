<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project builds on prior work to expand, augment and disseminate geoscience learning resources based on the affordances of the Google Earth virtual globe. Components of the project include 1) development of a suite of globally distributed interactive virtual fields trips which add high-resolution gigapixel panoramic images, virtual outcrops and specimens, and automated grading to the Google Earth base, 2) using the Earth Engine API to integrate large geoscience datasets into the virtual globe, enabling additional forms of inquiry-based learning and undergraduate research, 3) expanding toolkits, including mobile apps, to enable a broader range of faculty and students to contribute crowd-sourced data and educational resources to an online repository, 4) conducting face-to-face and online faculty professional-development workshops to promote use, and 5) assessing dissemination efforts and student learning gains through a combination of surveys, clickstream data and pre-/post-tests. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in its ability to leverage user-friendly, cutting-edge virtual-globe and gigapixel-imaging technology to engage students in an array of learning activities and virtual settings. Assessment is combining discrete collection of data through surveys and pre- and post-tests with more-continuous clickstream data to provide insights into how students learn in such virtual environments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of the project include 1) its applicability across a wide range of institutions, both as formal course assignments and for ancillary use in and beyond the undergraduate geoscience curriculum, 2) extensive faculty professional development using face-to-face, webinar and group-video-conferencing approaches, 3) materials development specifically for pre-service science teachers, and 4) provision of access for mobility-impaired students, as well as those with work or family commitments which limit participation in actual field trips.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Google Earth for Onsite and Distance Education (GEODE) project focused on designing and testing learning modules, visualizations, and tools for both onsite and online geoscience education. The project emphasized geospatial cognition in four dimensions (i.e., 3D geographic space plus time), as it is a common theme for all aspects of geoscience. Geoscience students must be able to mentally transport themselves to a different time and place, visualize an environment from different perspectives, and create models of the temporal evolution of that environment. The GEODE project developed geospatial visualization products, such as enhancements to virtual globes (Google Earth) that enable: 1) plate tectonic reconstructions; 2) embedded virtual specimens and outcrops; 3) interactive gigapixel imagery (GigaPan and GIGAmacro); and 4) learning modules and authentic research experiences using large datasets.&nbsp;These products are available on the project&rsquo;s websites, <a href="http://www.geode.net/">www.geode.net</a> and <a href="http://www.earthquiz.net/">www.earthquiz.net</a>, as well as on the Science Education Resource Center (SERC) platform for the National Association of Geoscience Teachers (NAGT) Teach the Earth portal: <a href="https://serc.carleton.edu/geode/index.html">https://serc.carleton.edu/geode/index.html</a>.</p> <p>The GEODE project team included Principal Investigators from three universities (Old Dominion University, James Madison University, and Northern Virginia Community College), senior faculty personnel from eight different universities, and an external assessment team. The initial phase of the five-year project focused on developing new tools and visualizations for geoscience education. These included a tool to move polygons around on the Google Earth globe (<a href="http://geode.net/margee/">http://geode.net/margee/</a>), which is a functionality that Google Earth still lacks. This tool led to the development of the Pangaea Breakup virtual field experience (<a href="http://geode.net/pangaeaBreakup/">http://geode.net/pangaeaBreakup/</a>) &ndash; a learning module useful for plate tectonics concepts. Additional learning modules were developed for structural concepts (The Fold Analysis Challenge: <a href="http://geode.net/fac/">http://geode.net/fac/</a>), ocean themes (marine sediments: <a href="http://geode.net/exploring-marine-sediments-using-google-earth/">http://geode.net/exploring-marine-sediments-using-google-earth/</a>, ocean basins: <a href="http://geode.net/GTOB2/">http://geode.net/GTOB2/</a>), and planetary environments (Earth&rsquo;s seasons: <a href="http://geode.net/rfts/">http://geode.net/rfts/</a>, terrestrial planets: <a href="http://geode.net/GTTP/">http://geode.net/GTTP/</a>). Other virtual field experiences were developed using gigapixel imagery at scales that range from thin sections to outcrops (<a href="http://geode.net/resources/gigapan/">http://geode.net/resources/gigapan/</a>). A particularly innovative learning resource, called EarthQuiz (<a href="http://www.earthquiz.net/">http://www.earthquiz.net/</a>), uses web-hosted imagery (Street Views, photospheres, aerial images) of locations of geoscientific interest to pose multiple choice questions for student-centered inquiry.</p> <p>All of the learning modules and tools described above have been disseminated to the broader community through multiple publications in peer-reviewed journals, presentations at professional conferences, and/or workshops for geoscience faculty and students. During the later phase of the project, faculty from a wide array of colleges and universities used GEODE products in their classes and provided feedback to the GEODE team for iterative development of the products. These resources likely will continue to be developed and refined by GEODE team members after the end of the project. The GEODE team also mentored several undergraduate and graduate students in original research projects related to the learning modules described above. Most of these students presented research results at professional conferences and contributed to GEODE-related peer-reviewed publications.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/19/2019<br>      Modified by: Kristen&nbsp;St. John</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1323468/1323468_10274033_1537106809049_Plate_Tectonics_Exercise--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1323468/1323468_10274033_1537106809049_Plate_Tectonics_Exercise--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Screen capture of the Pangaea Breakup Virtual Field Experience"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1323468/1323468_10274033_1537106809049_Plate_Tectonics_Exercise--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Screen capture of the Pangaea Breakup Virtual Field Experience"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A screen capture image of the introductory screen for the Pangaea Breakup exercise in the standalone Google Earth application.
