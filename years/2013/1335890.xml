<AbstractNarration>An award is made to Hope College for the purchase of a Nikon A1 laser scanning confocal microscope system that will provide the cornerstone for the renovated microscopy facility and transform a wide range of research projects in the departments of biology, chemistry and geological and environmental sciences. Briefly, research projects include regulation of stem cells during development using the well-characterized model organisms Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode) and Danio rerio (zebrafish), the study of membrane trafficking molecules in neurons, 3D surface imaging of skeletal crystal orientation in sea urchin spines, effects of reproductive hormone secretion on the function of neurons, the role of proteins involved in cell growth and angiogenesis, examining interactions with single molecule chemistry, and evolutionary biology studying DNA binding proteins using the parasite, Giardia lamblia. A significant impact with the acquisition of a confocal microscope is that investigators will be able to expand their abilities to collect data at a higher level of optical quality, thus enabling them to perform more complex experiments, especially using live samples, in which time course and molecular localization studies are critical. Furthermore, use of the confocal microscope will allow investigators to maintain the expectations of their respective fields in data publishing standards, thus, allowing them to be more competitive for external research funding. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acquiring a confocal microscope will transform the Hope College community and beyond in two major ways. The first major impact is the large number of undergraduate researchers that will receive training on the confocal microscope, which includes both Hope College students and non-Hope undergraduates accepted for the Summer Hope Academic Research Program. Additionally, the summer research programs include high school students and teachers accepted into the Research Experience Across Cultures at Hope, which focuses on recruiting students from under-represented populations in the sciences. The result of actively engaging undergraduate and high school researchers at Hope College for laboratory training using cutting edge technology, such as confocal microscopy, is that many of these students go on to pursue a PhD in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). The second major impact is that the investigators involved in these projects routinely present their research to the general public. By collecting data using cutting edge technology, they can present more compelling projects to the public with the goals of: 1) engaging more people in the scientific process, 2) demonstrating the relevance of the research projects, ranging in topics from cellular function to environmental impacts on local ecology and 3) recruiting talented students into the STEM fields as a career.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of this proposal were to acquire a laser scanning confocal microscope to enhance the research capabilities at Hope College, leading to higher standards of data acquisition (staying abreast of the latest standards in biology and chemistry research) and dissemination of research findings involving undergraduate researchers in both peer-review publications and major national conference presentations. Secondly, we sought to use the confocal microscope to expose to expose undergraduate students to cutting edge research technology in our efforts to expand the number of students in STEM fields. Finally, we aimed to provide access to regional research laboratories that do not have a confocal microscope at their institution.  We acquired a Nikon A1 laser scanning microscope during the first year of the grant and faculty members in the biology, chemistry, biochemistry, neuroscience and geology programs were trained in its use.  Since this time, we have trained numerous undergraduate students to use the instrument in order to address important questions in their research.  For example, one investigator used the microscope to better understand the molecular mechanisms which allow stem cells to undergo asymmetric cell division during embryonic development, such that the two newly created daughter cells can develop into different types of cells.  A neuroscience faculty member used the microscope to better understand how a membrane transport system which controls neurotransmitter release and cellular oxidative balance in the brain is regulated by its trafficking on and off the cell membrane.   Another faculty member was able to determine that viral genome replication occurs in sites within cells that are enriched with a particular lipid known as phosphatidylcholine using this instrument.   While a new faculty member is beginning to use the microscope to better understand how naturally produced capsaicin triggers cell death in glioma cells.  Collectively, this work has been disseminated in one published manuscript and in numerous regional and national conference presentations.  There are also three manuscripts that are currently in preparation summarizing much of this work.  All of the publications and presentation have undergraduate student co-authors.  Thus, the acquisition of the confocal microscope has led to advances in our fundamental understanding of such important biological processes as asymmetric cell division, viral genome replication, and regulation of oxidative balance in the brain.  With the recent hiring of several new faculty members at Hope College in the biology, chemistry and neuroscience programs who require confocal microscopy for their research programs, the microscope is also beginning to be used extensively to address important questions in mitochondrial biology, neuronal regeneration and circadian rhythm regulation.  As anticipated, the acquisition of this confocal microscope has also lead to training of over 50 undergraduate students in this state of the art imaging technique. Many of these students have enrolled in (or intend to apply to) graduate programs in biology, chemistry or neuroscience.  Given the inherent visual nature of confocal microscopy work, these experiences have been influential in exciting these students about pursuing research careers and providing them with novel insight into their own research projects.  With the recent incorporation of a confocal microscopy unit into a junior/senior-level Neurochemistry and Disease lab, this project is anticipated to lead to further training opportunities of nearly 20-30 undergraduate students each year.  Finally, the microscope has been used by a graduate student at Western Michigan University for her doctoral thesis work focused on understanding the development of the olfactory bulb, thus enabling her to do approach this problem from a novel perspective while also allowing the faculty at Hope College to build important relationships with faculty and students at this neighboring institution.
