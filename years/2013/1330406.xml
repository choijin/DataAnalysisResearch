<AbstractNarration>IIA-1330446, University of Vermont, Judith Van Houten &lt;br/&gt;Linked to: IIA-1330238, University of Delaware, Daniel Leathers and IIA-1330406, University of Rhode Island, Jennifer Specker.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Title: Collaborative Research: North East Water Resources Network&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The North East Water Resources (NEWRnet) consortium is comprised of Delaware (DE), Rhode Island (RI), and Vermont (VT). This consortium will create an advanced sensor network in watersheds for gathering high-frequency, spatially-extensive water quality and quantity data and a network of lab and field-based experiments and agent-based models to investigate how to align sensor data and their visualization in a way that will be utilization by stakeholders. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The overarching goal of NEWRnet is to improve the environmental governance and market mechanisms that sustain and/or improve water resources by linking information from a network of high-frequency sensors to behavioral results from decision makers. NEWRnet will address and integrate two challenges in environmental science and management to: 1) Understand the impact of climate variability and extreme weather events on water quality and quantity across the north-south gradient from VT to DE; and 2) Provide valuable and rapid information to stakeholders (resource users, resource managers, and policy makers) to lead to more time efficient and more informed land and water use decision making. The research design includes a sensor network nested in watersheds in each of the three states, using the same sensors to gather and transmit high-frequency hydrological and geochemical data for sharing to address hypothesis-driven questions. Concurrently, NEWRnet will create a network across all three states for experimental economics and agent-based modeling. Value-added data displays from the sensors will be tested in lab and field-based experiments to examine how stakeholders react to frequent, multi-dimensional environmental information over large areas and longer time periods, which in turn will inform agent-based models that will simulate the decision making of information users (farmers, residents, businesses, town managers, governance bodies) on a broader scale. The modeling will involve these stakeholders and test scenarios for their use of these high-frequency water quality data. Workforce development and diversity programs will be integrated into the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;The project has significant relevance to local communities as well as more broadly across the US. Researchers engage with diverse stakeholders (farmers, rural and urban residents, lake side residents and local to national level government agencies) and address water quality issues from a broad number of perspectives. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding how best to represent high-frequency data for use by stakeholders will be of broad interest beyond the three participating states. Appropriate displays of high-frequency data could allow policy makers and managers to accelerate their responses to low flow, drought and severe storm events, which are predicted to be more frequent and of higher intensity for our region, thereby reducing deleterious effects.</AbstractNarration>

The project has significant relevance to local communities as well as more broadly across the US. Researchers engaged with diverse stakeholders (farmers, rural and urban residents, lake side residents and local to national level government agencies) and addressed water quality issues from a broad number of perspectives.   NEWRnet was comprised of teams working in three different but highly integrated areas:  Sensors; Social Systems and Outreach.      The Sensors Team comprised of natural scientists from each state with expertise spanning hydrology, biogeochemistry and meteorology collaborated during the NEWRnet project to develop the first of its kind regional high-frequency water quality-monitoring network. Each site within the network was equipped with sensors that allowed researchers to monitor changes in water quality that can occur very quickly, particularly during storms. These cutting-edge sensors were deployed in each state in watersheds of differing land cover including agricultural, urban, and a relatively ?pristine? forested watershed. Sensors deployed in 2014 have been measuring water quality ever since, and will continue to do so beyond the duration of the award. This represents a significant enhancement of research and monitoring infrastructure across the NEWRnet states, as well as development of a lasting cross state research collaboration.  This network allowed the natural science team to make a number of different discoveries around how streams on regional and local scales respond to storm events and the changing seasons; and how these responses were impacted by different land covers and human practices on the landscape.  Sensor data also provided insight into understanding how organisms that live in the streams impact stream water composition across the different land covers over the course of the day as light levels change, and across seasons as water temperature and light also fluctuate. We also learned how this in-stream biological mediation of water quality is impacted by intermittent disturbances such as storms and gypsy moth invasion.  The Social Systems Team:  Understanding how best to represent high-frequency data for use by stakeholders will be of broad interest beyond the three participating states. Appropriate displays of high-frequency data could allow policy makers and managers to accelerate their responses to low flow, drought and severe storm events, predicted to be more frequent and of higher intensity for our region, thereby reducing damaging effects.  We organized a Stakeholder Engagement Meeting Workshop for policy makers and management officials in DE, RI and VT to: 1) Create a space for stakeholders across all three states to learn about and consider the roles that sensor data, results of experimental games, and learning outcomes associated with the experimental games can play in setting and implementing policy, and managing water resources and 2) Generate a series of conclusions or recommendations to be drawn from these results that can contribute to effective watershed management.  Outreach:  In concert with these efforts, NEWRnet also developed a robust workforce development and educational outreach network across the consortia and integrated students into research while increasing the diversity of participants including students who are under-represented in STEM.  Forty-one undergraduate students received summer research funding for projects in DE, RI and VT of which 49% were women.  Student recruitment efforts focused on building a diverse cohort of students well matched to their respective research projects.  A yearly symposium enabled students to present their research to peers and faculty from all three states.   An innovative component of the integrated research experience for our interns also included a communications-training feature for undergraduates, focused on communicating the significance of their research to the lay public.  The format introduced a two-minute talk, with one slide permitted.  Students received training from a professional communications coach, and had several practice sessions via videoconference; both the communications coach and the students provided feedback during the practice sessions.
