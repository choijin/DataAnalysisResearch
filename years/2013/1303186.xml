<AbstractNarration>The interaction between the solar wind and the magnetosphere actually occurs between the shocked solar wind plasma of the magnetosheath and the magnetosphere.  Therefore it is important to understand the properties of the shocked solar wind in the magnetosheath. The proposal deals with two questions that are central for understanding the interaction between the shocked plasma and the magnetosphere. The first question is how the shocked solar wind fields and plasma vary throughout the magnetosheath and the second is how do these fields and plasma influence where magnetic reconnection can occur at the magnetopause? The empirical model will be compared with both gas dynamic and magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the magnetosheath.&lt;br/&gt;The Lockheed group is involved with high school teachers and students. The models will be made available to the wider community through the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The intellectual objectives of this Project were to improve our understanding of the magnetosheath region between the Earth&rsquo;s geophysical magnetopause boundary which stands off the shocked solar wind, and the upstream fast-mode bow shock wave; and to better understand the conditions that control the location and stability of the magnetic reconnection process that occurs at the magnetopause surface, which transports solar wind plasma into the magnetosphere. The draping of the shocked solar wind magnetic field around the magnetopause can be difficult to determine, especially under conditions of nearly field-aligned flow. Spacecraft observed in the magnetosheath near the magnetopause during such conditions were analyzed to better understand the draped configuration. Analytical models of the magnetosheath magnetic field potentials and related fields (and orthogonal coordinate system development wherein the bow shock and magnetopause are constant surfaces) were investigated using a variety of methodologies. The magnetosheath magnetic field orientation at the magnetopause is a primary controlling factor in the establishment of the magnetic reconnection, via the magnetic shear angle across the magnetopause boundary. The location of reconnection lines at the magnetopause was examined using magnetic field models. The &lsquo;steepness&rsquo; of the variation in the magnetic shear angle along the magnetopause surface was examined in conjunction with spacecraft observations; the result of this effort provided greater insight into how strongly this parameter constrains the reconnection line location. The occurrence of magnetic reconnection equatorward of the cusps during northward interplanetary magnetic field conditions was described&nbsp;using multi-spacecraft observations. The rate at which magnetopause magnetic reconnection proceeds under specific solar wind conditions (asymmetric densities, contribution of minor ions such as oxygen, and guide field magnitude) and the observed ion exhaust velocity from the reconnection site (compared to the Alfven speed) were determined using spacecraft observations in multiple studies. Finally, lessons learned from these investigations were applied in a study of the occurrence and location of magnetic reconnection at the Saturn magnetopause.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The results of these investigations are represented in the publication of eight peer-reviewed journal articles, and were presented at various conferences and workshops. One of the publications also documented the current state world-wide web sites which use real-time observations of the solar wind to nowcast and forecast the locations of these geophysical boundaries. A high school student was supported by this grant to translate a currently existing real-time magnetopause and bow shock web site (which depends upon the smooth operation of multiple routines in a variety of computer languages) into the Python programming language. In addition, a second, new capability displaying the real-time magnetic field and plasma parameter jumps across the bow shock surface (plotted as contour plots) was also developed using Python. This effort was used to expose the student to the physics of the magnetosphere and its interactions with the solar wind, as well as to provide an opportunity to obtain important programming skills. The student has since graduated and is enrolled at university as an aerospace engineering major.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Publications:</p> <p>1. Trattner, K. J., S. Thresher, L. Trenchi, S. A.
