<AbstractNarration>The focus of this proposal is to provide technical coordination for the 2013 Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) Principal Investigators' (PI) meeting and multiple CPS-related workshops in the areas of Energy, Transportation, Medical Devices, and Agriculture in late 2013 and early 2014.  The workshops, each comprising 50-60 leading academic researchers and government as well as industrial technology managers, will help the community understand the research challenges at the intersection of cyber-physical systems and these application domains, and help build research agendas for these domains going forward.  Technical coordination to be provided includes creating web resources ahead of the PI meeting and workshops; coordination and formulation of the program agendas via planning committees for the events; developing, editing, and archiving content from these meetings; and contributing to the writing, editing, and publishing of research needs reports resulting from these meetings.  The broader impact of this project is comprised of the meeting/workshop artifacts, particularly a broad and compelling research agenda to guide future investments in cyber-physical systems R&amp;D, particularly in the areas of energy, transportation, medical devices, and agriculture.</AbstractNarration>

The <em>Fourth Annual CPS PI Meeting </em>was held October 17-18, 2013 at the Crystal Gateway Marriott Hotel in Arlington, Virginia.&nbsp; The primary goal of this meeting was to assemble all active CPS PIs who cover a broad spectrum of CPS R&amp;D to view new developments in CPS foudnations, to identify new, emerging applications, and to discuss technology gaps and barriers. Over 260 persons attended this two-day meeting. Over 150 proejct posters and videos were submitted. Presentations are hyperlinked&nbsp;to the&nbsp;respective speakers on&nbsp;the meeting program agenda. Project data and results are disseminated to the public via the 2013 CPS PI Meeting website at <a href="http://cps-vo.org/group/pimtg13">http://cps-vo.org/group/pimtg13</a>.</p> <p>2.
