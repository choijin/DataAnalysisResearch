<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Stephen A. Miller of the University of Florida will synthesize and characterize a new class of biorenewable polyesters, targeting thermoplastic packaging applications.  The desired polymers resemble the aliphatic polyester polyglycolic acid (PGA) and are termed PGA beta.  However, the proposed approach avoids the multistep production of glycolic acid currently necessary for PGA synthesis and it avoids fermentation technology upon which polylactic acid (PLA) production depends.  The cationic alternating copolymerization of formaldehyde and carbon monoxide is readily adapted to the incorporation of comonomers, allowing for the facile modulation of the thermomechanical properties.  Typical comonomers are inexpensive epoxides, which serve to disrupt the structural regularity of the polymeric main-chain, and thus will decrease crystallinity, modulus, and brittleness.  Structure-property analyses will provide guidance and predict the best comonomer targets for mimicking the properties of fossil fuel-based plastics.  Also, transition metal catalysts will be surveyed for their capacity to moderate the reaction conditions, and a battery of polymer degradation experiments will be conducted to assess the timescale and conditions for safely returning the PGA beta back into the environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Traditional commodity plastics are made via well-established routes and have proven material properties.  However, the vast majority derives from finite resources, such as petroleum and natural gas, and contributes greatly to the accumulation of waste because of slow degradation behavior.  This research addresses these drawbacks in developing a new, sustainable class of plastics.  The efficiently designed synthesis relies on feedstocks that can be sourced from biomass, such as forest byproducts and inedible agricultural waste.  The properties of the plastics can be finely tuned in order to mimic and replace existing fossil fuel-based plastics.  Instead of accumulating in waste disposal sites and in the environment, these plastics will degrade benignly back into the environmentally friendly chemical components.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal of this project was to convert abundant, renewable, and "single-carbon" feedstocks into sustainable packaging plastics.  Wood or agricultural wastes, which are non-food resources, can be sustainably converted to methanol (wood alcohol) and then to the simple "C1" feedstocks necessary for polymerization (formaldehyde and carbon monoxide).  We successfully demonstrated that these C1 feedstocks can be polymerized to yield a new class of biorenewable polyester thermoplastic that resembles the aliphatic polyester polyglycolic acid (PGA).  While PGA is a known polymer (used mainly for "dissolvable" sutures), our preparation is much less expensive since it circumvents the multistep production of glycolic acid currently necessary for PGA synthesis.  Moreover, the developed polymerization method is readily adapted to the incorporation of comonomers, allowing for the facile modulation of the thermomechanical properties.  These potentially biobased polymers can have the required thermal properties to replace classic, fossil fuel-based plastics, such as polypropylene (PP).  But unlike polypropylene, PGA is a far better prospect for future packaging materials because of its facile degradation and benign degradation products.  PGA is an ideal short-term packaging material that cannot accumulate in the environment and thus ameliorates the terrestrial trash crisis and the ocean plastics crisis.  This work was initially published as "Polyglycolic Acid from the Direct Polymerization of Renewable C1 Feedstocks" in the journal Polymer Chemistry in 2015 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c5py00230c) and was highlighted on the cover of that journal issue (see the graphic herein and http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/C5PY90077H).  Later, in 2016, this work was granted U.S. Patent #9,303,118 (https://www.google.com/patents/US9303118).  Two additional papers (also based on the Ph.D. Dissertation of Dr. Ersen G&ouml;kt&uuml;rk) will be submitted soon describing strategies to modulate the thermal properties of this promising plastic.  This NSF award has provided research and educational opportunities to about ten graduate students and five undergraduate students.   Also, this NSF award has facilitated their realization that new ideas and projects in organic chemistry and polymer chemistry will result in useful environmental technologies.  The fields of Environmental Science and Sustainability will be positively impacted by the results and findings from this project.  We have made genuine advances demonstrating that polymers from renewable C1 feedstocks can have the required thermal properties to replace fossil fuel-based plastics.  Ideal thermal properties for packaging plastics are no longer reserved for classic polymers, but can be achieved starting with very simple biorenewable and sustainable feedstocks.
