<AbstractNarration>This award provides partial support for graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and junior faculty to attend the 21st International Conference on High Magnetic Fields in Semiconductor Physics to be held at Panama City Beach, FL, USA in August 2014. The HMF series is now established as one of the major forums for the interdisciplinary, both theoretical and experimental, discussions of the electronic, optical and magnetic properties of semiconductor- and carbon-based structures and materials. The conference will attract a broad audience, which includes world leaders in semiconductor and condensed-matter physics (including several Nobel Laureates), emerging academic stars, and young researchers at graduate and early post-graduate levels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award provided support for the 21st International Conference on High Magnetic Fields in Semiconductor Physics (HMF) held on August 3- 8, 2014 in Panama City Beach, Florida, USA. This HMF conference was the 21st edition of the biennial series initiated in 1972. It is now established as one of the major forums for the interdisciplinary discussions of the electronic, optical and magnetic properties of semiconductor- and carbon-based structures and materials, both theoretical and experimental. Much of the subject matter of HMF conferences involves novel electronic structures and devices, linking basic and applied physics. For example, these include low-dimensional quantum structures for electronics and optoelectronics, spintronics and magnetic semiconductors, novel atomically-thin 2D systems holding great promise to transistor or sensor applications.  Participation in professional meetings is critical for students and junior researchers who need to be exposed to state-of-the-art research topics in a stimulating, collaborative  atmosphere. The HMF-21 conference organizers used this NSF grant to provide partial support to selected graduate and undergraduate students to attend the conference. After careful consideration, the Organizing Committee distributed 11 awards, 8 to cover registration fees and 3 for registration fees and lodging. All together, the HMF-21 conference  featured active participation of students and postdocs reporting strong and original science. For example, graduate students contributed 2 invited presentations and 12 talks. Not only was this an invaluable opportunity for students to grow academically and professionally, the conference as a whole benefitted from these studentsÃ† fresh research.
