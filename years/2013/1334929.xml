<AbstractNarration>The objective of this collaborative research project is to develop a microstructure-mediated design methodology that provides a seamless integration of design optimization, predictive materials modeling, processing and surface engineering, to enable accelerated discovery and development of new materials.  Through the synergy of experts in engineering design, mechanics, and materials science, a descriptor-based computational microstructure design framework and a combined theoretical, computational, and experimental approach to design new microstructural systems with tailored system properties.  Using emerging nanodielectric polymer systems as a testbed, final proof of concept will reside in design of filler morphology, interphase properties, and chemistry combinations for achieving specific mechanical and dielectric properties for a wide range of engineering applications. The computational microstructure design framework will create a shift from discovery-based materials development to systematic and computer-assisted materials design. This research will also make significant strides in predicting interphase behavior based on interaction of material constituents. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research could have important societal impact through innovations of new nanodielectric polymers used in electrical transmission and storage systems across a wide range of industries such as utility, energy, consumer electronics, and manufacturing.  Since this research provides a general methodology for designing microstructural material systems, the techniques will transcend to broader applications and benefit a wide range of domestic and military applications.  To disseminate the results to a broader community, a workshop on "Design of Emerging Microstructural Material Systems" will be organized.  Research will be integrated with education and students will have the opportunity to participate in interdisciplinary materials system design projects that offer innovation and leadership experiences.</AbstractNarration>

A wide range of design decisions including choice of material constituents, their compositions and chemistry, microstructural morphology, and processing conditions are required to optimize materials system performance. The broad objective of this interdisciplinary research is to develop a microstructure-mediated design methodology that provides a seamless integration of design optimization, predictive materials modeling, processing and surface engineering, to enable the accelerated discovery and development of new materials.  Our objective has been achieved through research developments from three interrelated aspects (1) material design representation - how to quantitatively represent the design space of a heterogeneous microstructure system using a small set of physically meaningful design variables, (2) material design evaluation - how to accurately and efficiently assess the interactions among material constituents with respect to their impact on materials system properties, and (3) material design synthesis - how to effectively explore the vast, high dimensional design space to search for optimal material designs that can be readily synthesized through processing.   Under (1) design presentation, our  major contributions include a new descriptor-based microstructure characterization and reconstruction methodology, a machine learning-based design representation method for identifying key descriptors, and a Structural Equation Modeling based method for identifying key microstructure descriptors and the latent groups.  Under (2) design evaluation, using the nanodielectric polymer system as a testbed, we developed finite element models of dielectric breakdown and relaxation processes in polymer nanocomposites, and created a data set for three polymer systems and particles with three surface modifications under a variety of controlled processing conditions.

Under (3) design synthesis, we developed a descriptor-based approach for microstructural design, which employs computational design methods like design of experiments, metamodeling, and multicriteria optimization. To further reduce the problem dimension, we developed a parametric design approach based on the spectral density function and the Gaussian random field (GRF) representation for microstructural design.  Finally, a Bayesian optimization based design approach has been proposed to integrate physical dataset with "on-demand" simulations and experiments.  The computational microstructure design approach developed in this work creates a shift from discovery-based materials development to systematic and computer-assisted materials design. The descriptor-based microstructure characterization approach creates fast statistically equivalent microstructure reconstructions as input to design simulations, provides physically meaningful mappings of microstructure to property and processing domains, and allows automated design optimization.
