<AbstractNarration>Arnout van de Rijt&lt;br/&gt;Michael A Restivo&lt;br/&gt;SUNY Stony Brook&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Women?s historical absences from scientific endeavors and other institutions that create knowledge are also seen in the contemporary practice of online peer production. Recent survey research of contributors to Wikipedia, a prominent example of peer produced knowledge, has found that less than 15 percent of its contributors are women. The causes for this high degree of gender inequality have been linked to both self-selection and barriers to participation: expertise in creating knowledge is considered a masculine pursuit, and women may buy into this belief, undermining their confidence in participating in online knowledge production. However, this gender gap has been shown to be more than simply self-selection:  research suggests that some aspects of online participatory culture serve to limit women?s participation due to excessive conflict or contentiousness, devaluation of certain topics or perspectives, and in some instances, overt hostility or other forms of misogyny.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The researchers will analyze the ways in which gender diversity affects the quality of work produced by contributors to Wikipedia. They will use the quality of the information in Wikipedia's encyclopedia articles as an indicator of the performance of the groups who author those articles. Organizational research has long known that diversity -- in respect to group composition, the types of tasks being performed, and other group dynamics -- affects a group's performance and shapes its collective output. For example, the quality of work produced by Wikipedia contributors has been shown to vary by the functional diversity (differences in types of work roles performed) and cognitive diversity (differences in the knowledge bases) of group members. However, the potential interaction with gender not been explored in any detail, which is surprising since research on gender differences in online communication and interaction point to the need to incorporate gender more thoroughly into our conceptualization of the problem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Studying the work of Wikipedia contributors provides an invaluable opportunity to assess how gender diversity, and the different ways of doing gender, affects group performance and shapes the quality of peer produced knowledge. Preliminary analysis of a subset of Wikipedia articles shows that gender diversity leads to favorable outcomes for article quality. The findings from this research will be of interest to gender scholars, organizational researchers, and others who study of online collaboration. More broadly, understanding why and when diversity can be beneficial to groups will be of practical relevance to the people who are building and working within these types of online organizations. Particularly, Wikipedia can take steps to shrink its gender gap by identifying and addressing barriers to inclusive participation from a diverse range of contributors.</AbstractNarration>

The major goal of this project was to obtain data about Wikipedia contributors and assess whether gender was a significant factor in the accomplishment of group goals. Collection of data on the gender of Wikipedia contributors came from two sources:  (1) coding information from the public archives of WikipediaÆs database; (2) solicitation of gender data from Wikipedia contributors via electronic survey. The specific objective of the data collection was to be able to measure gender on multiple dimensions (public vs private). Overall, womenÆs participation in Wikipedia was found to increase the performance of group work in producing the highest quality articles. However, because there was a high degree of missing data for contributorsÆ gender, it remains unclear whether the public vs private dimension of gender significantly affects group outcomes. The finding that women's participation (i.e. greater gender diversity) in Wikipedia lead to higher performance of groups highlights the need for more inclusive participation in organizations of this sort. These findings can also help organizations identify and lower barriers to participation from a diverse range of contributors.
