<AbstractNarration>A detailed seismic investigation of lithospheric structure will test two hypotheses for the tectonic origin of the Isabella high seismic velocity anomaly in the upper mantle of California's southern Great Valley. Both hypotheses are viable based on existing seismic imaging that uses data from stations spaced about 70 km apart, but they have dramatically different implications for the processes that accompany subduction termination and the evolution of continental arc lithosphere. One hypothesis attributes the Isabella Anomaly to the sinking mafic root of the southern Sierra Nevada batholith. The other attributes the Isabella Anomaly to a fossil slab that is a continuation of the Monterey microplate coherently translating beneath the Great Valley because it is mechanically coupled to the Pacific plate. Importantly, the latter hypothesis places the fossil slab beneath the along-strike extent of the section of the San Andreas fault that dominantly deforms by aseismic creep and hosts deep crustal tectonic tremor, which might be caused by fluids from the slab. Passive source seismic imaging using a dense broadband array with ~7 km station spacing extending from the coast to the Sierra Nevada foothills will robustly test the two hypotheses with detailed mapping of lithospheric interfaces and identification of whether or not they are continuous across a plate bounding fault with &gt;300 km of cumulative right lateral displacement. Scattered wave migration and tomographic imaging methods will be used in concert to constrain lithospheric structure beneath the dense array. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The seismic study will advance understanding of the structural legacy and mechanics of subduction termination, post-subduction evolution of the Sierra Nevada arc lithosphere, and present day basal boundary conditions on the creeping section of the San Andreas fault. A clear opportunity for scientific advance is identified not only by the potential implications for fundamental tectonic processes, but also by the existence of two well-defined hypotheses for lithospheric-scale structure that can be robustly tested with modern passive source seismic imaging methods. Additional impacts of the project include aiding in the development of a new geophysics group at the University of New Mexico (UNM) by supporting a beginning-career PI, a graduate student, and an undergraduate researcher. Expansion of geophysics research and teaching at the state of New Mexico?s largest institution has outstanding potential to attract under-represented minorities to opportunities in the geosciences. A graduate student and undergraduate researcher will be supported at Caltech. The project will develop a new collaboration between UNM and Caltech.</AbstractNarration>
