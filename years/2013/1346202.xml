<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to discover digital methods to personalize reading instruction such that students understand more when they read, retain knowledge, and build lasting skills. The academic research on reading supports the claim that active reading strategies that incorporate quality instruction can benefit students. However, instruction is usually not personalized to meet the needs of specific students, and even when an educator works 1:1 with a student they can only interpret a limited number of signals from a student to help guide instruction. The objective of the project is to take in several inputs when students read digitally and investigate whether personalized reading instruction can effectively be created and delivered for students working with any text. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this Phase I project will be to improve how students read, and therefore how they learn. Two-thirds of students in the U.S. are struggling readers; they cannot understand the main idea when they read. These students are four times more likely to drop out of school. Difficulty reading extends to all subjects; poor readers have only a 14% chance of success in math and 1% chance of success in science. Reading is the heart of education. It is the most important skill we learn in school. People who read critically have more success in school, obtain high quality jobs, and are able to contribute more to expand social resources. Thirty million students in the U.S. struggle to read, so reducing that number by even 10 or 20 percent would mean a huge improvement in the educational and financial opportunities for millions of Americans. Globally the problem is even larger, and digital devices give us the opportunity to reach over a billion people worldwide. Researchers and educators have been trying to solve the "reading gap" for decades, but only now does the technology exist to make this possible.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The key objectives for our Phase 1 project were to identify algorithms that effectively personalize reading instruction and to seed commercial success of that innovation.   The goal is to impact the two-thirds of students in the U.S. that are struggling readers; they cannot understand the main idea when they read. Nationwide, this equates to 30 million students from grades 4-12. Additionally, we took new approaches to reading instruction that had not yet been tried commercially.   We successfully completed both of the objectives &ndash; we built one personalized instruction feature for the digital reading platform Actively Learn and have launched it commercially, marketing it and pitching it to prospective customers.   Specifically, we found a way to provide students who are struggling more help when they read, in the form of additional help notes. Our algorithms take into account student performance and judge when extra notes should be provided.  The system learns over time, such that the proportion of instances when extra help is provided varies according to the readerÃ†s learning.   Teachers responded very positively to this feature idea amongst several others we also shared with them. They want a way by which to differentiate instruction for their students without having to write a new assignment for each student. Our personalized reading algorithm allows for that.   During our test-run of the algorithm, we saw 57% of students perform better when the feature was used (with a p-value of 0.027), and we also observed areas where we could improve it to make it even stronger.   Our team is committed to make personalized reading instruction even more effective in the future.          Last Modified: 04/02/2015       Submitted by: Jay Goyal]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
