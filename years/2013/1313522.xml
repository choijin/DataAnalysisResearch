<AbstractNarration>Hydraulic fracturing of shale gas deposits has a potentially large impact on water supplies.  In contrast to the current shale gas boom in Pennsylvania, New York State has been under a hydrofracking moratorium. This creates an opportunity to complete a large-scale, unbiased assessment of water chemistry pre-hydraulic fracturing, to facilitate detection of water chemistry changes following hydraulic fracturing.  This project will develop a shale chemistry signature fingerprint based on a combination of halogen concentrations (Br, I, and Cl), isotopic ratios (129I/I, 87Sr/86Sr), and fluorescence of organic matter.  The project will contribute to a scientifically-defendable protocol, applicable throughout the Marcellus play, whereby potential contamination from hydrofracking can be determined.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will develop geochemical fingerprinting tools to unambiguously identify changes in chemistry of surface water and groundwater due to activities related to energy production via hydraulic fracturing. These new geochemical fingerprinting tools will contribute to science-based decision making about the sources of contamination in regions where hydraulic fracturing is occurring and will lay the framework for developing best practices for evaluating evolving water quality in shale gas basins. The project will characterize geochemical parameters for present-day surface and shallow ground waters and establish a regional, pre-production baseline against which to compare future surface and shallow ground waters following the onset of hydraulic fracturing in New York State. This study will utilize; 1) unbiased sampling, 2) novel and unambiguous geochemical fingerprinting, and 3) rapid dissemination of results through a public database and web interface.  All participating landowners will receive results of all water quality testing for their well water. The project will develop an open-access, detailed, geospatially-referenced database of surface and groundwater chemistry. The database will be made publically-available online and will have a web-GIS interface, such that it is navigable by a non-technical audience.</AbstractNarration>

As a result, hydraulic fracturing has the potential to introduce saline water into the environment due to migration of deep formation water to shallow aquifers and/or discharge of produced water during storage, transport or disposal. Characterizing potential salinity and methane contamination is of particular concern in the rural Marcellus shale region, where the water supply is primarily private, domestic wells, and saline water and methane occur naturally in shallow groundwater.  High volume hydraulic fracturing (HVHF) is currently used to produce gas in all states overlying the Marcellus shale, with the exception of New York (NY), where HVHF is permanently banned. Given the similar regional geology, climate, and land use across areas underlain by the Marcellus, studies of water quality in domestic wells in NY are representative of conditions prior to HVHF in an area with conventional gas production.  We measured methane concentrations in 137 domestic wells across 5 counties in southern NY covering an area of 10,230 km2. For each well, we determined the topographic position (valley or upland), the geologic unit of water extraction, the chemical water type, and distances to the nearest fault, lineament, and active or other conventional gas well. Methane concentrations in domestic wells were not significantly different between geologic units of extraction, nor did they correlate with distances to faults, lineaments, or gas wells. Methane concentrations were significantly different between water types; Na-HCO3 waters had significantly higher methane concentrations than Ca-HCO3 waters.

Our results suggest high methane concentrations in valley wells producing Na-rich water are likely to be naturally occurring, rather than the result of gas production by HVHF.  In addition to assessing methane occurrence in the region, we have developed a multivariate statistical modeling framework for quantitatively fingerprinting natural and anthropogenic sources of high salinity (&gt; 20 mg/L Cl) in shallow groundwater pre- or post- hydraulic fracturing.  Fingerprinting water impacted by hydraulic fracturing is challenging given the other potential anthropogenic and natural sources of salinity and metals in areas in which drilling is taking place.
