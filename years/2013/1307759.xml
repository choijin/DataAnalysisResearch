<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to investigate boron carbide diode-based sensors applied to high spatial&lt;br/&gt;resolution neutron imagers. The approach is to experimentally and theoretically investigate the&lt;br/&gt;operational parameters and spatial resolution enhancement techniques required for this purpose. The&lt;br/&gt;four spatial resolution enhancement techniques to be investigated include threshold discrimination,&lt;br/&gt;density gradient, fast logic, and columnar sensor medium techniques. Each of these enhancement&lt;br/&gt;techniques will be investigated for feasibility and effectiveness. Boron carbide diode sensors will also be&lt;br/&gt;characterized experimentally with respect to related operational parameters for these spatial resolution&lt;br/&gt;enhancement techniques. The combination of these results will provide a basis for the development of a&lt;br/&gt;state-of-the-art neutron imager. The boron carbide will also be tested through direct coupling with Timepix&lt;br/&gt;QTPX-262k to test its functionality and improvement of current state of the art techniques utilizing&lt;br/&gt;established front end electronics and signal processing methods.</AbstractNarration>
