<AbstractNarration>Overview:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, KMlabs will work with the currently active ERC in EUV Science and Technology&lt;br/&gt;in an effort to optimize and commercialize a tabletop coherent extreme ultraviolet source&lt;br/&gt;based on high-order harmonic generation (HHG), targeted specifically for 13.5 nm wavelength.&lt;br/&gt;The end goal of this project is to produce a commercial prototype that can produce efficient&lt;br/&gt;13.5 nm light to support EUV lithography tool development. Such a small-scale laser source&lt;br/&gt;can be used for a variety of lithography support applications including optics characterization,&lt;br/&gt;metrology, and mask inspection, which can help to ensure the rapid deployment of this critical&lt;br/&gt;technology, currently planned for ~2015.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit :&lt;br/&gt;CU-Boulder, as a part of the EUV ERC, has been developing coherent EUV technology for more&lt;br/&gt;than a decade. Their recent work has led to a more comprehensive understanding of how to optimize&lt;br/&gt;the HHG upconversion process to generate EUV or x-ray light at a particular target wavelength.&lt;br/&gt;This for the first time allows us to identify specific approaches that may allow for significant&lt;br/&gt;(up to 3 orders of magnitude) increases in coherent flux capability at 13 nm.&lt;br/&gt;KMlabs has proven track of record for successfully commercializing cutting edge scientific&lt;br/&gt;results?for example the eXtreme Ultraviolet Ultrafast Source (XUUS), introduced in 2009. The&lt;br/&gt;XUUS is a broadband coherent ultrafast EUV source optimized to generate 30 nm light, and &gt;15&lt;br/&gt;XUUS setups have been delivered to research customers worldwide. Optimization of this source&lt;br/&gt;for 13 nm will make it possible to address a much greater range of industry needs. We have&lt;br/&gt;identified three possible approaches for optimizing 13 nm flux. In this project we plan to&lt;br/&gt;perform a direct comparative evaluation of these approaches. Based on our physical understanding,&lt;br/&gt;we believe we can determine the global optimum for HHG conversion to 13 nm.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts :&lt;br/&gt;KMlabs and the EUV ERC will each leverage their technical strengths, and this project will&lt;br/&gt;serve to leverage the impact of EUV ERC technology on the science and technology enterprise.&lt;br/&gt;The rapid advance of microelectronics technology, as described by Moore?s law, has been a&lt;br/&gt;major driver of the global economy. This advance has been driven primarily by progress in&lt;br/&gt;lithography that allows for shrinking feature size. Current visible wavelength tools are straining&lt;br/&gt;against fundamental limits, and the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors has&lt;br/&gt;been anticipated a shift to EUV lithography for quite some time. The timeline for EUV had&lt;br/&gt;repeatedly experienced delays because the use of EUV light, which is strongly absorbed by&lt;br/&gt;all materials, is radically more difficult to work with than visible/UV.&lt;br/&gt;Nevertheless, recent progress in 13 nm EUV light sources for lithographic exposure has made&lt;br/&gt;its adoption for the 22 nm node-size in the next generation computer chips a high priority.&lt;br/&gt;EUV lithography remains untested at the systems and large-scale production level, with many&lt;br/&gt;unknowns. Improved capabilities for mask defect detection and characterization, for characterizing&lt;br/&gt;optics degradation with long-term use, and for tasks such as alignment and quality control,&lt;br/&gt;can all benefit from a usable tabletop at-wavelength laser source. An HHG-based coherent 13&lt;br/&gt;nm EUV light source is a relatively low cost, small-scale, contamination-free coherent source&lt;br/&gt;suitable for industrial application, and which has already been proven to enable new capabilities&lt;br/&gt;such as coherent diffractive EUV imaging with near-wavelength resolution, and for materials&lt;br/&gt;characterization. KMlabs plans to build on this proposed work in future with development of&lt;br/&gt;reflectometer/ellipsometer instruments, as well as an inspection microscope for EUV lithography&lt;br/&gt;applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In recent decades, technological advances have been driven large part by our ability to master nature at ever-smaller dimensions. The best-known example is in microelectronics, where MooreÆs "law" has driven an exponential advance in computation. MooreÆs law has motivated industry to continually shrink the size of the transistor to the point where nanoelectronics now makes routine use of devices with feature size ~50x smaller than the wavelength of visible light.  This continual advance creates new fundamental challenges. First, since light&mdash;photolithographic printing&mdash;is used to fabricate microelectronics, and since this fabrication resolution is fundamentally limited by the wavelength, the industry has funded a multi-$B effort to develop "extreme ultraviolet" (EUV) photolithography light&mdash;using the region of the spectrum between visible light and x-rays. EUVL will be used in manufacturing near the end of this decade.  The second challenge, and one that has potential for broader impact, is in observation and measurement. It becomes increasingly difficult to reliably make what one cannot see. In nanoelectornics manufacturing, lasers are used extensively for metrology in the fab. However, current laser techniques have reached sensitivity limits. Laser technology&mdash;the ability to make coherent, collimated beams of light&mdash;has not advanced to shorter wavelengths since the 1970Æs, in terms of practical, commercial sources.  In anticipation of this problem, the NSF EUV Engineering Research Center (EUV ERC) was established in 2003. Its mission is to advance short-wavelength laser technologies using a variety of approaches. Laser-like light can be created either by light amplification at the desired wavelength, or by "upconverting" laser light. In its first decade, the EUV ERC was the single entity most responsible for developing and demonstrating the use of coherent EUV light. The techniques developed there made it possible to directly study heat flow at the nanoscale, to observe dynamics in nanostructured magnetic materials for new "spintronic" technologies, and to image using EUV light with a resolution limited only by the wavelength; i.e. ~10-20 nm.  To make this technology available for broad application, ERC affiliate company Kapteyn-Murnane Laboratories Inc.. commercialized the frequency-upconversion approach ("high-order harmonic" generation, HHG) through the XUUSTM coherent EUV light source. The XUUSTM is in essence the first commercial "tabletop x-ray laser" light source. However, the then-current generation of XUUSTM was optimized for generating light at 29 nm&mdash;in the EUV, but not matched to the 13.5 nm wavelength used for EUVL. "Actinic" coherent light could be used to support development of EUVL tools through characterizing optics, in alignment and metrology, and in imaging of the patterned structures (photomasks).  The objective of this SECO project was to understand the optimization of the XUUSTM system for generating light at 13.5 nm. Although the high-harmonic generation process is still fully applicable, it requires a substantial change in driving laser parameters&mdash;either to use higher laser intensities to drive the process, or through the use of a laser at a different, longer wavelength. Recent EUV ERC work pioneered the concept that high harmonic generation using longer mid-infrared wavelengths can create coherent EUV and soft x-rays at shorter wavelengths.  This SECO project identified the optimal laser and waveguide design for high-flux 13.5 nm HHG beams. It then focused on engineering the XUUSTM system for 13.5 nm. A new XUUS4TM product for 13.5 nm beams is now available, and the first commercial sale has occurred. During the SECO grant, KMLabs also received Series A investment led by Intel Capital and the Colorado Impact Fund, in order to develop the XUUS EUV source for industrial applications.
