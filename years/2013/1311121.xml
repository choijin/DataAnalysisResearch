<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for international collaboration in global change research in the Asia Pacific region.  The Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN) was formed in 1996 as a result of President Bush?s Rose Garden speech calling for international cooperation in global change challenges. The APN seeks to make its research results available to help the development of science-based strategies and decision-making processes, as well as the development of scientific capacity to address these important issues.  This award will support multidisciplinary research that focuses on key issues of global environmental challenges in the Asia Pacific region.  The results are expected to provide a strong scientific basis for decision-making at many levels. The United States, as member country of the APN, is considered a crucial partner in this process providing not only financial support but also scientific leadership that permits the region to scientifically develop and cope with the impacts of global change. &lt;br/&gt;Promoting US leadership and involvement in environmental change research in the Asia Pacific region and ensuring US participation in these activities positively impacts the not only the US science communities, but also the science communities in other countries.  The challenges of global environmental change are inherently international and the Asia-Pacific region not only has a great deal of research to contribute to global change phenomena but is also one of the most vulnerable regions to the impacts of global change. The outputs from this proposal will enhance the capacity of developing country researchers to conduct global change research at regional and sub-regional levels; and continued growth of a network of young and leading intellectual researchers in the AP region through international cooperative activities with leading US and other countries in the Asia Pacific region.</AbstractNarration>

Achieving these aspirations is further complicated by the impacts of natural and anthropogenic changes in Earth&rsquo;s bio-geophysical system. Therefore, it is not only important to understand the Earth system and the issues interlinked but also to provide policy-relevant information to decision makers that may lead to achieving development goals without compromising the environment.</p> <p>Asia-Pacific Network for Global Change Research (APN) is a network of 22 member countries in the Asia-Pacific region. APN has been part of a global effort to strengthen scientific capacity of countries particularly in the Asia-Pacific region through supporting collaborative regional research and capacity building activities. APN promotes research that improves and advances science that informs decision-making regarding adaptation, mitigation and sustainable development in the following areas:</p> <ol> <li>Climate change and climate variability</li> <li>Biodiversity and ecosystems</li> <li>Changes in the atmospheric, terrestrial and marine domains</li> <li>Resources utilisation and pathways for sustainable development; and</li> <li>Risk reduction and resilience</li> </ol> <p>Under the NSF Award 1311121, 11 collaborative regional research projects befitting the topics mentioned above were implemented. Some of the projects are still continuing with support from the APN. Highlights of the outcomes resulting from the projects during the two years support from NSF Award 1311121 are as follows:</p> <ul> <li><strong><i>Strengthening the network of scientific communities.&nbsp;</i></strong>Regional collaboration provides platform for scientists from various countries in the Asia-Pacific region to come together and combine forces and knowledge, creating a more robust knowledge to inform decision-making process in the region.</li> <li><i><strong>Advancing science and knowledge through observation/analysis of changes in the earth system.</strong></i>&nbsp;APN promotes research that improves integrated understanding of changes in the earth system, not only including physical and biological changes but also social and human changes.</li> <li><i><strong>Advancing knowledge on strengthening climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in various sectors.&nbsp;</strong></i>The adverse effects of climate change and natural variability pose a significant threat to humanity and ecosystems in the Asia-Pacific region and therefore&nbsp;climate change adaptation has been receiving increasing attention.

<li><i><strong>Enhancing capabilities to participate in research on global change and sustainability and to support science-based decision-making.&nbsp;</strong></i>APN encourages projects to provide opportunities to early-career scientists, particularly in developing countries, to be involved in regional research to enhance their knowledge and expertise in the field, expand their network and
