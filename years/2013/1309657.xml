<AbstractNarration>Technical Part:  Bone is a hierarchically-structured composite material which at the nanoscale comprises an interpenetrating network of hydroxyapatite (HA) nanocrystals dispersed within the interstices of self-assembled collagen fibrils.  The goal of the research is to use a combination of biomimetic processing techniques to synthesize collagen-hydroxyapatite composites with a hierarchical structure emulating bone, and thus reproduce its mechanical properties.  The work extends prior success in mimicking the interpenetrating nanostructure of bone, by integrating it to the next level of hierarchy:  the lamellar microstructure of bone.  To accomplish this goal, densely-packed arrays of highly organized collagen will be produced using liquid-crystalline precursor collagen solutions and then laminated to mimic the twisted plywood structure found in the lamellae of osteonal bone.  The microlaminated structures will then be mineralized by the PILP process, which has been shown to lead to intrafibrillar mineralization of collagen, with oriented nanocrystals of hydroxyapatite embedded throughout the interstices of the collagen fibrils.  Compositions matching bone, with 60-70 wt% mineral, can be achieved with the PILP process; however, even with this high degree of mineralization, the inherent porosity of reconstituted collagen sponges prevents the composites from supporting high loads.  Thus, a highly-organized collagen, as is found in bone, is needed for reproducing the properties of bone.  If the densely-packed collagen arrays can be mineralized via the PILP process, it should be possible, for the first time, to match the modulus, strength and toughness of bone.  Micromechanical testing will be performed on the multilevel composites generated with different lamination strategies to assess the quality of the structures that are produced, and how the various structural parameters (such as lamellar thickness, fiber diameter/organization, degree of mineralization, etc.) correlate to mechanical properties.  Finally, because bone is a mechanical structure, the PILP process will be conducted on both loaded and unloaded collagen arrays to determine if load might play a key role in bone morphogenesis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Part:  Bone is a remarkable composite from which its underlying structural design may help guide the design of future composite materials.  There have been many studies on the mechanical properties of bone, but because of its hierarchical structure, it is difficult to isolate the effects of various strengthening and toughening mechanisms that underlie each level of structure.  By developing an in vitro model system that can mimic separate levels of bone structure, such properties might be examined without this overriding complication, and benefit from the ability to tailor individual components of the composites.  This work also has important biomedical implications, both at the fundamental science level with respect to understanding bone formation and properties, and the applications side of developing the next generation of orthopedic biomaterials.  This biomimetic approach has the potential to lead to load-bearing bioresorbable bone substitutes which are remodeled through the cellular processes that occur during natural bone remodeling.  With respect to education, bone, due to its hierarchical structure, provides an interesting forum for training students about composites in the materials science field.  Outreach programs such as Research Experience for Teachers (RET) and Biomimetic-Materials Outreach Program (BMOP) will be continued, which have included training and outreach to students at the graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 levels.  A new outreach program is also proposed, in which public lectures will be provided to aquarists in nearby cities to show them the interesting materials science behind the invertebrate biominerals they enjoy as a hobby (such as sea urchins and mollusk shells), and the similarities/differences between these biominerals and vertebrate biominerals, to show how biomimetic engineers are developing novel hierarchically-structured composite materials.</AbstractNarration>

Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this Report are those of the PI and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation; NSF has not approved or endorsed its content.   Bone is a hierarchically-structure composite which has remarkable mechanical properties, being both a strong and stiff material capable of supporting heavy loads over many years, as well as being able to resist fracture.  This has intrigued the materials engineer because most ceramic materials are strong and stiff, but are also brittle.  In bone, the bioceramic material is hydroxyapatite (HAp) mineral, but this brittle phase is prepared as a combination of tiny nanocrystals that are distributed throughout the more ductile collagen matrix of bone. Collagen fibrils are found throughout the body, in all soft tissues as well as the hard tissue of bones and teeth, but in the case of bone, these fibrils become infiltrated with a fluidic precursor to the mineral phase, which enables the mineral to infiltrate into the nanoscopic spaces inside the fibrils as well as on the outside the fibrils, forming a unique interpenetrating composite structure in which the rigid mineral phase reinforces and stiffens the ductile collagen phase, while the ductile collagen phase protects the tiny crystals and disrupts any cracks that would normally form in the brittle mineral phase.  This research has focused on developing a synthetic model system in which the unique composite structure of bone can be reproduced in the beaker, enabling scientists to better understand bone?s formation process, and how this process leads to bone?s unique hierarchical structure, and thus bone?s unique mechanical properties.  As materials scientists seek to understand how nature forms its remarkable materials, materials engineers can then learn how to fabricate better composite materials, with both high strength and fracture toughness.
