<AbstractNarration>1337227&lt;br/&gt;Deng&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this proposal is to acquire a high-speed video imaging system for the Mach 4 supersonic wind tunnel at Alabama A&amp;M University (AAMU). The imaging system will enable researchers to conduct electromagnetic shockwave control and shockwave/boundary layer interaction research, both require capturing the shockwave location and movement near the area of extreme heat fluxes where the shockwave is typically oscillating at 1kHz to 20 kHz frequency. The AAMU supersonic wind tunnel is a state-of-the-art facility for shockwave experiments. This wind tunnel facility can provide stable air at speed of Mach 4 for 20 seconds within 6x6x18 inch test section. The existing instrumentation for the wind tunnel includes a sting balance, an optical imaging Schlieren system and a computer controlled high speed data acquisition system with 48 channels. However, this wind tunnel system does not have any high speed imaging capability, which is critical to the supersonic shockwave interaction research. The proposed project will acquire a high-speed high-resolution digital video system, the Phantom V1210 camera, made by Vision Research. It is the necessary instrument for the supersonic wind tunnel facility. It will immediately enable the research in electromagnetic control of shockwave and shockwave-boundary layer interaction using AAMU?s Supersonic wind tunnel.</AbstractNarration>
