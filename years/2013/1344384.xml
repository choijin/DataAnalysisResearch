<AbstractNarration>The Geosciences EarthCube program recognizes the importance of aligning cyber-infrastructure activities with the needs of end user research communities. To that end we propose to convene 50-70 members of the coral reef community in two workshops, one held at the University of Hawaii (HIMB) and the other at the University of California Santa Barbara National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS). The specific objectives of the workshop are to: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. Define current and future (5-15 years) scientific challenges in the field&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Summarize data and cyber-infrastructure constraints that prevent these challenges being realized&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Collate current community data and modeling resources and their locations&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;4. Identify and recommend data infrastructure that could facilitate rapidly addressing the scientific challenges in the field&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The coral reef research community is multidisciplinary and the data on reefs is diverse and complex, crossing biological scales from genes to ecosystems, temporal scales from nanoseconds to millennia, and spatial scales from nanometers to kilometers. The challenge is to integrate across these data sources to identify patterns and relationships that rapidly improve our understanding of coral reefs systems. This effort has been hindered to date by the lack of tools to accomplish this and ineffective means of sharing data or collaborating. This project will support workshops that engage the coral reef community to 1) develop a common vision of the grand science challenges in the field 2) highlight how data cyber-infrastructure needs will integrate the complex datasets and potentially facilitate rapid progress in key areas of coral reefs ecosystem science and 3) emphasize the value of collaboration and data sharing as a first step to changing and improving the way coral reef scientists support each other and advance the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As ecosystem engineers, corals provide the nutritional, economic, and structural basis of&lt;br/&gt;an ecosystem worth billions of dollars annually. This workshop proposal convenes the coral reef community and will address how cyber-infrastructure can inform coral reef systems science. The latter will ultimately accelerate understanding of reef ecosystems, broaden the scope of the questions that can be asked and build capacity to predict how these societally relevant and fragile ecosystems will face the challenges of climate change and human development. The workshops will also be attended by at least 4 postdocs and represents a significant professional development opportunity for these individuals. Results will be disseminated on the EarthCube website, the NCEAS website, and the HIMB website making them broadly accessible to the science, education and the public. The product from the proposed endeavor will be a report to NSF EarthCube summarizing the discussion for each of these objectives that will serve to define and align the needs across the Geosciences and help prioritize EarthCube activities. There is also an opportunity to use the results to develop a manuscript that articulates how cyber-infrastructure can address the science challenges facing the coral reef community and facilitate a systems level science agenda. Such a product could have high value in both the science funding and policy realm.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Major project goals of Developing a Community Vision of Cyberinfrastructure Needs for Coral Reef Systems Science were to:  Bring together coral reef systems scientists in two workshops to discuss the current status of cyberinfrastructure in coral reef science; Identify key science drivers and grand challenges in coral reef science; Identify the role that cyber-enabled data tools can play in addressing key science drivers and grand challenges; Envision how cyber-enabled tools can enhance the value, scope and impact of coral reef systems science.   Two workshops were convened: September 17-18, 2013, University of Hawaiæi: Hawaiæi Institute of Marine Biology; and October 23-24, 2013, University of California: Santa Barbara - National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis.  Specific objectives of each two-day workshop built upon major project goals. Workshop attendees were asked to:  1. Define current and future scientific challenges in the field;  2. Summarize data and cyberinfrastructure constraints that prevent challenges being met;  3. Collate current community data and modeling resources and locations;  4. Identify and recommend data infrastructure that could help address these scientific challenges.  A total of 53 participants, representing a broad geographic range of the U.S. academic coral reef research community, attended one or both workshops. Participants identified the following science drivers and grand challenges.  Key Science Drivers/Questions in Coral Reef Science that will be the focus of interdisciplinary efforts during the next 5-15 years:  What processes are relevant to understanding biological responses of coral reefs to biotic and abiotic drivers across temporal and spatial scales? What are the mechanisms of coral reef adaptation and acclimatization to climate change? How does symbiosis influence the biology and ecology of coral reef organisms? How does abundance and diversity of coral reef organisms influence community resilience at local, regional, and global scales? How will invasive species, disease, and parasites disrupt coral reef ecosystem structure and function?   These Grand Challenges in Coral Reef Science emerged as consistent challenges faced within and across disciplines.  Of highest priority was data utilization and accessibility for automated processing, standardization and measurement; data cohesion across spatial and temporal scales as well as disciplines; and application and access to this data, from -omics to ecosystem modeling. Rapid developments in bioinformatics and -omics sciences provide new tools to address taxonomic, genetic, ecological, and evolutionary questions, but there is a great need to develop methodologies to efficiently utilize these tools within coral reef science.  There is a need training opportunities to better communicate science to peers in other fields, to better inform policy, and to educate students and the public.   Participants also identified Technical Issues and Challenges in four classes of community needs: (1) Databases and Portals, (2) Data Processing, Modeling and Visualization, (3) Education and Training, and (4) Internationalization.  Detailed challenges and needs were developed by workshop participants, and those outputs were used as the starting point for a larger and even more diverse group to work within a subsequently funded NSF EarthCube Research Coordination Network. CReSCyNT, the Coral Reef Science and Cyberinfrastructure Network, is a multi-tiered and multidisciplinary network of coral reef researchers, cyberinfrastructure specialists, and computer scientists working together to facilitate integrative and interactive research. The network is working to coordinate, plan, and prioritize cyberinfrastructure needs within the coral reef community and with the broader geosciences. Objectives are to collectively identify needs, best practices, bottlenecks, and avenues to advance the design and development of data management, visualization, and i...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
