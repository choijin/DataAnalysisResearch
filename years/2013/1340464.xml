<AbstractNarration>1340464 - Simonian&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Foodborne disease, chemical adulteration, and food fraud are emerging public health threats&lt;br/&gt;due to the complex and global nature of our food supply chain. The heightened public awareness&lt;br/&gt;of adulterated and contaminated food products has brought increased pressure on governments,&lt;br/&gt;health organizations, industry and agriculture from around the world to combat these problems&lt;br/&gt;and ensure the safety and authenticity of our food supply. We propose to convene a symposium&lt;br/&gt;on Biosensors for Agriculture to address sensor technologies to confront these issues. The&lt;br/&gt;symposium will be held in conjunction with the Electrochemical Society?s annual fall meeting&lt;br/&gt;in San Francisco. This one day symposium will consist of 1) Invited Presentations describing&lt;br/&gt;recent sensor research and organizational roadmaps; 2) a Panel Discussion session to identify&lt;br/&gt;technology gaps not being addressed by current efforts; 2) an open forum Research Poster Session;&lt;br/&gt;and 4) a Poster Contest to encourage student research on biosensors. This symposium will lead&lt;br/&gt;to innovative and interdisciplinary approaches to ensure food safety for consumers.</AbstractNarration>
