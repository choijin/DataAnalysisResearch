<AbstractNarration>In this research the PI develops and analyzes mathematical and numerical frameworks for robust reconstructions from nonuniformly-acquired, multidimensional data.  A particular focus of this work is on wavelet-based, sparsity-exploiting algorithms based on infinite-dimensional (i.e. analog/continuous) signal and image models.  Research objectives include (i) introducing a comprehensive mathematical sampling theory for stable, realizable reconstructions in arbitrary bases and frames from nonuniform data, (ii) extending compressed sensing theory and techniques to nonuniform and nonideal data, as well as continuing the development of compressed sensing to the infinite-dimensional setting, (iii) implementing and analyzing efficient algorithms for reconstruction based on numerical linear algebra, and (iv) establishing new fundamental barriers for stable reconstructions from uniform and nonuniform data.  The research will provide thorough mathematical analysis, in particular as regards the key issues of accuracy and stability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In many different areas, including medical imaging, tomography, seismic imaging, radar, and astronomy, data is collected nonuniformly.  In medical imaging, for example, nonuniform sampling geometries allow for fast, higher-resolution scans with lower susceptibility to noise and artifacts.  However, standard algorithms used for image reconstruction from such data often have critical shortcomings, especially as regards accuracy and robustness to noise and other errors.  This can lead to incorrect image registration and, in medical imaging, misdiagnosis.  This project introduces new and improved algorithms for non-standard and nonuniformly sampled data, with a particular emphasis on sparsity-exploiting methods, and addresses the fundamental mathematical analysis of image reconstruction from such data.  The benefits of this work include (i) the development of a more realistic theory of sampling and compressed sensing that is closer to and more representative of the practitioner's needs, and (ii) the introduction of reconstruction algorithms with superior reconstruction quality, lower data acquisition times and improved robustness in the presence of noise and perturbations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goals of this project were to introduce, analyze and implement a new generation of robust reconstruction techniques for nonuniformly sampled data, such as is frequently found in applications including MRI, X-ray CT, seismology and geophysics.  That is, classical approaches to signal and image reconstruction require samples that are evenly spaced in time, space, and/or frequency.  However, depending on the sensing mechanism and method used to recover the signal, nonuniformly spaced samples may improve efficiency.  Work from this project led to theoretical advances, new algorithms, and scientific applications regarding the design and use of nonuniform sampling patterns for signal and image estimation.   On the theoretical side, one of the highlights of this work is a theorem that  explains the ability to use nonuniform Fourier measurements (roughly, the component strength of an image at each of a set of nonuniformly spaced frequencies) to reconstruct an image in a representation that is more natural for a given type of image; in this case the reconstruction uses a wavelet basis, which subdivides an image in both space and frequency.  In particular, this theorem shows that to recover the n most significant wavelet coefficients at a  given scale, one requires approximately n Fourier measurements, taken  randomly from an appropriate frequency bandwidth.  Other results include new density criteria for nonuniform sampling and reconstruction from derivative or bunched measurements and a greater understanding of the effects of asymptotic (i.e.  infinite-dimensional) structure in compressed sensing, providing further insight into  performance optimization in select applications (e.g. MRI, compressive  imaging, etc).   On the more practical end of the spectrum, results from this project include a new fast algorithm for parallel MRI reconstruction, which was generalized for  sensing applications in which multiple sensors act in parallel (so-called  multi-sensor architectures).   Work from this grant establishes the first  theoretical recovery guarantees for this problem and brings forth a series of new design protocols  for multi-sensor systems.  Additional work led to a new compressed sensing algorithm  for the practical recovery of quantitative MRI data from single-shot MR  scans.  This combines new techniques for efficient gridding of  nonuniform data with novel sparse regularization tools and parameter  estimation methods.  Other work includes the development of a sampling method for use in resolving material  grain structures with a scanning electron microscope.  This method  uses machine learning techniques to produce highly informative samples  based on previous measurements and a corresponding estimate of  uncertainty.  This work was extended to an application in x-ray crystallography, in which the dynamic sampling strategy was used to produce high-quality crystal images with minimal x-ray damage to the crystal itself.  Related work led to an improved method for detecting and modeling neurons in rat hippocampus using fluorescence microscopy.  Finally, new theoretical foundations led to a general algorithm for combining multiple sources of information regarding an image reconstruction problem.  This method has applications to several forms of tomography and other sensing modalities and allows for the combination of physics-based models with empirical or machine learning algorithms that are not necessarily expressible in a standard optimization framework.   One graduate student was partially supported on this grant, one other  was mentored by the PI and took part in this research as a  collaborator, and two others, including a woman, were mentored by the PI  through the early stages of learning about this research area.  With  support of this grant, the PI and co-PI served as authors or co-authors on 15  refereed publications and one book chapter, delivered multiple  conference presentations each year, and organized a session for speakers at an IEEE  workshop in the UK.
