<AbstractNarration>The Configurable, High-speed, Extensible Research Bandwidth (CHERuB) project connects the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) and the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) to national research networks at 100Gbps for collaborative research in data-driven science and engineering. CHERuB supports multi-institutional data transit over research networks such as Internet2 and ESnet for analysis and distributed computing, such as that provided by SDSC's Gordon project, and collaboration, such as that facilitated by UCSD's LHC Tier-2 site. It includes an upgrade of the campus gateway to support CENIC's newly-installed 100G pipe between San Diego and Pacific Wave's 100G regional research network collective, and intra-campus infrastructure to facilitate high-speed access by targeted research activities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CHERuB enables advancement of knowledge in large cosmology, atmospheric science, high-energy physics and other fields by providing high-bandwidth connectivity between the researcher and national networks. The project allows scientific instruments to efficiently transport big data, removing the network as bottleneck in the course of scientific discovery. Simulation, visualization, measurement, and interactive experimentation is streamlined. Exploration of OpenFlow/OSCARS coordination with real-world data flows will help other research users understand how best to set up projects for large pipes/big data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beyond the initial science drivers, CHERuB establishes infrastructure to serve additional research projects on campus and across the country. UCSD shares what we learn via CHERuB about transmission and processing of big data across the national network infrastructure with other campuses. High bandwidth makes possible new instructional activities that cross institutions and locations, such as telemedicine and distributed distance learning.</AbstractNarration>
