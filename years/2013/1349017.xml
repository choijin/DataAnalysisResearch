<AbstractNarration>Future computing systems will allow computations to be performed simultaneously with massive parallelization. However, current practices in scientific simulations cannot utilize the maximum potential of these machines. This is fundamentally due to the need for data synchronization across computing cores, which may cause up to 80% idling of the machines, and there is a need for new methods to overcome this inefficiency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is to develop a new framework for high performance computing where synchronization across the processing elements is relaxed. This will eliminate the overhead associated with extreme parallelism and potentially lay the foundation for  simulations at scale. The framework is based on asynchronous model of computation for high performance computing to better utilize future  systems.  The price to pay for asynchrony is poor predictability of the code, resulting in uncertainty in the calculations. The central theme of this project is to accurately quantify this induced uncertainty and develop techniques to mitigate it. Specific research thrusts include: i) study of numerical stability, consistency and accuracy of widely used numerical algorithms, in the context of fluid-flow, under asynchronous conditions; ii) development of new schemes which can maintain its accuracy under asynchronous conditions; iii) determination of efficient implementations of the resulting algorithms on current and future systems. These research goals are addressed in a dynamical systems framework. The behavior of asynchronous numerical algorithms is modeled as Markov jump systems. Issues related to consistency, numerical stability and error control is addressed by using tools for analysis and design of Markov jump systems.</AbstractNarration>

We present a novel ``SplitandMerge" algorithm for propagation of state uncertainty in such systems, providing a unifying framework for the performance and robustness analysis of general stochastic jump linear systems.     2) Optimal Switching Synthesis of Jump Linear Systems.  In this work a new method to design an optimal switching sequence for jump linear systems with given Gaussian initial state uncertainty was developed. In the context of this project, we can think of optimal switching sequence synthesis to be randomized scheduling that has beneficial effects. In this study, we considered two algorithms with different computational complexity, and determined a scheduling policy, or probabilities of execution for each algorithm.

The stability of the numerical algorithm with randomized scheduling was modeled as a stochastic jump linear system and the performance metric was defined over the probability density function of the system state variables.      3) A Switched System Framework for Analysis of Asynchronous High Performance Computing Algorithm.  In this work we study massively parallel solution of 1D heat equation with relaxed communication between processing elements. This results in asynchronous execution.

In this work, we also present new techniques that circumvent this scalability issue. The proposed analysis framework is verified by solving the partial differential equation in a NVIDIA Tesla GPU machine, with asynchronous communication between cores. Key accomplishments in this are:  i. stability analysis or quantification of steady state error with respect to the synchronous solution,  ii. convergence rate analysis of the expected value of this error  iii. probabilistic bound on this error.     4) Numerical properties of asynchronous PDEs solvers:  In this work we have analyzed the overall stability, consistency and accuracy of commonly used finite difference schemes.
