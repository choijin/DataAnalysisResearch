<AbstractNarration>"The Future of Statistical Sciences" workshop will be held in London November 11-12, 2013. This research conference is the capstone event of the International Year of Statistics.  It is being organized by the same five societies (American Statistical Association (ASA), International Biometric Society (IBS), International Mathematical Society (IMS), International Statistical Institute (ISI), and the Royal Statistical Society (RSS)) that founded the International Year of Statistics. The Workshop will bring together not only researchers but thought leaders from across the globe, including junior researchers in statistics who are rising stars, scientists from data-intensive fields, funders, and professional science writers to discuss the current state and future directions of the statistical sciences and to consider actionable strategies for advancing the profession. Bringing these statistical and other leaders together with other participants through this Workshop will provide an extraordinary opportunity to enhance existing collaborations and build new ones, which will greatly enhance the future statistical workforce. In addition to these benefits, a greater online presence and publications in high-profile scientific journals, a paper on the current state and future directions of statistics and the statistical workforce will be developed and made widely available. More information about the conference can be found at: http://www.statistics2013.org/about-the-future-of-the-statistical-sciences-workshop/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award supports the participation of U.S. junior researchers, women, and members of underrepresented groups in an international workshop to be held in London November 11-12, 2013. The workshop is being put together by the five largest professional statistical societies in the world. Statisticians work in a vast array of fields: advancing science; creating new methodology; providing information that shapes public policy; making our medicines more effective, our food safer, and our planet better. Statisticians come from many cultures, speak many languages, and arrive at statistics as their profession through many paths. This workshop will showcase the breadth and importance of statistics and highlight the extraordinary opportunities for statistical research in the coming decade.  The workshop will bring together a diverse group of top statistical researchers, including many relatively young researchers, women and minorities, and thought leaders, including non-statisticians in diverse areas, and give them and other participants an opportunity to think about where statistics should go as a discipline and the lessons learned that can guide us in the future.  It will be a space in which statistical scientists and scientists in other fields can interact and develop a shared vision for the future.</AbstractNarration>
