<AbstractNarration>The purpose of this project is to provide travel support for US participants to attend the international conference 'Representation Theory 2013' at the Inter-University Conference Center in Dubrovnik, Croatia during the period of June 21-27, 2013 (http://www.iuc.hr).  The conference will cover a variety of topics in representation theory including Kac-Moody Lie algebras, vertex algebras and related structures, and representations of real and p-adic Lie groups.  The main goal of the conference is to gather experts and researchers to present the most recent developments in this dynamic field.  Some recent breakthroughs include new constructions of W-algebras, logarithmic tensor product theory for vertex algebras, construction of combinatorial bases for affine-type vertex algebras, new results in the theory of Macdonald polynomials, and an algorithm for computing the unitary dual of real Lie groups.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Representation theory is an important area of modern mathematics with many profound applications in both the mathematics and physics communities. The broader impacts of the proposed conference are twofold: training of younger scientists and dissemination of new results and techniques.  At this meeting we will take further steps to improve communication within and across research communities. We aim to encourage US researchers to seek stronger links with their colleagues from Europe. Several graduate students and junior faculty will be supported by this award, some of whom will give talks at the conference.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project provided travel support for US participant to attend the international conference "Representation Theory XIII, 2013",  Inter-University Center, Dubrovnik, Croatia, from July 21 to 27, 2013. The conference covered two main topics: vertex algebras and representations of reductive Lie groups.  Representation theory is an important branch of mathematics that has already made profound applications in many areas of mathematics. The intellectual merits of this project include further improvement of our knowledge and better understanding of vertex algebras (including  2-dimensional conformal field theory) and representation theory in general. At the meeting numerous talks were presented on various topics in representation theory.   The broader impacts were twofold:  training of younger scientists and dissemination of new results and techniques. At this meeting we made further steps to improve communication within and across research communities. Many contacts were established among US and European (especially Croatian) practitioners of representation theory. Several new collaborations were initiated.  We were able to support several graduate students, junior faculty and a few senior researchers without NSF travel support. This includes several participants from under represented groups. Thanks to generous NSF support, some of the world's biggest experts on this subject attended the meeting including J. Lepowsky and  Y.-Z. Huang.
