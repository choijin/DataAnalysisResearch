<AbstractNarration>The METER (Manufacturing, Engineering Technology, and Energy Ready) Scholars Program at Northeast Wisconsin Technical College (NWTC) addresses the important issue of supplying well-qualified graduates of STEM programs in areas of high demand in the Wisconsin workforce.  The program enhances the diversity of the STEM workforce by encouraging the participation of female students and other underrepresented students in STEM programs.  For example, through a partnership with the Oneida Tribe of Wisconsin, the project team is disseminating information about the METER Scholars program and is recruiting METERS Scholars from the American Indian population in the service area of NWTC.  Through the development and implementation of innovative educational and career preparation activities, the METER Scholars program is addressing the national imperative to retain undergraduates in STEM disciplines.  The combined cohort-building activities, noteworthy involvement of local industry and academic support structures incorporated into the METER Scholars Program provide a model for other similar institutions to adapt and implement to facilitate graduation of technical and community college STEM majors.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The METER Scholars Program provides S-STEM scholarships to 92 students. METER Scholars are pursuing associate's degrees in Electro-Mechanical Technology, Automation Engineering Technology, Utilities Engineering Technology, Solar Energy Technology, and Energy Management Technology.  Complementing the financial assistance provided through the scholarships, academic and career-readiness support mechanisms are available to the METER Scholars. Examples of support include cohorted sections of General Education courses, supplemental instruction and coaching, mentoring by NWTC faculty and industry professionals and networking opportunities through campus student organizations and industry tours.</AbstractNarration>
