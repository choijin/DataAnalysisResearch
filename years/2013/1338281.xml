<AbstractNarration>COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH :Integrated Data-Model Analysis of CO2-Climate-Vegetation Feedbacks in a Dynamic Paleo-Icehouse&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;by&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Isabel Montanez, Univ. California, Davis EAR-1338281&lt;br/&gt;Christopher Poulsen, Univ. Michigan, EAR-1338200&lt;br/&gt;Joseph White, Baylor University, EAR-1338247&lt;br/&gt;Michael Hren, Univ. Conneticutt, EAR-1338256&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;Overview: Vegetation-COÂ¬2-climate feedbacks have been shown to be an important component of the climate system, capable of perturbing atmospheric circulation, continental surface temperatures, and hydrological cycling on regional- to global-scales. Recent work indicates that vegetation-climate feedbacks likely had the potential to push the late Paleozoic climate system between glacial and interglacial states and to strongly modify the climate regime within these states. The details of the nature, time-scales, and potential impact of these feedbacks remain elusive. This multi-disciplinary project, driven by three interlinked hypotheses, addresses these shortcomings and analyzes the roles of CO2- and orbital-forcing and vegetation-climate feedbacks in promoting glacial-interglacial transitions on eccentricity- to multi-million year time-scales:  &lt;br/&gt;- The response of vegetation to primarily CO2-driven glacial-interglacial transitions depended on the timing, magnitude and duration of CO2 forcing and whether critical ecological thresholds were reached.&lt;br/&gt;- Tropical vegetation, by way of physiological forcing, impacted low-latitude climate and water &amp; C cycling&lt;br/&gt;- Vegetation-climate feedbacks - on a global-scale - amplified radiatively forced glacial-interglacial transitions through changes in direct surface forcing and terrestrial C &amp; N cycling.&lt;br/&gt;These hypotheses are being tested through integrated empirical, experimental and multi-scale modeling approaches across a spectrum of time- (10 to 1,000,000 yr) and spatial-scales (leaf-to-canopy-to-global climate system). Climate-CO2-vegetation feedbacks, including the role of plant physiological forcing of climate will be assessed through a two-stage modeling effort that will first reformulate a terrestrial biosphere model (BIOME-BGC) using the empirical and experimental results coupled with modeling sensitivity experiments to define plant functional traits for late Paleozoic PFTs. In the second stage, we will incorporate these PFT traits into NCAR's fully coupled Community Earth System Model and use this version to investigate glacial-interglacial dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This research will generate the first high-resolution, high-precision reconstruction of atmospheric CO2 during the LPIA, which when incorporated into the climate modeling will provide insight into the evolution of earth system processes, including the terrestrial biosphere, in an icehouse under changing CO2 levels relevant to our long-term future. This study will be the first modification of terrestrial biosphere models to account for paleo-PFT traits and investigation of paleovegetation-climate feedbacks thus providing an improved understanding of the potential of non-angiosperm plants to influence hydrologic and C cycling through physiological forcing.  &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: Cross-disciplinary training and mentoring will occur through in-residence internships for the Ph.D. students.  Underrepresented students to Earth and environmental sciences will be integrated through a range of summer and academic year internships and programs at the collaborating institutions.  This study will contribute directly to a Carboniferous exhibit planned for the Paleontological Halls of the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution. All data generated by this study will be archived and shared via publications, and web-accessible tools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report  Collaborative Research:  Earth-Life Transitions: Integrated Data-Model Analysis of CO2-Climate-Vegetation Feedbacks in a Dynamic Paleo-Icehouse     This collaborative project involving PIs from 6 universities and the Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, as well as collaborators from two other universities, focused on the Earth?s penultimate icehouse? the late Paleozoic icehouse, 300 million years ago.  This was a time of the Earth?s earliest tropical forests, the introduction of wildfire on continents, and the only record we have of a glacial state, comparable to today, that turned over to a permanent ice-free greenhouse.   Our research tested three hypotheses that reflect important paradigms in the scientific community or scientific questions that remain unresolved. These hypotheses that were the focus of the study overall addressed the response of the late Paleozoic tropical forest plants to greenhouse gas-driven climate change and in turn, how the tropical vegetation, by way of physiological forcing, impacted the climate and influenced the cycling of water and carbon on Earth during this time.  Intellectual Merit: There are multiple outcomes and findings of the award that have impact on the scientific discipline.   First, we reconstructed how CO2 conditions in the atmosphere varied over a 40 million-year time period of this paleo-icehouse and its demise.  As part of this effort we applied novel approaches to estimating past CO2 concentrations involving the use of both minerals from fossil soils and well-preserved plant fossils.  Second, we introduced a new approach to study fossil plants ? what we refer to as reconstructing the 'whole plant' physiology of some of the first vascular plants. As part of this work, we have modified an existing process-based ecosystem model (BIOME BGC), which is used by many researchers to understand how terrestrial ecosystems function and interact with their environment, for use in the deep time and have made it publicly available through publication.  The modifications to the ecosystem model permit the assessment of plant functioning in the deep time based on fossil-derived data as input parameters. In turn we used this model to reconstruct the physiology of the extinct early vascular plants and to assess their influence on surface conditions and regional climate. Third, we substantially refined the record of the strontium isotopic composition of seawater over a 40 million-year period of this paleo-icehouse.  We used this reconstruction to compare to published records of seawater chemistry and contributed to a growing understanding in the scientific community that ancient records of seawater compositions may be decoupled from those of the open ocean, with implications for interpreting proxy records from the deep time.  And lastly, we contributed to an effort with collaborators to demonstrate the insight and constraints that can be provided for interpreting proxy records built using fossils and ancient mineral chemistry by using an isotope-enabled Earth System model.  Broader Impacts:  This award supported the education and mentoring of two graduate students at UC Davis, who were mentored by the PI and co-PIs of this grant. One of these students is a first-generation university student and of Mexican-American descent. The PI also mentored an undergraduate student, who is a Mexican-American and the first in his immediate family to obtain a college-level education, on a project related to the award.  Two female graduate students were co-mentored by the PI in collaboration with a co-PI at the University of Michigan and a co-PI at University College Dublin.
