<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2013 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist.  The title of the project for this fellowship to Nicholas Brubaker is "Mathematical Modeling of Capillary and Electro-Capillary Origami." The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Arizona, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Joceline Lega.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The spontaneous organization of objects (i.e., self-assembly) arises in all areas of life, constructing a diverse range of organic and inorganic entities. At the micro-scale, the organization is done through an efficient bottom-up approach that potentially could provide the breakthrough necessary for feasibly fabricating true nanoscale devices. One the most promising methods, known as capillary origami, is based on interfacial bonding: a liquid?s surface attempts to minimize it area so that objects living on the interface or located at the boundary of the interface experience a force of attraction. The force, known as surface tension, can be used to deform and bond structures together, like in the coalescence of wet hair.  In capillary origami a droplet of water is placed on top of a thin sheet. The surface tension deforms the sheet into an equilibrium configuration, and the size of the deformation is directly related to the competition between the interfacial tension and the sheet?s rigidity. As liquid is removed through either passive (evaporation) or active processes, the thin sheet will further wrap around the subsequently smaller drop. Under appropriate conditions, the sheet should fully encapsulate the liquid to create a three-dimensional structure that is predetermined by its initial cutout.   This award supported the mathematical modeling of capillary origami, for both two and three-dimensional configurations, and the analysis of such models to predict folding criteria.  Our work has led to a unified differential-geometric approach for studying the capillary induced equilibrium deformations of thin elastic structures. The approach is done from a two-dimensional energetic perspective where no boundary conditions are assumed and isometries are enforced in the admissible set of functions. The framework is robust, facilitates the complete characterization of equilibrium behavior of elasto-capillary systems, and is extendable to other elastic deformation scenarios arising in small-scale applications.Also, we have taken the first steps to building a general three-dimensional theory, which is much more difficult due to the inherent geometric complications involved with surfaces.  One major practical impact of our work was the identification of three parameter regimes of behavior, opposed to the previously observed two regimes discovered experimentally. Parameter regime 1 is where configurations do not fold under evaporation, i.e., surface tension is too weak to induce large sheet deformations; Parameter regime 2 is where configurations do fold after evaporation; and Parameter regime 3 is where configurations do fold under evaporation and there is a region of initial liquid volume where the configuration will instantaneously fold.   The existence of the third regime of behavior is an important discovery because it predicts that the sheet can immediately encapsulate the drop if the initial volumes are within a certain interval.That is, even with a low energy input, the fully folded state can be reached without evaporation. While the existence of this behavior has only been shown in the two-dimensional system, we still expect the qualitative predictions to be true in three dimensions since it is also governed by same dimensionless parameter.In fact, we have used simple experiments with common plastic wrap and soap bubble&mdash;a setup minimally influenced by gravity and, thus, occupying the same parameter regime&mdash;to rapidly fold triangles into pyramid.
