<AbstractNarration>Networks (or graphs) can represent the relationships in complex systems with myriad interacting elements.  Two primary examples are social networks that represents the set of friendships in a group of people and biological networks that represent the functional relationships between proteins in a living cell.  Many substantive questions can be phrased as questions of (a) the network structure and (b) supplementary measurements on the actors and their relationships.  This project will provide a statistical framework to simultaneously analyze relational (i.e. network) data and its contextualizing measurements.  The primary objective is to study the joint variability between the relational data and covariate measurements on the actors in the network.  A secondary objective is to begin studying the joint variability among a sample of networks on the same set of actors.  In both objectives, this project will (1) propose a general nonparametric model and a set of simple parametric models, (2) devise fast spectral estimators, and (3) provide estimation theory that examines the statistical performance of the spectral estimators under the nonparametric and parametric models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the age of big data, data sets are both larger and more complex, often coming from measurements on complex systems with myriad interacting elements;  social and biological networks can represent the relationships in complex systems and these substantive questions are, in essence, questions regarding networks.  The biological networks in the ENCODE research are an example.  Moreover, the relationships in complex systems are often measured with a rich set of supplemental information on the actors and their relationships.  This research program will provide a statistical framework, including models, algorithms, and theory, to study the supplemental information in tandem with the network, thereby contextualizing the network and the relationships.</AbstractNarration>

Spectral methods provide a set of computationally feasible techniques to study the broad structures of these networks.  This proposal studies and builds upon the popular "spectral clustering" algorithm. In a social network, this algorithm finds clusters or communities of individuals. There are two broad questions that were addressed in the funded research.  1)  [Sparse Graphs] The basic spectral clustering algorithm performs poorly in the "sparse regime," i.e. when there are few friendships that connect people; can this be fixed?  2) [Contextual Information] In many applied settings, we have additional information beyond the simple network;  I refer to these as contextualized networks because the additional information gives situational information that might describe the nature of the relationships. Spectral clustering does not use this extra information.  How can we include it?    Both objectives are discussed below.  1) SPARSE GRAPHS:  The paper "Regularized Spectral Clustering under the Degree Corrected Stochastic Blockmodel" provides the first theory that demonstrated the advantages of "regularization" in sparse graphs.  Denote  the number of people in the network as N. Previously, it was required that every person has at least log N friends; our theory only requires that the average number of friends is at least log N.  This paper appeared at Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS, a top machine learning conference) in 2013.    2) CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION:  This is the core focus of the grant. The funded research studied three types of network contextualization: a) edge values, b) edge directions, and c) node covariates.    2a  Contextualized with edge values:  Contextualizing with edge values leads to questions and methodologies that resembles Factor Analysis.  In collaboration with three faculty members in the UW Madison School of Education, our paper "Latent Factors in Student-Teacher Interaction Factor Analysis" studies the network that connects students and teachers; edges represent that the student took a class with the teacher and edge values measure the quality of their interaction (e.g. test scores).  We show how  this information can be used to find types of students and types of teachers, such that good (or bad) interactions can be predicted once you know the student's type and the teacher's type.   Motivated by this research, we proposed an improved algorithm and theory for handling this type of data.  The additional theory is in the paper "Asymptotic Theory for Estimating the Singular Vectors and Values of a Partially-observed Low Rank Matrix with Noise."  This theory provides the limiting distribution for what is commonly referred to as the "scree plot" in Factor Analysis.  Moreover, the estimator proposed in this paper is easier to compute compared to competing estimators.   Motivated by the new estimator proposed in the theory paper, we devised a new algorithm that adaptively estimates the noise level.  The improved algorithm is described in our manuscript "Intelligent Initialization and Adaptive Thresholding for Iterative Matrix Completion; Some Statistical and Algorithmic Theory for Adaptive-Impute."   2b  Contextualized with edge direction: In many graphs, the relationships are asymmetric.  What additional information can be estimated with these asymmetries? "Co-clustering for Directed Graphs; the Stochastic Co-Blockmodel and a Spectral Algorithm" shows how the edge direction allows for entirely novel inferences. This paper appeared in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in October 2016.    2c  Contextualized with node covariates:  Broadly speaking, there are two different types of information on the "actors" in the network (i.e. node covariates), low dimensional and high dimensional.  Motivated by two separate applications, we have two different methodologies to address these cases.   Diffusion Tensor Imaging creates a brain graph where we also know the physical location of each node. This is a low dimensional covariate (3 dimensions). We want to use these data to cluster the brain into distinct regions.  We propose a new spectral algorithm to include the physical location of the nodes, give some theoretical results, and demonstrate its speed and estimation performance on large brain graphs with up to 500 million connections (the algorithm easily scales larger).

This technique scales to hundreds of thousands of nodes and thousands of covariates.       Last Modified: 10/29/2017       Submitted by: Karl G Rohe]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
