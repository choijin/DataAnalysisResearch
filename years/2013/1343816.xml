<AbstractNarration>EarthCube Building Blocks: Community Inventory of EarthCube Resources for Geoscience Interoperability&lt;br/&gt;(CINERGI) Collaborating Institutions: University of California San Diego, Arizona Geological&lt;br/&gt;Survey, University of Chicago, Columbia University, The Open Geospatial Consortium This building&lt;br/&gt;block project focuses on constructing a community inventory and knowledgebase on geoscience&lt;br/&gt;information resources to extend work on interoperability-readiness and meet the challenge of finding resources across&lt;br/&gt;disciplines, assessing their fitness for use in specific research scenarios, and providing&lt;br/&gt;tools for integrating and re-using data from multiple domains. This capability is a key EarthCube&lt;br/&gt;mission mentioned in reports of several EarthCube domain workshops and roadmaps. We envision&lt;br/&gt;a comprehensive system linking geoscience resources, users, publications, usage information,&lt;br/&gt;and cyberinfrastructure (CI) components. It will supplement information included in existing&lt;br/&gt;data discovery catalogs by integrating feedback from users on their experience with resources,&lt;br/&gt;by providing characterization of resources in an interoperability assessment framework, and&lt;br/&gt;by supporting registration of mappings between information models and vocabularies to assist&lt;br/&gt;data integration. To assess interoperability among components an open source validation mechanism&lt;br/&gt;will be implemented. The system will enable community input and access by geoscientists via&lt;br/&gt;online user interfaces, and will provide documented web service APIs so that inventory information&lt;br/&gt;can be easily browsed, analyzed, and integrated within the emerging EarthCube CI. The project&lt;br/&gt;team will collaborate with related EarthCube efforts, including Building Blocks, RCNs, domain&lt;br/&gt;workshop and the Test Enterprise Governance. The PIs will work with researchers from selected geoscience domains&lt;br/&gt;(stratigraphy, hydrology, critical zone science) to validate and demonstrate advanced features&lt;br/&gt;of CINERGI in specific research context.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CINERGI is a direct response to the communitys need for easy discovery, assessment, and utilization&lt;br/&gt;of CI resources, expressed by many EarthCube stakeholders. It is a fundamental building block&lt;br/&gt;of an Earth Science CI and will serve geoscientists across all domains to efficiently and&lt;br/&gt;in more informed manner use existing and emerging resources for productive and transformative&lt;br/&gt;research. It will also help CI experts and computer scientists to align new developments better&lt;br/&gt;with existing resources such as vocabularies, ontologies, data exchange protocols, or metadata&lt;br/&gt;schemas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  While several large-scale text-based search engines such as Google Search help users find text documents published on the web, finding research data still requires scientists to search across specialized data repositories. This becomes a daunting task in multi-disciplinary studies, where researchers often need to explore many such repositories with search organization and terminology specific to each domain. Descriptions of datasets and other resources (metadata) might have different formatting and content, and support different types of discovery. Further, the metadata might be incomplete, non-standard or poorly curated, as it often relies on human researchers populating metadata fields after the research has been completed. It is not surprising that finding appropriate data has been a persistent bottleneck in multidisciplinary geoscience research.   The EarthCube CINERGI (Community Inventory of Earthcube Resources for Geoscience Interoperability) project addressed this challenge by compiling a large-scale inventory of resources used by geoscientists, and by creating technology to automatically improve metadata descriptions so that resources are easier to find and integrate into research workflows.   Over 1 million metadata records, harvested from geoscience data facilities or contributed by geoscientists through workshops, surveys, or other channels, are now indexed for searching through the project portal (cinergi.sdsc.edu). The information comes from government and academic data repositories and projects, representing multiple Earth Science domains. The CINERGI project, however, goes well beyond simple metadata aggregation from these sources. The metadata records retrieved from the repositories have been processed using the CINERGI metadata augmentation pipeline to improve metadata quality. The pipeline uses a large geoscience ontology and text analytics to assign keywords with references to ontology classes, to derive spatial extents based on place names found in the metadata records, and to add organization identifiers.

Project results contributed to the technical foundation of several other EarthCube projects, and to several data-discovery research scenarios. The project has engaged early career researchers, as well students at several levels (graduate, undergraduate, and high school) in metadata generation and assessment, and in software development.
