<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to establish a platform that processes like 2D and functions like 3D. Specifically, the strain-induced self-rolled-up tubular membrane nanotechnology, developed as a direct result of the PI's CAREER grant, will be exploited for 3D spiral inductors with dramatically reduced footprint and enhanced electrical performance. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is to shine light on the strain energy releasing mechanism with transient boundary conditions and localized stress control; and explore magnetic field confinement and magnetic energy storage ability in 3D architectures involving metal-insulator hybrid hierarchical materials and geometries. The unique approach of producing 3D architectures through 2D processing is transformative because it changes fundamentally the conflicting requirement between increasing inductance and reducing substrate related parasitic effect; and by passes mechanical stability issues associated with processing on 3D structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are to help establishing a platform technology for a wide range of applications using heterogeneously integrated 3D architectures, including guiding biological cell growth, resonators, plasmonic waveguide, metamaterials, and sensors operating in unprecedented frequency range. An education module on rolling-up inductors will be established and incorporated in the syllabus of a new experimental course on advanced nanotechnology for undergraduate students and tailored for high school demonstration. The interdisciplinary nature of this program will provide opportunities for the PI to create a more inclusive and dynamic environment for mentoring.</AbstractNarration>
