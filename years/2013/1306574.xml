<AbstractNarration>This action funds an NSF National Plant Genome Initiative Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2013. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow who also presents a plan to broaden participation in biology. The title of the research and training plan for this fellowship to Robert L. Baker is "Genome wide Associations between Anatomy, Crop-specific Resource Allocation Strategies, and Water Use Efficiency." The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Wyoming and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Cynthia Weinig and Brent Ewers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Stomatal conductance, hydraulic conductance, and resource partitioning to roots, stems, and leaves are components of water-use efficiency (WUE), a critical determinant of crop yield. Understanding the genetic basis of anatomical and physiological changes that improve WUE is relevant globally as human population growth places increasing pressure on available water. Historically, there are three geographic centers of Brassica (B.) rapa cultivation (Europe, India, and Asia), each including two or more crop types: brocolettos, turnips, cabbages, and seed oils. B. rapa is an excellent model to link anatomy to WUE patterns because different organs are targeted for harvest among crop types, which exhibit characteristic differences in organ-specific water use and allocation.  This research investigates the genetic architecture of leaf, stem, and root anatomy, resource allocation, and gas exchange in diverse cultivars of B. rapa. The research includes collecting anatomical data through thin sections, quantifying whole-plant resource allocation, and developing single nucleotide polymorphism markers through next-generation sequencing. Genetic distances among crop types will be tested for correlations with phenotypic matrices of root, stem, and leaf structure to elucidate the anatomical features that contribute to differences in photosynthesis and conductance among crop types. Genome wide association studies will be used to catalogue specific genomic regions affecting anatomical phenotypes of interest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training objectives include genomics, bioinformatics, and statistical genetics. Broader impacts include developing and implementing a durable training platform in histological techniques for undergraduates. One-on-one work with graduate and undergraduate students will provide for teaching and training opportunities while completing the proposed research.</AbstractNarration>

Understanding the genetic basis of anatomical and physiological changes that improve crop WUE is relevant globally as human population growth places increasing pressure on available water. Global and regional precipitation and future water supplies are also increasingly unpredictable as a consequence of climate change. In particular, climate model simulations project precipitation decreases in some sub-tropical and lower mid-latitude regions, including much of the western United States.</p> <p>To meet these challenges, Baker was investigated the relationship between plant structure (anatomy &amp; morphology) and function (physiology) and assessed the genetic underpinnings of the relationship with the ultimate goal of informing plant breeding programs aimed at increasing sustainable agriculture. Over the course of several experiments, Baker and colleagues assessed leaf-level morphology (leaf size, shape, and thickness) and anatomy in a wide range of plants from the agronomically important genus <em>Brassica</em> (which includes canola, rape-seed, kohlrabi, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, kale, Chinese cabbages, bok choys, mustard seeds, and turnips). Baker and colleagues also assessed leaf-level physiology including water use efficiency (WUE), stomatal conductance (g<sub>s</sub>) and photosynthetic capacity (<em>A<sub>max</sub></em>) of these plants under a variety of environmental conditions including across multiple years of field cultivation, in crowded and uncrowded environments, and in greenhouse and growth chambers. Baker was awarded an additional travel grant from the University of Wyoming to attend advanced training at the University of Washington&rsquo;s Summer Institute for Statistical Genetics. Baker employed the techniques learned to investigate the underlying genetic diversity of the plants in question through next-generation genomic sequencing techniques. Connections between plant anatomy, morphology, and their underlying genomic determinants assessed.</p> <p>The work by Baker and colleagues has several significant scientific outcomes with potential for improving <em>Brassica</em> breeding programs as well as implications for other crop systems.&nbsp; First, Baker et al demonstrate that there are unique genetic factors that contribute to leaf size vs. leaf shape.&nbsp; Further, while leaf size is correlated with aspects of water use efficiency and crop yield, leaf shape is not. Leaf shape is known to impact desiccation resistance among plants.&nbsp; The findings of Baker et all therefore demonstrate that it is possible to alter leaf shape and improve desiccation resistance without negatively impacting leaf size or size-correlated traits such as water use efficiency and yield.</p> <p>Baker and colleagues also looked across diverse <em>Brassica</em> species and explored how structure-function relationships evolved, in particular how multiple independent cross-species hybridization and whole-genome-duplication events effects these structure-function relationships.&nbsp; Baker and colleagues found that structure-function relationships changed over evolutionary time, and identified particularly labile relationships as potential targets for further crop improvement and breeding programs.</p> <p>During the fellowship, Baker published 5 papers; a sixth paper is in review and three additional papers are currently being written.&nbsp; The data collected during the course of this fellowship is projected to lead to a further four manuscripts.&nbsp; During the course of this work, Baker also contributed to related projects that should result in an additional three papers. In sum, the work conducted as part of the fellowship will yield a final total of 13 peer reviewed publications.</p> <p>As part of his research, Baker was also tasked with broaden participation in science through undergraduate and graduate mentorship and development of a durable research platform for plant anatomy at the University of Wyoming.

This project shared the artistic side of science with a diversity of intellectual and artistic communities in an exhibition of 15-20 final works, including prints, digital 3D models, and sculptures. The goal was to produce works of art that are evocative and visually appealing to non-scientists.&nbsp; The exhibition helped bridge the divide between the public and scientists by presenting aspects of scientific research that often seem arcane in an accessible, compelling, and artistic manner.
