<AbstractNarration>This award is for the support of the Southern California Number Theory Day (SCNTD) Conference Series at the University of California-San Diego.  The first conference will be held September 20-22, 2013.  The other two SCNTD conferences will be one-day meetings that are organized on a Saturday in 2014 and 2015 and will consist of 4 or 5 one-hour, high-quality lectures on the latest research in number theory and related areas (for example, model theory, cryptography, or algebraic geometry), given by research leaders in these fields who also have a reputation for their excellent expository skills.  The first eight meetings (2005-2012) have each brought together an average of 40 participants from universities, FFRDC's, and liberal arts colleges in Southern California, ranging from beginning graduate students to senior faculty and researchers.  The speakers at the SCNTD conferences are an internationally diverse group of number theorists, speaking on a wide variety of topics.  The lectures are designed to promote research and to encourage fruitful interactions among researchers at various stages of their careers.  One of the main goals of the conferences is to disseminate the latest research in number theory and related areas.  The SCNTD conferences offer their participants the opportunity to interact with scholars from other institutions, and also give graduate students and postdocs the opportunity to interact with more senior mathematicians in an informal setting, conducive to learning and collaboration.  Most universities and colleges in Southern California have small number theory groups which makes it difficult to maintain regular and active number theory seminars.  The SCNTD conferences have become a very effective way to bring together a critical mass of number theorists in a way that most of these institutions individually could not possibly afford.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The current award will fund the next three Southern California Number Theory Day meetings at UC San Diego in 2013, 2014 and 2015.  Due to several recent breakthroughs in the area of research related to Stark's Conjectures (deep conjectural links between analytic mathematical objects called L-functions and discrete mathematical objects called global units), the first of these meetings, to be organized on September 20-22 of 2013, will be a three-day conference entitled "Stark's Conjectures and related topics", consisting of 15 one-hour lectures delivered by the most recent main contributors to this exciting area of research in modern number theory.  The conference has been broadly advertised and the organizers will make special efforts to encourage and fund the participation of graduate students and young researchers who have showed interest and potential in this area of research.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Under this award, the PI organized five conferences in number theory and related topics at the University of California at San Diego: a three day conference in 2013 dedicated to mathematics emerging from Stark's conjectures on special values of L-functions, consisting of 15 one hour lectures and attended by over 70 participants; two one day conferences in 2015  each consisting of 4 one hour lectures and attended by 50 and 70 participants, respectively. The first of these conferences was dedicated to number theory broadly construed and the second to mathematics emerging from the influential work of John Tate; a one day conference in 2016 on number theory broadly construed, consisting of 4 one hour lectures and attended by over 50 participants; a two day conference in 2017 on number theory broadly construed, consisting of 6 one hour lectures and attended by over 50 participants.  The goal of these conferences has been to bring together research mathematicians of all ages from Southern California working in areas related to Number Theory, expose them to some of the latest developments through high quality lectures given by world leaders in the field, and give them the opportunity to interact with one another, start new collaborations, and create this way a sense of community among the number theorists in the area.  This conference series was founded by the PI in 2003, and with its 1-2 meetings per year ever since has contributed to spurring an impressive amount of new high quality research activity in number theory in Southern California, mostly purely theoretical but also applied to cryptography and coding, especially due to a constant high rate of attendance by mathematicians working in these areas  as employees of the Federal Government.  This conference series is broadly advertised through well maintained websites and several email announcements every year and it promotes participation (both in the speaker and the simple attendant categories) from underrepresented groups. It also strongly encourages broad participation (sometime with ample financial support) among young number theorists, both graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.  The facilities, financial and staff support provided by UC San Diego for this conference series are first class.
