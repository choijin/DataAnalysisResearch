<AbstractNarration>The hurricane genesis process is known to depend on the degree of vertical instability needed to support deep convection and on mid-level moistening, which modulates convective activity. However, the time variation of moistening is poorly known due to the lack of high temporal and spatial observations during the genesis process. Global Positioning System (GPS) Radio Occultation (RO) provides area-averaged profiles of refractivity (which depends on moisture and temperature) with very high vertical resolutions that are complementary to dropsondes (pointwise, high vertical resolution) and satellite retrievals (high horizontal but poor vertical resolution). GPS RO is insensitive to heavy precipitation, clouds, and winds.  Since the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and Climate (COSMIC) became operational, space borne GPS RO data have shown a positive impact on global numerical weather prediction models in the mid to upper troposphere range.  However, the use of the data at lower levels has lagged for several reasons: 1) complications due to strong horizontal variations in moisture 2) difficulties in signal tracking and 3) sparse observations within the window of interest for mesoscale systems. This has led to minimal impact in tropical cyclone genesis and forecasting, and minimal impact below mid-troposphere in general. Airborne RO can play a major role in advancing understanding of the hurricane genesis process, because dense targeted measurements are simpler to make with an airborne system than with the existing space borne constellation. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will take advantage of a unique opportunity to collect data during the Pre-Depression Investigation of Cloud Systems of the Tropics (PREDICT) campaign in August 2010, which will allow them to test their progress in data assimilation for the case of tropical cyclone genesis.  The data assimilation results should be of great interest to PREDICT investigators because they will provide better initial conditions for high-resolution models for testing new hypotheses concerning the evolution of tropical disturbances into hurricanes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The project will promote the use of airborne radio occultation to an expanded research community and serve as a feasibility test for hurricane hunter surveillance missions, potentially resulting in a direct societal benefit from improved operational forecasts. This research activity will educate graduate students and promote the advancement of postdoctoral researchers within an international collaborative structure between Taiwan and US universities. It will strengthen research programs led by four female investigators, who will serve as role models for their students as well as other young female scientists.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit: A new atmospheric observation system, the GNSS Instrument System for Multistatic and Occultation Sensing (GISMOS), has been developed for observing moisture from aircraft using signals that are transmitted from Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites.   The aircraft is equipped with a GPS receiver that measures the time it takes the GPS signal to get from the GPS satellite to the aircraft. In the standard use of GPS data, the signal travel time is divided by the speed of light to calculate the distance to the satellite, and the measurements of distance are used to locate the aircraft precisely.

By making these observations as GPS satellites set, the signal passes lower and lower through the atmosphere, and we can retrieve measurements at each height. This technique is called airborne GPS radio occultation (ARO) [Haase et al., 2014].  The amount of moisture as a function of height in the tropical regions greatly affects how hurricanes develop. We flew the new GISMOS system during the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season over areas where hurricanes had the potential to develop. GISMOS provides high vertical resolution profiles that are insensitive to clouds and precipitation, and provides greater control than spaceborne RO observation systems on the sampling location to be near tropical cyclones, and is therefore useful for targeted regional studies. We developed new techniques for analyzing the GPS ARO data to improve their accuracy and we verified that the system was giving reliable observations by comparing it to the types of dropsonde measurements that the Hurricane Hunters release from their aircraft [Murphy, 2015; Murphy et al., 2015; Wang, 2015; Wang et al., 2015].  The feasibility of the system was demonstrated with flights carried out during development of an Atlantic tropical storm, before it went on to develop into category 5 hurricane Karl that brought torrential rains and flooding to parts of Mexico.  The GISMOS airborne RO system increased the number of height profiles available for studying development of tropical storms by more than 50% over what was available from dropsondes alone during this campaign. The data are being put into weather models to examine how the measurements could improve hurricane forecasting in the future. The observations suggest that it is important to measure the largest variations of moisture that occur in the range between 4-6 km during the tropical storm genesis stage. This is the first study to publish results showing how airborne RO can be used to study weather systems.     Broader Impacts:  After these results were achieved, the system was deployed on the NOAA Gulfstream IV jet used for storm reconnaissance over the northwest Pacific Ocean. If a smaller automated version of the system is developed, it could potentially also be deployed on commercial aircraft in the future to help improve aviation weather forecasting.  The project provided support for four graduate students for their PhD Theses [Muradyan, 2012; Murphy, 2015; Wang, 2015] (two female), and two undergraduate student interns. The project provided support for three graduate students (two female) to participate with the PI in the field data collection, which trained them in state of the art instrumentation operation, gave them forecasting experience in collaboration with National Hurricane Center staff, and introduced them to many members of the hurricane research community in the context of the Tri-Agency cooperation among NSF PREDICT, NASA GRIP, and NOAA IFEX campaigns. These graduate students along with the other early career scientists participating in this campaign published an independent journal article on their contribution and learning experience [Evans et al., 2012].
