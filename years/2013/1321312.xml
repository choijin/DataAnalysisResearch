<AbstractNarration>A request is made by the University of Washington to fund additional and replacement instrumentation for the R/V Thompson, a 274? general purpose, global class research vessel, and R/V Barnes, a 66-foot coastal research vessel, both operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System research fleet. These platforms provide facilities for conducting oceanographic research funded by the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies. The instrumentation they  propose to acquire will provide operational flexibility to projects that are embarked upon both vessels, will address some deficiencies noted during the fall 2011 NSF vessel inspections, and will increase their capacity to do useful science and data collection during transits between funded cruises.. In order of priority, they propose to purchase the following: &lt;br/&gt;   &lt;br/&gt;Magnetometer cable upgrade from SIO/STS $18,607 &lt;br/&gt;Magnetometer SDSL data uplink from WHOI $16,425 &lt;br/&gt; $35,032 &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts       &lt;br/&gt;The principal impact of the present proposal is under criterion two of the Proposal Guidelines. They provide infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award enabled the University of Washington (UW) School of Oceanography to acquire a custom built tow cable for our existing Marine Magnetics SeaSpy Magnetometer.  Personnel at Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) had developed improvements to the standard vendor-supplied tow cable and connector for the magnetometer that strengthens the connector and reduces water leakage into the connector and the core of the cable.  This new style connector and cable improves signal quality and decreases the chance for failure during use. The data collected by this instrumentation can be utilized by scientists studying complex physical and geological processes within the world's oceans. The knowledge gained from these studies has applications related to plate tectonics, seismic activity, and paleooceanography.  Our magnetometer has been used by scientists from UW and several other oceanographic institutions in the past, and this cable will increase our operational flexibility for deploying it from several of the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System vessels in the future.  We requested and were granted a one year no cost extension of the original award to complete the fabrication and delivery of the cable to accommodate the availability of the personnel at SIO to build a cable for us and to obtain the parts required from a variety of vendors.  The cable was completed and received by us in spring 2014.       Last Modified: 04/03/2015       Submitted by: William S Wilcock]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
