<AbstractNarration>Ocean-atmosphere scientists have for many years been studying how bubbles in ocean whitecaps influence the exchange of gases across the air-sea interface. Bubbles provide greater contact surface area between air and water, and the over-pressure of gases in submerged bubbles forces their dissolution. Sea spray droplets likewise increase the effective surface area of the atmosphere-ocean interface, yet little is known of their role in air-sea gas exchange, or their effectiveness compared to bubbles. Understanding the exchange of atmospheric green-house gases such as CO2 into the global ocean is important to global warming and ocean acidification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will use a microphysical model and knowledge of the rate at which spray droplets are produced to evaluate the role of sea spray in enhancing air-sea gas exchange, and compare this to other sea-air gas exchange rates, and mechanisms.</AbstractNarration>

The overarching goal was to determine the role of sea spray in air-sea gas transfer. Upon initial evaluation of the sea spray generation functions it was clear that there were order of magnitude discrepancies within these and thus we conducted a review of spray generation functions. This review considers all functions proposed to date and ascertains the appropriateness of each within the experimental or theoretical parameters from which they were derived. The PIs have narrowed the range by choosing upper and lower boundary functions and the most likely representative functions that fall between these. By assessing these the PIs were then able to estimate a maximum contribution of sea spray at different wind speeds. <strong>This manuscript </strong>is to be submitted July 2017. A <strong>second manuscript </strong>to be submitted in September 2017 by lead author Allison Staniec who is the PhD student supported on this grant quantifies the gas exchanged for 4 noble gases over the range of wind speeds based on the spray generation functions derived in the review manuscript. Allison has dedicated her time over the last year in transferring Edward Andreas&rsquo;s (our late collaborators) Fortran codes to MatLab and adding the chemical components of our model to these. Generally the PIs have found that gas exchange through sea spray is less than 1% of the total gas exchanged at wind speeds under 15 m/s but steadily increases its contribution thereafter <strong>reaching up to 10%</strong>. Spray and jet droplets are a very small fraction of the overall droplet enhanced gas exchange at &gt;15m/s and rather <strong>it is the large spume drops (&gt;100 microns radii) that dominate gas exchange.</strong> Because these drops are too large to reside in the atmosphere for long periods of time, they re-enter the sea surface with relatively little evaporative loss. These spume drops do reside in the atmosphere long enough to reach thermal equilibrium and thus the major control of gas exchange of spume drops is the <strong>temperature gradient </strong>between air and water. These results are clearly elaborated on in Staniec et al. (in prep). The <strong>final publication </strong>is in collaboration with Magdalena Anguelova from ONR who will take the results from Staniec et al and apply them on a global scale to achieve a seasonal and regional analysis of sea spray droplet contributions within representative wind fiels and temperature gradient combinations. This analysis is planned for fall 2017 and manuscript submission is planned for spring 2018. To date there have been <strong>three peer reviewed publications </strong>that have resulted from the last two years and <strong>several conference presentations</strong>. This project has also trained a <strong>young female scientist Allison Staniec </strong>who has applied her STEM training in physics and chemistry to this interdisciplinary problem. From an outreach and broader impacts perspective, the project has generated <strong>animations</strong> that the PIs plan to integrate in learning materials for the general public and finally has led to a <strong>new collaboration with Magdalena Anguelova at ONR </strong>and <strong>Merete Bilde at the University of Arhus in Denmark</strong>. Both Staniec and Vlahos will be working with Dr. Bilde during a 5 week visit to Denmark on linkages in sea spray and aerosols under pristine and non-pristine conditions (with organics) to evaluate differences in gas exchange. Dr. Bilde&rsquo;s doctoral student will then spend a semester in the US in Dr. Vlahos&rsquo;s group in Fall 2018. This award has stimulated several new collaborations, a better understanding of the contributions of sea spray and an unprecedented analysis of global gas exchange estimates of sea-spray with particular focus on the formerly less constrained spume droplet contributions at high winds.</span></p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/03/2017<br>      Modified by: Penny&nbsp;Vlahos</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
