<AbstractNarration>The main objects of study in this project are word maps of groups, that is, maps that are obtained by substitution into a fixed element in the free group on d generators by elements of a given group G.  The first part of the project is a study of distribution of values of general word maps in groups.  The broad goal of this part is to give quantitative results about how random these word maps can be.  More specifically, the goal is to prove a bound on the Fourier coefficients of such distributions in finite and p-adic groups.  These Fourier coefficients are non-commutative analogs of Gauss sums.  The theme of the second part of this project is to study the distribution of values of certain words built from commutators and its connections to the moduli space of G-local systems on a curve, the representation theories of lattices in higher rank algebraic groups, and a new kind of Topological Field Theory. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Groups are mathematical objects measuring (and expressing) symmetry. They are fundamental objects of mathematics and are ubiquitous in many other sciences. This project has two parts, each dealing with equations in groups. The first part deals with general equations, but from a quantitative angle: instead of asking whether an equation has a solution, we ask how many solutions the equation has. The second part of the project will focus on a specific equation, for which the answer to the question of how many solutions there are (for different groups) is related to representation varieties, which are well-studied objects from mathematical physics and number theory. The goal of this part is to use this connection to answer questions about groups using representation varieties and vice versa.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual merit: There were two parts for the project:  1) Distribution of words in groups:  Background: Take two translations of the plane, say T and S. If you apply T, then S, then the inverse of T (i.e., translation in the opposite direction), and finally the inverse of S, you always get back to where you started. We say that the word xyx-1y-1 (denote it by [x,y]) is trivial on the group of translations. Doing the same with two rotations (with different centers) will not be trivial, in general, but will be a translation. In particular, the word [[x,y],[z,w]] is trivial on the group of rigid motions of the plane. In contrast, no word is trivial on the group of rotations in 3-space.  Objectives: This part of the project dealt with the following question: given a group G and a word w, what elements in G can be obtained as a w-value?  Results: My collaborators and I have shown that:  a) For groups of matrices over the p-adic numbers, any matrix is a product of at most 3 word values.  b) For groups of matrices over the integers, there is a constant C such that any matrix is a product of at most C word values.  2) Representation varieties:  Background: There is a formula of Frobenius, dating back to 1892 that connects characters of a finite group G (these are the most important functions on G) and the word values of some word in G (more specifically, with the question "In how many ways can 1 be expressed as a word value?"). Previously, Rami Aizenbud and I extended this to groups of matrices over p-adic numbers.  Objectives: This obective of this part of the project was to use this relation and count the number of characters of G according to their dimension.  Results:   a) For a matrix group G over the integers, we were able to bound the number of d-dimensional characters of G by d^{100}. This part is not optimal, as the correct answer is probably d^2.  b) We realized that the tools we used to solve this problem are actually much more general and give a new connection between the geometric properties of the space of complex solutions of a polynomial equation, and the number of solutions to the reduction modulo n of the same equation.  c) We generalized Frobenius's formula to cover spherical characters, which are important functions on a space with many symmetries.  d) In preparation to using the results in (c), we studied the spherical characters for matrix groups over finite fields.     Broader Impact: I'll divide this into levels:  1) Young children level: Over the last few years, I have organized a math circle for children aged 5-7.  2) High school level: I mentored a high-school research project of a high school student.  3) Book project: I am participating in a project to write a book about generalized functions.  4) Conferences: I organized two conferences during the time of the grant.
