<AbstractNarration>The project will map the spatial distribution of dust within the Milky Way. Their project traces Galactic structure and star formation, and is a tool for correcting for interstellar extinction. Previous work on dust structure has focused primarily on the projected density of dust, yielding two-dimensional maps of the dust column density across the sky. Their new approach is to produce a dust map is to measure stellar extinction directly. By combining distance and extinction estimates for a large number of stars across the sky, it is possible to produce a three-dimensional map of interstellar extinction. PanSTARRS-1 has been surveying 3รฐ steradians of the sky, producing a point-source catalog of more than 500,000,000 stars in five passbands They propose to produce a high-resolution three-dimensional dust map across three-quarters of the sky using PanSTARRS-1 photometry, and to make it available to the public.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Their 3-D map will allow estimation of distances to individual dust clouds and filaments, and better utilize information from CO and HI surveys, which suffer from velocity-distance degeneracy. Such a map also improves the understanding of the 3D distribution of stars, allowing for less biased searches for dwarf galaxies and tidal streams.  When the researchers combine hundreds or thousands of stars along the same line of sight (in one spatial pixel) they provide a powerful constraint on the dust distribution along the line of sight.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A graduate student will carry out part of this research and will be trained in developing and applying theory, observation, and statistical analysis tools to problems in Galaxy formation and evolution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They will release the data for use via the World Wide Telescope (WWT).  The WWT is a leading educational tool bringing the awe and beauty of astronomy to the public. It allows the user to zoom and pan around the sky, seamlessly merging full-sky maps at various wavelengths with detailed observations of particular objects. WWT has a 3D mode, in which the user can move through the 3D structure of the Solar System, Galaxy, and large-scale structure maps provided by redshift surveys. The PI has previously contributed the SFD dust map and H-alpha maps to the WWT project, and expects to contribute a 3D dust map as soon as possible.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Astronomers are obsessed with measuring the distances to things.  This may have started with wanting to know the size of the Sun or Moon, or a neighboring planet.  In time, we wanted to know the size of everything, from stars to galaxies to the entire visible universe.  This is not a matter of idle curiosity:  things like the speed, mass, or luminosity (total power output) of various celestial objects generally cannot be determined without knowing their distance. Detailed measurements like these allow astronomers to go beyond descriptive exploration, and understand nature from a perspective grounded in math and physics.  The National Science Foundation has generously funded this project to map our home galaxy, the Milky Way, in 3 dimensions. Our galaxy contains billions of stars along with interstellar gas and dust. This dust reddens starlight for the same reason sunsets are red. Stars behind dust appear fainter and redder than they would otherwise, in proportion to the amount of dust between us and them.  We use this fact to calculate the distance to both the dust clouds and the stars.  Using carefully measured colors of over 800,000,000 stars, we can make a 3-dimensional map of both the stars and the dust.  Many astronomers use this map to determine distances to various objects, and to correct for the effects of dust on their data.  Since its public release in 2015, the full map has been downloaded about 500 times, and our web server has been queried over 1 million times.     Fly-through videos arre available at http://argonaut.skymaps.info.  Building on this success, we are now implementing more sophisticated computational techniques to improve the spatial resolution and fidelity of the map, making it a more useful scientific tool. This project turns out to be an excellent opportunity to train students in computational and statistical techniques that are useful far beyond the field of astronomy. At the same time, we have produced a data product that will advance our understanding of the Milky Way galaxy, and - quite literally - our place in the universe                   Last Modified: 12/01/2017       Submitted by: Douglas Finkbeiner]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
