<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the "Eleventh East Coast Operator Algebras Symposium" that will be held from October 12-13, 2013, on the campus of the University of Cincinnati.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This event is the eleventh installment of a series that annually brings together a diverse group of mathematicians whose primary research interests are in operator algebras and related topics. Among the topics to be discussed by speakers at this year's meeting are the following: classification of C*-algebras (the Elliott program); noncommutative geometry; C*-algebras and the Novikov conjecture; rigidity and deformation theory; free probability and its applications; subfactors and their invariants; C*-algebras and dynamical systems. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This grant supported the eleventh annual meeting in the East Coast Operator Algebra Symposium (ECOAS) series, which was held on the weekend of October 12-13, 2013 at the University of Cincinnati, in Cincinnati, Ohio.  As all ECOAS meetings,  this meeting focused on operator algebras and noncommutative geometry, with applications to a wide range of areas from number theory to quantum physics.  In addition to facilitating interaction between researchers in the field, the East Coast Operator Algebra Symposia are forums in which young researchers, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the Eastern region of the United States can acquaint themselves with current issues at the forefront of research, present their own work, and interact with senior mathematicians in the field.       One of our hour speakers, N. Srivastava, presented an excellent overview of the recent solution to the acclaimed Kadison-Singer problem obtained by him, A. Markus, and D. Spielman       This meeting featured 12 distinguished speakers. 3 of the speakers were women, and half of the speakers were graduate students or junior faculty. The total number of participants was 45. 60% of those attending were graduate students, postdocs, or junior faculty. 20% were women. Leftover monies after speaker and participant support was disbursed were used to support  conference travel for several PhD students of the Mathematics Sciences Department of the University of Cincinnati.
