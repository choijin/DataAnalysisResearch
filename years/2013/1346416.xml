<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project proposes to develop and commercialize a fully implantable, integrated, ultra-flexible device for high-bandwidth bidirectional interface with the central nervous system aimed at brain-computer interfacing (BCI) and neurobiology research applications. The device will incorporate the implantable component of the multichannel wireless implantable neural recording and stimulating system (WINeRS developed under NSF funding at Georgia Institute of Technology) with a microfabricated high-density electrode array and planar spiral coils (PSC) in a single flexible substrate. This implantable unit will operate in conjunction with the existing WINeRS external unit, slightly modified for compatibility with the PSCs. Such a device will allow unrestricted movement of animals during recording sessions with no tethering effects, and require no transcutaneous wired connections thus reducing associated risks of infection or irritation. While the initial application will be micro-electrocorticography (?ÝECoG) to support brain activity mapping (BAM) in freely roaming animal models, the technology developed will be crucial for a broad range of wireless neural interface challenges in both the central and peripheral nervous system.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is both a wireless recording device for the animal research market and (perhaps more importantly) critical technology for next generation neural interface devices for human applications. By tightly integrating the ultra-flexible electrode array, IC, and coils required for power and bidirectional data telemetry into a single flexible unit, the proposed ?ÝECoG device will represent a significant advancement in tools available for BCI, BAM, and other neurobiology research. The advanced biocompatible packaging technology results in the IC being thinned to the point of flexibility (25?Ým) and fully embedded within the device ¡V the packaging is the device. The high-density connection scheme allows &gt;1000 electrodes to be connected to the IC for high-bandwidth neural interfacing. The technology developed will be directly applicable to a broad range of neural interface devices for the central and peripheral nervous system ¡V key components of brain-machine interfaces (BMI) to restore motor and sensory function to people afflicted with nerve damage from injury, stroke, or neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, the devices developed will be of immediate interest to biomedical researchers for animal studies and the technology of future interest to medical device manufacturers for advanced prosthetics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many common brain disorders including AlzheimerÆs, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, depression, and dementia have limited treatment options and lack a cure mostly due to a critical lack of knowledge concerning basic brain mechanisms.  As such, the neuroscience community is increasingly focusing on brain activity mapping (BAM) to understand principles governing brain functions with respect to specific neural interactions as evidenced by high-profile government initiatives such as BRAIN (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) in the US and similar efforts in Europe.  An important part of these efforts are the development of new research tools to support data acquisition from animal and ultimately, human brains.     One of these desired tools is a fully implantable, wireless, ultra-flexible, high-bandwidth electrode array with integrated electronic components for stimulating brain functions and recording brain signals for BAM without the need to connect to the outside world via wires and connectors., These devices are also crucial components in next generation medical systems like micro-electrocorticography (mECoG) used in epilepsy surgery or brain-machine interfaces (BMI) for use in advanced prosthetics.      The goals of this Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project were to demonstrate feasibility and develop key pieces of technology required to produce a fully implantable, wireless, ultra-flexible, high-bandwidth electrode array for electrical recording from the surface of the brain (micro-electrocorticography or mECoG). This was accomplished through incorporation of a multichannel wireless implantable neural recording system (the WINeR system developed by our collaborator at Georgia Tech) into a micro-fabricated device containing the integrated circuits, recording electrodes, and planar spiral coils (PSC).         In order to optimize wideband wireless data transmission (from the implanted device to the external unit), a second coil pair was employed to minimize interference between the data and power links.  The novel design used for this device was a pair of planar figure-8 coils. In this configuration careful alignment of the figure-8 and power coils resulted in minimal interference in the data link. This configuration is illustrated in Figure 1.        The key accomplishments in this Phase I are:     1)     Coil Design and Optimization for Power and Data Transmission: This was achieved by adapting the geometry of the planar spiral power coil to inductively deliver maximum power to the WINeR system, and develop and optimize the geometry of a printed planar figure-8 coil in order to establish a wideband wireless data transmission link from the implanted device to the external unit, while minimizing the interference with the inductive power carrier. Careful alignment of a figure-8 and planar spiral power coils resulted in minimal interference in the data link from the power carrier.     2)     Fabrication of Planar Spiral Coil Prototypes: This was achieved by developing a specialized process to produce the Figure-8 coil prototypes and flex circuits. The flexible polymer layers are used to as insulation layers and to embed the recording electrodes, conductive traces, interconnection pads, and coils.        3)     Wirelessly-Powered In Vitro Recording with Neural Recording System (WINeR):  This was demonstrated by delivering successfully power to the internal receiver board through a 1 cm air gap and by fully characterizing the fabricated figure-8 coils for data telemetry.     In conclusion, Phase I of this project was successful in achieving the major goals and objectives as outlined in the proposal.  The WINeR neural recording system (external unit and Integrated Circuit) was redesigned and optimized for compatibility with the planar spiral coils and advanced packaging technology. The system could be powered over the PSC wireless link from the external unit and amplify/transmit pre-recorded n...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
