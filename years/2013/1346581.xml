<AbstractNarration>This award supports continuation of the Enhancing Diversity in Graduate Education (EDGE) program.  The proportion of women, especially underrepresented minority women, in the mathematical sciences declines at each successive academic level.  In response to this problem, the EDGE Program is designed (1) to increase the number of women PhDs in the mathematical sciences, especially those from underrepresented groups; and (2) to place more women in visible leadership roles in the mathematics community.  The EDGE Program seeks to achieve these goals by providing a comprehensive mentoring program that supports the academic development and research activities of women in mathematics.  The proposed activities target women in four different groups: new PhD students, advanced PhD students, postdocs, and junior faculty.   Along with an annual summer session, EDGE supports an annual conference, travel for research collaborations, travel to present research, and other open-ended mentoring activities for each targeted participant group.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to impact the mathematics community by increasing the number of women, particularly from minority groups, who succeed in graduate programs in the mathematical sciences; who assume leadership roles in academia, industry, and government; and who ultimately diversify the mathematical community and provide a sustainable increase in the pool of available "home-grown" talent.  Increased diversity in the mathematics community will ultimately strengthen U.S. competitiveness in mathematics and science and allow people from all backgrounds and cultures to thrive, advance, and contribute to the profession.  Reducing the gender and racial disparities among faculty in the mathematical sciences will facilitate national efforts to increase the diversity of students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate programs in mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

In 2017, April Harry (EDGE 2010) was the first African American woman to earn a PhD in Statistics at Purdue University.    As participants complete their PhD, they are providing leadership throughout the mathematics community and beyond.  For example, Rachelle DeCoste (EDGE ?98) organizes a career workshop; Farrah Jackson (EDGE ?1999) directed  the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program at Elizabeth City State University and was recently appointed Associate Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs; in 2014 the governor of New Hampshire appointed Susan D?Agostino (EDGE 1998) to the New Hampshire Governor?s STEM Education Task Force. All four members of the team of creators of the website mathematicallygiftedandblack.com launched in 2017 to celebrate the diversity of African-American mathematicians are EDGE participants.    EDGE participants have found ways to reach broad audiences.  Talithia Williams? (EDGE 2000)  TED talk titled "Own your body?s data" has almost 1.5 million views and she recently debuted as a host of a new PBS science series "Nova Wonders" which is 6-part television series exploring the biggest questions on the frontiers of science.

In 2013, in response to an overwhelming push from EDGE participants we established a nonprofit organization, the Sylvia Bozeman and Rhonda Hughes EDGE Foundation to raise money to support EDGE activities and better insure the longevity of the program.
