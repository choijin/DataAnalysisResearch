<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to develop methods for modeling, estimation, and prediction of wireless networks in real time. The modeling approach generalizes to diverse propagation environments including "urban canyons", and directly addresses issues such as the random and ever changing interference effects and noise sources caused by the transmitter population.  The research will result in general methods that will improve communication channel utilization and thereby performance of various wireless networked system applications. Deliverable includes fundamental algorithms, modeling and analysis tools, demonstration and validation via simulation and hardware implementation, documentation of research results, and engineering student education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, particular benefits of this research will accrue to networked control systems, such as mobile sensor networks, unmanned vehicles, remote surgery, haptics collaboration, health monitoring, agricultural areas/farms, home networking, and wireless networks multimedia applications.  For example, the economically efficient delivery of highly reliable electric power is increasingly dependent on networked SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition System) and distributed control systems operating over commercially available, and frequently internet protocol (IP) based communication technologies. The results will be disseminated using different platforms to allow the creation of commercial software and hardware (transceivers) with increased performance, reliability, and reduced wiring costs.   The educational plan places a particular emphasis upon the cultivation of a diverse student population and inclusion of under-represented minorities, by utilizing student and mentor teams, incorporating graduate and undergraduate students, and focusing upon project-oriented integrated systems design. A partnership with Oak Ridge National Laboratory will provide realistic data sets and applications, and opportunities for direct feedback from practitioners to the students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Inttelectual Merit:  We have developed an integrated approach to model wireless networks, the physical links between transmitters and receivers as time varying processes identified and estimated in real-time. The primary contributions of this work include:  Developed realistic models for wireless communication networks as solutions to stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by jump diffusion processes.  The models were tested using experimental data on various wireless propagation environments. Developed real-time estimation algorithms to identify the SDEs channel parameter sets that characterize the behaviors of wireless networks. Extensive experimental results show that the developed models outperform significantly existing wireless models. Developed an algorithm for transmit power control based on these models which outperform existing power control algorithms in terms of energy usage and performance. Used these models to characterize the effect of wireless networks on stability. Developed a novel algorithm called LIPS: Link Prediction as a Service for data aggregation applications, and demonstrated that it is possible to integrate it into operating system interfaces so that higher layer data aggregation protocols can directly exploit these interfaces to improve their performance. An experimental set-up using an in-house developed operating systems and a wireless sensor network composed of MicaZ motes was built and used for testing and verification.  Hybrid spread-spectrum (HSS) techniques for commercial applications, particularly in the Smart Grid, can accommodate high data rates with high link integrity, even in the presence of significant multipath effects and interfering signals. A highly useful form of this transmission technique for many types of command, control, and sensing applications is the standard direct sequence modulation with ?fast? frequency hopping, denoted hybrid DS/FFH.   Error-probability analyses are performed for a hybrid DS/FFH system by progressively including the effects from wide- and partial-band jamming, multi-user interference, and varying degrees of Rayleigh and Rician fading.  An optimization approach is formulated that minimizes the bit-error performance of a hybrid DS/FFH communication system and solves for the resulting system design parameters.   Design, implementation, and evaluation of a hybrid DS/FFH radio transceiver using a single field programmable gate array (FPGA) was carried out. Numerical and experimental results were obtained under widely varying design parameters to demonstrate the adaptability of the waveform for varied harsh smart grid RF signal environments.   Boarder Impact:  The inter-disciplinary essence of the proposed research lent itself to cross-disciplinary collaboration and education. Investigators in control theory, wireless communication networks, wireless sensor networks, communication systems, and mathematics jointly guided graduate students and developed new course curricula. Other broader impact outcomes include:  This effort directly addressed a strategic goal of the university?s electrical engineering and computer science program: to develop curricula and R&amp;D activities in embedded systems. This project provided an excellent opportunity to significantly enhance the multi-disciplinary research and education infrastructure at UT. The project built a synergistic bridge between existing research laboratories in the department of electrical engineering and computer science (EECS) and the department of mathematics at UT on one side, and between the EECS department and Oak Ridge National laboratory on another side. The experimental set-ups and software have been incorporated in the undergraduate and graduate curricula.           Last Modified: 10/30/2017       Submitted by: Seddik M Djouadi]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
