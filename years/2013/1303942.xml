<AbstractNarration>This award supports travel for participants in the symposium Advances in Statistical Methods for the Analysis of Observational and Experimental Data, held July 13, 2013 on the North Carolina State University campus in Raleigh, North Carolina. The past several decades have seen numerous significant advances in statistical theory and methodology for the analysis of data from experimental and observational studies.  These developments have had a profound impact on statistical practice.  The conference features presentations by leaders in the development of statistical theory and methods in areas such as censored time-to-event data, missing data, longitudinal data, and causal inference. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The conference will serve as a forum for discussion of developments in statistical methodology and theory that have propelled advances in research in the health, biological, epidemiological, social, and economic sciences.  The conference offers a perfect opportunity for junior researchers to gain a valuable perspective on emerging trends and the opportunity to interact with senior and mid-career level leaders responsible for past and present advances.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Conference web site:  http://www.stat.ncsu.edu/events/2013_tsiatis_symposium/</AbstractNarration>
