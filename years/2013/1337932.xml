<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program award provides funding for acquisition of an advanced analytical field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) to enhance the research, education, and training capabilities at Utah State University (USU). The new equipment replaces an existing imaging device at the institution as the primary research device, and provides higher resolution for a variety of research applications as well as the ability for remote use by researchers and students at campuses across the state. At present, the only electron microscopy service at USU is a 22-year-old analog SEM with limited imaging capabilities and resolution. The new microscope provides advanced technical capabilities to USU's researchers that currently are not available at the institution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The acquisition of the microscope will provide a transformative improvement in the materials characterization infrastructure at USU, increase the quality and productivity of faculty research, and directly impact funded research in processing and manufacturing of biomaterials, nanomaterials, and energy materials for a number of researchers. Specifically, the enabled research includes characterizing nanoparticles for antimicrobial applications and biofuel production, bioplastics, and food microstructures; nanoscale-composition analysis for nanotubes, nanowires, nanoporous materials, nuclear materials, and charging effects in insulators; and microscale-composition analysis for geothermal and earthquake studies, soil, and leaf morphology correlated to climate. Overall, the equipment will be integrated into the USU Microscopy Core Facility that serves the research needs of faculty from at least six departments in three colleges of the university. The microscope also will be used extensively for educational outreach and training at USU and will be integrated into a new course on electron microscopy to help train students using the new microscope. Approximately 60 graduate and undergraduate students are expected to utilize this microscope in their research. Additionally, the microscope's remote operations will allow the microscope to be used for classes and research at USU branch campuses across the state of Utah. Additionally, K-12 students visiting the USU campus will take advantage of the unique capabilities of the instruments during visits to the university.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Utah State University is the only research university in Utah without a scanning electron microscope and a transmission electron microscope before 2014.  This grant brought in a much waited relief for any research on campus requiring microscopy and chemical composition analysis.  The Quanta-650 field-emission scanning electron microscope procured from this grant is a general purpose microscope.  It provides 1.0-nm resolution at high vacuum for conductive samples and 3-nm resolution at low vacuum for non-conductive samples.  Temperature control of the sample stage between -20 &ordm;C and 60 &ordm;C allows electron microscopy at 10 torr for biological samples.  After installation in July 2014, this microscope has operated 3300 hours up to October 2016.  Users include 90 USU researchers, 8 groups of bioengineering students for class projects, and 2 industrial users.  In two years, a total of 39 users have been trained and qualified to operate this microscope for their own research.  More than 30 papers using the SEM images and analysis have been published. The results also contribute to a number of master theses and PhD dissertations.  Science results include understanding the corrugation of carbon nanotubes on Nb/Si substrate for radiometry, characterizing the morphology and composition of catalysts for water-splitting and biomass oxidation for energy conversion, Characterizing the texture of rocks for paleoearthquake detection, and characterizing the hair of bees for taxonomy.  Engineering results include characterizing nanorods and nanoparticles for cancer detection, controlling the nanoparticle size distribution by surface energy, characterizing the surface of various synthesized spider silk proteins for applications.  Agriculture results include characterizing nanoparticles on roots and bacteria, and the morphology of Nitrosospira briensis C-128 bacteria with genome sequence.  On the broader impacts, the SEM is incorporated into teaching in 14 classes benefiting a total of 458 students.  The microscope has been used in many outreach activities include (1) one Intech high school (Logan) project, demonstrations for (2) 60 second grade students from Ellis Elementary School (Logan), (3) 30 fifth grade students from Edith Bowen Charter School (Logan), (4) over 100 fifth and sixth grade students from Pomotory school (Brigham City). Technical information of the microscope, user manuals, policies, scheduling, image gallery, and an environmental mode SEM video are posted at http://rgs.usu.edu/microscopy/.
