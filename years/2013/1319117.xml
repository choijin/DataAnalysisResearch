<AbstractNarration>Computer users can be distinguished from one another based on differences in their typing rhythms.  Our research extends this idea to ask whether a user's level of anxiety or stress can also be determined, but based on *changes* in typing rhythms.  Thus, our primary research objective is to answer a single scientific question in a laboratory study: Do typing rhythms change when a typist is under stress, such that the change can be measured and detected with a standard keyboard?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why would anyone want to do this?  There are at least two reasons: (1) people under stress tend to make more errors at the keyboard/console, which can affect job accuracy and reliability; and (2) insiders who abuse their legitimate access to sensitive computer systems are likely to show signs of stress in the execution of a nefarious act, such as cyber espionage.  In each of these examples, remote detection of typist stress, through the use of the common keyboard, would alert supervisory personnel to a potential problem that could be averted.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to having a major effect on error prevention in national critical infrastructure controls, and on insider detection in cyber space, the impact of this research in health care could also be substantial.  For example, subtle changes in typing rhythms could indicate early onset dementia, episodes of cognitive decline, or even a tendency for musculoskeletal disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome or digital flexor tendinitis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As this research develops, so will the range of beneficial uses.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Safer Computing Through Biometric Stress Detection  BACKGROUND.  Stress can profoundly affect human behavior.  Critical-infrastructure operators (e.g., air-traffic controllers, nuclear power-plant operators, etc.) may make more errors when overstressed; malicious insiders may experience stress/anxiety while engaging in rogue behavior; and chronic stress has deleterious effects on mental and physical health. If stress could be detected unobtrusively, without requiring special equipment, these situations could be countermanded. In this study a common computer keyboard and everyday typing are the primary instruments for detecting stress. AIM.  The goal of the research was to detect stress via keystroke dynamics &ndash; the analysis of a user?s typing rhythms &ndash; by noting rhythmic changes concomitant with stress.   DATA.  Four types of data were collected from 116 subjects: (1) demographic data, which can reveal factors (e.g., general health) that influence subjects? reactions to stress; (2) physiological data (e.g., heart-rate variability and blood pressure) that permit an objective and independent assessment of a subject?s stress level; (3) self-report data, comprising self-assessments regarding a subject?s stress, anxiety, and workload levels; and (4) typing data from subjects, in both neutral and stressed states, measured in terms of keystroke timings &ndash; hold times (the length of time that a key is held down) and latency times (the amount of time taken to transition from one keystroke to the next) &ndash; and typographical errors. Differences in typing rhythms between neutral and stressed states were examined to seek specific indicators for stress.  METHOD.  A single-subject, ABA design was used, in which subjects act as their own controls. Each subject provided 80 thirty-character typing samples in each of three conditions: (A) baseline/neutral, (B) induced stress, and (A) post-stress return-to-baseline. Physiological measures were analyzed to ascertain the subject?s stress level when providing each sample.  Typing data were analyzed, using a variety of statistical and machine learning techniques, to elucidate indicators of stress.  Clustering techniques (e.g., K-means) were also employed to detect groups of users whose responses to stress were similar.  RESULTS.  Our stressor paradigm was effective for all 116 subjects, as confirmed through analysis of physiological and self-report data. We were able to identify indicators for stress within each subject; i.e., we can discriminate between neutral and stressed typing when examining any subject individually.  However, using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, we were not able to identify universal markers for stress, across subjects; nor were we able to identify clusters of subjects whose stress responses were similar. Subjects? stress responses, in typing data, appear to be highly individualized.  CONCLUSION.  This work has shown that typing rhythms can be used as effective and accurate indicators of stress.  A cohort of 116 subjects was exposed to a vetted laboratory stressor; all subjects experienced stress, as confirmed by independent verification.  Stress manifested as significant rhythmic changes in all subjects? typing of a 30-character string.  Our experiments worked exactly as anticipated, based on a very rigorous experimental methodology; they revealed that responses to stress appear to be particular to individuals, and may need to be put into service in the same way as has been done in personalized medicine.  In closed-world environments (e.g., air traffic control, nuclear power plants, system-security and process-control operations, corporate settings, etc.) keystrokes can be used to detect stress reliably.  Once detected, stress and its consequences can be mitigated in various ways, as chosen by the sponsoring organization.
