<AbstractNarration>With this new award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program A (CSDM-A) of the Division of Chemistry supports Professor Steven Baldelli of University of Houston in a project that will use a technique to provide images of the boundaries between liquids and solids at the molecular level, helping us to learn how liquids wet surfaces. Although wetting of surfaces by liquids has been studied for many years, the process is not understood at the molecular level.  The use of this novel imaging technique will provide the basis for a fundamental understanding of liquid-solid boundaries that will impact areas including catalysis, materials chemistry, adhesion, and basic surface science. In addition to university researchers, the project will include high school students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will use surface sum frequency generation (SFG) imaging to provide spatial and spectroscopic information on liquid wetting of a heterogeneous surface. The goal of these investigations is to uncover the molecular basis of processes that rely on interfacial properties.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Pattern formation in nature is a common occurrence from the stripes and spots on butterfly wings to the streaming stripes formed on the sides of a glass of wine. We often desire to explain phenomenon in nature with a molecular approach.  Once there is understanding at this level then strategies can be developed to harness and control the process.  This might be how to reduce the friction between two objects, or how to use the natural patterning process to create electrical circuits or sensors.  It might even lead to ideas to mimicking biological functions in devices and artificial organs.  This work helps extends our ability to study the molecular-level descripts of pattern formation on solid surfaces.  Here laser light interacting with films that have been form on the surface are analyzed in both wavelength and in images.  The result tells us where the different types of molecules are located on the surface and how they arrange.  The molecules arrange then are used to explain how the patterns are formed.  A major result was to show how the new microscope developed here furthers our understanding of these complex surfaces. The project involved many complex topics and experimental challenges.  The project contributed to three PhD students dissertations and helped to train our next generation of scientist.       Last Modified: 10/05/2018       Submitted by: Steven Baldelli]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
