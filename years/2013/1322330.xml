<AbstractNarration>University of Michigan doctoral candidate Jin Li, supervised by Dr. Erik Mueggler, will explore how religious subjects are formed and transformed through the encounter with new religious discourses and material objects. Investigating the encounter between Tibetan and Chinese Buddhists in the post-Communist era, this research poses the following questions: Why have Tibetan monks included Han Chinese (the dominant Chinese ethnicity) in their revival of Buddhism? Why have so many urban Chinese abandoned the secularist worldview cultivated by the state to convert to Tibetan Buddhism? Li addresses the questions by looking into a tradition in the Nyingma sect of Tibetan Buddhism, known as gter. Gter is an indigenous term for exploration that brings together the domains of landscape, materiality, human wayfaring and new religious imagination and interpretation. It has eventually formed new Buddhist subjects who weave together the religious ties between Tibet and China. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will involve a combination of ethnographic methods: participant observation, semi-structured interviews, archival research, analysis of conversion narratives and focus groups. The goal of these investigations is to understand how the religious domain created by treasure hunting can be seen as an assembly, which gradually comes into being through encounters between humans and things. In doing so, it will increase social scientific understanding of the relationship between subject formation, as indicated in conversion, and the broader material world. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is important because it will provide a new way for theorizing religion in anthropology. It will also provide data on the newly emerged interaction between Tibetan and Chinese Buddhists, a phenomenon that can give a different way to imagine the fraught relationships between Tibet and China. Given the 60 year history of the Tibet-China conflict and ongoing disputes about who leads Tibetan Buddhism, the phenomena of secularist Chinese converting to Tibetan Buddhism has wide-ranging implications.  At a time when the Chinese economy is increasingly dependent on a capitalist model at odds with the fundamental premise of communism, it is important to understand the growing conversion of secularist Chinese to any religion, particularly one tied so closely to political independence of a disputed territory. Supporting this research also supports the education of a graduate student.</AbstractNarration>

To interpret such a new thing, we must first ask about their subjects coming into being in a revival time after the retreat of the Chinese Communist state.  This question brought me to a Nyingma tradition known as gter, or "excavation of hidden treasures." A mode of religious revelation, it shapes religious subjects through the intimate articulation it nurtures between humans on the one hand, and landscapes and material objects on the other hand. In this tradition, Tibetan revealers (gter ston) wander through sacred landscape, searching for treasures (gter ma).

This reincarnation link sustains a crucial aspect of experiences expected for a revealer: to "remember" (dran pa) his past lives, and simultaneously "re-collect" the teachings he heard from Padmasambhava. It is this subject formation process about "whom I was" (and should be) that empowers the revealersÆ teachings with an authentic aura, which thus has made gter practices a response long in the Nyingma to discontinuation of transmission, when warfare, political repression and social chaos bring damages to Buddhist communities. For the same reason, it is deployed again after the Cultural Revolution, as some Nyingma revealers, in attempts to revive religion, find themselves facing a life world torn apart by Chinese Communists and losing its integrity and continuity. In this picture, anchored in material assemblies, through wayfaring, the creation of religious subjects offers the primary vitality to reassemble religion in a culture dismembered by violence.  In contemporary eastern Tibet, no revealer is greater than Jigme Phuntsok, the founder of Larung, and nothing has more powerfully animated his grand project to convert the Chinese than his enigmatic notion that some of his gter teachings, according to Padmasambhava's prophecy, are specially beneficial to the Chinese.
