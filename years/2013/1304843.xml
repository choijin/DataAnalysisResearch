<AbstractNarration>This project is supporting and creating curriculum pathways to increase the number of qualified technicians in the areas of operation, troubleshooting, design and integration of automated manufacturing systems (industrial automation). The curriculum pathways include a series of courses and learning experiences that equip students for a successful career in automated systems and industrial automation. The project is developing career pathways that lead from high school to the workforce, using web technologies to make industrial automation education more accessible. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;Many curriculum articulation efforts have focused on establishing dual credit programs for general academic subjects or on particular types of technology, such as mechatronics and robotics. There has been relatively little emphasis on automated systems education or establishing dual credit programs in industrial automation that begin at the high school level. To overcome this shortcoming the project is: 1) assessing industry workforce needs and skill sets in the area of industrial automation, 2) identifying gaps and inefficiencies that affect students' ability to smoothly transition from high school to two or four-year college to jobs in industry, 3) developing curriculum pathways and articulation agreements to efficiently prepare students to enter the workforce, 4) developing tools (e.g., web-accessible automated systems and virtual learning environments) to make hands-on learning experiences more accessible to learners with limited instructional resources, and 5) pilot-testing the tools within three clusters consisting of (at least) one high school, one two-year college, and one four-year college.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The project is helping provide U.S. companies with technicians and engineers who have a deeper understanding of industrial automation concepts, and who are better prepared to adapt to changes in production goals, automation processes and organizational restructuring. The partnering institutions are working with a significant number of underrepresented minority students and the propagation plans are providing further opportunities for students from all backgrounds to learn the concepts associated with system integration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is further contributing to rural technician education, by engaging two-year college participants from west Texas to work in the wind and solar energy industries. Since there has been relatively little emphasis on automated systems workforce preparation, the project is creating model career pathways from high school to the workforce and using web technologies to make industrial automation education more accessible to all. The project's focus on automated manufacturing to benefit the energy industry is helping address the global priority on the critical shortage of highly qualified workers to positively impact the nation and its related economy.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Skilled technicians and engineers who can operate, maintain, design and build automated systems are increasingly difficult to find. Increasing this workforce benefits end-users of automated systems, companies that design these systems, companies that manufacture equipment used in these systems, and overall U.S. economic competitiveness. In addition, entry-level jobs related to automation pay well and often do not require a four-year degree. Often, however, industrial automation students do not get enough opportunities to practice skills such as robot programming due to large class sizes, limited lab time, and the cost of equipment.</p> <p>The goal of the project was to support and create curriculum pathways to increase the number of qualified technicians in the areas of operation, troubleshooting, design and integration of automated manufacturing systems. The curriculum pathways included courses and learning experiences designed to equip students for successful careers in automated systems and industrial automation, with availability starting at the high school level. Web technologies were developed to make industrial automation education more accessible.</p> <p>Major tasks included: 1) assess industry workforce needs and skill sets in the area of industrial automation; 2) identify gaps and inefficiencies that affect students&rsquo; ability to smoothly transition from high school to two or four-year college to jobs in industry; 3) develop curriculum pathways and inter-institutional agreements to allow efficient preparation of students to enter the workforce; 4) develop tools such as web-accessible automated systems and virtual learning environments to make hands-on learning experiences more accessible to learners with limited instructional resources; and 5) pilot-test the tools.</p> <p>Industry partners of the two-year college collaborators were surveyed in 2015 to assess workforce needs and skill sets in the area of industrial automation. Of the 103 industry participants, 78 responded that their companies employ technicians or engineers who maintain automated manufacturing systems as part of their job. The majority of these 78 participants (about 88%) indicated that their primary market segment/industry includes one of the following: Oil &amp; gas, Automotive, Semiconductor &amp; electronics, Energy storage and distribution, Metals, or Machine builder. Almost half (47%) indicated that their job level was manager or above; the rest were primarily either engineers or technicians.</p> <p>Participants were asked to list the most pressing challenges being faced by their companies. Inability to find/hire enough skilled entry-level employees was a very strong and common theme. They were also asked to identify skill sets or knowledge they wish new technicians or engineers had that they don't currently have. Some commonly mentioned needs included hands-on experience, communication skills, PLC-related knowledge and skills, and troubleshooting.</p> <p>The survey data were analyzed both in aggregate and broken down by the industry partners associated with each two-year college. The two-year colleges used the survey results to come up with action items, such as curriculum changes and development of instructional materials and technologies. Six courses were developed or revised as a result of this effort: Programmable Logic Controller, Industrial Robotics, 3D Printing, Manufacturing Processes, Introduction to Computer-Aided Manufacturing, and Basic Machine Shop I. The two-year college collaborators also established 12 articulation agreements with local high schools (RockWell Heath HS, Conrad HS, Richardson HS, Pearce HS, and Garland HS in Dallas; and KIPP University Prep HS, Byron P Steele II HS, Samuel Clemens HS, Veterans Memorial HS, Southwest Legacy HS, John Marshall Harlan HS, and Jubilee San Antonio HS in San Antonio).</p> <p>TAMU developed and evaluated a web-based intelligent tutoring system (ITS) to teach Computer Numerical Control and Industrial Robotics.
