<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF Final Project Report &ndash; January 2015   Award Number 1341996   INITERNATIONAL NANOTRIBOLOGY FORUM; KERALA, INDIA; JANUARY 2014   PI: Wilfred Tysoe   Awardee: University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee   Program Officer Name: Alexis Lewis      The International Nanotribology Forum 2014 was held from January 6th to 10th2014 in the Bolgatty Palace, a resort hotel well equipped for conferences and banquets. Kochi in the State of Kerala, India.  This provided a venue in which all of the participants could interact closely with each other, both during the formal presentations and during meal and coffee breaks during the conference.  These interactions were supplemented by social events including a tour of the estuary around Kerala on Wednesday afternoon, a banquet and show on Tuesday evening and an afternoon trip to Fort Cochin on Monday afternoon.  In particular, such events allowed students and young researchers to become better acquainted with the invited speakers and facilitated discussions between them.  The conference had a total of 94 participants, of which 8 were invited speakers.   41 people received scholarships of various types, which were given to young researchers (11) and students (30).  Attendees came from 12 countries: India (38), USA (12), Switzerland (10), Australia (9), UK (7), France (5), Japan (4), Germany (3), Sweden (2), Singapore (2), Denmark (1) and Cameroun (1).  The conference had 37 Plenary talks, 9 of them by invited speakers (listed below), 6 by students and 5 by former students of Prof Sanjay Biswas, in memory of the latter. 50 posters were presented during the coffee breaks in two sessions of 2 days each.  Invited Speakers:  Prof. Colin Bain, University of Durham, UK (vibrational spectroscopy in tribology)  Dr. Antoine Chateauminois, ESPCI, Paris, France (soft interfaces)  Dr. Rowena Crockett, Empa, Switzerland (tribology of glycoproteins)  Prof. Rosa Espinosa-Marzal, University of Illinois, USA (confined fluids)  Prof. Mark Robbins, Johns Hopkins University, USA (nanoscale roughness in tribology)  Prof. John Sader, University of Melbourne, Australia (AC methods in AFM)  Prof. Nic Spencer, ETH Zurich, Switzerland (tribology of surface-bound polymers)  Prof. Jason Stokes, University of Queensland, Australia (nanorheology and friction)  Prof. Eddy Tysoe, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, USA (subsurface effects in sliding)  The conference program is shown in the attached image.  The conference was extensively advertized by electronic mail and through a web site at: http://www.nanotribology.org/Kerala/kerala.html.  This indicated that there would be funds available to support both the registration and travel of students to the conference.  The original proposal indicated that the Fellowship Applications would be solicited via the web site prior to the students travelling to the conference.  However, since the funds arrived from NSF just prior to the start of the conference, there was no time for students to fill out formal on-line applications.  Instead, the selection of student awardees was made during the conference by a subcommittee consisting of Professor Nicholas D. Spencer of the ETH Zurich, Dr. Juliette Cayer-Barrioz of the &Eacute;cole Centrale de Lyon and Professor Wilfred Tysoe of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.  A preliminary selection was made of students currently registered in academic institutions in the United States.   The students were assessed based on the quality of their poster presentations at the conference and direct interviews with the student at the Conference by the subcommittee members.  The following students were awarded NSF fellowships:      Student Name    Presentation/Poster Title    Travel Funds/$    Registration Funds/$      Saurabh Das    Frictional Adhesion and Stick-Slip   Friction of Patterned Surfaces with Smooth and Rough Glass Surfaces    1500    325      Heather Adams    Development of a Method for Monitoring   Gas-Phase Products of Tribological Experim...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
