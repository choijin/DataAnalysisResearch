<AbstractNarration>1335988&lt;br/&gt;Gupta&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This MRI project proposal requests funds for an automated PS3 peptide synthesizer system to&lt;br/&gt;facilitate the expansion of a peptide chemistry laboratory at Texas A&amp;M International University&lt;br/&gt;(TAMIU), a Hispanic serving institution in South Texas. To foster the continued expansion&lt;br/&gt;of research at TAMIU and to better provide educational/research opportunities for their students,&lt;br/&gt;this proposal requests funding for equipment that will: 1) contribute to the limited understanding&lt;br/&gt;of the mechanism by which cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) translocate cell membranes; 2)&lt;br/&gt;increase knowledge of which key spider silk peptides are associated with specific mechanical&lt;br/&gt;properties; 3) elucidate the mechanisms of carbohydrates receptors responsible for malignant&lt;br/&gt;behavior of cancerous cells 4) provide training and access a research methodology to a large&lt;br/&gt;number of predominantly Hispanic students, who are historically underrepresented in math and&lt;br/&gt;science professions; 5) augment the education experience of several existing biology courses&lt;br/&gt;and enable the creation of an additional elective chemistry course on polymers; 6) foster&lt;br/&gt;intramural and extramural collaborations, and 7) increase TAMIU?s competitiveness for extramural&lt;br/&gt;research funding and publications.</AbstractNarration>
