<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the University of North Dakota (UND), located in Grand Forks, ND, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2014-18. The scientific focus of the REU program is on environmental influences on gene expression. Research will be conducted under the mentorship of faculty at UND, Cankdeska Cikana Community College (Fort Totten, ND) and Turtle Mountain Community College (Belcourt, ND). Mentors will work closely with students to develop an independent research project. Some example projects include investigation into how environmentally determined changes in gene expression influence learning in fish, sex-determination in turtles, stress tolerance in nematodes, and wing patterning in butterflies and moths. Students will receive training in molecular biology, genomics, bioinformatics, and others. In addition to the hands-on research experience, students will attend weekly seminars and workshops in which they will learn about science writing, ethical and responsible research conduct, and the graduate school application process. One of the goals of the program is to foster a sense of community amongst student participants and UND faculty. Therefore, although each student will be matched with a specific mentor, they will also have the opportunity to work and socialize with the other students and UND faculty. At the end of the program, students will present their findings at a symposium that is open to the public. The program will be assessed using pre- and post-surveys, as well as the REU common assessment tool. Students are provided a stipend, housing, meal allowance, and funds for travel to and from UND. Subsidized child care and family living accommodations are provided to students with dependents, using other funding sources. The program seeks students with a genuine interest in pursuing a career in science research and/or teaching. Students from groups that are historically underrepresented in the sciences, such as those from rural and tribal colleges with limited research opportunities, are especially encouraged to apply. Selection criteria include academic performance, as well as educational and career goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The primary mission of the program is to encourage students, particularly those from historically under-represented groups, to pursue graduate degrees in the sciences and enter careers that help strengthen science education, research, and literacy.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information can be found by visiting http://www.dozelab.com/reu, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Van Doze at van.doze@med.und.edu) or the tribal college program coordinator (Dr. Lane Azure at lane.azure@littlehoop.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This report covers 2014-2019.  During this grant award period, 75 undergraduate students completed 80 summer experiences (five repeats/extensions).  Of these 75 students, 20 (27%) were from tribal colleges/universities (TCUs), four (5%) from other community colleges, 24 (32%) from primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs), eight (11%) from MS-granting institutions, nine (12%) from research-intensive universities (RIUs), and 10 (13%) from the host RIU.  Of the five students who completed a second REU (an extension), one was from a TCU, two from PUIs, and two from RIUs.  Except for the RIUs, the other institutions have limited research opportunities for undergraduate students.  Overall, 30 (40%) of the REU participants were from institutions located in rural areas/small towns; five (7%) from Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs) and one (1%) was from a historically black college/university (HBCU).  Furthermore, 48 (64%) of the REU participants were attending private institutions which includes the TCUs, while 27 (36%) REU students were from public institutions.    Over half of the REU participants had completed two years or less of college; 15 (20%) had completed their freshman year, 28 (37%) their sophomore year, 26 (35%) their junior year, and six (8%) their senior year and were continuing for a fifth year of college prior to graduating.  Of these 75 REU participants, 40 (53%) were white, 22 (29%) American Indian, five (7%) Hispanic, four (5%) black, two (3%) Pacific Islander, and two (3%) Asian; 49 (65%) were female and 26 (35%) male.  Furthermore, 27 (36%) will be the first in their families to graduate from college.  In addition, one (1%) student had a disability and two (3%) were military veterans.  Several of the REU participants were nontraditional students (eight (10%) were 25 years or older and seven (9%) had dependent children), consistent with the characteristics of many rural community or tribal college students who are more likely to be older and/or a parent.   An evaluation, based on a staggered prospective multiple-cohort design with new students entering the program each summer, continued in 2014, the first year of this grant award period.  Each summer since 2010, REU participants completed a pre and post survey, reporting demographics, personal characteristics, and satisfaction with the summer research experience, its impact on them, and their academic and career intentions.  REU participants have been highly satisfied with the summer research experience, including their responsibility, their lab and mentor, and the project on which they worked (see Chart 1. Satisfaction).  Satisfaction with all components of the organization of the summer experience were rated on average higher than 4.0 on a scale from 1 (not at all satisfied) to 5 (very satisfied).  REU participants also reported that the summer research program positively impacted their knowledge, skills, self-confidence, networking, and interest.  Impact of the summer research project was measured using a scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (a great deal) (see Chart 2. Impact).  At the conclusion of their research experience, REU participants rated their intention to complete an undergraduate degree in science very highly (4.79 out of 5).  Their intention to complete a post-baccalaureate in science (MS, PhD) (4.28) or a professional degree in a science-related field (MD, JD) (3.26) was also high.  Intentions regarding undergraduate and graduate programs was rated on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (absolutely).  Students participated in dissemination of the results of their summer research experience through posters and scientific journal publications.  All of the REU participants gave at least one poster presentation and at least six of the REU participants were co-authors on peer-reviewed journal articles.  The undergraduate students who participated in this REU were involved in cutting-edge research projects.       Last Modified: 06/10/2020       Submitted by: Van A Doze]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
