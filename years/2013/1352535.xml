<AbstractNarration>This CAREER award to Oklahoma State University by the Biomaterials Program in the Division of Materials Research is to investigate how the material properties of multifunctional and aptamer-derivatized polyethylene glycol-grafted-polylysine copolymer would affect the gene delivery efficiency of a polymer/adenovirus vector. Earlier studies have shown that a hybrid vector possesses advantages over current viral and nonviral vectors. Determining how the hybrid vector could be further improved to better mimic the efficiency of a viral vector with none of the drawbacks, however, remains a significant challenge. The proposed study is expected to provide new insight into the design of hybrid, and eventually, non-viral gene delivery vectors. This in turn would guide the development of new materials to overcome current bottlenecks in the gene delivery system. These expected outcomes will be achieved by comparing the mechanisms by which the hybrid vector and native adenovirus transform cells and comparing the efficiency and rate at which the viral and hybrid vectors deliver genetic material. Through these efforts, the research investigator will be able to determine limitations of the currently used materials and would provide a better understanding of how to design material properties to overcome the current limitations. The proposed outreach activities would also directly impact Native American, African American and homeschooled students in exposing them to STEM related topics and would encourage them in STEM related higher studies and careers. Further, the proposed broader impact activities included assistance to school teachers in developing laboratory practices and curriculum development, thereby encouraging students to see the ways in which science and engineering shape their future. As part of teaching, training and education, the graduate and undergraduate students in cutting-edge research techniques for discovering and studying novel biomaterials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Gene therapy has long promised to change the way we prevent and treat disease in this country. The field, however, has largely failed to advance beyond the clinical trial stages due to difficulties encountered in delivering genes in a safe and efficient manner. The focus of this project would be in discovering and characterizing novel biomaterials that would help to transition from virus-based delivery methods to synthetic particle-based delivery methods. The project will develop a hybrid polymer/virus delivery method to help better understand how these materials would affect gene delivery. The project is expected to improve the basic understanding on how to design novel materials for gene delivery that will potentially transform the field from a fringe medical treatment to common practice. The project will also help train the next generation of scientists and engineers by working with high school teachers in integrating biomaterials teaching and training into current curriculum and laboratory practices. The project also involves two-week summer research studies in the PI's laboratory, primarily intended for Native American, African American and home-schooled high school students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The motivation of this project was to study a hybrid gene vector that provides advantages over both viral and non-viral vectors with the goal of gaining a better understanding of how we may ultimately move beyond our current scope and design synthetic vectors with inherent efficiencies rivaling those of a virus.  Our unique approach is to work in incremental steps to transition from a virus to our ultimate goal of a completely synthetic vector. As part of this work we studied a hybrid vector, where the function of the adenovirus (Ad) fiber protein was replaced with a polyethylene glycol-grafted-polylysine polymer coating (PEG-g-PLL) and a targeting aptamer.  Intellectual Merit Outcomes  The intellectual merit of this work is related to the novelty of combining the efficient transformation abilities of a virus with the superior safety and flexibility of a polymer shield. The mechanistic studies carried out were intended to (i) provide insight into how to better design materials that enable hybrid vectors to overcome limiting steps in the transformation pathway and (ii) ultimately lead to completely synthetic vectors that rival the efficiency of viral vectors.  A key outcome of our work was identification of the limits of the PEG-g-PLL material to act in place of the fiber protein.  We determined that the bottlenecks of transduction for the hybrid vector were cellular internalization and intracellular transport.  By identifying these bottlenecks, we can focus future efforts on designing novel materials that will aid in internalization and intracellular transport.  Subsequently, we can progress by replacing other parts of the virus with non-viral materials and repeat the process of identifying the bottlenecks and improving the materials.  Broader Impacts Outcomes  The broader impact of the project is its culmination of an improved gene delivery vector that will potentially transform gene therapy and greatly impact society by transitioning gene therapy from a fringe medical treatment to common practice. The research was also intended to directly impact a large number of high school and homeschooled students through biomedical engineering curriculum modules. Further, we hosted a summer research program for URM public high school students and homeschool students to provide a hands-on experience to encourage these students to consider entering science and engineering degree programs.  Safe and efficient gene vectors remain a limiting aspect of gene therapy.  Our work, however, may serve as a basis to build the next generation of hybrid gene vectors.  To this end, we have published two book chapters and six peer-reviewed research papers (with more planned).  We have presented our work at eight scientific conferences, and I have presented the work through five invited talks.  Additionally, the work has impacted hundreds of undergraduate students who have been exposed to gene delivery, material science, and biomedical engineering principles.  Undergraduate students, URM high school students, and home school students have also worked alongside us in a university research lab, with many of them inspired to pursue careers in STEM.
