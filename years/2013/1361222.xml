<AbstractNarration>The focus of this study is on assessing damage to infrastructure following major hazard events such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and wildfires. The premise is that some infrastructure (e.g., bridges and hospitals), particularly in cities, is so critical to saving human lives and supporting emergency response actions that near real-time information on the damage status of such infrastructure is essential and yet may be difficult to ascertain with conventional, ground observations and sensor networks that may not be functioning following a disaster. A potential solution to this post-hazard information access challenge is to design and implement flexible, ready-to-deploy, time-sensitive aerial imaging systems based on a small manned or unmanned aircraft and commercially available digital cameras. The key is to determine which infrastructure types are truly "critical" and then design and pre-plan low-cost systems that meet maximum time to delivery and minimum damage information reliability requirements of emergency managers. Aerial imagery from before and after a hazard event are precisely aligned and then compared to enable infrastructural damages to be detected, mapped and disseminated to emergency managers in such a short amount of time that emergency response actions can be taken to minimize loss of lives and inconveniences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research components of this study involve interviews and inquiries into emergency management information requirements pertaining to critical infrastructure following disaster events, as well as technical studies pertaining to the aerial imaging work flow. Emergency managers will be surveyed to prioritize critical infrastructural features and determine what types of damages they may be subjected to and how soon information about such damage is needed in order to be appropriately responsive. While a seemingly obvious first step, most aerial imaging technology studies and implementations fail to take this step and when they do, fail to deal with the time sensitivity of information delivery. The technical design of rapid-response systems based on aerial imaging technology will be informed by the synthesis of survey responses. Such systems involve flight planning, image capture, processing, and analysis, and damage information delivery to emergency managers. Incorporating wireless transfer of imagery and map products may be part of optimizing this information flow. All of these components and the end-to-end system will be evaluated in terms of their utility to the surveyed emergency managers. Procedures for optimizing the time to delivery of damage information while meeting minimum detail and precision requirements will be developed. These procedures and a prototype end-to-end system will be tested for simulated events involving emergency managers in New Mexico and California.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Immediately following hazard events that cause widespread damage and destruction to urban areas, the first responsibility of emergency managers is to plan for immediate triage, evacuations, and efforts to minimize risks from secondary hazards. This requires situational awareness of the status of infrastructure that: (1) supports medical triage (e.g., hospitals), (2) could be damaged and then create secondary hazards (e.g., dams and nuclear power plants), and (3) support communications and logistics for emergency response efforts (e.g., communication towers). We refer to these as hyper-critical infrastructure (HCI).</p> <p>Imaging from airborne platforms is currently the only viable means for achieving time-sensitive situational awareness on HCI in this context. Imaging systems based on piloted light sport aircraft or unmanned aerial systems (UAS) and consumer grade cameras integrated with sensor control and navigation systems are highly flexible and can be deployed immediately following a major hazard event. Capturing pre- and post-event images is beneficial, both for detecting subtle damage from minor pre-existing manifestations of wear or stress, and for catastrophic destruction of structures that make them unrecognizable in their damaged state. Our team developed an approach to image change analysis called Repeat Station Imaging (RSI), which minimizes effects of improperly co-aligned images and potentially enables real-time damage detection. RSI involves returning the same sensor to the same airborne imaging locations in the sky over time, and geometrically processing images on a frame-by-frame basis to maintain benefits of replicated view perspectives. While reliable information on the possible damage and structural integrity of HCI is needed, equally if not more important is that the information be available in a timely manner in order to save lives and minimize deaths. The 24-hour time to delivery requirement for damage information can only be achieved with a well-planned systems approach, such as time-sensitive remote sensing systems (TSRSS).</p> <p>The objective of the project was to conduct research pertaining to the development of TSRSS that support decision making pertaining to post-hazard assessment of damage to HCI, based on RSI. The following TSRSS components were addressed: 1) understanding information requirements of emergency managers pertaining to damage of HCI, 2) flight planning and data capture requirements for supporting bi-temporal RSI pairs, 3) automatic image registration and shadow classification and normalization routines applied to RSI pairs, 4) damage detection and delineation approach that exploits simple temporal differences in image brightness to automatically, reliably and robustly delineates new cracks associated with damage, and 5) rapid data and information transfer to emergency managers (Figure 1).</p> <p>In terms of intellectual merits, we found that identifying what truly is critical infrastructure in the immediate emergency response context and in extracting insights from emergency managers about their information requirements is challenging, but made substantial progress. We developed a model to predict the lapse of time within each component of a TSRSS and in total, while trading-off accuracy and precision. We determined flight planning and data capture requirements and capabilities for supporting pre- and post-event RSI. We showed that once post-event images are captured at nearly the same camera station locations, automatic image co-alignment and shadow detection and brightening routines (Figure 2) can be applied to generate high quality image data sets suitable for the detection of subtle changes. We also demonstrated that an image processing approach that exploits simple temporal differences in image brightness is able to reliably delineate new cracks in automatic fashion (Figure 3); such products can be used by image analysts along with the pre- and post-event images to definitively determine by visual interpretation which apparent new damage features are real. Finally, we elucidated the importance of rapid data and information transfer to emergency managers. These results were reported in a refereed, edited book that includes three of our book chapters, and in five refereed journal publications to date, three others that are in review, and at least four journal manuscripts in preparation.</p> <p>A broader impact from the study includes the advancement of TSRSS towards operational implementation by emergency managers, which in the long-term will help save lives and accelerate recovery efforts.
