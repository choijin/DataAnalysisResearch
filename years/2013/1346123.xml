<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project demonstrates the disruptive energy-efficiency advantages of neural classifier approaches for context aware applications (embedded systems incorporating a multiplicity of sensors to autonomously infer their current state in noisy conditions).  The value proposition benefits a wide range of consumer (wearable computing), telecommunication (mobile handset), industrial (internet-of-things edge nodes), medical (eHealth, portable medical devices, implanted devices), and military (autonomous control drones) applications which incorporate multiple sensors and where battery life/small form factor/product weight/device accuracy trade-offs are concerns. We address the digital signal processing power consumption problem, which requires engineers designing battery-powered systems to make undesirable product trade-offs.  Our proprietary mixed signal approaches uniquely close this traditional power/performance gap, solving a long-standing challenge for battery-powered/autonomously powered devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes disruption of traditional design approaches for battery-powered intelligent devices, accelerated scientific research, more efficient mixed signal electronic curriculum, new classes of portable devices that enhance the human condition and extend healthy life, and job creation. This project will demonstrate fundamental breakthroughs which can subsequently be extended to create a new generation of low-power configurable computing devices with potential impact matching the commercialization of earlier break-through digital technologies (FPGA, GPU, embedded processor).  Over the past 30 years, handheld electronics have improved energy efficiency 1000X; our approach enables another factor of 1000 improvement in energy efficiency for potential applications.   With advances in the tool-chain, experimental hardware from diverse scientific disciplines (neuroscience) incorporating FPAA technology will implement formerly impractical algorithms, achieving fresh scientific insights. Eventual tool enhancements support opportunities in engineering and computer science laboratory sensor-related curriculum. The initial wearable computing target market was based on strong technology-market fit, accelerated product adoption cycles, and a $300M market opportunity.  Wearable devices incorporating FPAA technology will be easier and safer to use, less obtrusive, and communicate more accurately.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our project focuses on building a demonstration platform for ultra-low power, FPAA-based, auditory and acoustic classification as well as wordspotting, a key aspect of speech recognition, based on acoustic techniques and driven by customer need.   Mavric's configurable technology allows for fast pivoting based on various challenges and difficulties both in the development process as well as opportunities dues to customer feedback.  Our minimum viable product (MVP), compiled and implemented on the FPAA ICs targets auditory and acoustic classification, based on neural classifier engines, on a microwatt power budget.    Computational power efficiency for biological systems is 8-9 orders of magnitude lower than the power efficiency wall for digital computation [1]; analog techniques at a 10nm node can potentially reach the same level of computational efficiency.   The resulting tradeoffs show that purely digital circuit approaches are less likely because of the differences in computational efficiency.   These approaches show huge potential for neuromorphic systems, showing we have a lot of room left for improvement, as well as potential directions on how to achieve these approaches with technology already being developed; new technologies only improve the probability of this potential being reached.  Computational efficiency, or the number of computations, like a Multiply ACcumulate (MAC) operation, per unit of energy, has not improved in 12 years [2]. The results show a saturation of performance at a level of 1MAC / 100pJ for production devices; an equivalent measure is 10MMAC (/s) / mW.  The saturation of today's digital processor performance further spells out the need for more physically based approaches.   Our FPAA technology utilizes a blend between sensors, analog signal processing and biological classification, algorithms at each stage, resulting power efficiency, as well as potential applications of the approach.   The application design is enabled by our Analog&ndash;Digital Software-Hardware CoDesign tools (e.g. [3]) and focused examples as mixed-signal design using FPAA SoCs. The tool simulates designs as well as enables experimental measurements after compiling to SoCs in the same integrated design tool framework. These tools enable high-level simulation as well as enable compilation to physical hardware.  We have also developed a high-level, GUI controlled, software in Scilab (open-source clone of MATLAB) that converts high-level block description by the user to targetable FPAA code.
