<AbstractNarration>The University of California-Berkeley proposes to conduct an AGEP Broadening Participation Research in STEM Education project entitled Interpersonal and Intrapersonal Mechanisms in Improving Mentoring Relationships for Underrepresented Students in STEM Fields. The purpose of the project is to understand how students can develop positive mentor-mentee relationships and the psychological barriers that may undermine positive mentor-mentee relationships. The researchers will examine whether targeting socio-emotional processes at the interpersonal and intrapersonal levels can enhance effective mentoring for underrepresented minority students in STEM. The research focuses both on the lack of interpersonal trust and warmth, that has been shown to characterize intergroup interactions (inter-individual processes), and the egocentric perspective and the heightened sense of threat that often accompany such interactions (intra-individual processes).&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will provide theoretically and empirically informed insights about the nature of the mentoring relationship by contributing to the understanding of how underrepresented students' identification with and success in the university and their majors can be improved. The results could prove to be transformative and significant for all STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

However, interracial mentoring relationships may face more challenges than same-race mentoring relationships, as underrepresented minority (URM) individuals in predominantly White institutions often worry that they will face discrimination or confirm negative group stereotypes, and Whites often worry that they will be perceived as prejudiced. Accordingly, our initial goal in this research was to examine whether influencing socio-emotional processes at the inter-personal and intra-personal levels could enhance interracial mentoring interactions. Over the course of this project, we broadened the scope of our goals to investigate interracial dynamics beyond mentorship contexts. Specifically, we sought to gain a deeper understanding of how interracial dynamics at the individual- and community-levels shape attitudes towards race-based social movements and health disparities.</p> <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>To examine the role self-disclosure as an inter-personal mechanism to improve inter-racial mentoring interactions, we ran 4 experimental studies (Leitner, Ayduk, Boykin, &amp; Mendoza-Denton, under review). Our hypothesis was that increased mutual self-disclosure among White mentors and URM mentees would improve inter-racial mentoring outcomes by reducing negative affect and increasing feelings of closeness and rapport. Findings indeed revealed that increased self-disclosure between URM mentees and White mentors decreased negative affect for mentees and increased rapport for mentors, which in turn predicted positive behavioral outcomes for mentees (better performance) and mentors (provision of more useful feedback). Figure 1 illustrates these findings. The intellectual merit of these findings is that they provide insight into the interpersonal pathways through which mutual self-disclosure improves mentorship processes and outcomes.</p> <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>A second objective was to investigate whether utilizing an emotion regulation strategy referred to as self-distancing prior to an interracial interactions might improve the outcomes of mentoring interactions. In 2 studies, we focused on whether self-distancing attenuates self-focus and sense of threat that are typically heightened when White mentors are asked to provide feedback to URM mentees. In one study, White participants prepared for interracial mentorship from a self-distanced (i.e., non-first-person), as opposed to a self-immersed (i.e., first-person) perspective and then provided feedback to a URM mentee. Results showed that White mentors who utilized self-distancing showed decreased neural activity in regions linked to increased self-referential processing (medial prefrontal cortex; mPFC) when conveying criticism to a Black mentee. This decreased mPFC activity, in turn, predicted more positive and helpful mentorship (Figure 2; Leitner et al., 2016, <em>Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience</em>). In another study, we also found that adopting a self-distanced perspective in preparing for an upcoming interracial interaction attenuated feelings of threat among White mentors (Leitner, Mendoza-Denton, &amp; Ayduk, unpublished manuscript). Together these studies provide insight into how self-distancing (an intrapersonal emotion regulation strategy) can be cultivated to modulate affective and self-referential processes that tend to undermine effective mentoring in interracial contexts.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Extending our original aims, we adopted two additional objectives. One aim was to elucidate whether interracial contact would shape Blacks&rsquo; and Whites&rsquo; endorsement of the Black Lives Mater movement. Our community-based studies found that increased interracial contact predicted increased endorsement of the Black Lives Matter movement for Whites, but decreased endorsement of this movement for Blacks (Boykin, Leitner, &amp; Mendoza-Denton, under review).

These studies revealed that Blacks showed poorer health outcomes in communities where Whites harbored more racial bias (Figure 3; Leitner, Hehman, Ayduk, &amp; Mendoza-Denton, 2016, <em>Psychological Science). </em>Interestingly Blacks also showed poorer health in communities where Blacks themselves harbored racial bias against Whites (Figure 4; Leitner, Hehman, Ayduk, &amp; Mendoza-Denton, 2016, <em>Social Science &amp; Medicine</em>).<em> </em>These findings provide insight into how community-level racial bias impacts public health.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The potential broader impact of this project is that results highlight two simple interventions (mutual self-disclosure and self-distancing) that can help reduce feelings of interracial threat, and facilitate positive interracial interactions. Furthermore, given our findings that positive interracial relationships are related to healthier communities, the current results have the potential to help identify the communities in greatest need of health-promotion and prejudice-prevention interventions.&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/18/2018<br>      Modified by: Rodolfo&nbsp;Mendoza-Denton</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1306709/1306709_10278408_1492218398821_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1306709/1306709_10278408_1492218398821_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1306709/1306709_10278408_1492218398821_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Indirect effects of self-disclosure on mentee performance, mentor warmth, and mentor helpfulness</div> <div class="imageCredit">Leitner, Ayduk, Boykin, Mendoza-Denton (2016, under review)</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Rodolfo&nbsp;Mendoza-Denton</div> <div class="imageTitle">Fig 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1306709/1306709_10278408_1492218592693_fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1306709/1306709_10278408_1492218592693_fig2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Fig 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1306709/1306709_10278408_1492218592693_fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Fig 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Indirect effects of self-talk condition on feedback valence, warmth, and helpfullness</div> <div class="imageCredit">Leitner et al.
