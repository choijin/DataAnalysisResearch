<AbstractNarration>The 4-year research and development project, Developing Rich Media-based Materials for Practice-based Teacher Education, is premised on the notion that recent technological developments have made it feasible to represent classroom work in new ways. In addition to watching recorded videos of classroom interactions or reading written cases, teacher educators and teachers can now watch animations and image sequences, realized with cartoon characters, and made to depict activities that happened, or could have happened, in a mathematics classroom. Furthermore, teacher educators and teachers can react to such animations or image sequences by making their own depictions of alternative moves by students or teachers in classroom interaction. And all of that can take place in an on-line, cloud-based environment that also supports discussion fora, questionnaires, and the kinds of capabilities associated with learning management systems. Such technologies offer important affordances to teacher educators seeking to provide candidates with course-based experiences that emphasize the development of practice-based skills. The focus of the project is on mathematics teacher education. This joint project of the University of Maryland Center for Mathematics Education and the University of Michigan will produce 6 to 8 field-tested modules for use in different courses that are a part of mathematics teacher preparation programs. The following two-pronged research question will be resolved: What are the affordances and constraints of the modules and the environment as supports for: (1) practice based teacher education and (2) a shift toward blended teacher education?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project involves the following activities: (1) a teacher education materials development component; (2) a related evaluation component; and (3) two research components. The development phase seeks to develop both the LessonSketch.org platform and six to eight mathematics teacher education modules for use in preservice teacher education programs from around the country. The modules will be written with practice-based teacher education goals in mind and will use the capacities of the LessonSketch.org platform as a vehicle for using rich-media artifacts of teaching with preservice teacher candidates. LessonSketch Teacher Education Research and Development Fellows will be chosen through a competitive application process. They will develop their respective modules along with teams of colleagues that will be recruited to form their inquiry group and pilot the module activities. The evaluation activity will focus on the materials development aspect of the project. Data will be collected by the LessonSketch platform, which includes interviews with Fellows and their teams, perspectives of module writers, descriptive statistics of module use, and feedback from both teacher educator and preservice teacher end-users about the quality of their experiences. The first research activity of the project is design research on the kinds of technological infrastructure that are useful for practice-based teacher education. The PIs will identify tools that teacher educators need and want beyond the current capabilities for web-based support for use of rich media and will produce prototype tools inside the LessonSketch environment to meet these needs. The second research activity of the project will supplement the evaluation activity by examining the implementation of two of the modules in detail. This aspect of the research will examine the goals of the intended curriculum, the proposed modes of media use, the fidelity of the implemented curriculum, and learnings produced by preservice teachers. This research activity will help the field understand the degree to which practice-based teacher education that is mediated by an online access to rich media would be a kind of practice that could be easily incorporated into existing teacher education structures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will produce 6 to 8 LessonSketch modules for use in teacher education classes. Each module will be implemented in at least eight teacher education classes across the country, which means that between 720 and 960 preservice teacher candidates will study the materials. The project aims to shift the field toward practice-based teacher education by supporting university programs to implement classroom-driven activities that will produce mathematics teachers with strong capabilities to teach mathematics effectively and meaningfully.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Professional education often takes place at a remove from sites of practice, such is the case for university teacher preparation. This project created a suite of tools to help mathematics teacher educators who teach in universities and do the work of preparing future mathematics teachers have their teacher candidates engage deeply with the practice of mathematics teaching. For the duration of the project, these tools were hosted by the LessonSketch platform, a Flash-based environment.     Figure 1 Image goes here   The tools created for the LessonSketch platform were designed postulating that teacher education would benefit from having a variety of ways to communicate about teaching, ways to:       Share representations of classroom interaction, like videos,    Have teacher candidates and teacher educators point to moments and clips in videotapes to ask questions about what happens in practice and to develop shared vocabulary ,   Make storyboards of what happens in classrooms, so that teacher educators and teacher candidates can communicate stories with the combinations of images and words that storyboards offer,   Share representations of different ways in which the same lesson might play out, and   Work with video and other representations of practice asynchronously.       Using the LessonSketch tools, the project supported a national network of over 50 teacher educators in developing in using representations of practice to help future teachers engage in learning particular skills of teaching. These were used in over 40 different courses at 30 different institutions across the US.
