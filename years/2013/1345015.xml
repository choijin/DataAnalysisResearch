<AbstractNarration>With the advent of EarthScope's USArray and other dense seismic arrays, there is an unprecedented opportunity for investigating the seismic structures within the deep Earth, all the way to the core.  Detecting structures in the very deepest part of the Earth provide essential constraints in understanding many aspects of the chemical and thermal history of the planet.  This grant will fund further development of array imaging techniques that will allow for more detailed investigation of how and why there are such complex structures at this great depth and how they link to the evolution of the Earth.  The grant will provide support for a postdoc, a graduate student, and foster continued international collaborations in Europe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Observations of seismic phases sampling the lower mantle have suggested Ultra Low Velocity Zones (ULVZs), a possible perovskite to postperovskite related D" layer, Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs), and rolling-hills of primordial material on the core-mantle boundary (CMB). Considerable progress has been made toward developing dynamical and mineralogical based mantle models compatible with seismic observations at the deep mantle, yet many details are still missing. It is still uncertain whether the densities and velocities of ULVZs are related to possible partial melting or have a distinct chemical origin, but the information about physical properties needed to answer this question are poorly constrained. For example the major phase used in imaging ULVZs, SPdKS, is not particularly sensitive to density and the velocities have strong trade-off with the shape of the structures. Other seismic observations have shown connections between the geographic distribution of the observed D? layer: where the post-perovskite layer is thickest beneath fast regions and disappears beneath slow regions. However, it is difficult to distinguish the velocity gradient effects caused subducted oceanic lithosphere at the base of the mantle from phase boundary effects.  The data set from USArray and other arrays, especially the greater PICASSO (partially funded by NSF-CD and CAREER) array, display waveform complexity at all ranges with remarkable coverage.  This grant will provide funding to better constrain mantle structures and answer questions such as: (1) Can we resolve and distinguish between the trade-off of different elastic properties? (2) Can we determine the 3D geometry of the ULVZ's? (3) Are there other types of low velocity zones besides ULVZs existing at CMB? (4) How compatible are the inferred slab histories with the presence of lower mantle structures? (5) What is the relationship between D? and slabs in the deep mantle? (5) How well can we resolve the edges of the LLSVPs?  To answer those questions, we will use array seismology techniques, waveform modeling and the newly developed Multi-Pathing Detector (MPD) to sharpen current tomographic models and produce synthetic seismograms that match observed waveforms complexities. The physical dimensions of these structures in the lower mantle and their inferred seismic parameters will be used in geodynamic models of mantle convection and explored in mineral physics experiments at CMB conditions.  These further mineral physics and geodynamic experiments will allow for improvement in our understanding of the connection between subducted slabs, the D? layer, ULVZs, and LLSVPs and the dynamic evolution in the deep mantle.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Detecting structures in the very deepest part of the Earth provide essential constraints in understanding many aspects of the chemical and thermal history of the planet. This grant focused on further development of seismic array imaging techniques that will allow for more detailed investigation of how and why there are such complex structures at this great depth and how they link to the evolution of the Earth.       Using a series of different seismological array datasets PI Miller, her postdoc, and graduate students imaged the lower mantle structure, just above the Earth's core.  They investigated the core-mantle boundary beneath the Atlantic Ocean and beneath the northern Pacific ocean.  They found in all cases that there are very distinct changes in structure that are not able to be found with traditional tomographic techniques.        The physical dimensions of these structures in the lower mantle and their inferred seismic parameters will be used in geodynamic models of mantle convection and explored in mineral physics experiments at core-mantle boundary conditions.      The results of this research was published in a series of high-impact academic journals, at international scientific conferences, and distributed widely using social media and traditional lectures.  These studies provided cutting-edge training in seismology for two female graduate students, one female, undergraduate student, a postdoc, and an early career female professor.
