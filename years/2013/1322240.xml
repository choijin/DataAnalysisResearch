<AbstractNarration>Abstract&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;#1322240&lt;br/&gt;Lu&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2013 Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) is for the first time organized by graduate students for graduate students, preceding this year's Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Laser Diagnostics for Combustion.  Graduate students will have an opportunity to present their research results and to interact with experts in the field from the United States and from abroad.  The off-the-record format presentation and discussion led by the topic experts also offers the exchange of the emerging ideas of the field.  The proposed funding is to provide support for registration for both GRS and GRC to student presenters.</AbstractNarration>
