<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop new technology for the separation of ultra-fast-rise-time incident and reflected step functions needed for the development of an integrated differential Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) to be used in soil water content measurement.  Because of residual reflections from circuit board striplines terminated in variable soil loads and reflections from wetting fronts and discontinuities in the soil, the derivation of propagation time, permittivity and water content are subject to errors caused by the vector addition of the spurious, shorter-term reflections with the main reflection from the end of the waveguide. The characteristics of the interfering spurious signals vary with the soil environment.  The overall waveform appearing at the TDR digitizer is a composite image of an incident step, a reflected wave and the set of spurious signals.  The research required is that of characterizing the spurious signal patterns and of developing machine learning and signal processing algorithms to remove their impact from the derivation of reflected wave propagation time.  Identification and timing of wetting fronts will also be included to provide sensor users with infiltration monitoring capability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to provide an affordable and easily deployed means of accurately measuring soil water content, including the credible measurement of water uptake by food crops. This capability will facilitate significant increases in water use efficiency - the foundation for growing high quality food with less water.  The value proposition to crop growers is reduced marginal costs and increased crop yield and quality, with a potential payback time of one to two growing seasons.  Commercial adoption of soil moisture sensing technology will help manage the increased cost and demand for fresh water, of which over 70% of consumption goes to agriculture.  The technology will also provide a stable and credible measurement tool for studying and monitoring watershed dynamics for flood and drought prediction, for monitoring dams, mudslide areas and levees for potential failure and for studying the impact of soil water dynamics on weather. Current tools for these measurements are either heavily regulated (neutron probe), difficult to install (Time Domain Transmissometer probe) or provide unstable readings with changing soil electrical conductivity and compaction (capacitive probes).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over 70% of the worldÆs fresh water consumption goes to agriculture.  With increasing demand and cost of clean fresh water, water use efficiency is becoming a local economic driver to farmers, who must cope with increasing water and electricity (pumping) costs while managing risks associated with crop production in arid climates.  Without enough water in the root zone, crops stress, reducing yield and profits.  Without accurate means to monitor soil water content, farmers tend to over-irrigate by as much as two times to prevent crop stress.  This not only wastes water and energy from pumping, but also leaches soil nutrients, flushes fertilizer, contaminates ground water, and adversely effects crop quality and yield.   A proposed, but not-widely-adopted solution is to use soil moisture sensing to schedule irrigation automatically based on in-situ soil conditions.  Time-domain reflectometry (TDR) is the de-facto gold standard for measuring soil water content (SWC). TDR systems derive bulk permittivity from the propagation time of a voltage step that traverses along a waveguide through the soil, and reflects off parallel open-ended rods back to a receiver. A typical TDR system for soil requires a step function generator, a transmission system connecting the generator to probes inserted into the soil, a receiver, a CPU with a storage unit, and waveform analysis software. In addition to being impractical for long-term in-ground deployment, the cost of typical TDR systems is extremely high for broad consumer adoption, varying from over $3,000 to more than $10,000.   The aim of this NSF SBIR Phase I research was to invent a low-cost proof-of-concept 2-rod differential TDR in a self-contained small package, which allows 33% less insertion force during installation, and provides 60% larger sampling volume than higher-cost 3-rod conventional TDR designs.  Although an attractive design to practitioners, preliminary research indicated that such a design would be a significant challenge for traditional waveform analysis.

Without a method to remove the effects of the structured noise in the embedded design, desired accuracies would not be achieved. Thus, the primary challenge in this project involved research and development of both hardware subsystems and embedded algorithms to mitigate effects of structured noise in an integrated 2-rod differential TDR.   The technical objectives achieved during  this NSF SBIR Phase I research include:  (1) Designed and fabricated a 2-rod differential TDR prototype that minimizes structured noise corrupting a transmitted voltage step.  Key research acclomplishments included careful design of a step function generator and waveguide that delivers the step to TDR rods with few reflections and minimal distortion.  (2) Invented and implemented signal processing algorithms to sample and estimate propagation time of a voltage step in the presence of medium-dependent structured noise.  Key accomplishments include a sample-and-latch algorithm that incorporates an amplitude-posterior distrubution to effeciently estimate signal amplitude and signal noise variance at each location; a semi-blind deconvolution approach that removes manifestations of structured noise in the waveform; and a step template-matching technique that precisely extracts the time of incident and reflected waves in a way that is robust to residual noise.  (3) Compared permittivity estimates of the TDR prototype against ground truth over a finely-spaced range of permittivities from 1 (air) to 80 (pure water).
