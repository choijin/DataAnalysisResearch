<AbstractNarration>All astrophysical and cosmological data now point convincingly to a large component of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) in the Universe, but a dark matter particle has yet to be directly detected.  A well-motivated possible candidate is a light axion.  Should axions constitute the dark matter of our Milky Way halo, they may be detected through their conversion into a narrow microwave signal by an apparatus consisting of a microwave cavity resonator permeated by a magnetic field.  Using this concept the Axion Dark Matter eXperiment (ADMX) has performed a search for such axions within the mass range of a few micro-eV.  Recently a smaller microwave cavity experiment was constructed called ADMX-HF (High Frequency), specifically to explore higher ranges of axion masses.  ADMX-HF also serves as a test-bed for innovations in microwave cavity and amplifier technologies that could be migrated to the larger ADMX platform.  ADMX-HF and ADMX operate as "one experiment, two sites", sharing expertise, technology, and data.  This award will expand the collaboration to accelerate the construction of ADMX-HF as well as dramatically expand its initial capability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  ADMX has proven to be a technology driver as components such as the SQUID amplifiers developed for ADMX are already being used for other purposes.  Innovations to be developed by ADMX-HF have similarly broad potential.  Both PI and Co-PI are committed educators with long experience in involving undergraduate students in their research and engaging the public.  The research funded through this award will inform additional education and outreach initiatives with which they are involved.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ What constitutes the dark matter of the universe is one of the most profound scientific questions today.  A leading candidate is a very light hypothetical elementary particle, called the axion, which might weigh only a trillionth of the mass of an electron, but be found with prodigious local density, perhaps a hundred trillion per cubic centimeter.  The axion is well motivated in the Standard Model of particle physics; it would explain why nature observes a symmetry in the nuclear force corresponding to the product of interchanging particles and antiparticles, and mirror reflection.  The axion is expected to have extraordinarily feeble interactions with anything, except gravitationally, but we can search for it in an experiment resembling a highly sophisticated radio:  axions can convert into a weak RF signal in a strong magnetic field, and the signal power can be boosted in a high-quality microwave cavity.  The condition for detecting the axion is that the frequency of the cavity (times Planck?s constant) must equal the mass of the axion (times the speed of light squared, i.e. Einstein?s famous E = mc2).  The very tiny signal, perhaps a trillionth of a trillionth of a watt, is detected with the quietest amplifiers that can be built, which operate at the limits imposed by quantum mechanics.  All of this is carried out near absolute zero temperature, which reduces thermal noise of the system.  A team of scientists from Yale, UC Berkeley, Colorado University and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory have built a third-generation experiment, specifically aimed at looking for axions a factor of ten higher in mass than previous experiments.  Berkeley was responsible for the R&amp;D and production of the microwave cavities for this experiment.  This experiment, called the Axion Dark Matter eXperiment &ndash; High Frequency (ADMX-HF) was successfully built and operated, and took production data for the first time in a long run in 2016.  Figure 1 shows the components of the experiment and its assembly.  It met all its technical and scientific goals, achieving the required sensitivity to detect axions corresponding to many theoretical models, although the axion itself was not found.  Figure 2 shows the limits on the axion-photon coupling as a function of mass.  While the mass range covered was small, 2% in bandwidth, all the technology is now in place for a longer run covering a much wider range of mass, having significant discovery potential. Berkeley also has been carrying out R&amp;D on innovative microwave cavities that will improve the experiment, operate at higher frequencies, with an improved quality factor, and eliminating the forest of unwanted modes which obscure the electromagnetic mode of interest as the cavity is tuned.  For example, we have begun to study depositions of superconducting thin films on the inner surfaces of the cavity to boost the quality factor of the cavity, i.e. the persistence time of an oscillation within it.  As a consequence of this experiment, all three university groups have trained many talented and creative postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students, more than 50% of them being women.  At Berkeley, we have trained one postdoc (Tim Shokair), four graduate students (Jaben Root, Maria Simanovskaia, Samantha Lewis, Al Kenany), and three undergraduate students (Kelly Marie Backes, Isabella Urdinaran, Nicholas Rapidis).  The experience they have gained has served both them and critical national missions well; Shokair and Root subsequently were hired by LLNL; Backes has matriculated at Yale where she continues to work on our experiment.  Regarding other broader impacts of our work, we expect that innovations developed in our microwave cavity work should have impact in the world of compact accelerators for industry, medicine, defense and science.
