<AbstractNarration>Direct analysis of bone strain has provided functional morphologists with a technique to measure performance in a tremendous variety of behaviors. However, measurement in skeletal cartilage has been hampered by the inability to use strain gauges or similar tools. This research project will use a novel approach, sonomicrometry, to investigate the function of cartilage as a structural material in cartilaginous vertebrates.  Preliminary research shows that sonomicrometry, which uses ultrasound to measure deformation, can be used successfully to measure strain in cartilage.  The research will advance our knowledge and understanding about the function of cartilage as a structural material in vertebrates by quantifying strain during in vitro and in vivo loading.  The study will also open multiple avenues of study on other biological materials that are not amenable to traditional strain analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A broad range of chondrichthyan and chondrostean fishes that vary morphologically and kinematically in jaw and hyoid structures will be studied during feeding and ventilation behaviors with five aims. Morphological variation will be quantified using 3D geometric morphometrics.  Mechanical properties will be measured in vitro to provide baseline data to assess the function of cartilage as a structural material.  Strain in living fishes will be measured to examine cartilage performance as a skeletal element, providing a technique and baseline for measuring strain in non-bony skeletal elements.  Finite element analysis will be validated from in vivo species and used to predict strain in those species or structures that are not amenable to in vivo techniques.  Cartilage performance, behavior, and morphology will be analyzed phylogenetically to uncover ecological and evolutionary patterns.  A research fellow, two graduate students and at least seven undergraduate students will receive research training in all aspects of the study, from data collection to publication.  The project will also include K-12 outreach, science teacher-training and undergraduate education.  FE models produced during the study will be archived in the publically accessible BIOMESH database (http://www.biomesh.org/).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The cartilaginous jaws of sharks, skates, rays, and chimeras are unique among vertebrates in being tessellated (= armoured), which provides flexible strength for feeding on prey with bones or hard shells. Tessellated materials are thought to resist fracture while stiffening the element and still allowing flexion compared to non-tessellated elements. The level of mineralization (i.e. the strength of the armour) in sharks, skates and rays is greater in the jaws than the hyoid or jaw supportive cartilages. The cartilages also become stiffer when tested with increasing compressive load (simulating biting) in a material testing system. Not surprisingly this change in stiffness as measured by Young-s Modulus is greater in the jaws than in the hyoid elements and also increases with greater mineralization. Stiffness and mineralization in the cartilages varies by jaw suspension type and feeding style. A complicated relationship exists between cartilage stiffness and shape that appears to allow the jaws of sharks to bend slightly around prey that is harder than the jaws. In-vivo jaw cartilage strain varies by an average of 10-fold indicating that the jaws do bend around objects placed in the mouth. This combination of stiffness and compliance appears to contribute to fracture resistance in the jaws of sharks. This is a collanborative research grant, and the outcomes here are specific to my portion of the collaboration (and are in addition to the outcomes reported by PI Cheryl Wilga). Outcomes include: 3 undergraduate (honors) theses, 9 undergraduate students involved in research, 2 high school students invovled in the research, 6 conference poster presentations with students as authors, and multiple (&gt;75) outreach presentations and lab tours featuring the work.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/14/2019<br>      Modified by: Lara&nbsp;A&nbsp;Ferry</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
