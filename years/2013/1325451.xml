<AbstractNarration>Overview: Small, schooling pelagic fishes often represents a critical link in how planktonic production reaches the upper trophic levels of ocean food webs. Despite their ecological and economic importance, distinct gaps exist in our understanding of the role these fishes play as consumers of zooplankton. This study takes a multifaceted approach, employing four types of analyses in order to better understand the feeding dynamics of six species of small pelagic fishes in the Large Marine Ecosystem of the Northeast U.S. continental shelf. Analytical techniques include detailed visual inspection of gut contents, bulk and compound-specific (amino acid) stable isotope analyses, and DNA barcoding techniques for identifying the otherwise unidentifiable prey. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Because of their economic importance, small pelagic fishes have received substantial interest and research attention from fisheries agencies such as NOAA. This work, however, has largely focused on either monitoring population sizes or examining the nature of small pelagic fishes as prey for other important natural resources. But, being consumers themselves, small pelagic fishes play a major role in determining when, where, and how much planktonic production flows either towards fish and upper trophic levels or is available for other processes, including export due to sinking. In this project, the investigator will use novel approaches to study small pelagic fishes not as a fishery resource, but as major consumers within planktonic food webs. By gathering trophic-related data using techniques that will be applied to each specimen, a larger picture of the top-down impact that small pelagic fishes have on all or particular zooplankton taxa should emerge. The use of compound-specific stable isotope analyses is of particular note, as this powerful technique will afford the ability to examine variability at the base of the food web, thereby providing insight into the bottom-up forces that influence these important species. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project is heavily geared toward involving many young and future scientists from underrepresented groups in research activities. At least eight undergraduates will participate on research cruises, to assist with sampling efforts. Two undergraduate summer student fellows will assist in laboratory-based data collection efforts, and will spend the summer in Woods Hole gaining research experience and a sense of what a career in oceanography might entail. An early-career lab assistant will gain valuable research experience by leading the sample processing activities in the laboratory. Travel support to a national meeting will allow one of the summer students or lab assistant to share results from this study with the scientific community. In an effort to foster scientific curiosity in local schools, the investigator will host students from East Boston High School as they spend a day in Woods Hole visiting various labs, facilities and attend presentations by the investigator and other scientists on careers in oceanography. The students' teacher will also participate on one of the research cruises, enabling her to share her experience with many other students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The overall goal of this study was to more thoroughly understand the diets and feeding behavior of small pelagic fishes on the continental shelf of the Northeast US. These fish are major consumers of plankton and represent a critical link between planktonic production and larger fish, bird, and marine mammals. The project focused on the six dominant small pelagic fish species in the Northeast US: Atlantic mackerel, Atlantic herring, alewife, blueback herring, northern sand lance, and Atlantic butterfish. The approaches and techniques applied in this work included (1) detailed visual gut inspections and prey identifications, (2) genetic identification of unrecognizable prey via DNA barcoding, (3) and stable isotope analysis of the examined fish species. In addition to these scientific goals, as a Research Initiation Grant, the project&rsquo;s other main objective was to provide the PI new opportunities for future research directions and ample opportunities for aspiring marine scientists&mdash;particularly those within underrepresented groups. Overall, the project was a success on all fronts.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Intellectual Merit</p> <p>There was great success in collaborating with NOAA scientists for obtaining the fish specimens in this study, thereby eliminating any costs of going to sea and maximizing the sample sizes analyzed. Fish specimens were obtained from two spring and two fall trawl surveys conducted by NOAA&rsquo;s Northeast Fisheries Science Center. A total of over 500 specimens were analyzed for stomach contents and stable isotopes. Two of the most prominent findings of the study were the seasonal differences in diets of the small pelagic fish assemblage as a whole, and the species-level differences in diets. This indicates that production from zooplankton to these important fish varies in time as well as which species is doing the consuming. Specifically, diets in the spring were dominated by copepods and appendicularians, while in the fall consumption of amphipods and krill was more prevalent (except in Atlantic mackerel). Atlantic mackerel relied heavily upon small copepods throughout the year and also consumed large numbers of fish larvae in certain locations. The large copepod <em>Calanus finmarchicus</em> represented a significantly higher proportion of the diet of alewife than Atlantic mackerel or Atlantic herring, and butterfish diets almost entirely lacked the common crustacean prey consumed by the other species, being dominated by unidentifiable soft-bodied prey. Many of these prey were genetically identified as polychaete worms, shell-less pteropods, and jellyfish. Selectivity analyses for Atlantic mackerel suggests that appendicularians and <em>Limacina</em> pteropods are highly preferred when availability reaches a prey-switching threshold. Stable isotope data corroborated diet data with the isotopic niche of these species varying by season, as well as butterfish signatures illustrating a wider niche width than the other species.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Broader Impacts</p> <p>I could not have been more pleased with the extent to which so many excited, young individuals were given a window into marine ecological research by this grant. A total of 10 individuals were supported by and/or participated in this project, including 5 undergraduates, 2 high-school students, 2 under-represented minorities, and 8 females. One major goal was to provide valuable experience for students prior to attending graduate school (and enhancing their applications when they apply), and I consider it a great success that all three core female participants (and co-authors on our published paper) are now in graduate programs. This project also supported the participation of 30 middle school students, most of which were under-represented minorities, in a field trip to Woods Hole, MA and a trip on Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard Sound with the Zephyr Foundation to experience oceanographic sampling techniques firsthand. For me personally, receiving this Research Initiation Grant has been great for getting &lsquo;my foot in the door&rsquo; with NSF funding. While I am excited by the findings of the study, it has been additionally beneficial for establishing long-term collaborations with NOAA scientists and other academics conducting similar and complementing work. Indeed, it was this project that led to me being a co-PI on the new NSF-funded Long-term Ecological Research (LTER) project that began this year on the Northeast US continental shelf.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/19/2018<br>      Modified by: Joel&nbsp;K&nbsp;Llopiz</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1325451/1325451_10257618_1526758691872_sophie--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1325451/1325451_10257618_1526758691872_sophie--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Sophie dissecting fish"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1325451/1325451_10257618_1526758691872_sophie--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Sophie dissecting fish"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Undergraduate Sophie Knorek dissects an Atlantic mackerel</div> <div class="imageCredit">Joel Llopiz</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Joel&nbsp;K&nbsp;Llopiz</div> <div class="imageTitle">Sophie dissecting fish</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1325451/1325451_10257618_1526758774134_Sara--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1325451/1325451_10257618_1526758774134_Sara--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Sara's poster"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1325451/1325451_10257618_1526758774134_Sara--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Sara's poster"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Undergraduate Sara Hamilton presents her poster at the annual WHOI Undergraduate Research Forum</div> <div class="imageCredit">Joel Llopiz</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Joel&nbsp;K&nbsp;Llopiz</div> <div class="imageTitle">Sara's poster</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1325451/1325451_10257618_1526758927373_andre--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1325451/1325451_10257618_1526758927373_andre--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Andre at the scope"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1325451/1325451_10257618_1526758927373_andre--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Andre at the scope"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Undergraduate Andre Price examines zooplankton samples during his summer at WHOI</div> <div class="imageCredit">Joel Llopiz</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Joel&nbsp;K&nbsp;Llopiz</div> <div class="imageTitle">Andre at the scope</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1325451/1325451_10257618_1519005371611_jocelynjoel--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1325451/1325451_10257618_1519005371611_jocelynjoel--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Jocelyn and Joel"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1325451/1325451_10257618_1519005371611_jocelynjoel--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Jocelyn and Joel"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Undergraduate Jocelyn Spagnuolo and the PI participating on the science verification cruise for the R/V Sikuliaq</div> <div class="imageCredit">Carin Ashjian</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Joel&nbsp;K&nbsp;Llopiz</div> <div class="imageTitle">Jocelyn and Joel</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
