<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professors Maria C. Gonzalez-Garcia, Christopher P. Herzog, Leonardo Rastelli, Martin Rocek, Robert Shrock, Warren Siegel and George Sterman at Stony Brook University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These research activities span a wide range of topics in theoretical physics, largely based on quantum field theory and string theory.   Recent years have seen a renaissance of engagement between theory and experiment in particle physics, with new and exciting data from the Large Hadron Collider, from neutrino observatories and from cosmic ray satellites.    These new sources of information about our universe enable theorists to test long-standing ideas against evolving data, and to develop new theoretical methods to guide experiment.  At the same time, novel applications of quantum field and string theory have been developed in and beyond particle physics, opening unexpected avenues of research into nuclear physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum information, sometimes with applications in pure mathematics.    As active participants in these historic developments, the senior personnel of this award will continue and develop their work in high energy collider physics, neutrino and astroparticle physics, applications of gauge-gravity duality, extensions of the Standard Model, electroweak symmetry breaking,  leptogenesis,  superstrings, the geometry of supersymmetric gauge theories, and the theory of the strong interactions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By advancing our knowledge of the laws of nature and by contributing to a better understanding of the physical universe, this research has significant broader impacts and implications for our world view.    Indeed, many of the topics under study by the senior participants are frequently discussed in the media, such as the discovery of the Higgs boson, the role of neutrinos in the Universe, string theory and the quark-gluon plasma.  The research outlined in this proposal will also serve in the training of graduate students and mentoring of postdoctoral fellows.  The faculty on this proposal conduct their research with graduate students, and share their experience and expertise with undergraduates and community members, in and beyond the classroom.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The project "Theoretical Physics" resulted in significant advances in broad areas of theoretical physics.  Many of these advances relate to quantum field theory, the most important contemporary tool to study nature, from the level of elementary particles and forces to materials with special electronic properties and applications.   As faculty members at Stony Brook University, the project's seven senior participants are involved in both undergraduate and graduate instruction, which is enriched by their research activities.   Mentorship by senior participants promoted the career development of junior participants through doctoral and postdoctoral research and training.    Intellectual Merit:  In this period, studies were published that are helping us to understand the properties of the recently-discovered Higgs boson, which mediates the masses of other elementary particles and hence the very structure of visible matter.  These studies serve to provide theoretical guidance to ongoing experimental efforts, supported by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy, that explore fundamental matter and forces at the Large Hadron Collider, the world's highest-energy particle accelerator.    Another frontier area in elementary particle physics is the study of neutrinos, where Fermilab in Illinois is performing experiments to resolve anomalies in existing data on these mysterious particles, working to answer whether this data provides hints of previously undetected natural phenomena. Neutrinos also play a critical role in the sun, and a study comparing particle experiments and solar observations was carried out.  New studies were published that synthesize the world?s current data on neutrinos.   These studies will serve as benchmarks for future planing and progress.    The Higgs particle and neutrinos play key roles in the group of quantum field theories known as the Standard Model, which accurately describes the vast majority of existing data on the structure of atoms and their nuclei, including forces that produce the decay of elementary particles and mediate the production of energy in stars.    The exploration of quantum field theories is also relevant to exotic materials and to the flow of fluids.   In this area, new methods were brought to bear, and new results were found, on quantum field theories that can describe such systems.  Certain properties that until now had been impossible to access have, for the first time, been computed numerically and from first principals.   In addition, studies were carried out on a property of matter known as quantum entanglement, which is the basis of quantum computing, and which has become an area of focus worldwide for its profound interest and its potential applications.     Other studies were carried out on properties of quantum field theories that are particularly relevant to the nuclear, or "strong" force in the Standard Model, which binds together atomic nuclei.    New approaches to quantum fields were explored in model field theories, which have already improved our understanding of how the strong force can produce composite particles like the proton and neutron out of elementary particles like quarks and gluons, and on the production of new particles in collisions at accelerators.      To understand the ultimate origin of the quantum fields that we observe in nature, string theory offers a compelling template, which appears to require that there are as-yet unobserved dimensions beyond the three plus time that we observe around us.  An innovative method to explore the theoretical potential of these proposals has been developed.   The analysis of string theories requires the creation of new mathematical tools for curved space-time, and progress was made in the exploration of these possibilities.  Broader Impact:  Much of this work was carried out with doctoral students and junior postdoctoral researchers, as an integral part of their professional training.  The senior faculty of the project all participate in teaching at the graduate and undergraduate levels at Stony Brook University, and are also active in outreach and training outside the university, including lectures at advanced international schools.  Project participants contributed to national planning exercises for the use of existing and the development of future scientific facilities.  High school students were mentored in scientific research, and activities engaging science with drama were sponsored by senior participants.   The scientific progress described above contributes to the understanding of our physical world at both its fundamental and emergent levels, and also to the national interest, through the maintenance of frontier research and the development of a workforce that is equipped with technical training and experience in solving challenging problems.
