<AbstractNarration>In organizations, groups are assembled to pool expertise and knowledge, solve complex and critical problems, and advance innovation. Yet, managing social dynamics in work groups is challenging, particularly when the groups are diverse in terms of gender, ethnicity, or cultural backgrounds. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research tests questions about work group dynamics derived from multiple theories of social influence. The aim is to move beyond questions about the pros and cons of diversity to understanding the processes by which demographic differences may influence group dynamics and performance, which will have more important implications for practice. The studies will explore such questions as: How do societal-level status differences influence multidisciplinary groups' social dynamics and performance? What types of social interactions facilitate both equity and efficiency in groups?  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The study will be conducted in multidisciplinary engineering laboratories that are at the forefront of scientific and technological innovations. From a policy standpoint, the attraction and retention of female and minority scientists and engineers has been a concern in both academic and corporate settings.  The findings from the proposed research will have practical implications for facilitating inclusive and productive working relationships in diverse teams.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on unpacking how interpersonal dynamics in diverse scientific teams leads to innovation and productivity.  Data were gathered from over 500 scientists and engineers across over 60 teams. Findings suggest that the rationale for fostering greater gender equity and integration goes beyond ensuring equal employment opportunity for men and women to accelerating scientific productivity and innovation within teams. But in order to accelerate scientific productivity it is important to not only increase gender diversity within the team but also in the context surrounding the teams &ndash; that is, in the departments and disciplines in which these teams are embedded.  Advances in science and engineering education have not yet translated to advancement in the workplace for women.The study posits that the disconnect lies in team membersÆ inability to accurately perceive expertise. After examining data collected from science and engineering teams, the study found a tendency among both male and female team members to perceive the expertise of their fellow female members at a lower level than their male counterparts, despite the level of education those women had achieved. Team membersÆ perceptions of their colleaguesÆ expertise is critical to the functioning of the team and all its members, because those perceived as experts are offered more opportunities to perform and to lead.If attributes, such as educational level, contribute relatively little to the evaluations of womenÆs expertise, then it is unlikely that any gains women make in their human capital can mitigate gender differences in employment outcomes.The study also found that the expertise of highly educated women is more highly utilized in teams with more women, and that teams with more highly-educated women are more productive in disciplines that have greater female representation.In a gender-integrated discipline such as civil engineering, highly educated and technically skilled female civil engineers are visible to team members and represent womenÆs success and abilities in this domain.  In this context, team members are unlikely to perceive female team members as less qualified than men and more likely to accept their inputs in achieving the teamÆs tasks and goals.  These findings have been used to enhance ongoing diversity curriclum at the undergraduate levels and been incorporated into workshops and presentations on the topic of diversity in science and engineering teams.
