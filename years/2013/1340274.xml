<AbstractNarration>This workshop will address the need for the neural engineering community to meet and address some of the major problems facing the progress in the area of Neural Interfacing in before the 6th International Neural Engineering Conference that will take place in San Diego just prior to the Society for Neuroscience meeting.  There are currently unsolved problems at the interface between the nervous system (both peripheral and central) that prevent clinical implementation for therapy. These problems involve both engineering and neuroscience and in particular, biocompatibility, mechanical properties, materials properties, electrochemistry, neural tissue repair and immune response. In particular outstanding benefits will be derived from the area of neuro-prosthetics, understanding the brain circuitry, engineering the brain  and neuro-modulation where it is possible to intervene directly to control or modulate the nervous system. A report will be developed based on the meeting discussions to provide guidance for possible future programs.</AbstractNarration>
