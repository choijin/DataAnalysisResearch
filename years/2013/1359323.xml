<AbstractNarration>This site is co-funded by the CISE Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) Program. This funding establishes a new Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Arkansas Little Rock. Undergraduate students will participate in summer research focused on the integration of fundamental security and forensics research with the latest technical advances in mobile computing, cloud computing, and social networks.  The research is led by an experienced faculty team that plans to offer a balance of theory, applications, and practical skills as well as mentoring and professional development opportunities for the students.  The site will focus on recruiting students from the South Central region of the United States using established regional connections.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this project lies in strong research basis and the expertise of the faculty. The projects are in research areas that are current and address national priorities. The site will leverage its National Security Agency designated Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education and NSF funded Cloud Computing Research Instrument and Computational Research Center to enhance and enrich participants' competitive research experiences. The undergraduate student participants will be able to gain a broad and unified picture of the significance of security and forensics through interactions with university professors, professionals and researchers in forensics labs, practitioners in IT industry, and security officers in military service. The research has the potential to contribute to the research core of the emerging field of cyber security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are centered on the opportunities for a diverse pool of students to gain research experiences in cyber security and forensics. The site will capitalize on the established collaborations and communication channels with regional institutions for student recruitment. Through extensive research training and careful mentoring, this program has a great potential to attract fresh young minds into graduate schools and advance the state of the art of research and education in cyber security and forensics at undergraduate level in the South Central part of the United States.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goals of this project are to 1) introduce participants especially those from underrepresented groups and institutions with limited research opportunities to state-of-the-art cybersecurity and forensics research, in particular, in mobile computing, cloud computing, and social networks, 2) nurture and train them to conduct real-world research independently, and 3) motivate and prepare them well for more advanced study and future career pursuance in cybersecurity or computer science.

Some of those projects were reported by local, national, and international media. For example, the research project on securing controlled area network (CAN) communications was covered by a wide range of media including THV 11 (a local TV channel), ACM TechNews, Yahoo.com, Science Daily, PHYS.ORG, Indian Express, Indian Times, Economic Times, Drive Spark, Buffalo Breeze, Forensic Magazine. Those research projects have produced five peer-reviewed conference papers, four peer-reviewed workshop papers, six peer-reviewed posters, and one peer-reviewed extended abstract. The outcome from a research project performed by an African American student mentored by PI Xie won the Best Poster Award in IEEE Conference on Communications and Network Security 2016.</p> <p>This project has successfully met its goal for participant recruitment and training. Among the 30 participants we recruited 12 (40%) are female undergraduates and 7 (23.3%) are African American and Hispanic students. The 30 participants were from 27 different institutions and 21 (70%) students were from the institutions that had no PhD program in computer/information science. 29 participants had no prior REU experience. A strong finding from the project assessment was that the participants reported an increase in their confidence levels towards presenting research findings at the end of each summer program. A large majority reported interest in graduate school and conducting research in particular.

The professional development seminars were well received and recommended.</p> <p>In summary, the outcomes of this award well conclude this REU project.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/01/2018<br>      Modified by: Mengjun&nbsp;Xie</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
