<AbstractNarration>This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the Population and Community Ecology Program in the Division of Environmental Biology in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and by the Emerging Frontiers Program in the Directorate for Biological Sciences, by the Condensed Matter and Materials Theory Program in the Division of Materials Research and Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate for Mathematics and Physical Sciences, and by the Office of Integrative Activities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Spatial and temporal variability are common across many areas of study ranging from physics to ecology. In all areas, it is important to understand dynamics across space: under what conditions are dynamics synchronous across space and when is there a lack of spatial coherence? Ecologists have struggled to understand spatial synchrony for over a century, in part because lack of synchrony often promotes persistence of populations. Within physics, studies of magnetic materials or of crystal structures have posed similar questions about the coherence of states across space. This project will explain how broad-scale synchrony can arise from local couplings by mapping relevant ecological models to an equilibrium model developed in physics. The interdisciplinary team of researchers has preliminary data establishing a correspondence between ecological non-equilibrium models and the equilibrium properties of physical models. Research will build on these preliminary results to confirm the presence of phase transitions for a wide variety of systems, thus providing ways to unify approaches for understanding the dynamics of synchrony. The primary tools will be computer simulations that are complemented by analytic approximations that provide understanding of transitions. This combination will both provide a deep understanding of synchrony in ecological systems that is not model specific, and produce new models of interest within physics, thus benefitting both disciplines.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This novel interdisciplinary project will contribute basic, new theory to the disparate fields of ecology and condensed matter physics by developing a basic understanding of the dynamics of synchrony at different spatial scales. Understanding of the emergence of spatially and temporally synchronous behavior in agroecological systems could have tremendous impact on effective management of plant and animal diseases, control of pests, agricultural strategies, and ultimately on food security. It is very rare that a theoretical project spanning two disparate disciplines has such potential to address questions of food security, providing novel ways to address a problem that will grow in importance with time.  The researchers plan to train students in interdisciplinary approaches and will hold workshops both at the National Institute for Mathematical and Biological Synthesis and the Santa Fe Institute to provide broad dissemination of the approaches developed.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on using ideas from statistical physics to look at questions of spatial synchrony in ecological systems.  The major results of the project focused on showing that the same ideas used to describe how magnets at a macroscopic scale arise from lining up magnets on a microscopic scale apply to ecological systems.  On a two-dimensional grid, think of a small magnet at each lattice point that can be either up or down (equivalent in lay terms to N or S).  If all the small magnets line up, there will be a magnet at the larger scale.  If the temperature (energy level) is low (below a critical point) the magnets line up so there will be a magnet at the macroscopic scale; if the temperature (energy level) is high (above a critical point) the magnets will not line up.  There is also a characteristic change in the length scale (and other measures) over which magnets line up as the temperature is raised or lowered.   This is a classical system in statistical physics and the model is called the Ising model.  We looked for a correspondence between ecological systems and this Ising model.  We looked at ecological systems over space in discrete time that had oscillations where high and low population levels alternated between years.  We thought of the role of randomness due either to small population sizes or environmental variability in the ecological system as analogous to the effect of the energy level (temperature) in the  physical system.  We called sites where the population size was high in even years up and those where it was high in odd years down to match up to the description of the Ising model.  We then showed a correspondence between the ecological systems and the Ising model in two important cases, one theoretical and one empirical.  In a theoretical model starting with a classic model from population dynamics that was originally developed to look at fish populations, the Ricker model, that was extended to incorporate dispersal between neighboring locations and the effects of randomness, we showed an exact correspondence with the Ising model using numerical approaches.  We also looked at more general cases.  We then looked at data for the individual yield of trees from a pistachio orchard over a six year period.  Pistachio trees, like many commercial tree crops, tend to alternate bear with high and low years alternating.  We showed that for some (but not all) years, that the spatial aspects of the yield were consistent with dynamics near the critical point of the Ising model (described above).  This allowed us to infer the kinds of mechanisms that might yield spatial synchrony in this orchard and rule some others out.  As our approach is essentially detail-independent, the results should apply quite widely.  Both for the specific system of yields from commercial tree crops, and more generally, it is easy to see that there is interest in both understanding what causes spatial synchrony and how possibly to either prevent or insure synchrony.  Our analyses from important underlying concepts for achieving this long term goal.       Last Modified: 12/01/2018       Submitted by: Alan M Hastings]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
