<AbstractNarration>PI: Matthew M. S. Evans (Carnegie Institution of Washington)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CoPIs: Donald L. Auger (South Dakota State University), John E. Fowler (Oregon State University), R. Keith Slotkin (The Ohio State University) and Erik W. Volbrecht (Iowa State University)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Senior Collaborators: Allison Phillips (Wisconsin Lutheran College) and Jennifer Eustaquio (Stanford University)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project comprises foundational research on epigenetics and gene expression, and thus may have broad implications for the manifestation of important plant traits, particularly in crops with large numbers of transposons in their genomes. More specifically, gametophytes are central to plant reproduction; thus this project is directly relevant to several agricultural objectives (e.g., controlling pollen fertility, limiting pollen-mediated transgene flow, inducing apomixis), particularly given the project's focus on a crucial crop plant, maize. Additionally, the project will provide a data framework for other researchers to determine how gametophytes function and how they can be manipulated to generate improved crop plants. This project will train a number of undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate scientists in an interdisciplinary fashion through frequent exchanges between the partnering laboratories. Undergraduates will gain experience in modern laboratory techniques as well as computational analysis of large-scale data sets. Undergraduate students will simultaneously be trained as researchers and educators through Stanford University's Science in Service Program. Undergraduates learn to be Science Mentors for high school students and develop laboratory curricula that are then performed by local high school programs under the supervision of the undergraduate mentors. As part of the project, students from the high school programs also participate in the project, getting exposure to genetics and image analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Within the floral tissues of flowering plants, multicellular haploid female and male gametophytes produce the gametes that undergo fertilization to produce seeds. Although gametophytes are small and undergo few cell divisions, they are crucial for producing the next generation, and execute diverse biological processes. Plant seed formation and reproduction, and thus global agriculture, are dependent on gametophyte function. In spite of their critical role in plant reproduction, gametophyte function and development has largely been overlooked due to their small size and imbedded location within the parental tissue. The maize genome, like many crop plant genomes, harbors a large number of mobile DNA elements, called transposons, and control of these elements, often through regulation of epigenetic states, is critical for maintenance of gene function and genome structure. Gametophytes help set epigenetic states in the next generation, however little is known, especially in the female gametophyte, about how transposon expression is regulated, and how that control impacts the concurrent expression of protein-coding genes. This project will use tissue micro-dissection techniques and whole genome analysis to understand the mechanisms that underlie developmental regulation of epigenetic states and cellular functions in the gametophytes of both sexes in maize. This project will screen for new mutants and genes that function in gametophyte development; perform genome-wide analysis of expression of genes, transposons, and different classes of RNAs with cellular detail; generate visual reporters for transposon activity; and characterize transposon expression in developing gametophytes. This project will determine the spatial and temporal expression pattern for genes and transposons in developing gametophytes, as well as define how they function to program gametophyte development. The effect of relevant mutants on transposon expression is expected to increase understanding of the interaction between basic gametophyte development and control of transposon activity in the important crop plant, maize. The sequence gene expression data generated from this project will be widely accessible through the project website (www.maizegametophyte.org) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo), and the Maize Genetics and Genomics Database (maizegdb.org). Seed stocks will be deposited with the Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   This project focused on a genome-wide characterization of the genes that control the development of the plant gamete-containing units, the gametophytes. Plant gametophytes are essential for fertilization and reproduction, and in maize (the focus of this project), fertilization gives rise to the seeds that are the primary agricultural product of the crop.  One primary outcome was the generation of a large dataset of all the genes actively expressed in a cell (the transcriptome) assessing the different cell types of the female and male gametophytes and specific phases during development of the maize male gametophyte (pollen). This dataset enabled identification of the protein-coding genes likely contributing to these phases of in maize reproduction, which could help inform approaches to increase pollen resilience, as high temperature can induce significant inviability and reduced seed set in agricultural settings. A novel imaging and automated computer vision pipeline was also invented for analyzing maize ear traits (‘EarVision’), which enables assessment of the functional effects of relevant mutations in putative pollen genes at a large scale. Using this system, the fitness costs were measured for a set of mutations in over 50 genes, which were selected with high precision from the transcriptome dataset.  Fitness measurements indicate a correlation between elevated transcript level and gene function in pollen, further highlighting the value of omic-scale data sets for helping predict traits for specific genes.  The same process identified two genes with key roles: 1) Zm gex2 (gamete expressed2), a gene that plays a critical role in sperm cells during fertilization; and 2) Zm larp6c1 (La-Related Protein6c1), a gene encoding a putative RNA-binding protein with a key role in enabling pollen to effectively fertilize the female flower after pollination.  As potential broader impacts, genetic manipulation of either gene may provide agronomically useful control over maize reproduction, e.g., in hybrid seed production or haploid induction. Protein coding genes aren’t the only expressed regions in genomes, and the transcriptomic dataset also enabled discovery of distinctive regulatory trends for transposable elements - i.e., mobile DNA - during male gametogenesis. The project identified a developmentally-programmed activation of transposable element expression that begins in the early stages of male gametophyte development and continues into the mature pollen and sperm cells.

Overall, the project’s results highlight maize pollen as a powerful model for investigating the developmental interplay of transposable elements and protein-coding genes, as well as for measuring fitness contributions of specific genes.  Additional broader impacts are derived from the training achieved under this project. Over 35 undergraduate students, seven graduate students and four postdocs were trained in genetics, molecular biology, and/or cell biology approaches to biological research.  Eight undergraduates were trained in mentorship and laboratory lesson plan development and a set of lesson plans covering genetics, molecular biology, and plant biology was produced that was subsequently used for STEM outreach programs for middle school students, and a public presentation covering maize evolution was presented at Discovery Day at AT&amp;T Park, a Bay Area Science Festival.  In Oregon, hundreds of undergraduates every year connect directly to plant cell and developmental biology via a lab activity growing pollen tubes in vitro; moreover, the module was written up and released via MaizeGDB.org to facilitate adoption for other college-level introductory biology courses.  Finally, the inherently engaging fluorescent Ds-GFP kernel lines were adapted for use in a genetics module for high school students from underserved populations in a summer STEM camp held at Oregon State University (&gt;50 students engaged over the past three years).
