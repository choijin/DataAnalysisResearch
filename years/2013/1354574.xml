<AbstractNarration>This project supports the operation and maintenance of four Fabry-Perot Doppler Imagers, two at the Millstone Hill Observatory in Massachusetts and two at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. These instruments provide data on the behavior of the neutral components of the Earth?s thermosphere, and contribute to studies of interactions among the Earth?s ionosphere and thermosphere in response to solar forcing as a system. This will address the distribution of energy and momentum throughout different latitudes and layers of the atmosphere.  Data and operation will be centralized through a client-server architecture that allows for remote operation, data collection and automated analysis. Data will continue to be published to the web and Madrigal database daily, within hours of observation. The project will provide educational opportunities for undergraduate students through collaborations. SSI is pursuing non-traditional educational opportunities to educate the public about space science and optics in general.&lt;br/&gt;            The ASTRA team will use the Millstone Hill and Arecibo data to investigate the magnitude, occurrence rate and variability of the midnight temperature maximum (MTM), and the annual and semiannual variability of the upper thermosphere. These results will be compared with TIMEGCM model output. Thermospheric vertical winds will be measured at each location using two different techniques, a direct line-of-sight technique and the Burnside technique where vertical winds are inferred from the horizontal wind gradient.  When available these vertical winds will be compared to vertical motion measured by the incoherent scatter radars at each location.  These observations allow for the inter-comparison and verification of the veracity of different measurement techniques and will ultimately allow for a better understanding of the 3-d dynamics of the thermosphere.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>While our knowledge of the near-Earth space environment has increased significantly in the last few decades, many significant gaps exists in our understanding of the variability of the ionosphere, thermosphere, and mesosphere. The strategic vision document entitled &ldquo;CEDAR: The&nbsp; New Dimension&rdquo; explicitly calls out space-atmosphere variability as one of the important science objectives that needs to be studied in order to advance our understanding, prediction, and potential mitigation of space weather impacts on our technologically reliant society. Variability of the Earth&rsquo;s upper atmosphere can occur on different temporal scales (short- and long-term changes). The source of long-term variability could be natural or artificial (anthropogenically induced) and this leads to uncertainties when attempting to de-convolve their influences in time series of observations. Prominent seasonal variations that affect thermospheric density and composition include annual and semiannual modulations. Operations of the Millstone Hill and Arecibo Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) instruments provided direct observations of thermospheric temperature, horizontal and vertical neutral winds during varying levels of geomagnetic activity and different dynamical conditions. Our analysis of multi-year MH FPI data showed clear annual and semiannual signatures in thermospheric temperatures. The annual and semiannual oscillations in FPI temperature over Millstone Hill in 2014 are shown in Figure 1. The blue symbols represent hourly-averaged temperature measurements in the four cardinal directions while the red curves are the fit to the observations. The amplitude of semi-annual oscillation was found to be smallest in 2012 during which the QBO phase was easterly. Another aspect of thermospheric variability is the Midnight Temperature Maximum (MTM), which is defined as a large-scale neutral temperature anomaly usually observed at low latitudes. The magnitude of temperature enhancements during low-latitude MTM events is about 50-150 K and its occurrence is linked to poleward surges in an otherwise &ldquo;quiescent&rdquo; equatorward meridional flow. In our study of the Millstone Hill FPI data, we demonstrated that the MTM anomaly can extend well into the mid-latitude region. We identified several case studies which show a 50 K enhancement near local midnight accompanied by weakening of the neutral winds, consistent with observations of Meriwether [2008]. We also investigated the statistical occurrence of MTM events over MH and its phase variability. Finally, our analysis of the FPI neutral wind and temperature data from Millstone Hill showed a clear association with the modulation of solar wind velocity and Kp. The thermosphere and ionosphere forms a tightly coupled system. The chemistry, dynamics, and electrodynamics of the region make them inextricably&nbsp;<em>intertwined. </em>It is well known that variations in Joule and particle heating at high altitudes are very effective in driving disturbance neutral winds and neutral composition changes during geomagnetic storms. Auroral heating and ion drag represent processes through which the ionosphere can impart influence on the thermosphere. The results from our study suggest that even during geomagnetically quiescent conditions, the thermosphere is constantly modulated by the underlying variations in geomagnetic activity. Figure 2 shows Lomb-Scargle periodograms of the hourly averaged nighttime zonal and meridional winds and temperature data from the Millstone Hill FPI between March and July in 2010. These periodgrams show spectral peaks at 9, 13.5, and 27 days. These periodicities in the neutral wind and temperature data correspond to similar modulations in the geomagnetic activity. The 27-day oscillation in the FPI data is likely due to the solar rotation which produces periodic heating of the thermosphere. We note here that the 13.5- and 9-day oscillations are the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> subharmonics of the fundamental period of solar ration. Similar variations were also observed in the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIMEGCM). The TIME-GCM results are shown in Figure 3 for midnight local time between 1 March, 2010 and 31 July, 2010. The geomagnetic variations, shown as the black dotted lines, are accompanied by global changes in winds and temperatures in the model results. Our results show that the response of the thermosphere to high speed streams is not limited to high latitudes only. The FPI data from Millstone Hill show that the recurrent geomagnetic activity can generate corresponding oscillations at mid-latitudes while the numerical simulations show that the thermospheric response to high speed stream extends globally.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/28/2016<br>      Modified by: Irfan&nbsp;Azeem</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1354574/1354574_10341346_1481748436693_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1354574/1354574_10341346_1481748436693_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1354574/1354574_10341346_1481748436693_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Annual and semiannual variations in Millstone Hill red-line temperatures during 2012.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Irfan Azeem</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Irfan&nbsp;Azeem</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1354574/1354574_10341346_1481748654314_Figure3a--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1354574/1354574_10341346_1481748654314_Figure3a--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1354574/1354574_10341346_1481748654314_Figure3a--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Bandpass filtered TIMEGCM results showing perturbations at 00LT in (top) zonal wind (middle) meridional wind, and (bottom) neutral temperature at 240km.
