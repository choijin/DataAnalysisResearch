<AbstractNarration>This action funds Richard Vallett of Drexel University to conduct a research project in the Computer  and Information Science and Engineering area during the summer of 2013 at Hubo Lab at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in Deajeon, South Korea. The project title is "Kinematics of Humanoid Robot Vehicle Operation." The host scientist is Dr. Jun-Ho Oh.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project develops a kinematic joint controller to enable the humanoid robot, Hubo2+ KHR-4 (Hubo), to operate a small utility vehicle as required for the 2013 DARPA Robotics Challenge (DRC). This project involves analyzing the kinematics of rotating the steering wheel and pressing the foot pedals of a golf cart, simulating the desired steering and throttling/braking motions using the Hubo virtual model (openHubo) and virtual vehicle model, and verifying the planned motion using the Hubo and physical hardware. This approach allows the DRC driving team to correlate the desired linear and angular velocities of the golf cart to the Hubo's joint movements to effectively control the vehicle during the first DRC event. Further research tasks involve updating the dimensions and mass properties of the Hubo Computer Aided Design (CAD) model to develop a more complete 3D model, which will be reflected in the improved accuracy of the openHubo model used by affiliated DRC teams working on related competition tasks.  The outcome of this research will immediately benefit engineers and DRC affiliates working with Hubo platforms in the United States on humanoid motion planning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Furthermore, the knowledge gained from working with humanoid researchers at Hubo Lab will be documented and shared with students working at the Drexel Autonomous Systems Lab (DASL) and affiliated research labs and will be used to instruct students on proper operation and maintenance of the Hubo platform. The revisions made to the Hubo CAD model will be used to facilitate cooperation between universities by providing an accurate and standardized model in this concurrent engineering project. The improvements to the virtual Hubo model will aid researchers in accurately simulating and prototyping planned motions before testing with the physical Hubo. Ultimately, this research will assist in the adoption of the Hubo as a standardized platform used for humanoid research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The focus of my 7-week research stay in Hubo Lab at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) was to create an accurate simulation model of the DRC Hubo used by Team DRC Hubo in the 2013 DARPA Robotics Challenge held in Miami, Fl.  In 2012, the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) announced a competition based on the 2011 Japan Tsunami and Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant disaster where unmanned robots would be used to navigate terrains and perform tasks vital to disaster response.  Team DRC Hubo was formed by the Drexel Autonomous Systems Lab (DASL) at Drexel University and Hubo Lab at KAIST to compete in the challenge.  Partnering universities also included University of Delaware, Worchester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), Colombia University, Swarthmore College, Georgia Tech, The Ohio State University, Purdue University, and Indiana University.  The chosen robotics hardware was the Hubo2 KHR-4 humanoid, a mature robotics platform developed at KAIST since 2002.  The goal my work at Hubo Lab was to provide up-to-date CAD models of components during design revisions to facilitate concurrent engineering between the hardware team and software teams in the United States and relay this information back to Hubo Lab to improve the hardware design.  My work involved analyzing the motion of the Hubo using Solidworks, a computer-aided design (CAD) program.  This program allowed me to perform range-of-motion analyses to determine reachability of poses and path-incursions, which was useful for competition tasks involving manipulation (ladder climbing, valve turning, driving, tool handling, door opening, and debris clearing).  Additionally, I was able to determine the mass properties of components and bodies to find the overall mass-centroid of the robot which was useful for planning walking gaits.  The solid modelÆs volume and mass properties were used to create a simulation model in the Open Robotics Automation Virtual Environment (OpenRAVE), a physics engine built for robotics simulation.  The model was also ported to the Robot Operating System (ROS) Universal Robot Descriptor Format (URDF) used by partnering schools for simulation experiments and during the competition.  The results of my work in creating the virtual DRC Hubo model allowed Team DRC Hubo to prototype motions more quickly and efficiently through software than by simply relying on time-sharing the hardware.  The accuracy of the model ensured that teams could run motion scripts on the Hubo without the need for excessive code editing and rewriting.  Through performing this research, I was able to improve my knowledge and conceptual grasp of dynamics, kinematics, circuit design, and DSP programming.  In addition to working at Hubo Lab, I had numerous opportunities to visit Korean historic sites, socialize with other EAPSI fellows and partake in Hubo Lab social activities (soccer, lab dinners, League of Legends raids).  During my trip, I traveled with EAPSI fellows around the country and visited Camp Boniface at the DMZ between North and South Korea, hiked in the Jirisan mountains, and visited Changgyeonggung Palace in Seoul.  Overall, this trip helped to broaden my world view and expose me to cultures and customs outside of what I am used to experiencing.
