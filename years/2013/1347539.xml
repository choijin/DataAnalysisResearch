<AbstractNarration>Over the past three years, the quantity and quality of synchrophasor measurements made on the U.S. electric grid have dramatically increased.  In addition, the performance and robustness of the systems used to collect and manage this high-sample rate, GPS time-stamped data have greatly improved.  The number of real-time phasor measurements in some Reliability Coordinator control rooms is now approaching the level needed for full analysis of the electric grid through synchrophasor measurements alone. This full analysis requires a Real-Time Phasor State Estimator (RT-PSE). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The objective of this project is to develop, test, demonstrate, and commercialize the RT-PSE.  The project team believes that the RT-PSE is necessary, if not critical, to realize the full value from synchrophasor measurements.  Through the capabilities enumerated above, the RT-PSE will provide more complete, higher quality, and more reliable synchrophasor data streams for use by control conter applications and operators.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Real-Time Phasor-Based State Estimation (RT-PSE) has been implemented as a portable action Adapter. This allows it to be deployed on a number of Grid Protection Alliance?s (GPA) open-source software such as openPDC and Project Alpha without changes to the RT-PSE code.    Because the openPDC is available as open source and can communicate with other Phasor Software using the IEEE C37.118 standard, it is possible for any Reliability Coordinator or TO to easily implement the RT-PSE into their existing Phasor data processing systems.  The implementation was tested on an openPDC and Project Alpha platform at RPI?s testing setup using the NE and NY PMU data. These tests showed that the RT-PSE is able to continuously run up to 30 samples per second.  In addition, ISO-NE, the NE reliability coordinator, has implemented the RT-PSE in their development systems to evaluate its performance under real time operation and compare the results to SCADA state estimation and their PMU Data quality management system (DQMS). Starting in Fall 2016 they are using the RT-PSE results to identify PMU?s with bad calibration during steady state and evaluate the RT-PSE?s performance under transient system conditions.   During steady state system conditions the average TVE is close to.  0.6 percent.  The RT-PSE is also able to compute an additional 38 virtual PMU measurements in the NE System, improving ISO-NE?s observability of the 345 kV system.
