<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the Biophotonics (7236)and Biomedical Engineering (5345) programs in the CBET Division in the Directorate for Engineering; the Robust Intelligence (7495) program in the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems in the Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering; and the the Organization (7712) program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems in the Directorate for Biology and the Instrumentation and Instrument Development (1108) program in the Division of Biological Infrastructure, also in the Directorate for Biology.  Emerging Frontiers (7275) money was provided for the Organization and Instrumentation and Instrument Development programs by the Directorate for Biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ability to optically image real-time physiological processes in living systems is of central importance for understanding how biological systems compute and function.  In order to enable the imaging of deep, arbitrary-scale tissues, the PI proposes to address one of the fundamental limitations in live tissue imaging: the scattering of light by live tissues.  Much work has been devoted to adaptive optics using conventional off-the-shelf spatial light modulators, interferometers, cameras, and other hardware. Here the PI proposes to create new technologies for adaptive optics based instead upon nanotechnology, which can help correct optical imaging for the scattering properties of living tissues. The project goal is nothing less than that of making real-time physiological processes visible throughout live tissues and organs, important for understanding how biological computations occur.  The impact will be large for any field where understanding complex 3-D systems is key - for the study of live organs such as heart and brain, for the immune system, for the study of metabolism, for the study of development and aging, and for cancer biology.  &lt;br/&gt;They will distribute all tools as freely as possible, and pursue distribution mechanisms to maximize the availability of tools, at cost whenever possible.  The proposed innovations will also benefit the field of optogenetic control of complex systems.  These innovations will also greatly help with teaching of biology and medicine at all levels of education, since the ability to visualize things is powerful in education; we will incorporate these tools into teaching both at MIT and elsewhere, engaging scientists-in-training, as well as the public.  Through both direct impact of tool usage, as well as via teaching, they anticipate that these proposed technologies will result in a more scientifically literate workforce.  they also anticipate commercial impact, in the creation of new methods of diagnostics and medicine.  The ability to hunt down better disease mechanisms, or mechanisms of disease treatment, may accelerate the development of new drugs and therapies.  Some of the technologies here proposed could also lead to new companies, or new products, thus contributing to economic development, as well as helping with dissemination of the tools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The brain is an incredibly complex circuit made out of cells called neurons.  Other biological systems, such as cancers, developing organs, and aging tissues, are also complex 3-D systems made out of heterogeneous cells.  The Boyden lab at MIT has been creating a set of new imaging tools to enable better examination of the high-speed electrical activities of neural circuits, and the probing of 3-D biological complexity more generally.  By enabling the monitoring of neural activity in intact circuits responsible for sensation, action, and emotion, these new tools are not only opening up new frontiers on the fundamental science of understanding the brain, but helping examine how neurons contribute to diseases of the brain.  More broadly, they are finding application for a diversity of investigations throughout biology.  The Boyden lab, working with the Vaziri lab (now at Rockefeller University), optimized and applied a technology, lightfield microscopy, to the imaging of brain activity.  This strategy works in a fashion similar to the human visual system: we have two eyes, and since each takes a slightly different picture of the world, our brain can reconstruct the 3-D world about us.  In lightfield microscopy, the microscope has multiple lenses, each of which captures a slightly different angle on the object being imaged.  In this way, such a microscope can reconstruct the 3-D sample being imaged.  The Vaziri and Boyden labs showed that this strategy could be used to image entire nervous systems or brains of small organisms like C. elegans and the larval zebrafish, at high speeds since the microcope has no moving parts.  Such strategies are enabling the real-time analysis of how complex biological systems work.   Another key set of contributions is towards the hope that nanotechnology might be more commonly available and utilized in high-performance optical imaging.  Nanoparticles are hard to make, and hard to organize into 3-D structures.  The Boyden lab developed a very simple way of making nanoparticles, that does not require any exotic equipment out of the reach of typical biologists:  simply take a nanowire, and vibrate it very hard using sound.  The nanowire will then automatically fragment into nanoparticles.  This strategy, sonofragmentation, requires only sonication equipment commonly available in biology labs, and thus makes the generation of nanoparticles available much more broadly than before.  In addition, the Boyden lab designed a new kind of protein architecture, which they named Pumby, which enables proteins to be arrayed in an orderly fashion on a nucleic acid (i.e., RNA) template.  In this way, proteins (and any moieties attached to them, in principe) can be scaffolded into 3-D shapes in a nucleic acid-programmable way.  The Pumby architecture, it turns out, is very useful for a broad array of scientific problems &ndash; it enables scientists to monitor the generation of proteins in cells, to halt the generation of specific proteins, and to assemble proteins in living cells.   The broader impacts of the work include the training of 11 graduate students and postdocs, two of which are now professors, one of which became a research scientist, one of which received a PhD, and the rest of which are still in their training careers.  Teaching is a big emphasis of the Boyden lab: the technologies named above have been widely disseminated, with Boyden?s group hosting many visitors to come by MIT and learn how to use tools in their research.  The various technologies are described on websites such as http://lightfieldscope.org, which teach tool usage.  Several of the technologies have been commercialized, with a company, Leaflabs, now working on advanced versions of the lightfield microscope.  The direct as well as indirect impacts of the grant have created jobs, and broadly made new tools available to the community.
