<AbstractNarration>1337511&lt;br/&gt;Ustinova&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal requests a Vicon Motion System T160S (Oxford Metrics Ltd) to replace an outdated Qualysis system for motion analysis currently used at Central Michigan University (CMU). The Vicon offers a unique combination of features that will enable cutting-edge research as well as research-based instruction in the area of rehabilitation engineering. The features include: greater camera resolution; wider aperture with greater accuracy of signal processing; minimal latency of real-time feedback; and capabilities for integration with most industrial as well as with custom-made soft- and hardware. The system will serve as a key instrument for establishing a human motion laboratory, currently missing at the university. Establishing the laboratory will expand the opportunities for multi-disciplinary collaboration across disciplines such as engineering and rehabilitation sciences.</AbstractNarration>
