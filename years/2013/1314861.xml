<AbstractNarration>Quantum computers have the potential to solve problems that are completely impossible for classical computers, ranging from cryptography for national defense to face recognition and drug development. Just as the transistor is the building block of all modern digital circuits, the quantum bit (aka the qubit) is the heart of a quantum computer.  Superconducting qubits, which are essentially artificial two-level atoms that can be designed and fabricated using integrated circuit technology, have emerged as one of the top candidates for realizing scalable quantum information processing. In order to perform quantum computation successfully, quantum computing circuits must be able to transfer quantum information rapidly among a large number of qubits with high fidelity.  However, because existing protocols for quantum information transfer (QIT) are in general an order of magnitude slower than single qubit gates, QIT has become the bottleneck for quantum computation. Furthermore, conventional methods of QIT either require a large amount of on-chip real estate or have relatively low quality factor leading to lower efficiency and fidelity. Therefore, it is difficult to scale up qubit circuits to a practically useful size with these protocols.  The focus of this project is to demonstrate the basic elements of a novel method of quantum information transmission in superconducting qubit circuits. This new approach uses "dual-rail arrays of negative-inductance Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices (nSQUIDs)" as the information transmitting structures for significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art QIT protocols. The negative mutual inductance between the branches of an nSQUID assigns the two tasks of processing and transferring quantum information to different parts of the nSQUID circuit and therefore makes it possible to optimize parameters of each part for its particular task, so that much faster QIT can be achieved. The success of the project will thus remove one of the most critical roadblocks to building quantum computers. Therefore, knowledge and insights gained from the project activities can be readily applied to other superconducting qubit based quantum computing circuits.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Quantum information research has emerged as a highly competitive cutting edge research field which is actively pursued by all major nations around the world. It is critically important to national security and to maintaining United States' leadership position in scientific discoveries and technological innovations. This collaborative project between theoretical and experimental groups in quantum circuit physics provides a good opportunity for education and training of the graduate and undergraduate students in one of the frontiers of scientific exploration. The project also includes significant outreach and education activities such as improving the undergraduate and graduate classes in Quantum Computing developed with previous NSF support at the University of Kansas and Stony Brook University; involving undergraduates into quantum information research at Kansas; and presenting colloquia on quantum information at local high schools, colleges and universities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Superconducting qubits have emerged as a leading candidate in building practical solid-state quantum computers. An important issue for scalable quantum computing is the requirement of rapid transfer of quantum information among qubits. So far, the prevailing method of quantum information transfer is based on the controllable qubit coupling via capacitance, inductance, or microwave resonator (a.k.a. cavity). Recently, a novel approach to information transfer among superconducting qubits has been proposed which utilizes quantum dynamics of magnetic flux to transport quantum information at the speed of light along a superconducting circuit. The central building block in this approach is a Josephson junction based device called nSQUID, which is a two-junction superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) with a negative mutual inductance between its two arms. Such an nSQUID has two degrees of freedom, one is the differential mode (DM) and the other is the common mode (CM).  DM and CM can be used to encode and transport quantum information, respectively and thus this novel protocol is called "dual-rail" quantum information processing.  However, although the concept of utilizing the CM of nSQUID to transmitting information encoded in the DM has been validated in classical regime the quantum nature of nSQUID, which is the most important prerequisite for its application in quantum information processing, has not been observed previously.  The objective of our project is to find out if nSQUIDs behave quantum mechanically by looking for experimental evidence of quantum tunneling which is one of the most distinctive quantum signature.  With support from this award we successfully designed, fabricated, and characterized nSQUIDs and carried out a series of experiments at 30 mK to investigate their quantumness.  The results obtained significantly exceed the scope of the project and are very encouraging.  We not only observed macroscopic quantum tunneling but also succeeded in demonstrating quantum coherence, such as Rabi oscillation which is the foundation of single bit quantum gates and Ramsey fringe in nSQUIDs.  Our findings establish a solid foundation for and pave a new way to using nSQUID to realize scalable quantum information processing.
