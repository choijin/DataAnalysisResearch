<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project will demonstrate the technical and commercial feasibility of a puncture resistant surgical glove having areas reinforced by flexible, needle resistant nanocomposite materials made from knit textiles intercalated with shear thickening fluids (STF).  STF treated textiles are a class of smart material that respond differently based on the applied stress and have proven applications in stab-resistant soft body-armor.  This STTR Phase I research will advance the knowledge and understanding of flexible composite materials for needle-resistant protective equipment. Current puncture resistant materials are made from hard ceramics or stiff, woven fabrics. The novelty of this research is the use of knit substrates, which impart important flexibility as would be required for use in glove for medical professionals and others requiring significant dexterity and tactile sensation.  The proposed research will further elucidate the mechanisms that lead to the unique material characteristics of nanocomposites based on shear thickening fluids. The optimization of the STF textile puncture resistant glove materials and glove design in this project will yield a cost-effective glove that offers protection against accidental needlestick injury together with the fit, feel and comfort demanded by medical professionals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to fill a significant, unmet need for needlestick protective gloves in the billion dollar surgical glove market.  There is no PPE option currently available to surgeons and nurses that protects against needlestick injury. Annually, 100-200 of these medical professionals die from infections resulting from needlestick injury. The device envisioned in this proposal will directly mitigate some of the 350,000 needlestick injuries sustained by medical professionals each year in the U.S. Prevention of these injuries has significant benefit for medical professionals as well as potential cost savings to our health care system. In addition, there are substantial benefits to patients with associated cost savings, by preventing incidental patient infection through needlestick injuries to surgeons and operating room nurses. The flexible, puncture resistant composites developed by this research will also serve as an enabling technology for advanced personal protective equipment with much broader applicability. Puncture-resistant gloves that are lightweight, flexible, and cost-effective are of great interest in markets such as law enforcement, waste handling, bioresearch, construction and industrial work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We are developing a fundamentally new, puncture-resistant surgical glove. There are over 350,000 needlestick injuries each year in the USA.  These injuries expose doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers to potential infection from bloodborne pathogens like HIV and Hepatitis B and C.  Sharps injuries generate over $1 billion annually in preventable costs to the US healthcare system through blood testing following a needlestick, post-exposure prophylaxis drugs, lost work, workerÆs compensation and litigation.  Needlesticks also inflict an unquantifiable mental and emotional toll on healthcare workers, who face significant fear and uncertainty about the consequences of a needlestick injury and potentially contracting HIV or hepatitis. There is a particularly high risk of needlestick injury in the operating room, however conventional latex surgical gloves offer no significant resistance to needle puncture.   Existing needle-resistant materials are far too stiff and bulky to offer the required dexterity and tactility needed to successfully complete surgery.   There is currently no needle-resistant glove option in the $1.4 billion surgical glove market.  This STTR project successfully developed a new, needle-resistant surgical glove by incorporating STF-ArmorTM materials within a biological fluid-resistant latex (or synthetic latex) glove.  STF-ArmorTM is a composite material consisting of a thin and flexible knit fabric treated with shear thickening fluid.  Shear thickening fluid is an engineered "smart" material that behaves like a fluid at low deformation rates but behaves like a solid at high rates or local stress (such as when the tip of a needle impacts the material).  When shear thickening fluid is added to an appropriate textile, the puncture resistance can be enhanced substantially with no effect on the flexibility.  Different fluid and textile combinations were tested against a wide range of needles commonly found in surgery in order to develop an STF-ArmorTM composite that provides the highest possible levels of puncture resistance and flexibility.  Further, the project investigated multiple means for assembling/integrating the STF-ArmorTM into a surgical glove. A scalable production method that is consistent with current glove manufacturing practices was successfully developed and demonstrated at lab-scale.   The glove design and comfort was validated through hands-on evaluations in which nurses performed simulated patient care activities while wearing the prototype STF-ArmorTM gloves.  The nurses judged that the gloves offered adequate dexterity and tactile sensitivity for patient care activities.  Quantitative testing of tactility showed that the STF-ArmorTM gloves offered a level of sensitivity comparable to current surgical glove products. Additionally, the nurse evaluations confirmed that needlesticks are viewed as a significant problem and that healthcare workers are willing to use a slightly thicker glove that offers more protection.   The work completed under this STTR Phase I met our overall goal of advancing commercialization of the  first puncture resistant gloves suitable for surgeons and other medical professionals through successful proof-of-concept demonstration of prototype gloves, initial demonstration of a scalable manufacturing process, and confirmation that the glove addresses a true need for needlestick protection while also offering the fit, feel and comfort necessary for healthcare workers to do their jobs effectively.
