<AbstractNarration>The Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) is part of an international effort to develop and evaluate technologies needed for a muon-based neutrino source and a future muon collider.   MICE is located at the ISIS accelerator facility at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the UK.   This award provides partial support to the University of California Riverside and the Illinois Institute of Technology to complete ongoing efforts in hardware and software development and commissioning, prior to data taking.  A broader impact of the program is to engage graduate students and postdocs in forefront accelerator physics research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF Award Project Outcomes Report:   Collaborative Research: Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment  There is increasing interest in using particle accelerators to form very intense beams of high-energy muons. Discovered in 1937, the muon (a more massive "cousin" of the electron) is a subatomic particle whose simple and well-understood interactions with matter make it a useful probe for a variety of purposes. However, due to its short average lifetime (2.2 microseconds), it has not been possible to accelerate muons to high energies. A key step in demonstrating the feasibility of muon accelerators is the Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE).  Several key technologies are needed in order to produce intense muon beams. The way such beams are produced makes them too large to fit into the vacuum chamber of a cost-effective accelerator, and the short muon lifetime means that the beams must be reduced in size rather quickly, without losing too many of the muons. This reduction in size is called "cooling." Ionization cooling is a new technique that can accomplish such cooling. The beam of muons passes through material in which it loses energy by ionizing nearby atoms. The energy loss reduces the muon velocity in all three directions (horizontal, vertical, and longitudinal). The beam is then accelerated by radio-frequency cavities, replacing only the longitudinal component of velocity. The horizontal and vertical components are increasingly reduced while the longitudinal component is maintained. The muon beam becomes increasing collimated, while focusing magnets reduce the beam size, thus achieving the needed intensities.  This project was part of an international effort to develop and evaluate these technologies in the context of a muon-based accelerator program.  The MICE experiment was constructed by an international collaboration at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire, England. The apparatus that forms the muon beam studied in MICE was installed and worked well. Our group has participated in the hardware and software development of instrumentation needed to measure the muon beams, cool them, and measure them again to determine the effects of the cooling. The particle detectors used to measure the muons have worked well. The various superconducting magnets were installed that allowed precise measurements of the muons before and after cooling and that kept the muon beam properly focused as it passed through the cooling cell. The entire system was commissioned, and the measurements to demonstrate muon ionization cooling have been made and are still being analyzed.  The development of muon ionization cooling involved advances in the theory, simulation, and design of cooling configurations.  Central to this effort has been a clear understanding of the figure-of-merit for beam cooling, i.e. "transverse emittance reduction."  In addition, suitable spectrometers positioned upstream and downstream of the cooling channel were needed to measure the amount of cooling achieved by a specific channel configuration.  Given the modest amount of cooling expected in MICE and the need to extrapolate the MICE observations to a roughly twenty-fold longer cooling lattice, the quality of the data from the two spectrometers is paramount.  Since the proponents carried out this research in university environments, both undergraduate and graduate students were involved in undertaking both the theoretical and design, as well as the hardware and software development and commissioning, aspects of this research.  One of the important aspects of this program has been the possibility for students, both undergraduate and graduate, to become involved in forefront accelerator physics research at universities.  There is a significant shortage of trained accelerator physicists and also of students studying accelerator physics.  Research such as this at the participating universities has provided opportunities to involve students in this area of research, thus broadening the population of potential candidates for graduate study in accelerator physics and future employment in universities, national laboratories, and industry.  The members of this collaboration have also had opportunities to discuss this research, both informally and in seminars, with undergraduate and graduate students, researchers, and faculty in widely varying fields of study, as well as with the broader community.
