<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating micro-electromechanical (MEMS) tactile sensing and signal processing science to fill a non-invasive eye-pressure measurement technology gap.  The translated technology has the following unique features: the ability to detect minute changes in the physical characteristics of soft materials and tissues, the ability to detect and measure pressure inside closed cavities in tissues and organs such as the human eye, and the ability to recognize changes that might occur due to aging processes.  The translated technology provides exemplary cost savings, convenience, and efficacy when compared to the leading competing corneal tonometry in this market space.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project accomplishes this goal by utilizing the latest advances in sensor miniaturization, soft tissue biomechanical modeling, and application of artificial neural network (ANN) signal processing techniques, resulting in an easy-to-use self-administered home tonometer.  The partnership engages Arch Partners LLC, EPV Sensors LLC, Arizona Retinal Specialists LLC, and the University of Arizona to provide guidance in the home tonometry market space and other aspects: evaluation and testing of the device, financing, commercialization, and marketing as they pertain to the potential to translate the tactile sensing technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential economic impact is expected to be over $2B in world-wide sales in the next 5 to 10 years, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the home tonometry market space.   The societal impact, long term, will be better management of glaucoma affecting over 4.3 M Americans each year, reduced disability rates, lower healthcare delivery costs, and greater access to eye diagnostics and care.</AbstractNarration>
