<AbstractNarration>The monumental work of G. Perleman and W. Thurston has shown the fundamental importance of hyperbolic 3-manifolds within the study of 3-manifolds.  Hyperbolic 3-manifolds constitute a complicated and mysterious class of 3-manifolds, and it is important to understand them to the fullest extent possible.  The simplest tool for analyzing hyperbolic 3-manifolds is the volume invariant.  The proposer plans to work on a grandiose open problem in the theory of hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and to use the knowledge gained from this work to better understand the connections between the topology and the geometry of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  The grandiose open problem is to find the first infinite string of volumes of 1-cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds; that is, to find all 1-cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds with volume less than that of the minimum volume 2-cusped hyperbolic 3-manifold(s).  The proposer, working jointly with D. Gabai, and in consultation with N. Thurston, has a computer-based scheme to attack this problem.  The computational aspects of the approach are interesting in their own right.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Almost 200 years ago, J. Bolyai, C. Gauss, and N. Lobachevsky revolutionized mathematics by claiming that a legitimate geometry could be constructed by taking the five classical postulates of Euclid and negating the fifth postulate (the parallel postulate).   Further, they theorized that this new and mysterious non-Euclidean geometry (now called "hyperbolic geometry") would have important applications.  Their theorizing has been borne out:  hyperbolic geometry is vitally important in the modern study of geometry.  For example, hyperbolic geometry turns out to be much more important than Euclidean geometry in the study of "3-dimensional manifolds" (our 3-dimensional Universe is an example of a 3-dimensional manifold).  As another example, it is quite possible that our Universe adheres to the laws of non-Euclidean geometry rather than the laws of Euclidean geometry.The proposer, working jointly with D. Gabai, and in consultation with N. Thurston, plans to work on a computer-based approach to understanding hyperbolic 3-dimensional manifolds by studying their volume, or size.  This understanding of volumes of hyperbolic 3-manifolds should lead to a variety of insights about hyperbolic 3-manifolds, including connections between their topology (shape) and geometry (measurement).  Such connections between seemingly unrelated areas often have profound implications for mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
