<AbstractNarration>The Exploring Engagement and Science Identity Through Participation is a research project that examines the outcomes of various citizen science models for Public Participation in Scientific Research (PPSR). The investigation specifically targets citizen science projects that focus on relationships between science learning and science identity. A mixed-method, meta-analysis approach will be employed. The two primary goals of the study are to better understand science learning and science identify within PPSR contexts and to develop a valid Participant Engagement Metric (PEM) for use within PPSR contexts. Data will be collected and analyzed from several PPSR projects and over 4,000 PPSR participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses several research questions:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1. What are the dimensions of PPSR engagement and how can we measure them across different project models?  The research for this question includes approximately 50 interviews of participants in six primary projects representing a range of PPSR approaches to develop and validate a Participant Engagement Metric (PEM) that will be constructed from the frequency, duration and intensity of involvement in key activities.  The project uses a constant comparative method of data analysis (processing of data as they are gathered in order to compare them with emerging categories. The development of the PEM will be one concrete outcome of the proposed research.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Within and among projects, what is the relationship between participant engagement and individual learning outcomes?  The project uses validated measures of learning outcomes derived from Learning Science in Informal Environments (NRC, 2009) and developed for the DEVISE project described below.  The six measures include: Behavior &amp; Stewardship, Skills of Science Inquiry, Knowledge of the Nature of Science, Interest in Science &amp; the Environment, Efficacy, and Motivation.  The proposed research will look at how engagement affects learning outcomes, as assessed by these six measures (science interest, efficacy, etc.).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project conducts participant surveys in the six participating citizen science projects in addition to several other PPSR projects to test the relationship of the PEM and other measures of activity involvement to the learning outcomes measured by the survey instruments developed and validated through a previous project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The data analysis begins with univariate summary statistics that will provide an overview of the basic dataset.  Inferential statistics including multiple regression analysis will be used to test the relationships among the independent variables (type of PPSR project, demographics), PEM as a mediator variable, and the dependent variables.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. How does degree and quality of participation in scientific research develop and/or reinforce individual science identity? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project conducts a 3-year longitudinal study using surveys, a series of in-depth interviews, and on-site observations of 36 participants from the six primary projects to understand the development of individual science identity within PPSR environments over time.  Quantitative and qualitative data and findings are triangulated to determine if convergent, inconsistent or complementary results can be identified.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project dissemination plans include presenting research in journals, disseminating research briefs, hosting online forums, and launching various listserves and online forums at the citizenscience.org website.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ To better understand how public participation in scientific research influences lifelong science learning, we examined the types and levels of engagement, several science learning outcomes, and aspects of and changes in science identity of individuals participating in six different citizen science (CS) projects. Spanning the contributory to collaborative to co-created continuum, the projects are NestWatch (NW), Monarch Larva Monitoring Project (MLMP), Community Collaborative, Rain, Hail, and Snow Network (CoCoRaHS), Hudson River Estuary Project (EELS), Alliance for Aquatic Resource Monitoring (ALLARM), and Global Community Monitor (GCM).  We used a mixed-methods approach to answer the following research questions:   1.         What are the dimensions of engagement across different types of citizen science projects?  2.         What is the relationship between engagement in citizen science and science learning?  3.         How does degree and quality of citizen science participation develop and/or reinforce science identity in participants?  To examine dimensions of engagement, we interviewed 83 participants in the six different projects and coded all comments into engagement categories.

Notable was the prevalence of extrinsically leaning motivations among co-created projects, as well as the significance of emotion and experiential learning. Social aspects of participant engagement, especially with project leaders, were particularly important. Although participants described all aspects of the scientific process, the majority of participants engaged in three main project activities or behaviors: Gathering data, submitting data, and sharing information about the project with others.

This finding suggests that engaging in more aspects of the scientific process is related to increased learning outcomes, although the strength of the relationships was not dependent on the type of project.   Triangulation of datasets from the first and second research questions reveal that participants in co-created projects had higher extrinsic motivations than participants in contributory and collaborative projects. Across all projects, there were very few examples of participants engaged in "higher order" scientific practices such as formulating hypotheses or designing their own studies, but interviewees provided rich and detailed examples of how they used data that were personally relevant and meaningful to them.  We found that far from identifying "as scientists," participants described a wide variety of aspects of identity they felt in relation to science.  We found that a majority of participants felt strongly that they are someone who uses and does science and are recognized by others as doing so, regardless of engagement level. However, those who reported doing project activities including and beyond data collection evidenced many more diverse aspects of science identity, including contributing to science and being part of the science community.  With respect to determining the influence of citizen science on science identity over the 4 years of interviews, we found evidence that 2/3 of interviewees participating in the CS project either developed or reinforced their identity as someone who does or uses science, as someone who contributes to science, and especially who identifies as a part of the scientific community. This latter may be the real "value-added" of citizen science for developing participants? identity with science. For nearly half of the interviewees, participation in the CS project specifically reinforced those aspects of their science identity, while only about 20% of participants developed those aspects of science identity over time. These findings indicate that participation in CS primarily reinforces participants? identity with science; however, an important proportion of participants did develop an identity with science that they didn?t have before.
