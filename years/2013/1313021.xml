<AbstractNarration>This is a theoretical project to develop simulations of protoplanetary disks that model the development and saturation of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence and the response of small solid particles to that turbulence.  They will focus on planetesimals 1-100 km in size, and more accurately model Ohmic diffusion and ambipolar diffusion in disks.  One of the goals is to determine whether planet formation can occur equally through a disk, or whether there are locations or disk properties (such as metallicity) that strongly favor or inhibit planetesimal formation.  Planetesimals are the first bodies in primordial circumstellar disks that are large enough that their dynamics is dominated by gravity at the very early stages of planet formation, and they eventually lead to the formation of planets.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include training a postdoctoral researcher, incorporating this work into class lecture notes which are shared with the astronomy community, and providing planetarium programs to the public.  This work has implications for models of how planets formed in our solar system, and for extrasolar planetary systems.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project studied how the first comet or asteroid-sized bodies, called planetesimals, may have formed within the disks of gas and dust that orbit newly formed stars. The investigators focused on the hypothesis that planetesimal formation is initiated by the streaming instability, which causes pebbles orbiting within the gas disk to cluster into dense clumps that can collapse gravitationally to form planetesimals. Using new computational methods that were developed as part of the project, and NSF XSEDE supercomputer resources, we completed a series of numerical simulations of planetesimal formation. The most significant result was a demonstration that the predicted distribution of planetesimal masses, arising from the streaming instability, appears to be independent of the sizes of the pebbles that participate in the instability. This implies that the primordial asteroid and Kuiper Belts in the Solar System, and analagous structures in extrasolar planetary systems, have certain universal properties. Simple models were developed to investigate where and when planetesimals may form within disks. We also studied how turbulence within protoplanetary disks develops over long time scales, and explored how this may affect the pebbles that are the raw material for planetesimal formation. The project provided partial support for one graduate student and two postdoctoral researchers, who gained experience in different aspects of high performance computing. The Principal Investigator gave advanced lectures on protoplanetary disks and planet formation at two winter schools, published a major open access review on the physics of protoplanetary disks, and participated in outreach activities with the Logan School (Denver) and via Sommers-Bausch Observatory.
