<AbstractNarration>This project will develop the key technologies needed for interactive wireless applications operating in shared spectrum. Sharing is the new spectrum paradigm, and interactive applications are the most demanding in terms of the quality-of-service they require. Thus, they are the perfect vehicle to push the frontiers of our understanding of sharing. This project will explore new high-reliability coding techniques to protect interactive applications while meeting tight latency constraints and explore how to coexist with neighboring disparate systems through explicit and implicit signaling. The project will contribute the fundamental understanding required to define the correct regulatory structure for spectrum sharing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broadly speaking, the interactive applications that this project will study are the key to the next growth phase in commercial wireless - as machines need to interact with each other to improve the performance of real-world systems. Because industrial control is a critical use case, this project can help invigorate the agile manufacturing sector of the economy. Efficiently shared spectrum is much more economical than exclusive-use spectrum and hence could help innovative high-skill manufacturing where the United States has an advantage over low-wage countries. While developing this technology, the project will train students in a way that encourages cross-fertilization of ideas between wireless communication, circuit implementation, control theory, and coding theory. These ideas will be brought into the classroom, including our new M.Eng. courses aimed at educating innovative technical leaders. The project will also broaden participation in the technical workforce by mentoring students from underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>For the typical American, wireless is synonymous with unreliability. We've all experienced dropped cellphone calls and flaky WiFi. But increasingly, we need to be able to use wireless in applications that demand ultrareliability. Think about flying drones or machines in factories. As any video-game player can attest, "lag" is a big deal when you want to interact with others and your interactions have consequences (even if only in the world of a game). So, in addition to ultrareliability, we need what is called very low latency. Finally, the wireless spectrum was traditionally divided up into lots of exclusive use blocks, but we no longer have that luxury because there is no more exclusive spectrum available. Consequently, we need to understand what ultrareliable low-latency systems really need, so that we can come up with ways for the wireless spectrum to be shared effectively without hurting reliability.</p> <p>In this project, we helped figure out how to do exactly this. We found that the key to reliability is a concept called "diversity" --- which is a technical version of the popular adage "don't put all your eggs in one basket." To appropriately exploit this diversity, we needed to understand not just how to combine ideas of error-correcting codes (being able to recover from little bits of noise) with wireless protocols for this purpose, but also the degree to which we need to trust our models of the world. The popular adage is "In theory, theory and practice are identical. In practice, they're not." This gap comes from modeling precision and the unknown nature of the real world. We found that it is indeed possible to be robust to uncertainties in our model. But certain uncertainties, namely those that effect diversity itself, we do need to understand. Consequently, we did a deeper exploration of the nature of wireless channels, how they change at a fast time-scale. After all, for industrial machines (to enhance the productivity and creativity of the American worker), we need to understand what happens at the time scale of hundreds of times per second --- milliseconds. We found that when we care what happens at the level of one-in-a-billion or one-in-a-million type events (corresponding to a machine messing up once a year or once every shift in continuous 24/7 operation), we needed to enhance our understanding of these models. The kind of models that supported flakey WiFi and cell-phone calls weren't good enough anymore.&nbsp;</p> <p>All this taught us a lot about what we need from shared spectrum --- we need the other systems to not hinder our diversity.
