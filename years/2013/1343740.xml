<AbstractNarration>Under the direction of Dr. Sally McBrearty, Mr. Nicholas Blegen will collect data for his doctoral dissertation. The project explores the origin of modern human behavior through archaeological research into the technologies, subsistence strategies and environments present in the later middle Pleistocene (~300-130 thousand years ago) of Sub-saharan Africa, the time and place that Homo sapiens originated. National Science Foundation support will be used for archaeological excavation of the Sibilo School Road Site (SSRS) in Baringo, Kenya. This site preserves stone tools and fossil bones in sediments recently dated to 284 thousand years before present, roughly 90 thousand years before the first appearance of Homo sapiens. The rare associations of stone tools and bones in a well-dated context at the SSRS suit it to answer three important questions about hominin behavioral evolution in this important time period: 1) What types of stone tools were present in the East African later middle Pleistocene? Stone tools from SSRS have the potential to characterize the types of tools present in African later middle Pleistocene as well as how they were made and used. This can reveal if advanced composite technologies such as spears or projectiles were already in use around the origin of Homo sapiens or whether older technologies such as large hand-held technologies persisted. 2) What types of fauna were present in the later middle Pleistocene? The SSRS has the potential to produce an ecologically informative fossil fauna in a well-dated context, and provide insight into the environments that hominins of this time period occupied. 3) What were hominin subsistence strategies like in the later middle Pleistocene of East Africa? The SSRS has the potential to produce a rare record of subsistence behavior in the later middle Pleistocene of East Africa through recovery of an in situ archaeological fauna. An archaeological fauna would provide insight into the abilities of hunters in this period to take large and dangerous prey, choices of which prey body parts to transport and the distance this prey is transported. All of these are important to demonstrating similarities and differences between later middle Pleistocene hominins and modern hunter-gathers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The later middle Pleistocene of Africa encompasses significant behavioral and biological adaptations in human evolution. Many researchers in the field agree that all behavioral characteristics unique to Homo sapiens did not appear simultaneously. However, the rarity of associated stone tools and fossil bones in well-dated contexts for this time period poses challenges for establishing the order in which modern behaviors were acquired as well as the timing their appearance relative to environmental changes and the biological origin of the human species. Results of this project will: 1) Produce a new later middle Pleistocene stone tool assemblage in a well-dated context from East Africa. 2) Produce a new faunal assemblage to the small but growing later middle Pleistocene data set. Individually both are valuable contributions to the understanding the origin of Homo sapiens. Take together the presence of multiple behavioral characteristics in association offer the rare opportunity to relate behaviors like technology, subsistence behavior and habitat preference around the time of our species origin&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Data collection will be conducted in collaboration with Kenyan researchers in the National Museums of Kenya and local communities of Baringo, Kenya. Research funded by this proposal will assist in the doctoral training of the Co-PI, Nick Blegen, and benefit the National Museums of Kenya and local community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The later Middle through Late Pleistocene (~10&ndash;400 ka) of East Africa is an important time and place for the behavioral and biological evolution of our species. This period records the first appearance of Homo sapiens and spans significant technological changes including the decline of large handheld stone tools characteristic of the Acheulean, the development of stone tool technologies collectively known as the Middle Stone Age (MSA). These include diverse Levallois prepared core techniques and the manufacture and use of pointed weapons. It is in association with MSA technologies in sub-Saharan Africa that most of the behavioral features considered characteristic of modern humans first appear.     This doctoral dissertation provides new chronological and archaeological data relevant to hominin behavior associated with MSA technology in the Middle and Late Pleistocene of East Africa. Improved chronological resolution is achieved through tephrostratigraphy, the correlation of volcanic ashes, combined with chronometric dating in two regions: the Kapthurin Formation in the Rift Valley, Baringo, Kenya and the eastern Lake Victoria Basin of western Kenya. New data on hominin behavior is provided by archaeological excavations of two sites:     1) The 196&ndash;226 ka Sibilo School Road Site in the Kapthurin Formation.     2) The 33&ndash;49 ka site of Nyamita Main in the eastern Lake Victoria Basin.      Though separated by ~200 km and sampling largely different time periods, the archaeology of the Kapthurin Formation and the eastern Lake Victoria Basin are connected thematically by the presence of MSA technology. These basins are also connected stratigraphically and chronologically, as this study shows, by tephra correlations between them.     Results of this work demonstrate:   1) Levallois prepared core techniques, important aspects of MSA technology, are shown to be &gt;380 ka in the Kapthurin Formation, ~100 kyr older than previously estimated in East Africa.      2) Long distance transport (&gt;166 km) of high quality obsidian for stone tool manufacture was a feature of hominin behavior associated with Middle Pleistocene MSA technology ~200 ka ago.      3) MSA technology persisted in East Africa later than 49 ka and perhaps later than 33 ka, after Later Stone Age technologies, often considered categorically superior, are documented in the region.      By demonstrating both the early and late presence of various aspects of MSA technology and associated hominin behavior this work shows that tephrostratigraphy and the excavation of new archaeological material in East Africa are productive means of producing new and important data on the MSA and the evolution of human behavior.
