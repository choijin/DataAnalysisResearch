<AbstractNarration>Stanford University will bring together faculty and researchers for a series of workshops to assess the potential for (1) expanding the number of researchers and specifically PhD students in Computer Science education research; and (2) establishing the legitimacy of computer science education research as a research discipline within CS departments at research-oriented schools. The first workshop will identify key research directions in computing education drawing from other STEM education disciplines. The second workshop will address the many concerns of how Computer Science education research can effectively be housed with CS departments.</AbstractNarration>
