<AbstractNarration>Astrophysical and cosmological data point convincingly to a large component of cold dark matter in the Universe, but the nature of that dark matter is still unknown.  Axions are possible dark matter candidates.  This award will support the Axion Dark Matter eXperiment - High Frequency (ADMX-HF), which searches for Axions in the galactic halo.  ADMX-HF extends the range of the ADMX experiment to the higher frequency band that probes both Axions with trace mass and Axions with sufficient mass to account for all the matter density in the Universe.  ADMX-HF is therefore a uniquely powerful probe of Axion dark matter.  Several new technologies have been developed in support of ADMX-HF.  These have potential applications for high-precision measurements in other fields. The group has a history of employing undergraduates in the research, which provides training and experience in the areas of experimental control and data analysis software, mechanical and electronic assembly.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Axions in the galactic halo can be converted into a narrow-band microwave signal by an apparatus consisting of a microwave-cavity resonator permeated by a magnetic field.  ADMX-HF is a small microwave cavity experiment that serves as both a pathfinder to take first data in the 10 to 100 micro-electronvolt range and as a test-bed for developing new cavities and quantum-limited photon detection schemes that could be migrated to the larger ADMX platform.  All major systems have been constructed and are being integrated into the experiment with full commissioning to begin soon.  During this award period ADMX-HF should transition to routine data-taking operation and probe the 16.5 to 66 micro-electronvolt range, bracketing the mass of the axion that corresponds to saturation of the matter density of the universe.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The nature of dark matter which accounts for 80% of the matter contained within the universe remains a mystery.  It is generally assumed that dark matter comprises some as yet undiscovered particle or particles, which interact very feebly with light or ordinary visible matter, so feebly that they have eluded detection except through their gravitational interaction. The observational evidence for the existence of dark matter is presently taken as conclusive and as certain as possible within the framework of modern physics.  A possible dark matter particle is the Axion which is motivated by certain peculiarities in the nature of the forces that bind nucleons together.  In particular, the nuclear force ,as described within the context of Quantum Chromodynamics, should not be time-reversal symmetric, whereas experimental tests show no sign of time asymmetry, to a level far below where one might expect quantum fluctuations to generate such.  This theorectical puzzle is addressed by introduction of the Axion which neutralizes the possible time-reversal asymmetric effects.  The Axion is a perfect dark matter candidate: It is presumed to be very light, with experimental and astronomical observational evidence to suggest it is less that 1 milli-electron volt (the mass of an electron is 511 kilo-electron-volts).  As postulated, the Axion interacts very feebly with electromagetic fields or with matter, with undiminsihed gravitational effects.  To give the known dark matter mass in our galactic halo, about 100 trillion axions per cubic centimeter are required. Even with such a huge number available, their interactions with matter or fields is so feeble that their detection is at the limit of what is experimentally possible.  A very small fraction of these galactic halo axions can be converted to radio-frequency photons  by use of a strong magnetic field.  Operationally, a resonant cavity is placed in a very strong magnetic field, and a possible signal from cavity is amplified and detected using state-of-the-art quantum limited amplifiers.  Unfortunately, the axion mass is unspecified by the theory, however cosmological models suggest around 25 micro-eV is a reasonable range.  By use of the Einstein relation E=hf, where E = mc2 is the axion mass energy, h is Planck's constant, determines f to be about 5-6 GHz, which is near the WiFi band.  Our first detector was designed to operate in this frequency range, due in part to the availability of microwave components.  The detector which was built and has been operating at Yale is referred to as HAYSTAC, for Haloscope At Yale Sensitive to Axion Cold (dark matter), and was originally call ADMX-HF until Jan. 2017.  The work is a collaboration between Yale, U.C. Berkelely, and Colorado University (Lawrence Livermore was part of the collaboration through 2015).  The HAYSTAC detector comprises several complex subsystems:  A dilution refrigerator which cools the sensitive detection region to about 0.1 K, or a tenth of a degree above absolute zero A tunable microwave cavity that incorporates an adjustable power output coupler, cooled to 0.1 K A low noise amplifier, for which we employ a Josephson Parametric Amplifier (JPA) that provides sensitivity at the quantum zero-point-fluctution limit, cooled to 0.1K A superconducting magnet with a large bore to accommodate the cavity Magnetic shielding for the JPA and microwave components  A data acquisition and experiment control computer and software Data analysis software.   A photograph of the apparatus which is inserted into the magnet bore is included with this report.  The major complication of this type of experiment is the lack of knowledge of the location of the axion signal in frequency. Thus, the experiment needs to be slowly tuned, and over about 1 year of data acquisition, we were able to scan 200 MHz, and plan to increase this scan speed with future upgrades to the experiment.  Because of the slow search process, the operation needs to be fully automated and highly reliable.   In summary, the outcomes of our award are: Demonstration of a JPA-based tunable axion detector that achieved sensitivity at the level of the KSVZ model; Acquisition of data and its analysis over a 200 MHz scan range, as shown in the attacthed figure, which includes comparisons (in the graph inset) to other work in this field. In achieving these outcomes, we demonstrated the operation of a JPA near a strong 9 Tesla magnetic field, which required the development of novel magnetic shielding techniques.  The broader impacts include the demonstration of the use of quantum information techinques (JPA) to more general physics and astrophysics experiments where the lowest noise that can possibly be achieved is required. In addition, this experiment has provided an ideal training ground for students and postdoctoral researchers, in that the project is relatively small and self-contained.  The intelletual merits include working toward the identification of dark matter which is known to exist in abundance, but has so far eluded direct, non-gravitational detection.
