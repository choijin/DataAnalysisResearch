<AbstractNarration>Simulation tools for astrophysical and space physics systems share a set of common requirements: they need to robustly simulate magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows around spherical bodies with high accuracy. Building a computational framework, based on shared needs in space physics and astrophysics, will unleash important synergies between these two allied fields of study. The MHD equations are a combination of the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid dynamics and Maxwell's equations for electromagnetism.  Thus, the MHD equations require numerical solvers that incorporate the hydrodynamic fluid motion and enforce the divergence free magnetic field, i.e. no magnetic monopoles, requirements on the geometric domain (which is approximated by a polygonal mesh). The nature of the MHD equations closely couples solution methodologies to the underlying mesh, making it necessary to develop new algorithms for the (divergence-free) reconstruction of the magnetic field on novel mesh structures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Simulation tools for astrophysical and space physics systems share a set of common requirements: they need to robustly simulate magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flows around spherical bodies with high accuracy. This multidisciplinary project will develop algorithms from applied mathematics for robust, highly accurate non-relativistic MHD on geodesic meshes. In the past few years new schemes for simulating conservation laws with truly multi-dimensional divergence free approximate Riemann solvers for applications have been developed. Currently, these Riemann solvers are only available for two-dimensional rectangular structured meshes for MHD. This project will employ a geodesic mesh to provide the best possible coverage for simulations of magnetohydrodynamic flows around spherical bodies and to incorporate Delaunay triangulation to achieve high accuracy. Divergence-free formulations of vector fields can be found on these triangular meshes.  The MHD system is formulated as a system of conservation laws. With a traditional conservation law, the fluxes can be evolved on a dimension-by-dimension basis. The fact that different flux components are coupled in an involution-constrained system also makes a case for multidimensional upwinding based on multidimensional Riemann solvers. Such solver strategies are again intimately coupled to the mesh structure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Simulation tools for physical processes such as Earth based wind and weather, as well as astrophysical and space physics systems, share a set of common requirements: they need to robustly simulate flows around spherical bodies with high accuracy. Wind and weather are both physical processes that require the numerical solution of partial differential equations on a sphere. The dynamics of space weather (for example solar storms) is modeled by a system of partial differential equations called magnetohydrodynamics, that capture the interaction between magnetic fields and moving, conducting fluids. The nature of the magnetohydrodynamic equations closely couple solution methodologies to the underlying mesh, which made it necessary to develop new algorithms on novel mesh structures. This project employed a geodesic mesh to provide the best possible coverage for simulations of flows around spherical bodies.  We incorporated Delaunay triangulation to achieve high accuracy and to gain opportunities for using powerful mesh partitioning algorithms for parallelizing the code.  This multidisciplinary project required the development of applied mathematical algorithms to support such a computational capability. This newly developed computational framework, based on shared needs in space physics and astrophysics, as well as Earth weather will unleash important synergies between these fields of study.  The description of the computational method and numerical tests and the technique for partitioning the sphere for the method and flow templates have been disseminated to the public through publication in peer reviewed journals.  In addition, several other applied mathematics papers have been published and under-represented minority students have been trained in this area.
