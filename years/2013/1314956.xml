<AbstractNarration>The domain name system (DNS) protocol plays a significant role in operation of the Internet by enabling the bi-directional association of domain names with IP addresses.  It is also increasingly abused by malware, particularly botnets, by use of:  (1) automated domain generation algorithms for rendezvous with a command-and-control (C&amp;C) server, (2) DNS fast flux as a way to hide the location of malicious servers, and (3) DNS as a carrier channel for C&amp;C communications. This project explores the development of a scalable, hierarchical machine-learning stack, called HIMALAYAS, which specializes in algorithms for automatically mining DNS data for malware activity. In particular, we are interested in isolating both ordered and unordered sets of malware domain groups whose access patterns are temporally and logically correlated.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HIMALAYAS performs a task of increasing complexity at each level - starting from scalable clustering and feature selection at lower levels, to more advanced malware domain subsequence identification algorithms at higher levels. It has multiple benefits, including speed, accuracy, interpretability, and ability to use domain knowledge, which makes it very well suited for malware analysis and related tasks. The analysis by HIMALAYAS should accelerate the identification and takedown of malware domains on the Internet and improve services such as Google SafeSearch. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The machine-learning stack developed as part of the HIMALAYAS project has broader application to many important data mining problems, e.g., in financial data analysis, and mining user patterns from web access logs.  The project provides opportunities for students to participate in the development and transition of the technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  HIMALAYAS was cross-disciplinary multi-institutional project that brought together security and machine learning researchers from SRI, University of Minnesota (UMN), and the Texas A&amp;M University.   The objective of the HIMALAYAS project was to develop a unique machine learning stack, which employs a data waterfall model to continually filter, cluster and analyze live, high-volume cyber security-related data, such as evolution of malicious domain groups on the Internet.  Among its accomplishments, the team published several papers in top tier journals (IEEE Transactions on Networking), security conferences (IEEE Security and Privacy, Usenix Security, NDSS, ICDCS), data mining conferences (KDD, NIPS). We identify three noteworthy results.    First is work conducted at TAMU on SMASH (Systematic Mining of Associated Server Herds), that utilizes an unsupervised framework to infer malware "server herds" by systematically mining the relations among all servers from multiple dimensions. We developed a prototype system of SMASH and evaluate it with traces from a large ISP. The result shows that SMASH successfully infers a large number of previously undetected malicious servers and possible zero-day attacks, with low false positive rate. We believe the inferred ASHs provide a better global view of the attack campaign that may not be easily captured by detecting only individual servers.    A paper describing this research was published at ICDCS 2015 and received the best paper award.    Second, UMN and SRI collaborated to work on models and inference mechanisms for discrete time series which can be applied to DNS data sequences. We developed (a) the first provable correct algorithm for inference in HSMMs; (b)  investigated the use of LSTMs for malicious domain group detection from DNS sequences (results published in the IEEE S&amp;P Deep Learning for Security Workshop 2018) and (c)  developed a novel formulation for temporal modeling using RNNs (recurrent neural networks), which includes LSTMs (long short term memory) neural networks as a special case.  The architecture and approach have been shown to be effective in a variety of real world settings.   Third, the SRI team worked on a framework for analyzing the content of darkweb (onion) domains that are hosted on the Tor anonymous overlay network.   We developed an automated infrastructure that crawls and indexes content from onion sites into a large-scale data repository, called LIGHTS, with over 100M pages and Automated Tool for Onion Labeling (ATOL), a novel scalable analysis service for thematic assessment of the content of onion sites in the LIGHTS repository. Our evaluation results demonstrate that ATOLClassify gives a 12% performance gain over an analyst-provided baseline, while ATOLCluster gives a 7% improvement over state-of-the-art semi-supervised clustering algorithms.     A paper describing this work was published in KDD 2017 and AAAI AICS Workshop 2017.  The source code of ATOL was publicly released.    The project supported over 15 students, including 5 graduate students each at UMN and TAMU, and 5 summer internships at SRI (including one high school student and four graduate students).  Female and minority students were supported as part of this grant.             Last Modified: 12/19/2018       Submitted by: Vinod Yegneswaran]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
