<AbstractNarration>GeoPRISMS program that conducts interdisciplinary activities that integrate the Earth and Ocean Sciences communities. The overarching themes of research are 1) the origin and evolution of the continental crust; 2) fluids, melts and their interactions; 3) tectonic-sediment-climate interactions; 4) geochemical cycles; and 5) plate boundary deformation and geodynamics. The guiding principles to study these main themes are 1) the use of interdisciplinary communities; 2) the study of active systems; 3) use of experiment, theory and computation; 4) crossing the shorelines; and 5) use of focus sites. Research at the main initiatives (Rift Initiation and Evolution; Subduction Cycles and Deformation) combine large scale amphibious deployments and smaller marine or terrestrial field studies at Cascadia, Eastern US, Alaska-Aleutians, East Africa and New Zealand. The field studies are augmented with thematic and global studies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funds are provided for the GeoPRISMS Office including deliberations of a Steering and Oversight Committee and an Education Advisory committee. The Office will  provide structure for the GeoPRISMS community to facilitate community planning, organizes planning and synthesis meetings, and supports the community management structure by organizing meetings of the steering and educational committees. The Office will also support education and outreach activities, provides direct links between the GeoPRISMS community and national infrastructure facilities (such as EarthScope), and facilitates international collaboration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The office will provide a central vehicle for the dissemination of the planning, execution, and documentation of the main scientific projects.  The Office will also provide outreach to scientists working in hazards and economical resources and promote  teaching, training, and learning through its education and outreach activities that include a distinguished lecturer program, mini-lessons and webinars, a student and community forum, a postdoctoral fellowship program, and graduate student symposia that are held during GeoPRISMS workshops.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ GeoPRISMS scientists study the evolution of the Earth's continents with particular interest in the structure and dynamics of convergent margins (subduction zones) and extending margins (rifting margins). The GeoPRISMS program is a 10-year funding opportunity within NSF that bridges a divide between programs that  traditionally fund either sea-going or terrestrial science. The GeoPRISMS program is also a community effort that is supported by an active Office, that rotates between universities approximately every three years.  During 2013-2016 the Office was located at the University of Michigan. During this time the Office activities included:  Publication of twice-yearly newsletters documenting GeoPRISMS research and community efforts.   Maintenance of a website for the GeoPRISMS program (geoprisms.org) along with an active presence on Facebook and Twitter.  Organization of a successful Theoretical and Experimental Institute on the Subduction Cycles and Deformation that was attended by 120 participants including many early-career scientists.  Organization of multiple mini-workshops during the annual American Geophysical Union in San Francisco. During this meeting with also host an increasingly more busily attended Townhall and Community Forum and a student prize competition for best poster and best oral presentation.   Organization of an annual meeting of the steering and oversight committee at NSF headquarters in Arlington, VA.   Organization of a Distinguished Lecturer Program that brings between four to six scientists to universities, musea, and community colleges to discuss advances in GeoPRISMS science.  Documentation of the scientific outcomes of GeoPRISMS-funded science in a review report (geoprisms.org/2015-review).  The Office also prepared the community participation in the formal mid-term review that was mandated by NSF.       Last Modified: 05/31/2018       Submitted by: Jeroen E Ritsema]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
