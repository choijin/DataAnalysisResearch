<AbstractNarration>This award provides renewed funding for a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the University of California, Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla, CA. The Scripps Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF)program is a 10-week summer program that invites sixteen undergraduate students from across the country to Scripps to participate in a high quality collaborative research with Scripps faculty and researchers. Program components include a comprehensive research project, research seminars, career workshops, graduate school preparation, a GRE-prep course, participation in a research symposium, field trips and social events.  Research topics directly relate to many contemporary environmental issues and underlie an understanding of earth systems, evolution, climate, marine and ocean sciences and sustainability. All participants will present the results of their summer research projects in the SURF Research Symposium at Scripps and will be encouraged to present at a national conference as well. This program will give REU participants access to research facilities at Scripps and the opportunity to engage in high quality collaborative research with accomplished faculty mentors, graduate students and researchers. The breadth of ocean-related sciences at Scripps makes it accessible to students from practically all science and engineering disciplines, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, geology, ecology, physiology, molecular/biotechnology, environmental sciences, technology/computer science and pharmaceutical sciences. This program will provide a total of forty-eight students with an exceptional research experience and career training.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant provided three years of funding (2014-2016) for the Scripps Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego.  The SURF REU program, funded continuously since 2011, provides summer research opportunities to undergraduates as a means to enhance student learning (e.g. through realization of practical applications), positively influence students? decisions to continue in careers and graduate programs in ocean sciences, and help minority students overcome traditional boundaries in the sciences.  In particular, the SURF REU seeks to recruit students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in the ocean sciences and for whom this research experience will likely have the most impact in terms of career development.  Increasing diversity in the ocean science workforce is a high national priority and is necessary to maintain and enhance the intellectual health of our disciplines. Over the last three years, SURF has trained a total of 67 undergraduate students.  Fifty of these students have been supported directly by this NSF REU grant, and the other 17 have been supported by a mix of additional funds that directly support the SURF program goals. There are three key assessment results of the SURF REU program to date. (1) In each year of the program we have exceeded our recruitment goals to attract and admit over 50% of our participants from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in ocean sciences. (2) Summative evaluations from pre- and post- program survey from each summer cohort define the SURF program as highly effective, with statistically significant positive outcomes in students? academic preparedness and confidence in their ability to conduce scientific research in earth and ocean sciences. (3) Follow-up surveys and longitudinal studies to assess the longer term impact of the SURF program on the field establish that the SURF research training and experiences have effectively increased the "pipeline" of underrepresented minority students who are pursuing graduate school, research and careers in earth and ocean sciences.  The group photos in Figures 1-3, taken towards the end of the summer in 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively, captures the diversity emphasis of the SURF program and also displays the confidence and enthusiasm of the participants, espeically prominent towards the end of the summer program.  This project commited to recruiting and retaining diverse students in ocean and earth sciences; working toward building a research community, professional organizations and leadership that will also look as diverse as our SURF program in the near future.
