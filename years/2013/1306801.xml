<AbstractNarration>This work by the Rutgers particle physics group is mainly focused on advancing the potential of the CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider by a combination of novel physics analysis, exploration of instrumentation improvements, and a broad outreach program.  Research topics include understanding the properties of the recently discovered Higgs boson, searches for supersymmetry, and other searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model. The group will also continue its leading efforts in the Pixel Luminosity Telescope (PLT), which is a novel diamond-based proton-on-proton interaction rate monitor around the LHC beam-pipe near the CMS detector.  The Rutgers group will also participate Quarknet outreach activities, including helping New jersey teachers and students deploy a large-area cosmic ray detector.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This Rutgers high energy physics group has successfully carried out the proposed projectof searching for signs of new physics at the smallest distance scales achievable.  The work is carried out at the CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. Our current understanding of nature is described by the Standard Model of particles and fields.It is the most precise description of natural phenomena constructed.  However, it containsknown flaws, both internal and external.   Internal problems in the Standard Model arise from its treatment of various symmetries in the theory, and the way they are broken in the observable universe.  One of the keys to how these symmetries are broken is the  higgs boson.  The Rutgers group played a major role in the discovery of this fundamental part of the Standard Model in 2012.   This discovery opened up many more questions about the fundamental nature of matter.  The  relative lightness of the higgs boson, seventeen orders of magnitude lower than the Plank scale, is a major problem within the current Standard Model. It is so perplexing that it has its own name, the "Hierarchy Problem".   One of the proposed theoriesto solve these problems is called Supersymmetry, and  our group has been on the forefront of understandingthe ramifications of this theory and searching for its signals in the data. Our expertise spans varied particles signatures, photons, leptons (electrons, muons, and tau leptons) as well as b-quark and light quark jets.  Theseparticles all leave distinct impressions on the detector and we haveused these to search for new phenomena.  We have used our photon expertiseto investigate the decay of higgs to photons, a major discovery channel.We have also investigated several Supersymmetric models that contain photons.Our expertise in leptons allowed us to investigate several signatures of Supersymmetry and other new physics (such as a fourth generation of quarks).Our group has also been at the forefront of searches using the fragmentationleft by quarks and gluons, called jets.  Since quarks and gluons carry the strong nuclear force,  new physics signatures that contain just quarks andgluons can be very difficult to extract from the copious strong force backgroundspresent in hadron collisions such as those at the LHC and Tevatron.  With help from our theory colleagues we created innovative search strategies for such new physics.  We used these techniques to search for resonances that would signal new physics, as well as extinction of strong processes that may be an indication of microscopic black holes. External problems with the Standard Model include its inability to describe observationssuch as Dark Matter.  The Rutgers group has innovated several search strategies thatextend the search for Dark Matter by investigating their production at the LHC.  We havealso invented new technique to search for large extra dimensions of nature, and microscopicblack holes. The Rutgers group has  built and installed several pieces of hardware that analyze the data from the CMS experiment.  Members of our group were responsible for designing, building, installing and maintaining significant parts of this complex experiment, especially in the critical area of luminosity measurement, pixel tracking electronics, andhadron calorimetry.  We have taken a leading role in helping run the experiment and ensuring the quality of the data as it is being collected. Sharing the excitement of particle physics has always been a major part of theRutgers group mission.  In the past few years we have hosted high school students and teachers under the NSF Quarknet program.  These groups haveconstructed cosmic ray detectors and readout electronics to observecosmic rays and measure the muon lifetime, and analyzed data from the LHC tofind signatures of bound states of quarks as well as W and Z bosons. We have hosted summer students from small colleges across the country that may not have access to major research groups, under th...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
