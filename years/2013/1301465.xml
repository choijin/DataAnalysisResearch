<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Stephen Bradforth of the University of Southern California and his students will elucidate pathways for ultrafast ionization, charge transfer and spin crossover in solution phase small molecules.  A combination of broadband transient absorption and liquid-microjet time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy will be used to understand the role that solvent plays in controlling excited state dynamics. The solvent is expected to modulate solute electronic structure, stabilize charge-separated states and modify the approach to conical intersections that control photochemical branching.  In this framework, a mechanistic understanding for the photooxidation of aqueous guanine and adenine will be sought by mapping and correlating the onset for ionization of these DNA bases with the dissociative reactivity exhibited in non-polar solvents, the gas phase and theory.  In addition, the cascade of intermediate states in excited-state spin crossover organo-iron complexes will be unraveled through a combination of time-resolved optical and photoelectron probes, the latter being uniquely sensitive to ligand field states.  These specific chemical studies will complemented by construction of a source of extreme UV femtosecond pulses to expand the electron binding energy range for both steady-state and transient photoelectron spectroscopy.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental mechanisms revealed in this project will impact efforts in the photobiology community to correlate UV wavelength and lesion formation in cellular DNA. In addition, the new spectroscopic tools applied here to spin-crossovers systems should help to optimize organometallic chromophores utilizing earth-abundant metals for solar energy conversion.  Training of PhD, postdoctoral and undergraduate students in the PI?s lab will prepare a new generation of physical scientists in designing and analyzing experiments that use contemporary spectroscopic probes of matter.  Students will have abundant opportunities to work with international scientists both here and abroad through a network of collaborations.  A broadening participation program with proven success will be continued whereby Bradforth offers Los Angeles county community college students 8-week summer internships themed on light-to-energy conversion research.  Participation of diverse groups and extensive collaboration will be emphasized at all levels of involvement in the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our group has fully developed liquid jet photoelectron (PE) spectroscopy as a versatile technique for probing aqueous-phase electronic structure.  The electronic structure of molecules and materials defines their reactivity, their potential to store energy, and underlies chemists understanding of chemical mechanism. While photoelectron spectroscopy has been widely applied to isolated molecules or solids, its application to aqeuous solutions is a recent innovation and provides access to fundamental synthetic and biochemical pathyways.  With this grant, we have achieved a higher sensitivity to dissolved solutes (now 1 mM) and eliminated the solvent background with a scheme called resonantly enhanced two-photon ionization (R2PI). Additionally, exploiting the instantaneous nature of photoemission allows the energetics of oxidation processes to be characterized without follow-up reactions like deprotonation reactions, very common in oxidized organics. We have thus established the intrinsic (spectroscopic) oxidation potentials of the aromatic amino acids in water and established the conditions necessary for our technique to prove general.  Applying the technique in time-resolved mode, we have explored the evolution of the amino acid tryptophan photoexcited in the UV; configuration interaction in the excited state wavefunction is imprinted on the measured spectrum and how it evolves on picosecond (10-12 s) timescales. In addition to organic biomolecules, we have time-resolved ligand-to-metal charge transfer photoexcitations in transition metal complexes and charge-transfer-to-solvent-state dynamics in halide ions exploiting the full versatility of the photoelectron apparatus.  These types of excitations are important in photocatalysis, where solar photons can be converted into the creation of higher energy molecules (fuels).  In experiments with collaborators in Berlin, we have gone on to further enhance our understanding of the information accessible from the photoelectron angular distributions from aqueous solutions by variable polarization measurements with tunable soft X-rays aimed at (a) understanding electron scattering in the presence of salt and surfactant and (b) photoelectron ejection from valence orbitals of water and embedded solutes.  This work has been complemented by synergistic theoertical work exploring nanometer scale electronic delocalization within the disordered water structure.   The broader impacts of this project are longer term efforts in correlating UV wavelength and photodamage in cellular DNA. New spectroscopic tools have being applied to model photocatalyst systems that may help to optimize organometallic dyes utilizing earth-abundant metals for solar energy conversion. Training of PhD, postdoctoral and undergraduate students in the PI?s lab help prepare a new generation of physical scientists in designing and analyzing experiments that use contemporary spectroscopic probes of matter.   That training includes working with international scientists through a network of collaborations.  An additional integral part of the project addresses the STEM pipeline by offering a paid solar-energy research internship opportunity each summer for local community college students in the San Gabriel Valley.  This internship is based on an existing partnership established by the PI, and three other NSF-supported PIs at USC with the largely minority Cerritos Community College located in nearby Norwalk, CA.  Cerritos College is the 6th largest Latino serving community college in the US, and was not participating in any outreach programs in the physical sciences prior to our partnership.
