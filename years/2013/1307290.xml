<AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract**** &lt;br/&gt;This project will involve low temperature experiments that elucidate properties of a state of matter exhibiting both superconductor and insulator characteristics simultaneously.  It builds on substantial progress showing that this Cooper pair insulator state has a spatially inhomogeneous granular structure that emerges spontaneously.  This quality appears commonly among many other interesting systems in which electron correlations effects are strong.  Experiments will focus on the Cooper pair insulator phase in thin amorphous films deposited on the surfaces of nano-porous anodized aluminum oxide substrates.  Investigations of how this phase responds to magnetic impurity doping, depends on the physical dimensions of the films and evolves with systematic changes in the substrate nano-structure will be conducted.  These results can reveal the factors driving the Cooper pair localization and the size of the localized states.  These studies will be the platform for training graduate and undergraduate students in nano-technology and forefront issues relevant to the development of new materials for applications.  This type of training has been good preparation for careers in industry.  The results will impact the general field of condensed matter electronics by providing new insights into how granularity emerges and the properties of correlated electron systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract**** &lt;br/&gt;This award supports experimental research in condensed matter physics that will be performed with PhD and undergraduate students.  The investigations focus specifically on a class of materials that has been transformed dramatically using nano-technology.  The material normally superconducts (i.e. carries electricity without losing energy) but becomes an exceptional electrical non-conductor or insulator when patterned with nano-technology.  The experiments build on recent work showing that these insulators consist of electrically disconnected grains of superconductor that are few billionths of a meter in size.  The experiments will study the factors that drive the spontaneous formation of these grains.  These insights will be valuable for understanding the electrical properties of many other recently discovered materials that show similar spontaneous grain formation as well as promise in future applications. This research program will expose the PhD and undergraduate students to scientific issues relevant to the development of new materials for high technology.  This type of training has been excellent for launching the careers of scientists in high technology fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  This grant funded experiments investigating the factors that can drive a material to change its electrical properties dramatically.  At low temperatures near absolute zero, the materials employed behave like electrical insulators when they are made in the form of very thin films.  Remarkably, increasing their thickness very slightly transforms them to behave as excellent electrical conductors; in fact, they becomes superconductors. Or, when they are thick enough to be superconductors it is possible to turn them into insulators by applying a magnetic field.  The goal of these experiments has been to determine what happens at this transformation to the electrons that are known to carry the electrical currents.    Previous work showed that the electrons in superconductors form pairs.  The electrons in a pair move togethe. To electrically superconduct pairs coordinate their motion with other pairs through quantum mechanical interactions.  To become an insulator, either the pairs stop coordinating their motion or the individual pairs break apart.  The experiments conducted for this grant were aimed at distinguishing the factors that influence the pairs to stop coordinating from those that cause the pairs to break.  The experiments revealed that pairs tend to break when the material becomes insulating by being made thinner.  On the other hand, pairs tend to remain intact but lose coordination when a material is made insulating by applying a magnetic field or more disordered by making it rougher.    These results provide more insight into the behavior of electrons in materials. They will help researchers make models that explain why some materials superconduct or insulate.  One of the frontiers in physics research is developing models that can account for all the possible behaviors that electrons exhibit in materials.  Broader Impacts:  Superconductors are technologically important. For example, they are used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines.  The development of new superconducting materials can make MRI's cheaper to make and operate.  Knowing what factors cause superconductors to fail and become insulators is useful for developing promising new materials.  This grant supported the training of physics students who will join the high tech workforce or become educators in STEM.  It supported the training of 3 PhD students, a visiting PhD student and of 5 undergraduate students.               Last Modified: 06/30/2016       Submitted by: James M Valles]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
