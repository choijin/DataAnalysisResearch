<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;This award from the Division of Engineering Education and Centers supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site program at The University of Alabama.  The program is intended to engage nine undergraduate students per summer for ten weeks in engineering research projects that have a strong computational thrust.  Most of the research projects also have an experimental component, either directly or through collaboration, and by tightly coupling the computational research with the experiments, the pace of engineering innovation can be enhanced.  By introducing undergraduate researchers to computational tools early in their research careers, they will gain a broader knowledge of available research techniques, their problem solving approaches will be expanded, and they will develop a deeper appreciation of the length-scales and time-scales relevant to different natural phenomena.  Faculty mentors from three different academic departments will be participating in the program, so students will learn about the techniques and approaches relevant to a wide range of engineering challenges.  Through weekly group meetings, invited seminar speakers, and visits to local facilities, the students will begin to understand the information-passing that can be made amongst different modeling techniques, and they will become familiar with national high-performance computing resources and rapid prototype techniques.  Ultimately, this experience will engage students in challenging and meaningful computations-based research experiences, providing a rich pipeline of talented engineers that can contribute to current and emerging engineering challenges.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: &lt;br/&gt;This award from the Division of Engineering Education and Centers supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site program at The University of Alabama.  The program will engage nine undergraduate students per summer for ten weeks in computational engineering research projects.  The program theme resonates with many of the national thrusts, ranging from the Materials Genome Initiative to new frontiers in neuroscience and computational ecology.  Furthermore, these hands-on experiences will allow the REU students to make more informed decisions about their preferred balance of experiments/simulations in future graduate research projects and careers.  The summer program is designed to help the REU make real-world impacts in science and engineering, by educating students about technology-transfer issues, computer-based research applications in the private sector, and the leadership skills needed for long-term success.  To this end, there will be regular interactions with the newly-created National Water Center on The University of Alabama campus, Oak Ridge National Lab, and the students will benefit from a one-on-one leadership coaching program.  Post-program sustainability will be enhanced with big-brother/big-sister pairing between REU students and current graduate students, as well as return visits to campus for completing manuscripts or for conducting critical experiments.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This design of this Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site program has been driven by an intellectual focus on using computational tools for accelerating engineering innovation.  By tightly coupling computational tools with experimental projects, the pace of innovation can be significantly enhanced.  Furthermore, by introducing undergraduate students to computational tools early in their research careers, students can develop a much broader perspective on research techniques, problem solving approaches, and a more thorough understanding of model-based design.  Thus, this REU program has provided numerous high-impact summer research opportunities for a diverse group of undergraduate engineering students, with a focus on blending experimental and computational approaches to research.  Over the three-year project duration, 27 undergraduate students and one high school science teacher have gained hands-on research experience with multiple aspects of computational engineering approaches, ranging from blast protection of soldiers in the field, genetic design of microorganisms for renewable fuel production, design of polymers for industrial gas clean-up, and the development of models for the mechanical behavior of tumors.  In addition to the technical aspects, the undergraduate student participants have also engaged in a broad range of other professional development exercises and interactions with industry.  This helped to emphasize the role of political, legal, and economic driving forces that are critical components of a successful engineering approach.  These aspects were introduced into the summer program through invited speaker presentations (computational biologists, intellectual property attorneys, leadership coaches, etc.) and site visits to neighboring centers and facilities (such as The National Water Center, Gaylord Chemical, etc.).  With each summer cohort, four primary goals were targeted:  a)      Identify well-defined engineering challenges, which can be more thoroughly understood or solved with computational approaches (emphasizing hypothesis-driven research);  b)      Provide undergraduate engineering students with some of the computational tools and training needed to develop innovative engineering solutions;  c)      Educate the students about the industrial aspects of computations-based engineering (plant-scale design, process simulation, advanced materials discovery, data-intensive operations);  d)      Allow the students to conduct the simulations (and supporting experimental work) in a safe laboratory environment, help them establish thorough documentation practices, and provide the students with several opportunities to clearly communicate their research to others.  Throughout the summer and upon the conclusion of each summer research experience, a variety of metrics and student learning gains were analyzed in order to gauge the impact of the REU Site program.  Significant improvements were identified with respect to the students' perception toward research, such as increased motivation to pursue an advanced degree, significantly increased confidence in making technical presentations, and an increased ability to perform literature searches and discuss research with colleagues.  In additional to a variety of poster presentations at national conferences and publications in peer-reviewed research journals, three of the REU Site participants were awarded nationally-competitive Goldwater Scholarships (which are primarily based on undergraduate research performance).  In terms of student diversity, nearly 50% of the summer participants were female, and these students originated from a broad array of institutions (17 unique institutions in total).
