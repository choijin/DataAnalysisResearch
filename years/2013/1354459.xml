<AbstractNarration>This grant supports organization of the workshop that brings together thought leaders from industry and academia to discuss use-case scenarios for use of robots in small and medium sized enterprises. The objective of the workshop is (1) to present and discuss industry use-cases for robotics in manufacturing and in particular examples where a move from fixed automation to flexible automation is an economic enabler and (2) to have broad discussions across academia and industry to internalize a common set of challenges and opportunities. The workshop participants gain new insights into what advances needed to deploy robotics in small and medium manufacturers. The workshop report provides a roadmap of challenges and research opportunities to guide the robotics community. The workshop stimulates future research towards development of robots for manufacturing applications.  These activities directly impact the U.S. manufacturing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Over the last few years, we have seen tremendous growth in use of robots in the manufacturing and material handling sectors. The latest industry statistics report shows a 40% growth in use of robot systems[1]. At the same time we have also seen tremendous economic growth and increased new employment in the same sectors. Companies such as Apple, Lenovo, Flextronics and HP have re-shored major manufacturing facilities through the use of advanced automation in combination with a skilled workforce. The Federal government has made significant investments in robotics through the National Robotics Initiative (NRI)[2]. One of the important themes in the NRI is co-robots, robots that can work in close cooperation with humans to perform tasks more effectively and safely. Co-robots have seen applications in diverse applications including those in the manufacturing, agriculture, healthcare, service and space sectors. Co-robots are particularly important in manufacturing enterprises where lot sizes may be too small to justify full automation and product life-times can be short. Humans must function alongside robots to enable fast deployment, especially since the environment may only be partially structured.  With this as a backdrop, on October 21, 2013, NSF, CCC, OSTP and the Robotics-VO organized a meeting at the White House Conference Center in Washington, DC. The objective of the meeting was to discuss current opportunities for US manufacturing related to robotics, automation and computer science. A second objective was to try to define use-cases for use of advanced technology to promote growth in the general area of manufacturing. The meeting had participation from a broad set of industry representatives, academic researchers and government representatives to ensure a balanced dialog about the challenges and opportunities The workshop identified three important areas that need immediate attention. 1. "Automate the automation" &ndash; streamlining the design of assembly lines and the deployment of robots to reduce the time to start production, independent of the product mix or volume. This in turn points to the need for research and development on model-based design, simulation and analysis for manufacturing automation enabling the optimal setup, design, and implementation of new assembly lines.  2. Abstractions and representations for middleware - currently the "missing middleware" makes it difficult to generalize from successful deployments of components for specific tasks and transfer solutions across different manufacturing equipment and products. 3. Models of collaboration: There was extensive discussion of novel models of collaboration that could give academia more immediate access to relevant problems faced in manufacturing automation and lead to a successful collaborative research and development program.
