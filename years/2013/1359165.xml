<AbstractNarration>The REU in Mathematics at California State University Channel Islands will support 27 REU students conducting mathematical research in Summer 2015 and Summer 2017. Unique features include a focus on targeting talented students who might not otherwise have considered mathematics as a viable career choice, particularly those from traditionally underrepresented groups, with a special emphasis on native Spanish speakers and first-generation college students. The group of faculty mentors includes several bilingual (Spanish-English) faculty. The inclusion of one early-career mathematician from another campus each year will spread the practice of effective undergraduate research mentoring. By inviting native Spanish speakers and first-generation students to join more traditional students, this project creates a model of a diverse, rigorous research environment. Students will tackle original research problems in the areas of algebra, data analysis, graph theory, operator theory, analysis, linear algebra, applied mathematics, and their intersections that are of interest to the mathematical research community yet accessible to students.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Students will spend the bulk of their time working on research in groups of four per faculty mentor; faculty mentors will work with their students an average of 3 - 5 hours per day. Workshops, distinguished visitors and colloquia, and social outings are also included in the activities. The primary goal is for student participants to conduct original mathematical research while raising their levels of mathematical maturity and confidence and fostering an enthusiasm for mathematics. Students will develop mathematical communication skills in visual, oral, and written form. The project will incorporate students into a heterogeneous group with shared intellectual goals. Students will leave the program feeling excited and prepared to conduct graduate-level mathematics in an academic or industrial setting. We expect the emphasis on native Spanish speakers and students from underrepresented groups will broaden the pipeline into graduate school and mathematical careers.</AbstractNarration>
