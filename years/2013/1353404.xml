<AbstractNarration>The frequency and severity of wildfires is changing throughout much of the West, impacting humans and forest ecosystem services and the rate of forest recovery after wildfires. These altered wildfire rates and forest recovery patterns may force the dominant vegetation permanently to shift from forests to shrubs. The 25-million acre (10 million hectare) Klamath region of Oregon and California is an area of particular concern. A shift from forest to shrub would impair the ecosystem services of the forest that benefit humans, impair unparalleled botanical diversity of the Klamath region (for example, there are 29 species of conifer trees that support associated assemblages of other plants and animals) and release massive amounts of greenhouse gasses as these high-carbon sequestering forests transition to low-carbon content shrub-chaparral. The scientists working on this project will evaluate the potential for a forest to shrub transition in the Klamath and collaborate directly with the U.S. Forest Service to identify robust strategies for ecosystem management in the face of climate change. Including the participation of Forest Service decision-makers, who manage 80% of the Klamath region, will ensure the transparency and credibility of the science, thereby increasing its impact on environmental outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will test the general hypothesis that climate may drive a critical transition in the Klamath from a high-biomass conifer forest dominated region to a self- low-biomass shrub-chaparral-hardwood dominated region because of increased fire activity and decreased forest recovery rate. The project will quantify the potential for, and mechanisms underlying, a climate induced transition using a three-pronged research approach: (1) development of general mathematical models to gain a broad understanding of dynamics underlying critical thresholds in fire-prone ecotones and to identify the functional relationships that control transitions between shrub-chaparral-hardwood and mature conifer forest, at local and landscape levels; (2) field research to characterize the climate- dependence of post-fire recovery and to test and parameterize models; (3) process-based simulations of local, landscape, and regional dynamics to characterize the interactive roles of climate, fire, and management in shaping the region's ecological communities. Improving understanding of critical transitions has been recognized as a fundamental challenge in ecology with global relevance and urgency in the face of climate change. Increased understanding of the potential for a critical transition in the Klamath region will inform the management of fire-prone forests worldwide.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The overarching goal of this project was to understand if climate change could cause the Klamath region to transition from a forest-dominated landscape to a shrub-dominated landscape.  The Klamath Ecoregion of Oregon and California was selected for this study because it has stabilizing feedbacks between a mixed-severity fire regime and vegetation, which maintains two distinct ecological communities: a high-biomass mature forest state and a low-biomass shrub-chaparral-hardwood (SCH) state.  Understanding how the vegetation in the Klamath ecoregion will respond to climate change is critical for predicting shifts in the dominant vegetation type, which has consequences for the region?s ability to store carbon. Our work encompassed a field study, mathematical modeling, and simulation modeling.    Our research began with sampling 57 sites across the Klamath region to characterize the early stages of post-fire vegetation; sites spanned a broad gradient of moisture status (climatic water deficit) and time-since-fire. We demonstrated that conifers face a highly competitive environment for establishment and growth following severe fire since broadleaf trees and shrubs were able to quickly establish after fire by either resprouting or germinating from a persistent seedbank.

The implication is that projected future increases in aridity could limit postfire regeneration across a growing portion of the landscape.     Next, we developed general mathematical models to advance ecological theory regarding critical thresholds in disturbance-prone systems. We found that increases in fire activity and decreases in forest recovery rates can destabilize forest communities. If widespread, this would result in greatly reduced carbon stocks and a positive feedback to climate change.      Using more detailed projections from the LANDIS-II/CENTURY landscape model, we saw a decrease in median total biomass under all projected climate scenarios with the results showing earlier onset of growth in winter-spring but reduced growth in summer.  We also found that the area of high severity fire in large patches (&gt;50 ha) increased under the climate change scenarios, which had the effect of hampering a rapid recolonization of new tree recruits.       As part of our outreach efforts, we engaged the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) --  the primary land management agency in the region -- as well as other regional stakeholders in the region. Through a series of workshops, the stakeholders defined a suite of alternative management pathways which were incorporated into our simulation modeling.  These results were used by the USFS to assist forest restoration efforts after the 2017 Chetco Bar fire.  Moreover, the modeling results have been integrated into the Southwest Oregon Adaptation Project, a multi-agency collaborative project to promote climate adaptation of federally owned lands in Oregon.
