<AbstractNarration>This work develops a novel receiver methodology to integrate signal detection and forward&lt;br/&gt;error correction in multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) communications and various diversity&lt;br/&gt;transmissions. Moving beyond traditional approaches relying on belief-propagation, this&lt;br/&gt;investigation into the rather classic open problem of integrated signal detection and decoding&lt;br/&gt;involves novel joint optimization formulations that incorporate binary field parity constraints&lt;br/&gt;imposed by the low-density parity check within maximum likelihood detection frameworks for&lt;br/&gt;unified optimization. This novel framework is general and encompasses a number of practical&lt;br/&gt;transmission models, including distributed antennas, opportunistic cooperative networking,&lt;br/&gt;and signal retransmission as well as their integrations. This project has broad impacts on&lt;br/&gt;engineering, education, and society. Its success can lead to new research directions, new&lt;br/&gt;tools, and results to help advance other science and engineering fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Focusing on multicarrier MIMO signal reception, the investigators will develop and optimize&lt;br/&gt;integrated receivers for important wireless network diversities including distributed&lt;br/&gt;transmissions, cooperative MIMO, and hybrid-ARQ retransmission systems. The new design&lt;br/&gt;methodology emphasizes integration of multiple constraints from incompatible fields. By&lt;br/&gt;reformulating and relaxing joint detection and decoding problems into convex optimization, the&lt;br/&gt;investigators will design high performance receivers that are efficient and are robust to various&lt;br/&gt;forms of uncertainties in channel state information. Such a novel approach to receiver design&lt;br/&gt;integration represents a fundamental and practical design paradigm that can fully utilize&lt;br/&gt;various a priori signaling and code constraints for joint detection and decoding against channel&lt;br/&gt;distortions and other non-idealities to achieve high performance, efficiency, and reliability. The&lt;br/&gt;research findings can contribute practically to improvement of future wireless services and&lt;br/&gt;broaden their applications in many practical fields where quality, efficiency, and distributivity&lt;br/&gt;concerns are paramount.</AbstractNarration>
