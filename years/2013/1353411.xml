<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to further enhance the efficiency and lifetime of quantum dot light emitting diodes (QD-LEDs) used for displays. An active matrix QD-LED prototype display will be demonstrated using solution processing. The lifetime of QD-LED will be extended  by determining degradation mechanisms, and development of new materials, modified device processing and encapsulation techniques. The effects of charge imbalance and light trapping on the efficiency of QD-LED will be determined and optimized. External quantum efficiencies will exceed 18%.  Lifetimes of QD-LEDs exceeding 10,000 hours for all three primary colors will be demonstrated, which meets the requirement for mobile display applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be a demonstration that quantum  dot light-emitting diodes (QD-LEDs) have the commercial advantages of high efficiencies and  long lifetimes. QD-LED will be welcomed by the display industry which is now desperately searching for next generation technologies. The demonstration of an active matrix QD-LED display prototype with a solution printing process will be a critical step towards the commercialization. The systematic investigation of technical details involved in the printing process of active matrix QD-LEDs will enable the construction of a pilot facility and eventual mass production. The simple architecture and solution fabrication process will provide significant cost advantages over conventional processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The amount of information transferred by human vision is far greater than the amount transferred by other techniques such as smell, feel, writing, etc.  Therefore the display of information is extremely important for our society. The primary objectives of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant was to make a more efficient display.  For example an effIcient display would be sunlight readable with a long battery lifetime.  We used quantum dots (QD), which are small clusters of about 1000 atoms, to achieve a high efficiency.  Quantum dots are so revolutionary, their inventor(s) are likely to be awarded the Nobel Price for their discovery.  In displays, the quantum dots efficiently convert electricity to light.  We combined the semiconductor quantum dots with conducting polymers and zinc oxide quantum dots to produce a QD light-emitting diode (QLED) that is up to 100 times more efficient.   Our QLEDs  technology is also cheaper to manufacture because we use solutions to deposit and pattern layers on the surfaces without wasting the expensive inks.  The one remaining problem is that the brightness of the quantum dots must not decrease too rapidly with use.  The time for this decay is about a factor of ten to a thousand too short for TVs.  We discovered many of the mechanisms leading to this rapid decay of brightness, and are selecting new materials and developing new processing to avoid these problems.   We are confident that we will achieve long lifetimes in the near future.  In summary, quantum dot light-emitting diodes are suitable for the next generation of displays.
