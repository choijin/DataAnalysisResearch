<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop a bio-inspired contact lens that closely mimics the structure of natural tear film, and prevents contact lens-induced dry eye disease (CLIDE).  CLIDE is a serious problem faced by 50% of contact lens wearers. In spite of advances in materials and lens design, an estimated 10% of patients discontinue use each year due to CLIDE symptoms of dryness and discomfort. The architecture of the proposed lens minimizes tear film disruption through the use of a high water content polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel that interfaces with the ocular environment. The unique multi-layered design will enable a new paradigm in contact lens design, which so far has relied on modifying copolymer blends rather than making use of discrete layers of bulk materials.  The objectives of this research project are to develop and optimize scalable manufacturing processes to produce the lenses and validate their safety in animals. The results of this project will enable efficacy studies in human subjects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project, if successful, will be a contact lens that alleviates dryness and discomfort.   The global contact lens market is $6.8 billion dollars annually, with an estimated $680 million dollars in revenue lost from patients discontinuing lens wear due to discomfort. In addition to the significant commercial potential, and ability to improve patient comfort, development of this contact lens will have broader impacts in the ophthalmology and medical device fields. Through better understanding of the tear film-lens interactions, more reliable, objective, and quantifiable metrics to predict success and segment patients will be possible. The new lens architecture also may enable a better understanding of the various metrics used in comparing the comfort of contact lenses.  In addition, this device will validate the use of this unique material/design for other potential medical device applications.  The novel processes and technology under development in this project for thin film hydrogel deposition has broad application both in clinical science and fundamental research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With this SBIR award we developed a contact lens coating, Hydra-PEG&trade;, that encapsulates lenses in a bio-inspired, crosslinked hydrogel layer. The coating is unique because it is a bulk crosslinked layer. The coating makes the lens surface look more like the natural corneal surface. This allows tears to form naturally and improves patient comfort, especially in patients with dry eye and ocular surface diseases.  During this award period, we optimized the performance of the coating, developed tools to measure the surface properties, and installed the manufacturing process in locations across the US. We have also developed a companion care solution that will allow patients to boost the thickness of the coating throughout the 1 year wearing period.  We have successfully commercialized the lens coating on rigid gas permeable lenses. These lenses have the biggest problem with discomfort and many patients who wear these lenses have significant ocular surface diseases that cause extreme discomfort. To date, ~40,000 patients have worn lenses coated with HydraPEG and many of them have experienced a large improvement in their quality of life.  Disposable lenses with HydraPEG will be available in 2018 and this will expand the number of patients we can reach with the technology.  The coating process we have developed is simple, biocompatible, and applicable to a range of medical devices and we are actively exploring additional applications for the coating.
