<AbstractNarration>This project supports the US Ignite Application Summit which will be held in Chicago, IL on June 24-26, 2013.  US Ignite fosters development of next-generation applications to provide transformative public benefit. The applications focus on six national priorities: Education &amp; Workforce Development, Energy, Health, Public Safety, Transportation, and Advanced Manufacturing.  The inaugural US Ignite Application Summit will provide the first opportunity to bring together the community involved in US Ignite?s mission to share experiences, demonstrate successes, discuss barriers and difficulties, further engage industry and communities, and inspire students, academics, open source developers, and community leaders.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A significant part of the Application Summit will be the demonstration of NSF-funded applications. The Application Summit participants will demonstrate that advanced networking technologies such as software-defined networking, virtualized networks, gigabit to the end-user, and GENI racks have real applications in the US Ignite target sectors.   The combination of technology demonstrations and other summit activities will:  enlarge the community that is knowledgeable about and can apply next-gen technologies to public benefit applications;  engage the non-academic community including industry labs, federal mission agencies, foundations, venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, open source developers, and students at-large;  build a sense of community and common effort within US Ignite constituencies as they meet in role-based groups: cities, foundations, and testbeds, application developers, and technical coordination and tools; and obtain participant buy-in for the next year of US Ignite efforts to ensure resources are widely available and partnerships are coordinated to support development of more applications for public benefit.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ US Ignite hosted the inaugural US Ignite Application Summit on June 24 to 26, 2013 in Chicago, Illinois.  The event brought together 275 developers, technologists, corporate labs and academic researchers interested in the potential of advanced technologies like symmetric gigabit, software defined networking (SDN) and local cloud with the organizations, municipalities, and government leaders who want to leverage these networks to address challenges faced in education, healthcare, transportation, public safety, and clean energy.  The eventÃ†s purpose was two-fold: education and community building.     The Summit hosted keynote speakers, panel presentations, BarCamp-styled education sessions, wherein participants set the agenda, and showcased 30 demonstrations of advanced networking public benefit applications. In addition, the University of Illinois at Chicago hosted tours at its Electronic and Visualization Lab where participants could experience the CAVE2 virtual reality environment and the live-stream of a 4K three-dimensional video from Poland.   The diverse group heard from communities with deployed advanced networks and gave participants a "first" look at the transformative power of next-generation technologies. These "firsts" were "things" that had not previously been demonstrated or seen before, such as:  First city-to-city streaming 3D model of live information (i.e., live animals at a Tennessee aquarium) First city-to-city low-latency high definition-quality, low-cost video demonstration First commercialized US Ignite applications, including SimCenter and Early Health Change Detection Open source announced for some key US Ignite applications Three demonstrations of a "more reliable" Internet Announcement of the Internet2 Innovative Application Awards Mozilla-Ignite announced the award of $250,000 to its Challenge winners Joint telepresence with Cisco Live in Florida Real end-user SDN demos (first time anywhere) of Medelight and Connected Collaboration   Indicative of the diversity of demonstrations, and to recognize the greatest achievements, US Ignite presented the following awards:  Best App in Show and Best Use of Software Defined Networks: WiRover enables doctors in hospitals access to vital data when an ambulance arrives at the patient site.  Best App in Advanced Manufacturing: Simulation-as-a-Service transforms how professionals and students learn about advanced manufacturing components through a city-supported, cloud resource  Best App in Health:  In-Home Health Alert with Remote Care Coordination provides non-obtrusive, in-home sensors for detecting early health problems  Best App in Clean Energy:  Multi-User Testbed for Wide-Area Monitoring of Power Systems shows how massive volumes of power system data collected from thousands of sensors for a geographically dispersed large power grid can be shared via distributed communications  Best Use of Local Cloud Computing: Medelight enables a networking experience that is policy-based, on demand, anytime and anywhere on any device.  Best use of Low Latency Networks:  CIZZLE allows users to collaborate and learn in an immersive 3-D environment that users can update simultaneously.  Best App in Public Safety: CASA (Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere) improves hazardous weather warning and response by connecting radars to ultra-high speed networks  Best Use of Wireless:  Real-Time Emergency Response combines live and recorded high quality video from multiple feeds, organized collaboratively in real-time  Most Likely to Have a Big Impact: Software Lending Library enables users to use a particular piece of software to do homework, perform routine tasks and generate creative output  Most Innovative Student Idea:  Hadoop@Home concept would allow volunteers with idle computer time to donate their time to work on academic research projects requiring computational hardware an institution may not have or have enough of  Over 92% of attendees were "satisfied" to "ex...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
