<AbstractNarration>The team proposes commercializing a sensing platform comprised of three parts: a low-power wireless sensor mote, embedded communication and damage detection algorithms, and cloud-based GUI for data visualization and sensor network management. This project represents a step-change for the industry in several ways: it provides a continuous, real-time stream of data, enables remote monitoring, and validates engineering models.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work would create a dataset that currently does not exist, and could be used not only by our customers, but also by insurers, risk analysts, financial investors, researchers, and consumers - creating value in complementary industries. The proposed technology will be able to impact customers in construction monitoring starting from early 2014, and with good traction, would be able to reach customers in the transportation, energy, mining, and other sectors within five years.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This I-CORPS project investigated a business model and viability of a startup in wireless sensor networking for infrastructure monitoring. In particular, two markets were considered: structural health monitoring and construction. The business viability of both markets was tested by contacting and interacting with 80+ customers. In structural health monitoring, the market viability was not there due to costs and per unit benefits. In construction, the business organization of stakeholders separates the ultimate beneficiary of wireless sensing (construction company) and those who are responsible for technology selection (third party). The later focuses on increased labor costs and sensing is not foremost. Despite this challenge, the project tested an open source wireless sensor network system (SnowFort) on the field with the construction company ARUP. The test was successful and has led to an internal group investigating the use of such sensors in a broader scale. The project also resulted in the training of faculty, postdocs and an MBA. The postdoc proceeded to be an early employee/co-founder of IOTERA, a startup in the wireless sensor network space. The MBA proceeded to become the business opportunity lead developer at PlanetLabs, a microsatellite startup that is utilizing sensing to monitor the state of large spatial areas.
