<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2013 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Andrew Lawrie is "Nonlinear Dispersive Partial Differential Equations with a Focus on Wave Maps." The host institution for the fellowship is the University of California-Berkeley, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Daniel Tataru.</AbstractNarration>
