<AbstractNarration>Simonian(1317635). This proposal explores a new approach to cascading-reaction sensing using CNTs and enzymes to enable a LbL construction of the cascading layers on a single electrode. Previously, the common method for multianalyte detection and multiplexing used a combination of multi-electrode arrays, using complicated microfluidics, multi-spot biorecognition elements, and signal processing via heavy computing. The simplified approach should enable greater efficiencies, reliability, and scale-up potential. The presence of different enzymes at each layer will provide a unique capability to recognize substrates that are down-stream of cascade reactions. The intermediate products may also be detected, based on differences in individual oxidation potentials for each enzyme, enabling simultaneous detection and discrimination of several target analytes from one electrode.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Pesticides are one of the major pollutants and trace food contaminants that have a serious impact on our environment. Indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides in agricultural production can cause its residues to enter our soil and water and therefore contaminate rivers, ground water, water in reservoirs, and even our drinking water.  Hence, detection of these pesticide residues is very crucial. Biosensors are devices that can detect low limits of these pollutants. The research performed under this award has led to the development of a class of unique bioelectronic devices for environmental and energy applications. These bioelectronics devices offer promising advantages in discriminative detection of pesticides, surface layer restoration of biosensors, and biofuel cell applications.        Nearly 40% of pesticides used in agricultural production are classified as organophosphate pesticides (OPs).  Most of the remaining pesticides are carbamates, non-organophosphate pesticides (Non-OPs).  Both pesticides can cause damage to the human central nervous system upon exposure through food, inhalation or skin contact.  These pesticides lead to severe health conditions such as tremors, paralysis and potentially coma. Under this NSF project, we have developed a biosensor that can demonstrate discriminative detection of OP and Non-OP pesticides in water and in real food (apples). The biosensors were constructed using a technique called "Layer-by-layer" (LbL) method that boosts the detection performance by incorporating nanomaterials into their construction. Very thin films of biomolecules such as enzymes (proteins), DNA, polymers and nanocarbons are deposited on the biosensor surface by alternating positively and negatively charged layers to form LbL architecture. Two enzymes that work independently in detection of these class of pesticides were chosen. The reactions that occur in the presence of one or both OP and non-OPs produce a simple electric current and optical signals that enable discrimination between these pesticides at micro-molar detection levels.     Nearly all pesticide biosensors are single use devices.  Once exposed to a pesticide, the biosensor enzymes are suppressed and the biosensor becomes useless.  We have made great progress in constructing a pesticide biosensor that can be used multiple times.  A very high concentration of alkali medium was used to remove the uppermost layer of the used biosensor and a fresh new enzyme layer was deposited.  The regeneration method that we used resulted in greater than 95% restoration of the sensor surface.     Our work was further extended to study more than one enzyme on the sensor surface whose mode of action is based and dependent on both the enzymes. These enzymes work in concert to produce a "cascade."  This cascade approach was used to construct in an LbL manner a "bioanode" for electricity generation.  The bioanode is placed in a solution of sucrose (polysaccharide) and electricity is produced by the consumption of the polysaccharide. .  The enzymes on the bioanode breakdown the polysaccharide and produce byproducts that generate electrons (electricity). Different kinds of sensor surfaces and electron transfer mediators were used to improve the performance of the biofuel cell.     This project also provided education and training of postdoctoral fellow, graduate and undergraduate students. One undergraduate student co-authored a publication in ECS Transactions on this research.  One graduate student completed his PhD degree based upon research on this project.
