<AbstractNarration>CBET-1332252&lt;br/&gt;James F. Driscoll&lt;br/&gt;University of Michigan&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding the physics of how a turbulent flame extinguishes and blows out is an important and yet unsolved barrier that limits progress in the area of combustion science. It is desirable to extend the flame blowout limits in order to achieve lower nitric oxide pollutant levels and higher energy efficiency from stationary energy sources and from engines, but first the basic physics must be understood. At present, computational design codes cannot predict flame blowout limits because of the need for critical experimental data. This research project will obtain new insights into the flame blowout problem by making measurements using new laser diagnostics recently developed by the PI on a previous NSF project.  High-speed movies will measure the local gas velocity field and the fuel and air concentration levels within a highly turbulent flame.  Laser light sheets pass through the turbulent flame and the fluorescence is recorded at 20,000 frames per second by high-speed cameras.   The images provide measurements of fundamental quantities that are needed by the computational models, including the local flame turbulent propagation speed, the aerodynamic strain rate and the flame index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The novel aspects of the work are that the new laser diagnostics provide measurements of the true, three-dimensional flame propagation speed.  They also provide information about the type of combustion that occurs, such as the locations were the fuel and air have been properly premixed and where they burn in a non-premixed manner.  The high-speed movies will help to explain the dynamic, unsteady processes that previously could not be measured.  The approach is to systematically vary the non-dimensional governing parameters and then attempt to collapse the data set to fit it to a set of simple scaling relations (formulas) that will be of general use. The high-speed movies will record fluoresecence from formaldehyde, acetone and nitrogen dioxide in order to image the concentrations of fuel, air and intermediate chemical species. Three dimensional measurements will be achieved by rapidly sweeping the laser light sheets.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The success of the work will lead to the 3-D data for the first time for understanding flame anchoring/blowout in turbulent flames spanning the whole spectrum of burning regimes premixed, partially premixed, and non-premixed.  This is critical for developing codes for designing combustion devices.  The  study would further enable low-emission combustion (e.g., NOx), because once the flame anchoring/blowout mechanism is understood, the combustion conditions can be pushed toward as close to the lean limit conditions as possible, resulting in low temperatures and low levels of NOx.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project outcomes  The first project outcome was the successful development of a new measurement method that has been needed to understand and model the process of flameout of gas turbines that are used to produce electricity. Gas turbines operate on clean-burning natural gas and their usage will increase as electric cars begin to dominate. The natural gas flame can flameout when the power load is too high, if a sudden change is required in an emergency, if the fuel-air ratio is too small, or if a brand of natural gas that has too much nitrogen is supplied.  Optimum gas turbine operation is close to flameout, since this minimizes nitric oxide emissions.     Scientists need a reliable model of flameout, which first requires the measurement of the Flame Index.  This work developed the first successful method to measure Flame Index, and the resulting publications were well received.  Flame index indicates whether the flame, as it approaches flameout, burns as a premixed or as a non-premixed flame. Flame Index tells the modelers for what conditions they should use a premixed turbulent flame submodel and when they should use a non-premixed model.  For many years this fundamental understanding has been lacking, and so no physically realistic model of flameout has been developed. The goal of predicting flameout has been a major fundamental unsolved problem in combustion science. Solving this problem appears reasonable now that new measurements and new computational methods have shown much progress.    To develop a way to measure the Flame Index, two ultraviolet lasers formed two light sheets that passed through a natural gas flame that was close to flameout. One sheet provided an instantaneous image of the fuel layers. The other sheet provided an instantaneous image of the oxygen layers (that are part of the air regions).  Fluorescence was recorded from the acetone tracer gas that was added to the fuel, and from the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) tracer gas that was added to the air. When the fuel and oxygen layers were observed to be on the same side of flame, the flame must be premixed and have a Flame Index of +1.  When they are observed to be on opposite sides, the flame must be non-premixed and have a Flame Index of -1.  Thousands of images were recorded and statistical data analysis was performed.  Many governing parameters that control flameout were varied in a systematic way, including: the upstream air velocity, the fuel-to-air ratio, and the fuel type.   The second project outcome has been completing the statistical data analysis and providing the results to several leading modeling groups.  The analysis of the measurements led to statistical quantities that modelers need to assess, improve and verify their models of flameout.  These quantities include the mean, variance and probability distribution of the Flame Index, the gradients in the fuel and oxygen concentrations, and other conditional averages.  Major results were published in the journal Combustion and Flame. The PI visited the leading modeling groups at U. of Cambridge, Lawrence Berkeley Lab and Sandia Lab to disseminate his experimental findings.  The research funded one Ph.D. thesis (Dr. David Rosenberg) and half of another (Dr. Yuntao Chen) who are now conducting research to improve natural gas as an abundant source of clean energy that will complement renewables in the future.
