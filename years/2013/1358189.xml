<AbstractNarration>This International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project will provide experience in ecological modeling to U.S. students interested in ecology and agroecology through a partnership between The Pennsylvania State University and the University of Sassari in Sardinia, Italy. In the Sardinian setting with mentors of diverse background, student participants will examine the dynamics of carbon and nitrogen in a Mediterranean silvo-arable-pastoral ecosystem, at the Berchidda Long Term Observatory (LTO). Ecosystems such as the Berchidda LTO have high biodiversity and cultural value, being the source of many domesticated grain and forage crops in use throughout the world. Such ecosystems are also important carbon and nitrogen sinks, and their integrity can be considered at risk due to climate and land use changes. The students' collective experience will encompass field research, laboratory work and computer modeling and follow a structured professional development plan. During each year of the three-year IRES, cohorts of five undergraduate and graduate students will train to integrate measurements and modeling to study landscapes with high temporal, spatial, and ecological diversity that are strongly influenced by humans.  Overall, the students' research should contribute to our basic knowledge of relevant Mediterranean ecosystems, which may be extended to other ecosystems in the U.S. and abroad, at global and local scales. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fifteen U.S. students, divided into three cohorts, will work on the diverse silvo-arable-pastoral ecosystem of Sardinia to understand carbon and nitrogen fluxes in the mosaic land-use of the Long Term Observatory of Berchidda, in northeastern Sardinia.  Their IRES experience will consist of three phases: 1) scientific and cultural pre-departure preparation, 2) five-week research project at the Berchidda LTO, and 3) post-arrival work which will comprise preparation of posters, presentations or publications, and IRES evaluation. Students will be mentored by the U.S. PIs and three counterpart scientists from the University of Sassari who lead research at the Berchidda LTO. Additionally, graduate students will gain educational experience by teaching a workshop at the host institution in Sardinia and undergraduate students will contribute to a seminar at the Pennsylvania State University.  As an international research team, the U.S. and Italian partners expect to deepen understating of the identified Mediterranean systems and the role human activity  plays in driving the changes of carbon and nitrogen stocks.  Furthermore, for broader impact, because the IRES  students participate and gain this timely experience, they should benefit from the valuable early career exposure to collaborative research in a area where general ecological principles and modeling techniques may be applied to similar local and regional landscapes, for more sustainable environmental management.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of this project was to provide an international experience in ecological measurements and modeling to students interested in ecology and agroecology. The setting was the Mediterranean silvo-arable-pastoral ecosystems of Sardinia, Italy, and specifically the Berchidda Long Term Observatory and the Arborea irrigated dairy systems. Our partner institution was the University of Sassari. Founded in 1562, it is the oldest university in Sardinia. The science focused on the inventory and dynamics of the carbon and nitrogen cycles. The students experience encompassed field, laboratory and computer modeling work and many opportunities for academic and civic engagement with our international partners.</p> <p>Over 3 years, we recruited and trained 9 undergraduate and 5 graduate students from Colorado, Idaho, Louisiana, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texas. Each student was paired with an Italian and a US mentor. During the spring of each year students prepared for the research experience abroad through an introductory course that included topics in ecology of Mediterranean systems, meeting the Italian mentors, and developing draft research proposals. The field campaign occurred in four to five weeks during June-July of each year. Fieldwork was intense, requiring hands-on coordination and long working days when including fieldtrips, all made more amenable by the invaluable help and good-natured disposition of our colleagues at the University of Sassari.</p> <p>The student projects yielded surprising discoveries and methodological insights. Much of the island is a mosaic of woodland, wooded grassland and open grassland. <strong>The students found that any land use change that reduced the tree component would measurably reduce the ecosystem carbon storage. </strong>The aboveground dry biomass mass in cork oak trees was more than 5 times higher in woodlands than in open grasslands (68 to 11 Mg/ha); the 57 Mg/ha difference is equivalent to all the carbon stored in the soil in these systems. It was also evident that due to the edge effect, tree clusters store more carbon than an equivalent area of woodland, suggesting that wooded grassland can enable grazing while storing some carbon in the tree clusters. A potential practice emerging from these findings is to manage the number and size of tree clusters in wooded grasslands. Further analyses let the students quantify the nature of the competition among trees, which can inform management as well as ecological studies.</p> <p><strong>Students discovered that in terms of soil carbon storage, dry can be like cold. </strong>How can that be? The soils of Berchidda have an unusually high level of organic carbon. We hypothesized that charcoal from the frequent fires (charcoal is somewhat inert) could explain the high soil organic carbon. However, the students only found traces of charcoal particles (if any) and discarded that hypothesis. Soil respiration measurements revealed that subsoil respiration is the dominant source of carbon dioxide in the summer, when the soil is dry. Emissions are low but steady and measurable. Students learned about gas diffusion in soil through experiments in which the top soil was removed and replaced by organic matter free substrate (sand) to isolate subsoil from topsoil respiration. We concluded that the explanation for high soil carbon storage is simple: a dry topsoil for many months of the year. Wet and sunny springs allow high carbon input through plant growth, but dry and hot summers limit microbial decomposition. Thus, dry summers act like the long cold winters in the subpolar regions, preserving soil carbon.</p> <p><strong>Perhaps the most shocking result was the measured nitrous oxide (a greenhouse gas) emission in irrigated forage systems that receive manure.</strong> The emission rates amounted to 27 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> of nitrogen as nitrous oxide in three weeks, a massive emission rate. For comparison, a maize crop in Iowa may emit 5 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> for an entire year. This unexpected finding is a call to action to develop methods to temper emissions of this greenhouse gas, and a terrific lesson for students about the challenges and rewards of measuring processes in the field.</p> <p>Of the 9 undergraduate students that participated in the program, 5 started or will start graduate school, 2 of them supervised by co-PI Leites. Another student obtained an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. The students presented 8 posters at Penn State, University of Colorado, and Mid Atlantic ESA meetings, with 3 of them obtaining 2nd and 3rd place awards. Co-PI Leites co-authored a presentation with mentor Seddaiu, and PI Kemanian co-authored a publication with mentors Seddaiu and Roggero.</p> <p>In addition to the mentoring by Italian and US mentors, students participated in at least one civic extracurricular activity while in Italy, for example addressing conflicts between urban and rural water users during a drought near Sassari and addressing desertification in the Mediterranean basin. Overall, this NSF project provided students both a round academic training and international outlook that we trust will stay with them for the rest of their professional life.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/05/2019<br>      Modified by: Armen&nbsp;Kemanian</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1358189/1358189_10326351_1549369332348_2017IRES-NSFstudentsmeasuringsoilrespiration--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1358189/1358189_10326351_1549369332348_2017IRES-NSFstudentsmeasuringsoilrespiration--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Students measuring soil respiration"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1358189/1358189_10326351_1549369332348_2017IRES-NSFstudentsmeasuringsoilrespiration--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Students measuring soil respiration"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Clockwise from the top, students Sarah Isbell, Joshua Simon, Joseph Amsil and Sally Ross measure soil respiration.
