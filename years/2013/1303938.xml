<AbstractNarration>Recent major changes in the extent, thickness and properties of arctic sea ice have captured attention and posed significant challenges to a diverse group of stakeholders, ranging from maritime safety and security, resource management and development, politicians, coastal communities, weather and climate forecasters, climate change researchers, and a growing segment of the general public. Sea ice forecasting on seasonal-to-interannual timescales, especially over the summer and into fall, is of particular interest. Though each stakeholder is driven by different priorities, all require improved monitoring, prediction, and communication of sea ice conditions. To date, sea ice modeling efforts have largely focused on climate scales (i.e., response to greenhouse gas forcing) or targeted synoptic forecasting in support of navigation. Sea ice forecasting on seasonal scales is a challenge because of: (1) high variability in atmospheric and oceanic influence, (2) observations for initialization and validation have limited coverage and/or high uncertainties, (3) limitations of current model capabilities, (4) inherent limitations in sea ice predictability, and (5) an Arctic system changing in ways without recent historical precedent.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The SEARCH Sea Ice Outlook was implemented four years ago in an ad hoc fashion, requesting voluntary contributions to estimate September sea ice extent based on late spring (June 1) conditions. Contributions have been made using different methods that vary from complex (partially- and fully- coupled general circulation models and statistical relationships) to basic (trend extrapolation, heuristic, public poll). The Outlook will be organized and expanded into a more structured, coordinated and formal effort that focuses on tackling key barriers to sea ice forecasting, including rigorous evaluation of predictions, coordination and organization of relevant observations for initialization, evaluation of methods, and finally, an organizational network structure to manage the efforts and communicate results in new ways. This effort builds on the experience of the past four years and expands on structures already in place, leveraging resources and expertise at an international scale to help address a set of challenges recognized as priorities by a range of U.S. and international programs and organizations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit - This project advances NSF?s goal of providing improved predictive tools for the Arctic by creating an innovative network of scientists and stakeholders to generate, assess and communicate arctic seasonal sea ice forecasts. The network?s focus is to develop new methods to evaluate forecasts, new metrics for synthesis and comparison across forecast methods and new approaches to initialize forecast methods with targeted observations. Finally, the network will investigate how different forecasting methods can be combined to exceed predictive skills of narrower approaches. The research team will explore how best to plan observations for improved seasonal predictions and how these predictions in turn can advance understanding of the evolving state of the arctic sea ice cover.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts - Improved seasonal forecasts of arctic sea ice will be developed and disseminated for societal benefit. By fostering and coordinating an international network of researchers and leveraging a broad range of activities, the project provides information tailored to stakeholders? needs. In addition to rigorous evaluations of stakeholder information needs, the network will develop a common reference framework for key sea ice variables and predictors, generating integrated datasets and predicted fields for the scientific community and stakeholders. Activities will also be initiated to inform and engage the growing internet communities of citizen scientists, many of whom already show a strong interest in arctic science, have capabilities for their own original and potentially worthwhile analysis, and connect with wider networks of media and public discussion. The activities will include graduate students and post-docs who are mentored to conduct high-quality research at the intersection of fundamental and applied research. By entraining more young researchers into the network, the project also addresses an important need for qualified experts that can help address urgent questions concerning resource uses and ecosystem services impacted by rapid arctic sea ice change.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Each Arctic summer since 2008, the Sea Ice Outlook (SIO) has invited researchers and the engaged public to contribute predictions regarding the September extent of Arctic sea ice. The public character of SIO, focused on a number whose true value soon becomes known, brings elements of constructive gamification and transparency to the science process. From 2008 through 2018, the SIO received more than 800 individual predictions, providing not only a window on sea ice research in progress, but a unique dataset in itself. Through a series of papers and reports beginning in 2014 (with 2008-2013 SIO data), we analyzed the patterns of success and failure in this growing record of predictions. Our analysis compared different types of prediction methods, at different points of the season and in different years. In some years, predictions based on dynamic modeling had better success; in other years statistically-based methods showed more skill. Overall, however, the most striking discovery was a pattern of easy and difficult years -- when many different methods performed well, or performed poorly. In predictively easy years, Arctic sea ice extent followed climatological trends, and the average SIO prediction was not far from the true extent value. In difficult years, on the other hand, unusual summer weather in the Arctic drove the ice extent far above or below trend, and the average prediction was off as well. The difficulties of prediction, tied to thinning ice that is highly sensitive to summer weather, reflect our transitional era between a past Arctic cool enough to retain much thick, resistant multiyear ice; and a warmed future Arctic where little ice remains at summer&rsquo;s end. These conclusions based on the first 300 predictions over 2008-2013 were confirmed and strengthened in later years; the most recent analysis covered 800 predictions over 2008-2018.<br /><br />Many drivers of polar-region change originate in mid-latitude industrial societies, so public perceptions there matter. Through a series of nationwide or single-state surveys, we tracked US public perceptions and knowledge of basic polar facts. Only 44% of respondents on a nationwide survey knew that the North Pole is on ice over a deep ocean, rather than land. Even fewer (34%) knew or guessed correctly that melting of Greenland and Antarctic land ice, rather than Arctic sea ice, could potentially do the most to raise sea levels. A larger fraction (63%) said they think that if the Arctic warms in the future, that will have major effects on the weather where they live. Sixty-nine percent were aware that the area covered by Arctic sea ice in late summer has been less, in recent years, than it was 30 years ago. More detailed analysis of this survey and others, involving thousands of interviews, discovered that polar facts subjectively fall into two categories: those that are or are not directly connected to people&rsquo;s beliefs about climate change. Responses to climate-linked factual questions, such as whether Arctic sea ice area has declined compared with 30 years ago, are politicized as if the survey asked for climate-change opinions. Political divisions become less apparent with questions that do not suggest climate change, such as location of the North Pole. This distinction between belief-neutral and belief-dependent responses to factual questions provides new insights about what goes into people&rsquo;s understanding of climate change. Results emphasize that diverse approaches are needed to communicate about science with people having different combinations of assumptions and knowledge.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/09/2019<br>      Modified by: Lawrence&nbsp;C&nbsp;Hamilton</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1303938/1303938_10252089_1549749846967_SIO_2018_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1303938/1303938_10252089_1549749846967_SIO_2018_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1303938/1303938_10252089_1549749846967_SIO_2018_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Number of Sea Ice Outlook contributions by year and method, all months combined, 2008?2018.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Lawrence Hamilton</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Lawrence&nbsp;C&nbsp;Hamilton</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1303938/1303938_10252089_1549749998551_SIO_2018_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1303938/1303938_10252089_1549749998551_SIO_2018_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1303938/1303938_10252089_1549749998551_SIO_2018_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Sea Ice Outlook June, July and August 2018 predictions for September mean sea ice extent.
