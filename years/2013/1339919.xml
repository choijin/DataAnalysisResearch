<AbstractNarration>Montana State University Billings is providing Robert Noyce scholarships and unique training for secondary science and mathematics teacher candidates to prepare them to effectively deliver content in a culturally sensitive manner for high-need  and sometimes, reluctant learners. This effort is focused on providing 18 highly qualified teachers (12 undergraduates and 6 career changers) for high-need rural Montana school districts on or near American Indian reservations, where data shows low matriculation rates for STEM majors. Six undergraduates will receive schorships in year 1 and 6 in year 2. Three professionals will receive scholarships in year 1 and 3 in year 2.  Using state science standards based on practices that embed inquiry-based learning pedagogy, this Noyce Scholarship Track Phase I project trains teachers to engage secondary students with methods that keep the students interested and motivated to continue STEM learning. These training methods have broad applicability to other rural situations and will develop a stronger pipeline of students from these rural schools to become STEM majors. The MSUB teacher-training program builds on six unique courses in mathematics and sciences in combination with a Noyce teacher cohort seminar that focuses on the needs of reluctant learners. Previous research suggests that students on or near American Indian reservations need greater cultural connections with STEM subjects and this program is training teachers to frame instruction in new ways to help make this connection. This is an important intellectual contribution from this project. To help ensure that the Noyce graduates succeed at the beginning of their teaching career, this project mentors them during their initial years of teaching using specially trained success coaches and continuing professional development.</AbstractNarration>
