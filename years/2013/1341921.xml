<AbstractNarration>This award will support student travel to the 2013 International Conference on Supercomputing (ICS), which is being held in Eugene. Oregon. ICS is a highly regarded international technical conference with a multi-disciplinary focus on high-end computing for scientific and engineering applications.  The funds will help support U.S. students, focusing on Ph.D. students at an advanced stage in their program and students who would otherwise not be able to attend ICS. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. Broader impacts include training the next generation of researchers in this important research area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This project supported student travel grants for The International Conference on Supercomputing (ICS), a highly regarded conference in Computer Science held in Eugene, OR USA in June 2013.   This critical support helped to insure that interested students in related research areas had equal opportunities to present their work and to enjoy the rich educational benefits of attending the conference.  Supercomputing is a cross-disciplinary field that includes the necessary computer hardware and software to solve a variety of complex problems in science and engineering, including widely useful techniques such as weather prediction; critically useful techniques such as earthquake and hurricane prediction; and industrially important techniques such as aircraft and automobile design.    Students supported by this project attended a special session highlighting the best approach for conference attendance, presented their research as posters or papers, and had the chance to interact with leaders in their fields in both formal and informal sessions.  In addition, each went back to their University and shared what they had learned with other students.   The opportunity to learn about the applications and achievements in Supercomputing helps provide sustaining motivation for students working on their theses and dissertations; and also helps us to retain the brightest and most successful students in scientific careers after their graduation.
