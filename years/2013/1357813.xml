<AbstractNarration>1357813&lt;br/&gt;Glezer&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rate of consumption and withdrawal of water for use in power plant cooling systems has become untenable in light of limited water supply and cost, as well as regulatory restrictions, and environmental concerns.  However, the effectiveness of dry air cooling of current, conventional condenser systems has been hindered by the high thermal resistance and poor air thermal capacity of the cooling air.  It is clear that in order to enable an appreciable decrease in water consumption for power generation, the heat transfer between the condensing steam and the air-side medium must be significantly enhanced.  Earlier attempts to improve the air-side heat transfer focused on the addition of surface features (dimples, etc.) on the cooling fins with limited success and significant increase in fan power.  The proposed program overcomes the limits of air-side heat transport by exploiting interactions between the cooling air flow and miniature, autonomously-fluttering reeds (AFRs) to induce the formation and advection of small-scale vortical motions near the condenser fin surfaces.  A unique aspect of this approach is that reed flutter is generated by harnessing mechanical energy from the embedding cooling air flow at exceedingly low penalty in pressure losses.  These low-cost thin reeds can be tailored for different regions of the condenser and fabricated either integral to the external condenser surfaces or as drop in retrofit assemblies for existing condensers. The reed assemblies are easy to install and maintain without plant level infrastructure modifications.  Preliminary heat transfer enhancement and pressure drop analyses coupled with condenser designs and power plant simulations have shown that air-cooled condensers using AFR technology can increase plant efficiency while significantly reducing water consumption compared to wet cooling.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research program will focus on enabling advances in thermoelectric power plant condenser technology to overcome current limits of cooling by dry air and thereby significantly reduce water usage for evaporative cooling.  The present approach overcomes the limits of air-side heat transport by exploiting interactions between the cooling air flow and miniature, autonomously-fluttering reeds (AFRs) to induce the formation and advection of small-scale vortical motions near the condenser fins.  A unique aspect of this approach is that reed flutter is generated by harnessing mechanical energy from the embedding cooling air flow at exceedingly low penalty in pressure losses.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The program encompasses integrated experimental/modeling/numerical investigations that will focus on the fundamental knowledge needed to implement, design, and optimize the use of the AFRs, and demonstrate their efficacy in improving the heat transfer characteristics of finned air-side passages of condensers in power plant configurations and operating conditions.  The research at Georgia Tech will focus on experimental investigations of the heat transfer characteristics enhanced by the AFRs along with the modeling, design, and testing of novel condenser configurations enabled by the AFR technology.  Johns Hopkins University will focus on CFD investigations of small-scale heat transfer and performance evaluation and optimization of AFR-enhanced condenser configurations.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Small-scale heat transfer enhancement by AFRs was recently demonstrated in air-cooled heated ducts at Georgia Tech with significant heat transfer enhancement.  These low-cost thin reeds can be tailored for different regions of the condenser and fabricated either integral to the external condenser surfaces or as drop in retrofit assemblies for existing condensers. The reed assemblies are easy to install and maintain without plant level infrastructure modifications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The research program at Georgia Tech was motivated by the need to reduce the rate of consumption and withdrawal of water for use in power plant cooling.  Conventional condensers cooled by dry air have been hindered by air thermal resistance and thermal capacity.  Furthermore, high operational temperature differences for heat rejection limits power production at elevated ambient temperatures.  To enable an appreciable decrease in water consumption the driving temperature difference for condensation should be reduced while enhancing the heat transfer between the condensing steam and the air-side medium.  Earlier attempts to improve the air-side heat transfer focused on cooling fins surface features (dimples, etc.) with limited success and significant increase in fan power.   The present program focused on the development and implementation of a new approach to overcome air-side heat transport limits by harnessing interactions between the cooling air and miniature, autonomously-oscillating thin-film reeds to induce the small-scale vortical motions near the heated surfaces.  A unique element of this approach is that the mechanical energy to drive aeroelastically induced flutter of the reeds is derived from the cooling air flow at minimal penalty in pressure drop.  The low-cost, ultrathin reeds operate at subaudible frequencies and can be designed with new condensers or as retrofit for existing condensers.  It is anticipated that such reed assemblies will be easy to install and maintain without need for plant level infrastructure modifications.  The investigations focused on the fundamental knowledge needed to implement, design, and optimize the use of autonomously-oscillating reeds for improving the heat transfer characteristics within high aspect ratio, rectangular mm-scale channels of a high-performance, air-cooled condenser fins, and on their performance evaluation in laboratory-scale condenser configurations.  The primary findings of these investigations are:  Enhanced air-side heat transfer by autonomously-oscillating reeds  For a given flow rate within the fins channel , the presence of the reed leads to significant heat transfer enhancement as measured by the channel?s Nusselt number (Nu) over a broad range of channel Reynolds numbers.  For example, in a 25 x 5 x 250 mm laminar channel flow (Re &raquo; 1,000), a rectangular reed (23 x 0.012 x 50 mm) fluttering at 105 Hz (St = 0.9) leads to heat transfer enhancement of 85% over the base flow.  The reed-enhanced heat transfer also persists and improves for transitional and turbulent flows with up to 120 % and 132 % Nu enhancement, respectively over the base flow.  For the removal of a desired heat power and fixed nominal fin temperature, the presence of the reeds reduces the required operating flow rates and pumping power, leading to increases in coefficients of performance (COP) of up to 120 % and 200 % at laminar and turbulent base flows, respectively. For given heat transfer augmentation, the flow losses in the presence of the reed are over 200% lower than the losses associated with conventional, passive heat transfer enhancement techniques.  Furthermore, the flow losses associated with the reed can be further diminished with negligible reduction in heat transfer enhancement by reducing the its operating frequency based on its the structural and geometric characteristics.   Implementation in Air-Cooled Condensers (ACC) and Power Plants  Experiments on a scaled model air-cooled heat exchanger with features similar to ACCs in power plants were used to measure in situ heat transfer coefficients and pressure drops, and develop correlations for Nusselt number and friction factor for the baseline and reed-enhanced configurations. These correlations were used to develop and optimize the geometry of an ACC for a 500 MW power plant.  Air flow rates per ACC module were varied to optimize the geometry and operating conditions based on the tradeoffs between decreasing the required Initial Temperature Difference (ITD) to accomplish the design cooling duty, and the increases fan power requirements. A decrease in steam saturation temperature (at low ITDs) leads to increased turbine output is offset to some extent by the increased electrical work input to the fans. Because the major pressure drops in the A-Frame result from minor losses due to obstructions and changing air-flow directions, the increase in pressure drop at the condenser is not very significant at the system level and yields possibilities for system efficiency improvements. Without geometry optimization, the maximum predicted plant efficiencies for the baseline and reed-enhanced condenser geometries were 32.55% and 32.95%, respectively. Thus, reed installation and the associated increase in heat transfer coefficient yielded an overall efficiency gain of approximately 0.4% over the baseline condenser geometry, despite an increase in required fan work input to the ACC array. Optimizing the air-side geometry for the reed-enhanced air cooled condenser by modifying the fin pitch, fin length and air flow rate yielded further power plant level improvements. A maximum cycle efficiency of 33.86% was found, i.e., a ~1.5% improvement in power plant efficiency over the state of the art.
