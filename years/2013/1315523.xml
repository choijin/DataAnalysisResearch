<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR) Phase I project is aimed at the development and commercialization of a high-performance cloud processing platform for Internet- and mobile-based video services. Target users of this platform would initiate live video streams, or upload video files, through a web portal or application programming interface (API) for processing services (such as transcoding to produce formats and bit-rates suitable for display on mobile devices). Building this platform is challenging due to the need to (a) provide real-time guarantees on shared infrastructure, (b) achieve linear performance scaling, (c) guarantee content security and (d) deliver high availability (99.99%). To address these challenges, the feasibility of (a) a novel, video-aware parallel and distributed stream processing framework (called Scarlet), and (b) a low-overhead isolation framework (called Shield), will be explored in phase I of this project. Scarlet's design and implementation aim for guaranteed real-time processing and linear performance scaling (up to 100 compute units) while delivering professional-grade video quality. Shield should isolate content and resources for real-time media processing on shared infrastructure; content security should be comparable with today's virtual machine (VM) technology but without the associated performance penalties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be significant as the underlying technology simplifies video processing workflows and reduces associated costs for enterprises that work with large volumes of media content. In particular, the cloud video services resulting from this project will benefit TV broadcasters, Internet-based media companies and mobile video service providers, ultimately benefiting consumers of video in terms of lower prices and better quality. The proposed platform to be developed in this project will be the first to leverage ground-up distributed processing techniques with a high degree of parallelism, scale and reliability to achieve fast turn-around times (&gt;&gt;10x real-time) for media processing. These characteristics will enable this platform to serve as an efficiency enabler for this large and fast-growing Internet video services industry, while also advancing our scientific understanding of cloud technology as applied to media processing. Other emerging vertical segments likely to benefit from this platform include on-line education, surveillance, and augmented reality.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This SBIR project focuses on fundamentally improving technology and reducing costs associated with distributing professional video content to consumers over the Internet. Our goal is the development and commercialization of a high-performance, cloud video processing platform (called "Zipreel Video Cloud" or ZVC) that aids video or media distribution for Internet and mobile clients.  Summary: Video content (e.g. a movie) needs to be processed before it can be distributed. This processing is required to convert videos into different resolutions to fit different screen-sizes. It also helps compress videos into different bit-rates (or "quality" levels) to match the different network speeds over which consumers watch this content.  From a technical perspective, this processing requires a lot of computing "horsepower", and the challenge is to reduce the time required. From a commercial perspective, reducing the associated costs is also critical when dealing with large media volumes. E.g. consider the problem of processing hundreds of hours of video content in a few hours or even minutes at low cost.  Existing solutions solve this problem by treating every video file as an atomic entity and serially processing the files through the fastest available servers. Thus, the processing speed is limited by the fastest processors operating serially on the data.  In this project, we explore a "divide-and-conquer" approach that involves breaking each video file into smaller "chunks" that can be processed in parallel. Such an approach allows a cluster of inexpensive small-to-medium-range computers to be used to reduce processing times and costs by an order-of-magnitude.
