<AbstractNarration>This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the Perception, Action, and Cognition Program in the Division of Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences and the Mathematical Biology Program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This work explores the role of selection and adaptation in two radically different domains, 1) molecules and 2) languages. Consider, for example, human languages. The 6,000-7,000 languages spoken by people display a dazzling variety of sounds, words, and grammatical forms. This diversity is typically explained as a product of random drift: As a single population splits and drifts apart, the accumulation of small random changes eventually produces mutually unintelligible languages. An alternative is that some of the variation we see among human languages is due to selection. In this account, languages adapt to some extent to the different social and ecological environments in which they are spoken. Similarly, researchers have only recently considered the role of selection and adaptation in the study of prions (self-replicating proteins)and how they propagate within and across generations of cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though biological structures and human languages are radically different domains, they share properties that suggest they may be described by a common mathematical framework. Specifically, (i) they are both epigenetically inherited, (ii) they both capitalize upon a pre-existing biological substrate, and (iii) they both propagate in a system of agents (cells, people). A highly interdisciplinary team of cognitive scientists, linguists, biologists, and mathematicians seek to connect and inform these domains by using mathematical models and large-scale behavioral experiments to understand the selective processes. They will assess convergent tests of the idea that selection acts as an organizing principle of systems at different scales. This work has important implications for issues such as the role of environmental context in the spread of structures such as prions or linguistic elements. For example, results could help explain how a structure newly infects populations, such as when a new word "invades" a linguistic environment, or when a prion structure successfully propagates and infects cells in its environment. The interdisciplinary nature of this award will provide a unique training experience for graduate students and will include outreach efforts to local schools.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our goal was to integrate two seemingly disparate subjects of study: the distribution and diversity of biomolecular and linguistic variants and to provide convergent tests of the hypothesis that selection acts as an organizing principle of systems varying in scale from molecules to languages. Although fully integrating these subjects proved challenging, this grant supported diverse and impactful work on the evolution of language, the surprising prevalence of iconicity &mdash; words resembling their meanings &mdash; in spoken languages.    Across a series of studies we showed that people have an uncanny ability to create vocalizations to communicate a range of meanings spanning common actions, animals, spatial terms, and adjectives such that naive listeners can understand these vocalizations at levels considerably above chance. These results help us understand the origin of spoken words.  The funding enabled the development of ILMpy, a unifying framework for using iterated learning models to examine how noise in phoneme-production can influence the morphological structure of language, and how the same framework can be used to understand the impact of noise in genetic copying on population dynamics.  The grant also helped fund theoretical work on the origin of the tRNA-protein interaction network operating in ribosomal protein synthesis ("translation"), the origin of which is thought by some to be the defining event in the origin of modern cells. A longstanding mystery is why translational proteins bind tRNAs in so many different ways. By using novel application of the classical coding theory of Shannon and Hamming, we showed that diversity in tRNA-binding may have originated to increase the combined rate and accuracy of encoded protein synthesis.   In a different application of Shannon?s information theory, we have investigated the relationship between population size and language entropy, finding that  languages spoken by more people have higher entropies (i.e., are less predictable and less compressible).    Broader impacts of this grant include the training of multiple graduate students and postdocs, who have gone on to have tenure-track jobs or careers in industry. The grant supported the development of pedagogical tools for teaching high school students about language evolution.  Tools developed with support of this grant have also been used to train interdisciplinary students for the NSF-funded Intelligent and Adaptive Systems NRT. at UC Merced, a Hispanic-Serving Institution.
