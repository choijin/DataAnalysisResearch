<AbstractNarration>The long-term survival of wild plants that hybridize with crops depends on maintaining the diversity of wild gene pools, which, in turn, may be useful for further crop development.  If wild populations are small and isolated, neighboring compatible crops could reduce their genetic diversity through pollen- and/or seed-mediated gene flow.  Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is a popular native prairie grass and a promising biofuel crop.  Switchgrass cultivars have been extensively planted in federal Conservation Reserve Program areas, which often occur near small, remnant prairies.  However, the extent of crop-to-wild gene flow and its impacts on wild switchgrass genetic diversity have not been well studied.  This research will compare genetic diversity of wild and nearby cultivated switchgrass populations, and will test for evidence of genetic swamping using DNA markers and Geographical Information System data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our study will provide valuable information on the current state of wild switchgrass diversity and the potential impacts of ongoing habitat restoration projects involving commercial switchgrass cultivars.  Our findings will also be useful for planning the long-term conservation of native prairie grass species, and will provide guidance for the future development and regulation of transgenic switchgrass that is developed for biofuels.  We plan to teach undergraduate students at Ohio State University about natural hybridization and the importance of preserving biodiversity.  In addition, we will reach conservation practitioners, amateur botanists, and the general public through professional meetings and local organizations.  We hope to raise awareness of potential ecological and evolutionary impacts of new cultivars, including genetically engineered crops.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Planting semi-domesticated plants for habitat restoration has raised concerns on their longer-term persistence in novel environments and their potential impacts on wild relatives through crop-to-wild gene flow.  Nevertheless, cultivars are commonly used when wild seed sources are not available.  In the Midwest USA, switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) cultivars have been planted extensively in federally designated Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) areas; however, genetic diversity and composition of switchgrass in CRP lands have never been studied nor have they been compared with those in remnant prairies (i.e. wild switchgrass).   This project aimed to investigate if gene flow between CRP and prairie switchgrass populations could occur and the genetic similarity among these populations.  We sampled 16 CRP and 17 prairie populations across eastern Kansas during summer of 2011 and 2012 (Table 1).  We assessed genome content of 2 to 16 switchgrass individuals from each population to infer population ploidy levels (i.e. copies of chromosome numbers &mdash; individuals of different ploidy levels cannot hybridize).  In addition, we analyzed genetic diversity and composition of a subset of the populations (10 CRP and 10 prairie populations; Figure 1) using ten simple sequence repeat (SSR) DNA markers (16 samples per population).  For comparison, we also included five popular switchgrass cultivars into the analysis.   All of the 16 CRP and 15 of the 17 prairie populations were octaploid (8x), while 2 of the prairies had a mixture of hexaploid (6x) and octaploid (8x) individuals (Table 1).  This suggested that switchgrass planted in the CRP areas are capable of crossing with wild switchgrass in the same region if the two flower during the same period.  Genetic diversity indices of CRP and prairie populations were similar, and genetic variation of the sampled populations was mostly found within populations (93%) rather than between the two types of populations (CRP vs. prairie).  Furthermore, the prairie populations still harbor a small number of genes unique to each population.  When compared to cultivars, the CRP samples shared similar genetic composition with two cultivars &mdash; Trailblazer and Blackwell &mdash; that were bred from wild populations of the same general region (Oklahoma, Nebraska, Kansas).  Lastly, a positive spatial autocorrelation was detected up to 41km and 42km among prairie and among CRP populations, respectively.  The results suggested that CRP and prairie populations were similar in genetic diversity and composition.  Furthermore, genetic correlation still exits among remnant prairies within 41km range, and switchgrass seeds planted in CRP areas were likely collected from local prairies within 42km radius.  In regard to wild switchgrass conservation in eastern Kansas, the sampled prairie populations are still of conservation value because they still possess unique genes and have a considerable level of genetic diversity.  The current practice of CRP area establishment using local seed sources has helped maintain genetic diversity of CRP populations at a level comparable to remnant populations and keep local genes in the region, which in term avoid potential consequences of gene flow from seed sources of low genetic diversity or genetic makeup novel to the region.   This project and funding provided training of a Ph.D. student and four undergraduate students in conservation biology and molecular ecology.  This study also became a chapter of the graduate studentÆs dissertation, which will be submitted to a peer-reviews journal.  We were not able to host a summer term course for land grant students as described in the proposal; however, we will reach out to ecologists and conservation practitioners in the related field through future publication and professional meetings.
