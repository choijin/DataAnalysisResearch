<AbstractNarration>The 10th Workshop on Algorithms and Models for the Web Graph (WAW 2013) took place at Harvard University in Cambridge, MA, December 15-16, 2013. The focus of these meetings is to present recent research and to explore directions for future research on areas involving networks relating to the World Wide Web and related complex networks. Topics of interest include algorithmic research, data analysis, the modeling of complex networks, and specific applications to understanding the web graph.  This is an annual meeting, which is traditionally co-located with another related conference; in this case WAW 2013 was co-located with the 9th Workshop on Internet &amp; Network Economics (WINE 2013).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In the rapidly growing world of Internet infrastructures, the research areas of WAW represent major efforts from the theoretical and practical communities to address the challenging problems that we face today.  The WAW series of workshops have established themselves by bringing together researchers in a variety of interrelated areas, as these questions require interdisciplinary efforts.  The choice of the plenary speakers and co-location with WINE highlights the important themes of the conference.  The speakers, organizers, and conference history combine the experience to plan a successful conference, along with the reputation to attract a strong and diverse group of participants. The proceedings were published in a Lecture Notes in Computer Science volume.  Selected papers will also be disseminated in journal form, in a special issue of the journal Internet Mathematics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant was used to help fund the 10th Workshop on Algorithms and Models for the Web Graph} (WAW 2013), which successfully took place at Harvard University in Cambridge, MA, December 14-15, 2013.   The focus of this workshop is to present recent research and to  explore directions for future research on areas related to networks  relating to the World Wide Web and related complex networks. Topics of  interest include algorithmic research, data analysis, the modeling of  complex networks, and specific applications to understanding the web  graph.  This is an annual meeting, which is traditionally co-located  with another, related, conference. In this case WAW 2013 was co-located with the 9th Workshop on Internet &amp; Network Economics (WINE 2013).  The aim of the workshop is to further the understandng of graphs tat arise from the Web and various user activities on the Web, and stimulate the development of high-performance algorithms and applications that exploit these graphs.  The workshop gathered the researchers who are working on graph-theoretic and algorithmic aspects of related complex networks, incuding citation networks, social networks, biological networks, molecular networks, and other networks arising from the Interent.   The event was successful, with 38 registered attendees (9 students and 29 others);  this does not include the additional 36 registrants of WINE who were also able to attend sessions.  There were 17 accepted papers at the two-day event, along with two plenary talks given by Alan Frieze of Carnegie Mellon University on Geometric Models of Real World Networks and by Jukka-Pekka Onnela of the Harvard School of Public Health on Combining Big Data and Small Models to Study Networked Social Systems.  The papers for the workshop have been published as Lecture Notes in Computer Science Volume 8305, available at this Springer link (http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-03536-9).   Besides the NSF, funding for the workshop was provided by Microsoft Research, Google, Ryerson University, and Spinger.  Harvard provided support as the host institution.  With this funding support, the workshop was free to the participants.        Last Modified: 08/06/2014       Submitted by: Michael Mitzenmacher]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
