<AbstractNarration>A collaborative multi-instrument investigation of the high-latitude geospace system will be carried out, motivated by the completion of the Resolute Bay Incoherent Scatter Radars RISR-N and RISR-C, the first ever ISRs deployed to the geomagnetic polar regions. Initial results from RISR-N have revealed an unexpectedly structured and dynamic plasma environment. In order to understand these new measurements and to fully exploit this new diagnostic capability, an experimental campaign is proposed that will synthesize RISR observations with data from the collocated optical sensors (Fabry-Perot Interferometer and Optical Mesosphere Thermosphere Imager), the PolarDARN HF (high frequency) radars, the THEMIS and NORSTAR camera networks, and the global ISR network (in particular, Sondrestrom, the Poker Flat Incoherent Scatter Radar (PFISR), and the European Incoherent Scatter Radar (EISCAT)). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will leverage the new diagnostic information provided by RISR to foster collaborative studies of the high latitude geospace system. The guiding questions of the investigation arise from this systems view: 1. What governs the internal structure and HF propagation characteristics of plasma density patches? 2. How do auroral processes affect structure and composition of the polar ionosphere, and what are the global-scale implications? 3. What are the important interactions between the plasma and neutral gases at polar latitudes? 4. How do the aforementioned processes control the distribution of plasma on high-latitude flux tubes? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide a wealth of information on the ionospheric boundary for modelers to enhance our understanding of the ionospheric boundary. The investigation of plasma structuring mechanisms will have implications for communications and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signal propagation. The investigation of plasma-neutral interactions will shed light on how the lower atmosphere drives the global geospace system. The research will be carried out through an 8-institution international collaborative (4 from the U.S., 2 from Canada, 2 from Japan). The project will contribute to training the next generation of geophysicists, and the team will include three early career investigators.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project supports observations of thermospheric winds in the northern polar cap using ground-based Doppler remote sensing instrument called Fabry Perot interferometers (FPI) at Resolute and Eureka in northern Canada.   The goal of the project is to understand the impact solar / geomagnetic impact on the ionosphere and thermosphere in the polar region.  During solar / geomagnetic storms, the Earth's ionosphere is strongly affected, which can have significant impact on communication and navigation systems.   Polar region usually feels the impact first, because the geomagnetic fields from the region is connected directly the solar wind.  We aim to understand how the solar wind changes can change the ionosphere, which in turn drives the thermosphere.   There is an interaction between the ionosphere and thermosphere, which determines how the ionosphere reacts to the solar input.   Thermspheric winds can carry disturbed ionosphere to mid- and low-latitudes resulting space weather effects (e.g., interfering with GPS and radio communications) in those region.  The FPI instruments can also observe mesospheric and lower thermospheric winds.  The observations are used to the mesospheric and lower thermospheric dynamics.   The instruments we deployed in Resolute and Eureka are the only ground based wind instruments operating in the northern polar cap.   These FPIs are critical part of a major NSF facility called Resolute Incoherent Scatter radar (RISR), which are aimed to study the space weather and magnetosphere ionosphere coupling in the polar cap.  Our observations so far have shown that our theoretical models overestimate the thermospheric winds in the polar cap.   Hence new improvements are need for the models, which will be developed for future space weather forecast use.   On the research of the mesospheric dynamics, we used the optical observations from Eureka to compare with model simulations. The goal was to examine the lunar tide effect during the stratospheric warming event.   The observation showed the lunar tide may not have major effect at high latitudes during stratospheric warming events.          Last Modified: 04/16/2018       Submitted by: Qian Wu]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
