<AbstractNarration>In this award the Chemistry of Life Processes Program supports Professor Nien-Hui Ge of the University of California at Irvine to use femtosecond multidimensional infrared (MultiD IR) spectroscopy to study the conformational dynamics, distributions, and folding of peptides. The goal is to provide detailed knowledge of protein structure and dynamics that is essential to the understanding of biological processes. The proposed work includes investigating the interplay between helical and extended structures, determining conformational distributions of nonfolding peptides, and elucidating protein-membrane interactions. MultiD IR experiments access the backbone and side chain vibrational modes of peptides, and provide data that reveal the angles, distances, and correlations between structural units. Isotope editing and incorporating IR probes at selected locations enhance the spatial resolution, facilitate the assignment of resonances, and extend the method to larger peptides and tertiary contacts. The effects of temperature, pH, solvent, and chain length are investigated to understand the factors that control protein stability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Proteins, long chains of peptides, fold rapidly into complex shapes that affect their function and how they bind with other molecules. Detailed knowledge of peptides and larger proteins - structure, dynamics, and folding can shed light on protein misfolding that characterizes many diseases. Understanding how proteins interact with membranes also informs the design of novel functional molecules, potentially useful for medicine. MultiD IR spectroscopy is a laser technique that can determine the shape and behavior of a peptide by studying the infrared light emitted after it was "photographed" using laser pulses at a "shutter speed" faster than one trillionth of a second. Graduate students and postdoctoral researchers participating in the research gain valuable experience with advanced laser techniques and core physical sciences that can strengthen their future career development. This project is also integrated with outreach efforts on maintaining an online spectrum database and contributing lectures and laboratory courses for K-12 students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Professor Nien-Hui Ge, who studies physical and analytical chemistry, and chemical physics and biology, conducts research to determine how molecular structures change in time, at equilibrium and during reactions, with a focus on devising new techniques in nonlinear spectroscopy and microscopy to investigate these changes. In this project, Professor Ge&rsquo;s team and Italian collaborators have distinguished a fully extended peptide from a 3<sub>10</sub>-helix. Peptides are cellular components that carry out important biological functions. Professor Ge&rsquo;s finding is significant because it gives us a glimpse into how those functions are produced. &nbsp;On the basis of computer simulations, the 3<sub>10</sub>-helix has been predicted to exist as an intermediate on the way to folding an a-helix from an extended peptide structure.&nbsp; However, it is still unclear whether this is the case because it is difficult to distinguish different structures by conventional methods, such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and the intermediate exists for only a tiny fraction of a second. Professor Ge&rsquo;s two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopic experiments employed isotopes (the heavier versions of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms) to isolate different parts of the peptides and used ultrashort laser pulses to probe the interactions between these isolated parts. The results show that this combined approach can distinguish between the fully extended structure and the 3<sub>10</sub>-helix. &nbsp;These exciting results demonstrate that the new laser spectroscopic method that Professor Ge developed can be used as a high-speed molecular camera to take snapshots of protein folding with high structural sensitivity.</p> <p>In addition to probing the behavior of folded peptides with well-defined structures, Professor Ge&rsquo;s team investigated the structure of an unfolded peptide. In the field of protein folding, whether the unfolded state of peptides and proteins is truly random remains an open question. Using a combination of isotope labeling, laser experiments, and computer simulations, Professor Ge&rsquo;s team was able to provide evidence that strongly supports the importance of the polyproline II structure in the unfolded state, thus showing the unfolded state to be not completely random. The comparison between experiments and simulations also provides a means to validate molecular dynamics force fields.</p> <p>In addition to gaining insight into peptide structures, Professor Ge&rsquo;s team has made significant advances in technical development. They have devised a novel reference scheme that can suppress laser noise to the detector limit and significantly improve the signal sensitivity of the 2D IR spectroscopic method, which is important in studying molecular structure and dynamics.&nbsp; Because the new reference scheme is versatile for all detector choices, it is generally applicable to many different spectroscopic techniques. It will further advance applications of heterodyne nonlinear spectroscopy to systems with weak signals, enabling many new experiments that were previously deemed infeasible. Armed with the newly improved experimental capabilities, Professor Ge&rsquo;s team has begun to study opioid peptides, peptaibol antibiotics, and enzyme reactions, which are important in biomedical and biofuel applications.</p> <p>The project&rsquo;s outcomes have broad impacts.
