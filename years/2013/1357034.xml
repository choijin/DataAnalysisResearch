<AbstractNarration>University of Florida doctoral student Jessica-Jean Casler, supervised by Dr. Clarence C. Gravlee, will explore how networks of health care access and delivery are shaped by programs designed to improve the relationship between patient and provider. The research will focus on the role of short-term health care providers (STHPs). Short-term health care providers (such as medical school student brigades) supplement local and state health care services in many lower-income countries. Even with these additional providers however; the inability to access adequate health care largely continues to affect the poor. Annual influxes of short-term health care providers in lower-income countries suggest that health care systems may be changing structurally and with them the ways that patients and providers use health care services. This study will provide a timely contribution to this global issue by examining: (1) how patients and providers use short-term health care providers (STHPs), (2) whether the informal structure of providers? networks resemble patient networks, and (3) the role of STHPs in patients? health care networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To meet these goals, the Co-PI will recruit 30 households in Matagalpa, Nicaragua representative of the socioeconomic, familial, and geographic diversity in the city to participate in the study. The site itself is chosen because of the high concentration of American medical students that visit it during an STHP trip. Households will be visited bi-monthly over a period of eight months as Ms. Casler the researcher conducts in-depth ethnographic interviews with her participants and also records their most recent usage of health care services. The Co-PI will map and interview all local health care providers (as identified by the community), collecting information about how they refer patients to different health care providers within the system. Using this information the Co-PI will be able to create network usage patterns for both patients and providers, determining any similarities between the networks and identifying the role of STHPs in one of Nicaragua?s urban health care systems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is important because it will contribute to the development of theory in both medical anthropology and the anthropology of development by mapping patients' and providers' use of health care providers within larger health care networks in a local setting. This study specifically explores the relatively recent addition of STHPs to health care systems of the poor and will also contribute to interdisciplinary social science research on health care systems. Findings will also suggest how urban health care systems could more efficiently use and organize the providers that typically comprise them. The project also supports the training of a graduate student.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project studied the role of short-term medical missions (STMMs) in urban Nicaragua and focused specifically on how STMMs were used by patients and integrated into the existing healthcare system in Matagalpa, Nicaragua. Although some of the project goals shifted over the 13-month research period, the project provided valuable insights into the ways STMMs currently operate in urban areas.  Goals and Hypothesis  The specific goals of this research were:  1.) To understand how patients &amp; healthcare providers use STMMs in their healthcare networks  2.) To determine if STMMs occupy equivalent roles in patientsÆ healthcare networks  I addressed these goals by testing the following hypothesis:        H1: STMMs have a higher degree of structural equivalence than long-term healthcare providers in MatagalpaÆs healthcare system  Findings  The hypothesis was rejected, STMMs did not have a higher degree of structural equivalence in the health networks. This signals that the short-term trips are not being recognized or used as permanent or continuous forms of care within urban Nicaraguan healthcare systems. Despite the absence of greater structural equivalence, the social network analysis revealed significant differences among the ways that primary care and specialty care STMMs were used by Nicaraguans.  Primary care STMMs (those offering basic check-ups and medicines) were less present in NicaraguanÆs self-identified healthcare networks and thus, far less likely to be used by Matagalpan residents than STMMs providing specialty care (surgeries, special exams, etc.). Primary care STMMs (typically offered by those without formal medical training- such as university students and church groups) were identified by many Nicaraguan residents as more difficult to access and more redundant than the specialty care STMMs.  Nicaraguans who found the primary care STMMs hard to access often believed that they or their families were not part of the right community groups, churches, or neighborhoods to access the short-term services. The broadly acknowledged inaccessibility of STMMs frequently created divides among community members and reinforced feelings of helplessness, often among those most in need of medical attention. In addition, because the country already has a well-developed primary care infrastructure in urban areas, for many Nicaraguans it was not the medical attention, but rather the free medications that were most desired from these visiting short-term groups.  Intellectual Merit  This study specifically explores the relatively recent addition of STMMs to healthcare systems of the poor and also contributes to interdisciplinary social science research on increasingly globalized and complex healthcare systems.  In many ways, the findings support claims that development projects (such as STMMs) reinforce existing, unequal power relations between citizens and the state. However, the research, and resulting dissertation also suggest ways to move forward and improve upon this growing global healthcare delivery mechanism.  The study also broke new ground by identifying structures of healthcare networks between and among urban poor patients and providers in a decentralized healthcare system in the Global South.  Broader Impacts  Findings suggest that simply adding more short-term sites for healthcare will not remedy a problem rooted in structural shortcomings of organization and coordination. STMMs need to work more closely with the Nicaraguan government to make the best use of their limited services (by potentially serving more remote and rural areas or donating medications to public health facilities which are more equitably able to dispense them).  Additionally, this research has prepared me to consult with universities, professionals, and churches wishing to send short-term medical teams abroad and to help groups foster stronger relationships with the states and cities they wish to visit and serve.
