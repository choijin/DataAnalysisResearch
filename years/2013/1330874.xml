<AbstractNarration>Elucidating the connection between genotype and phenotype is critical to achieving new heights in agriculture, evolutionary biology, and medicine. In this project, our goal is to help characterize basic principles underlying the genotype-phenotype map by comprehensively dissecting a genetically complex trait in a "simple" model organism. Specifically, we will extend our ongoing research on variability in susceptibility to DNA damage in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We will use statistically powerful and high-resolution genetic mapping experiments to identify the dozens of genetic variants that cause differences in DNA damage tolerance among three strains. We will then study how these genes interact and exert their effects using genetic experiments and functional assays. Our work should produce one of the most detailed genetic characterizations of a highly complex trait to date, and could also provide new insights into how cells detect and repair DNA damage.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of our broader impacts on society, we will use the proposed research to train multiple PhD, undergraduate, and high school students. We will also work with Rebecca Cooper, who instructs four sections of AP Biology at Burbank High School, to develop multiple lab practicals in which we use heritable trait variation in yeast to help teach biology to high school students. Additional interactions with Ms. Cooper?s class will involve talking with students about career opportunities in science, as well as discussing the many impacts of biological research on everyday life. Lastly, we will use the proposed work as a vehicle to expose minorities to research through the USC GREU program.</AbstractNarration>
