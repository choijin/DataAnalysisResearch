<AbstractNarration>This partnership brings together the Robotics Institute (Carnegie Mellon University), two institutions experienced in educational research and teacher development (Marshall University and West Liberty University) and school districts in West Virginia (Mingo County Schools) and Pennsylvania (Allegheny Valley School District). The key innovation of this project in the focal area of Identifying and Cultivating Exceptional Talent is its incorporation of robotics into courses for middle school students in a non-competitive setting to identify and cultivate talent in "exceptional computational thinking" and "exceptional engineering design." The project utilizes the Arts &amp; Bots program which enables teachers to introduce craft-based robotics projects to students in disciplines as varied as art, science, health, or English.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this work is the analysis of the role of creative technology in student engineering engagement and the identification of unrecognized creative STEM talent. This contributes to STEM talent theories on computational thinking and engineering design and refines working definitions of technology fluency. The broader impacts include the integration of creativity with technology, refined professional development materials for teachers to support STEM talent, and models for school district-wide deployment of curricular innovation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By executing the project with pre-service educational partners, a pathway to scaling is built so that the program may spread across a widening footprint of school districts. Research and evaluation focus on student engagement, knowledge, and attitudes as well as teachers' abilities to identify and support student talent.</AbstractNarration>

This program has designed, deployed, and refined a       creative robotics kit that enables non-technology teachers to       integrate sculptural robotics into an expressive practice in the       classroom: anatomical demonstrations in Physical Education;       metaphorical allusions in Poetry; moving models of historical       structures in in Social Studies; technology as an expressive       medium in Art class. In each case, Creative Robotics has helped       elucidate transdisciplinary integration, ensuring that STEM       talents such as mechanical engineering and computer programming       are not siloed, but rather embraced as expressive tools with       authentic value in any disciplinary discourse.
