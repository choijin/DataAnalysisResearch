<AbstractNarration>Objective:  The objective of this program is to understand and develop scalable nanomaterial-based wet-coating processes that enable high-throughput, cost-effective roll-to-roll production of an organic solar cell integrated with a composite supercapacitor that simultaneously harvests and stores solar energy.  The proposed device and processes have the potential to transform energy applications by dramatically decreasing costs and increasing the adoption of solar energy; lowering dependence on fossil fuels and minimizing climate change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:  The intellectual merit is a deeper understanding of producing high-performance polymer solar cells/nanowire electrodes and supercapacitors with low-temperature, high-throughput, wet coating processes.  A systematic approach with interdisciplinary researchers from the basic materials level to the manufacturing process level provides the intellectual basis for the project. Barriers to high performance organic solar cells, nanowire electrodes and composite supercapacitors are addressed to bring these important components together in an integrated device. The materials and processes involved in the devices are all optimized and/or developed to be compatible with cost-effective roll-to-roll production.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: The broader impacts are related to both education and technology.  The knowledge gained from the process development will provide a base for cost-effective solution processing of numerous other nanomaterials and an array of devices beyond those studied in this proposed work, including; organic light-emitting diodes, wearable electronics, flexible sensors, and flexible displays.  This program will also enable nanomaterials and nanomanufacturing enhancements to undergraduate/graduate courses as well as the development of a new course and workshop. It will reach high school students through hands-on research opportunities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Goals  The objective of this program was to understand and develop scalable nanomaterial-based wet-coating processes that enable high-throughput, cost-effective roll-to-roll production of an organic solar cell integrated with a composite supercapacitor that simultaneously harvests and stores solar energy.  The proposed device and processes have the potential to transform energy applications by dramatically decreasing costs and increasing the adoption of solar energy, lowering dependence on fossil fuels and minimizing climate change.  Intellectual Merit  The team working on this Award has the following achievements:  Publications: A total of 34 journal articles have been published, 6 conference proceedings, and 3 dissertations. Advanced Multifunctional Carbon X-Aerogels: demonstrated the potential of advanced multifunctional carbon x-aerogels as oxygen electrodes for supercapacitor, lithium&ndash;oxygen (Li&ndash;O2) batteries as well as electrochemical water purification. Integration of OPV, Supercapacitor and control circuit: Up to 4x increase in solar energy harvest and 3x increase in energy storage was observed for a roll-to-roll compatible control circuit when interfaced with a flexible photovoltaic and supercapacitor. Integration of nanowire electrodes and organic photovoltaic devices: 5.25% power conversion efficiency of organic solar cell with small band gap polymer on flexible nanowire/PET substrate with a high work function PEDOT:PSS layer with PFI additive. Large Scale CuNW Synthesis: A copper nanowire (Cu NW) synthesis was developed that yields &gt;4 g of Cu NWs in one hour, and a silver-coating procedure was developed that yields &gt;20 g of silver-coated Cu NWs (CuAg NWs) in one hour. CuNi Electrochromism. It was discovered that CuNiNW (copper-nickel nanowires) electrodes are electrochromic, that is, change color based on charge state of the electrode. There are few electrochromic systems, but many potential applications. Fully Printed Memory: A fully printed memristor based memory was developed using copper silica coreshell nanowires&#894; with switching voltages (3 V), write speed (3 &mu;s), cycling endurance (104 cycles), and retention times (&gt;10 y) competitive with commercial nonvolatile memories.   Broader Impacts  The broader impacts have been significant, including the following:  1. Research results: In terms of "scalable nanomanufacturing", the team has achieved significant results. For example, the scalable synthesis of metal nanowires has a direct impact on the production of nanomaterials. The successful demonstration of OPV devices on flexible nanowire/PET substrates is a solid step forward towards the full roll-to-roll printing of such technologies. The prototype devices, including the integration of organic solar cells with supercapacitor and control circuit, are significant demonstration of the potential of simultaneously harvesting and storing the solar energy, which is the key objective of this award.  2. Education and training: This project has been an excellent opportunity to train graduate students and undergraduate students as it involves experts from a variety of research fields in distinctively different disciplines (chemistry and engineering). Working within this team has helped students to develop research and communication skills and understand challenges involved in other fields and also how to work with researchers from different fields to achieve specific goals. Female and minority students have been trained with this award.  3. Publication and presentation: Results obtained in this work have been published in peer reviewed journals (34 publications as of now), and the participants (students and faculty members) have given research presentations in various venues, including materials-focused and device-focused conferences.  4. Outreach to general public, and K-12: Outreach has been a major focus of the award. A summary of outreach efforts is as follows. Each year, two students from a local high school (North Carolina School of Science and Math, Durham, NC) are hosted in the PI/Co-PI?s labs. The group participated in the UNC Science Expo and Climate LEAP program at UNC each year and the Fitzpatrick Institute of Photonics Symposium at Duke. The expo and symposium have an emphasis on outreach to historically underrepresented groups and include Title I schools. 2-3 undergraduates were involved at all times in project activities, including two who were co-authors on a journal publication.
