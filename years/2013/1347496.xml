<AbstractNarration>Stroke occurs in 2.9% of the US adult population and there are nearly 800,000 new or recurring&lt;br/&gt;cases annually. Neuromuscular impairment is a common consequence, though one from which recovery&lt;br/&gt;is possible with appropriate therapy. Though most healthcare plans cover post-stroke therapy,&lt;br/&gt;insurance reimbursement caps typically limit it to a few weeks, despite a growing body of&lt;br/&gt;evidence that therapeutic gains are possible months and even years after a stroke. Adding&lt;br/&gt;the fact that patients generally prefer out-of-clinic care, there is a compelling case for&lt;br/&gt;delivery of physical therapy in the home setting. The new product that will result from this&lt;br/&gt;project will increase dosing of meaningful exercises that promote recovery and minimize co-morbidities&lt;br/&gt;such as pain, swelling, spasticity and (shoulder) subluxation.&lt;br/&gt;This project?s outputs respond to other trends in the US healthcare system, including the&lt;br/&gt;dwindling supply of qualified care providers, the movement toward evidence based medicine&lt;br/&gt;and the economic requirement for increased self-care. The ultimate goal of our Virtual Coach&lt;br/&gt;technology is to leverage scarce human-based care with computer based solutions at substantially&lt;br/&gt;lower cost. The self-adjusting goal-setting capability developed in the proposed research&lt;br/&gt;will enable professional therapists to extend their reach to patients.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One significant challenge in computer-based coaching is devising algorithms that affect human&lt;br/&gt;behavior in an intended way. It is difficult to predict how people will react to commands,&lt;br/&gt;instructions, prompts and rewards. Some respond well to a nurturing "atta boy!" while others&lt;br/&gt;respond better to a drill sergeant?s "that?s not good enough!" Moreover, not only is there&lt;br/&gt;variability among people, but also within a particular individual from day-to-day. To be a&lt;br/&gt;viable, pervasive solution, Virtual Coaches will need to be responsive to the psychology&lt;br/&gt;of the people they serve. Pursuit of our objectives, especially the exploratory research objective,&lt;br/&gt;addresses this challenge in the context of motivating people to adhere to an exercise regimen.&lt;br/&gt;A second challenge is designing exercise software factoring in the heterogeneous presentation&lt;br/&gt;of individuals with neuromuscular impairments. Such patients have varying levels of motor&lt;br/&gt;control, cognitive ability and co-morbidities associated with their impairments. Off the&lt;br/&gt;shelf exercise packages do not account for their limitations. Our translational research objective&lt;br/&gt;is to overcome this challenge by leveraging research conducted on impaired patients and an&lt;br/&gt;already developed software architecture for coaching them through movements that promote long&lt;br/&gt;term recovery.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Value Proposition for this endeavor has been to reduce the long term paralysis of chronic stroke survivors who live in the community and have access to consumer electronic products such as gaming consoles, laptops, and televisions.  The participants, Myomo, Inc and Carnegie Melon University, collaborated to commercialize a Virtual Coach that evaluates and offers corrections and feedback for rehabilitation of stroke survivors, allows a therapist to establish a therapeutic regimen via a computer program, ensures patient adherence to that regimen, and allows the therapist to review the patientÆs progress.. The Virtual Coach is composed of a Laptop to run the software, a Microsoft Kinect 3D camera system for monitoring motion, a machine learning model to evaluate the quality of the exercise, a database to store and retrieve results, and an Automatic Goal Adjustment module to improve motivation and personalization for users.   An initial set of tasks have been incorporated into the Virtual Coach that have been found to be appropriate for users of the Myomo MyoPro Elbow orthotic, have been recommended by a number of Therapists who work with the product, and follow the standard of care for stroke rehabilitation therapy known as Functional Repetitive Task Practice. These tasks have been performed by a number of patient volunteers and observed by Key Opinion Leaders in the field of stroke rehabilitation.   Product testing initially focused on healthy individuals as a means of debugging the software system and then expanded to include stroke survivors who would be expected to use the product in a home environment as well as Key Opinion Leaders in the stroke rehabilitation community who are experts in their field and in a position to validate the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), help generate awareness for the emerging product.  During the Beta Test, it was confirmed that each of the key objectives had been accomplished:  Therapists were able to establish a therapeutic regimen via computer  Patient adherence to the regimen monitored Patient results and adherence were reported to the therapist    The following outcomes have resulted from the project:   Design and implementation of the Virtual Coach for Stroke Rehabilitation Exercises that evaluates and offers corrections and feedback for rehabilitation of stroke survivors. The Virtual Coach commercial beta product that is composed of a Laptop to run the software, a Kinect for monitoring motion, a machine learning model (Hidden Markov Model) to evaluate the quality of the exercise, a database to store and retrieve results, and an Automatic Goal Adjustment module to improve motivation and personalization for users. This Virtual Coach is being tested with potential clinical partners and current users of the Myomo MyoPro Elbow Orthotic with the following key learnings:   Users have reported the Virtual Coach to provide a useful experience Users found the Virtual Coach easy to use Instructions were found to be clear and easy to follow  Users reported they were likely to user the Virtual Coach regularly on a weekly basis    The Virtual Coach can be used for home-based stroke recovery therapy to facilitate key Activities of Daily Living.
