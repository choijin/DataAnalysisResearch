<AbstractNarration>The human vision system understands and interprets complex scenes for a wide range of visual tasks in real-time while consuming less than 20 Watts of power. This Expeditions-in-Computing project explores holistic design of machine vision systems that have the potential to approach and eventually exceed the capabilities of human vision systems. This will enable the next generation of machine vision systems to not only record images but also understand visual content. Such smart machine vision systems will have a multi-faceted impact on society, including visual aids for visually impaired persons, driver assistance for reducing automotive accidents, and augmented reality for enhanced shopping, travel, and safety. The transformative nature of the research will inspire and train a new generation of students in inter-disciplinary work that spans neuroscience, computing and engineering discipline.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While several machine vision systems today can each successfully perform one or a few human tasks ? such as detecting human faces in point-and-shoot cameras ? they are still limited in their ability to perform a wide range of visual tasks, to operate in complex, cluttered environments, and to provide reasoning for their decisions.  In contrast, the mammalian visual cortex excels in a broad variety of goal-oriented cognitive tasks, and is at least three orders of magnitude more energy efficient than customized state-of-the-art machine vision systems. The proposed research envisions a holistic design of a machine vision system that will approach the cognitive abilities of the human cortex, by developing a comprehensive solution consisting of vision algorithms, hardware design, human-machine interfaces, and information storage. The project aims to understand the fundamental mechanisms used in the visual cortex to enable the design of new vision algorithms and hardware fabrics that can improve power, speed, flexibility, and recognition accuracies relative to existing machine vision systems. Towards this goal, the project proposes an ambitious inter-disciplinary research agenda that will (i) understand goal-directed visual attention mechanisms in the brain to design task-driven vision algorithms; (ii) develop vision theory and algorithms that scale in performance with increasing complexity of a scene; (iii) integrate complementary approaches in biological and machine vision techniques; (iv) develop a new-genre of computing architectures inspired by advances in both the understanding of the visual cortex and the emergence of electronic devices; and (v) design human-computer interfaces that will effectively assist end-users while preserving privacy and maximizing utility. These advances will allow us to replace current-day cameras with cognitive visual systems that more intelligently analyze and understand complex scenes, and dynamically interact with users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Machine vision systems that understand and interact with their environment in ways similar to humans will enable new transformative applications. The project will develop experimental platforms to: (1) assist visually impaired people; (2) enhance driver attention; and (3) augment reality to provide enhanced experience for retail shopping or a vacation visit, and enhanced safety for critical public infrastructure. This project will result in education and research artifacts that will be disseminated widely through a web portal and via online lecture delivery. The resulting artifacts and prototypes will enhance successful ongoing outreach programs to under-represented minorities and the general public, such as museum exhibits, science fairs, and a summer camp aimed at K-12 students. It will also spur similar new outreach efforts at other partner locations. The project will help identify and develop course material and projects directed at instilling interest in computing fields for students in four-year colleges. Partnerships with two Hispanic serving institutes, industry, national labs and international projects are also planned.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project aimed at scientific and technological advances towards reverse engineering the mammalian visual cortex in silicon.  The goals of this effort were twofold: to gain a more fundamental understanding of visual information processing in the mammalian cortex through analysis by synthesis; and to leverage this understanding in developing visual sensors and information processing systems for visual scene understanding and navigation that approach the efficiency and efficacy of the mammalian visual system.  Towards these major goals, we developed silicon and emerging nanotechnology integrated circuits and systems that emulate biological visual processing architectures and that yield a factor 100-1000x improvement in energy and area efficiency over state-of-the-art computational vision hardware approaches.   Intellectual Merit:  Among exciting outcomes of collaborative research between the Cauwenberghs group at UCSD and the Wong group at Stanford University is the first nanoelectronic hybrid CMOS-RRAM (complementary metal-oxide semiconductor, resistive random-access memory) realization of a Boltzmann machine for highly energy efficient stochastic interference.  The chip contains over 3M analog RRAM synapses operating at less than 10 pJ of energy per activation.  The team effort between Stanford and UCSD along with collaborators at Tsinghua University involved system level architecture design and simulations, CMOS circuit design of neural core and synapse peripheral circuits, and RRAM-CMOS device engineering.  The team further conducted algorithm-hardware co-optimization specifically for such hardware comprising dense RRAM-CMOS cores to facilitate learning and inference using flexible network connection topologies maximizing overall energy and area efficiency.  On the front of learning algorithms and system integration the Cauwenberghs group developed a new architecture for stochastic neural interference and learning, the Synaptic Sampling Machine (S2M).  Extending on the widely used principle of Dropout and DropConnect during training of deep networks, S2Ms use synaptic stochasticity rather than neural stochasticity for inference and learning.  Spiking Synaptic Sampling Machines (S3Ms) offer superior learning and generalization capability over restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) on conventional digital computing platforms, and produce sparse synaptic connectivity in addition to the sparse neural activity in spike-based coding.  Further quantization of synaptic weights yields highly efficient representations amenable to dense and low-power neuromorphic implementation.  Continued research further extended the RBM framework to a broader class of neural and synaptic array transceivers (NSAT) for neuromorphic stochastic inference and learning that support highly efficient dense local connectivity at the core architectural level, and scalable highly expandable long-range sparse connectivity through hierarchical address-event routing (HiAER) at the inter-core communication level.  Importantly, the general HiAER-NSAT framework and its extensions to deeply layered architectures support on-chip deep supervised and unsupervised learning, without the need for precise computation of error gradients usually required in standard stochastic gradient descent based approaches to deep learning.  These outcomes were published in the peer-reviewed open literature and presented at international conferences and public lectures with electronic records available on-line.   Broader Impacts:  Outreach activities aimed at integrating results of research into the curriculum as well as transferring the results of the research into practical applications.  PI Cauwenberghs offered a winter school and workshop on Neuromorphic Engineering at UCSD in 2016 and 2017, that immersed students into research at the interface between computational neuroscience, and computational intelligence.  The project sparked significant interest with industry, and resulted in strengthened collaborations beyond the academic team including Intel, IBM, Fujitsu, Texas Instruments, Qualcomm, and Brain Corporation.  Collaborative interactions with industry included the Intel Strategic Research Alliance (ISRA) on Neuromorphic Architectures for Mainstream Computing as a formal partnership between Intel, UCSD, and other Expeditions partners.  These industry partnerships provided valuable internship and practical training opportunities for students and postdoctoral fellows to interact with industry and gain a hands-on industrial perspective in the research.
