<AbstractNarration>Monogenetic vents are relatively small volcanoes that are active for a single eruption over a period of a few months to a few years, in contrast to more typical volcanoes that are gradually built up over many different eruptions and which are typically intermittently active for 10s of thousands of years or longer. Monogenetic vents often occur in clusters, and are a common type of volcanism in many tectonic settings. Several monogenetic vent fields occur in or near high-population-density areas, including Auckland, New Zealand and Mexico City, Mexico. Therefore, monogenetic vents represent a significant volcanic hazard. Previous studies have shown that the compositions of the ash and lava erupted from a monogenetic vent during the course of an eruption often varies systematically over time. The cause of this variability is not clear, but it most likely reflects either processes involved in melt generation and extraction from the mantle, or melt storage in the continental crust and melt/crust interaction prior to eruption. A better understanding of the cause(s) of the chemical variations observed in monogenetic vent eruptions would provide scientists with a better understanding of the plumbing system that feeds these volcanoes. This in turn will allow better prediction of the precursor signals that may signal an impending eruption.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will combine numerical modeling of melt transport and storage processes with detailed geochemical analyses of material erupted from selected monogenetic vent eruptive sequences to better constrain the processes of melt generation, ascent, and storage that precede the eruption of monogenetic vents. Different hypothesized mechanisms for generating chemical variations in monogenetic vent sequences (e.g., reactive melt transport in the mantle or progressive draining of magma sills that are emplaced in the shallow crust prior to eruption) will produce different temporal chemical variations. We will compare model predictions with observations to constrain the likely origin of these variations, and then use the observed variations to extract information on important variables related to melt generation, transport, and storage such as the size of chemical heterogeneities in the mantle source region, the volume and geometry of magma storage chambers in the crust, and the time interval between melt injection into the crust and subsequent eruption of this stored magma. This information can be used in future studies to predict the most likely signals that may indicate an impending eruption (e.g., upward ground deformation due to magma injection) as well as the likely time lag between these signals and an actual eruption. The proposed study with therefore both improve our overall understanding of a geologically important and widespread style of continental volcanism, and improve our ability to evaluate and plan for the risks inherent in possible future monogenetic vent eruptions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  The goal of this project was to examine the cause of compositional variations observed during the course of volcanic eruption of "monogenetic vent volcanoes", small volcanoes that typically erupt only once but that often occur in clusters or fields. Previous studies had suggested that these compositional variations could reflect melt generation and extraction processes occurring in the mantle, such as mixing of melts generated from different components in the mantle. Alternatively, the variations could reflect assimilation of continental crust during ponding in the crust prior to eruption, and mixing of contaminated and non-contaminated melts at the time of eruption.

Proper interpretation of the "mantle signals" in volcanic products requires an understanding of both melt generation and extraction processes and magma storage and evolution in the crust.  To address these goals, this project took a novel approach that focused on examining the "crystal cargo", or crystal phases that were transported to the surface by the erupting magma at a well-characterized volcanic sequence in eastern California, the "Papoose Canyon" sequence. The compositions of the mineral phases revealed that the crystals had grown from earlier magmas that had ponded within the continental crust and cooled and partially crystallized prior to eruption. These "evolved" magmas then mixed with hotter, more primitive magmas at the same time that the eruption occurred, suggesting that the arrival of this second pulse of magma  is what triggered the volcanic eruption. This finding is significant because it suggests that, contrary to many previous suggestions, magmas that fed volcanic eruptions within this volcanic field had a protracted history of storage within the continental crust prior to eruption.
