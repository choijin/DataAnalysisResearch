<AbstractNarration>This award is providing funds to support the conference "Permutation Patterns 2014" (http://www.etsu.edu/cas/math/pp2014), which will be held July 7-11, 2014 at East Tennessee State University. Permutation Patterns is a subject that has become an established branch of Combinatorics over the last two decades. Much of the research in the area has centered on classes of permutations that are avoiding, i.e., each permutation in such a class avoids certain sets of subsequences. It turns out that pattern avoidance arises naturally in theoretical computer science to characterize the set of possible outputs of many natural sorting devices, such as stacks; in fact Knuth's result that a list is one-stack sortable if and only it avoids the pattern 231 is considered to be one of the cornerstones of the rich theory of permutation patterns. Current new research involves areas such as complexity theory and theoretical computer science. The conference series "Permutation Patterns" has been held annually since 2003, and has attracted a community of researchers in enumerative, analytic, algebraic and probabilistic combinatorics, all with common interest in research questions that revolve around pattern avoidance or containment in permutations or words.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The numbers of women, undergraduate and graduate students, and early career faculty who attend this conference have increased steadily over the years. Indeed, nurturing and mentoring of such mathematicians has been a significant part of the conference mission.  Eight students from the PI's summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates program will attend the conference in 2014, as might past participants from the program.  Award funds are dedicated to supporting participation of US citizens and permanent residents.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project entitled "Conferences in the Mathematical Sciences -- Permutation Patterns 2014, July 7-11, 2014" was used to support US Citizen and permanent resident applicants to attend the 12th International Permutation Patterns conference in Johnson City, TN.  Support was given for travel expenses by car or plane; a dorm package; and registration fees.  Non US persons were self-supported.  There were 78 attendees, including several undergraduate REU students.  Intellectual merits:  Without a doubt, the most important intellectual impact of the conference has been the generation of new research and the consolidation of existing research and research partnerships.  There have been sixteen papers submitted to the Conference Volume, to be published in 2016 by the stringently peer-reviewed and golden open access journal "Australasian Journal of Combinatorics" .  There have been sixteen submissions, of which one has been rejected; eight accepted; and seven are under review.  it is expected, based on preliminary referee reports, that most of the seven papers in the last category will be accepted.  We tried to maintain high quality from the beginning by informing potential authors that getting two strongly supportive referee reports was a necessary condition for acceptance.  Broader Impacts:  We witnessed a very diverse conference attendance pool.  Of the seventy eight participants, we can report that there were  22 undergraduates, from 3 NSF-REU programs; 23 graduate students; 5 post-docs; 25 women; and several junior faculty.   There were 18 participants from abroad, including undergraduate and graduate students in the US.       Last Modified: 05/05/2015       Submitted by: Anant P Godbole]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
