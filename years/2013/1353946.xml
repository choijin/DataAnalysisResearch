<AbstractNarration>The organizing theme for this Workshop is: "Strengthening the Nation's Competitiveness through Stronger University-Industry-Government Engagement".  This grant provides funding to host a workshop on the planning for, execution of, and reporting on an outcomes-oriented workshop designed to evaluate the current government-university-industry research, development, and commercialization engagement model and identify new approaches worthy of consideration and testing.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Leaders in the public and private sectors have long recognized that strategic Industry/University (I/U) research collaborations are critical to advancing a nation's commercialization portfolio, and its overall economic competitiveness and well-being.   While few challenge this hypothesis that the idea-to-innovation process is bolstered by healthy university-industry relations, the type of strategic and high value collaborations are often difficult to implement.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To achieve its objectives, the Workshop will be structured around: a pre-event survey that captures issues to be addressed;  presentation on the topics and findings/materials from the October 2012 GUIRR/UIDP Workshop; examinations of what role federal agencies and NSF specifically play; regional efforts meant to spur collaboration; identification of on-going and proposed pilots/demonstrations; and building new models. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Workshop will bring together a strategic set of thought leaders who have the ability to affect change in their organizations and undertake pilots, demonstrations and experiments that can impact the way that companies and universities (in conjunction with government) act.  Many of the invitees will have experience implementing bold approaches and providing a neutral environment for conversations will bolster efforts to dispassionately consider these pilots and propose new ones.   &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The National Academies has been a critical player in examining issues affecting university-industry collaborations.  Through its Government-University-Industry Research Roundtable, The National Academies regularly has convened thought leaders from academia, corporate, government and the non-profit sectors to examine these issues and created the University-Industry Demonstration Partnership to provide an incubator for addressing matters affecting high value, high return collaborations between the sectors.  Using the National Academies GUIRR and UIDP programs provides a high visibility platform for launching national experiments to advance co-creation among the three sectors.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The University of South Carolina organized an October 2013 workshop on behalf of the University-Industry Demonstration Partnership (UIDP).  This workshop brought together a strategic set of leaders who have the ability to effect change in their organizations and undertake pilots, demonstrations, and experiments that can impact the way that companies and universities (in conjunction with government) act. Small group breakout sessions were used after each set of plenary presentations and discussions to consider those issues from one of four points of view. The four breakout groups and key findings were:  Intellectual      Property &ndash;  Participants requested that the UIDP  create  a simple and informational quick guide addressing IP FAQs. The UIDP created and released the quick guide in 2014. Metrics &ndash; Participants suggested that the UIDP consider developing key terms to be used in metrics, develop a translator to cross reference key words, and identify timelines and then develop short- and long-term metrics, both tangible and intangible. The group rapporteurs also shared the suggestion that UIDP consider a long time horizon study and mapping of networks resulting from funded research projects. Big data analyses and already-in-use mapping techniques could be used to accomplish this.  This is an extremely challenging issue to address and the UIDP is in discussions with several other groups to pursue these recommendations. Roles of      Government &ndash;  Participants advocated that the UIDP evaluate current European Commission initiatives to promote the "industrial PhD and postdoc" in the United States and see how it may work in the US. Additionally, the UIDP could study and report on ways to expand current NSF efforts to get more industry involvement in government-supported STEM initiatives.To date, the UIDP has not pursued the industrial post-doc initiative but has worked with its membership to provide NSF and other federal agencies strategies for enhancing substantive industry engagement on federally supported academic projects.  New Models of Collaboration &ndash;  Particpants recommended that the UIDPundertake a project  to develop a "public dedication resource" of open IP and expand existing core models of university-Industry shared knowledge into new areas. Through such a pilot project, UIDP members could consider developing a university researcher residency in industry program, sometimes termed a "dual citizenship" program. Such a program could be beneficial for UIDP member organizations to work with government(s) to identify and align innovation programs to megatrends to include global entities.  The UIDP released a New Models report in 2014 and is pursuing the creation of a "how-to' guide on the correct approach to public dedication of IP emanating from industry sponsored academic projects.
