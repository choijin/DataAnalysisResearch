<AbstractNarration>A workshop is proposed to identify and articulate the cyberinfrastructure (CI) needs and&lt;br/&gt;potential applications in the broad scientific domain encompassing sedimentary geology. The&lt;br/&gt;effort is intended to build consensus within the diverse sedimentary geology community (SGC)&lt;br/&gt;with respect to the EarthCube effort. The SGC focuses on the processes that form, shape, and&lt;br/&gt;affect Earth's sedimentary crust, and distribute key resources such as hydrocarbons, coal, and&lt;br/&gt;water. The sedimentary records studied by this community are the archives of Earth's past&lt;br/&gt;surface processes, climates, oceans, and biosphere. The SGC collects a great diversity of&lt;br/&gt;qualitative and quantitative data that characterizes diverse attributes of sedimentary rocks at&lt;br/&gt;spatial scales that span 13-orders of magnitude. Most data is based on physical samples; some is&lt;br/&gt;continuous. Derivative products based on the data are published, but the data itself are typically&lt;br/&gt;not archived or readily available to other researchers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The domain workshop will focus on: 1) defining the current nature of SGC data and workflows,&lt;br/&gt;including the challenges and impediments to sharing and using that data; 2) establish what types&lt;br/&gt;of data, repositories, software, and tools (analytical, modeling, and visualization) would enable&lt;br/&gt;community-based, 'big science' collaborations within the SGC; 3) evaluate the potential&lt;br/&gt;importance of mining legacy data; 4) identify examples of the kind of scientific challenges the&lt;br/&gt;SGC would attack given an ideal CI; and 5) evaluate how EarthCube, if populated with the type&lt;br/&gt;of data and tools articulated in the above bullets, would impact the SGC's teaching. The overall&lt;br/&gt;product of the workshop will be a report to NSF that defines the issues and challenges that must&lt;br/&gt;be met for the integration of the SGC with EarthCube.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Sedimentary rocks are the most abundant rock type on the surface of the Earth and are rich in&lt;br/&gt;geologic data and history. The intellectual merit of the proposal is that the summary outcomes&lt;br/&gt;will provide SGC guidance on the priorities and use of sedimentary data to the EarthCube&lt;br/&gt;framework of Earth systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader of impacts of the proposed workshop are to integrate SGC with one of the most&lt;br/&gt;important cyberinfrastructure initiatives to NSF integrating information and data across the&lt;br/&gt;geosciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ EarthCube (earthcube.org) is a NSF initiative to advance cyberinfrastructure for the geosciences, with the goal of enabling geoscientists to address the challenges of understanding and predicting complex and evolving solid Earth, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and space environment systems. The NSF sponsored multiple domain (subdiscipline) workshops to engage scientists, and to provide opportunities for input on how to build the best structure to fit all geoscientistÃ†s needs.  In March 2013, the Sedimentary Geology Community (SGC) workshop brought together 57 geoscientists with expertise in modern and ancient sedimentology, stratigraphy, basin analysis, paleontology, paleoclimatology, sedimentary geochemistry, sedimentary petrology, petroleum geology, paleopedology, and geochronology.  The workshop discussions highlighted many issues including: challenges to integrating the community into EarthCube, important scientific drivers, research themes that could be pursued with an ideal EarthCube, impediments to sharing and using data, current cyber resources, needed data sets and tools for the future, and potential impact of EarthCube on teaching.    Key outcomes of the workshop were in three areas.  First, three main drivers of research were identified in the SGC community that will develop concurrent with the building of EarthCube.  Second, 22 potential challenges to high-impact, interdisciplinary science in the SGC community were examined.  Third, and most importantly, a list of databases, search capabilities and tools desired by the SGC community for inclusion in EarthCube were identified.  The latter would maximize EarthCubeÃ†s potential to aid the SGC community in meeting the challenges of the three main science drivers.  Major points and overarching societal issues are in the SGC executive summary, available through the EarthCube webpage.  The support of this grant helped cover the expenses of the workshop participants, provided for the meeting space and preparations, facilitated the generation of workshop reports, assisted dissemination of the outcomes via professional meeting presentations, and facilitated the engagement of the lead Principal Investigator (PI) in additional EarthCube activities and governance.  Finally, one of the most important workshop outcomes was the SGC recognition of EarthCubeÃ†s potential to: 1) change the way we find information and make science discoveries, and 2) improve our ability to share our science with colleagues and the public through better visualization and data accessibility.
