<AbstractNarration>Human language is the most complex communication system known. However, many non-human animal species also have quite complex communication systems, including non-human primates, whales and dolphins, and even many bird species. The key factors driving such complexity, though, remain largely unknown for both human language and for non-human communication systems. Discovering these factors is crucial to understanding the origin and evolution of such complex behavior, including the origin of language in our own ancestors. The proposed research will use observational and experimental methods to test three key factors proposed to explain vocal communication complexity: social complexity and group size, predation risk, and habitat-induced constraints on sound transmission. The investigators will examine these factors in two common North American bird species that possess complex systems of vocal behavior as well as complex social structures: Carolina chickadees and tufted titmice. The researchers will include their results in their teaching and mentor multiple student researchers in current research methods including Big Data management strategies, and collaborting with supercomputing staff through the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment program associated with the University of Illinois supercomputing facility. Lucas and Freeberg will continue to write about this work for general-audience journals like American Scientist, where they co-authored a 2012 article that has been read by thousands of readers in the U.S. and abroad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What factors drive the evolution of complex signals? The Social Complexity Hypothesis posits that species or populations forming complex social groups require more complex signaling systems than species or populations that form simpler groups. Although there is increasing evidence to support the Social Complexity Hypothesis, a key limitation is that it is rarely tested against alternative hypotheses. The proposed work tests the Social Complexity Hypothesis against two major alternative hypotheses to explain communicative complexity, using chick-a-dee calls of two avian species of the family Paridae (Carolina chickadees, Poecile carolinensis, and tufted titmice, Baeolophus bicolor): (1) Social Complexity: Individuals in more complex flocks produce calls with greater complexity than individuals in simpler flocks. (2) Habitat Constraints: Individuals in habitats that are more open produce calls with greater complexity than individuals in more closed habitats. (3) Predation Pressure: Individuals in habitats with a greater density or diversity of predators produce calls with greater complexity than individuals facing fewer predators. The hypotheses will be tested with unprecedented resolution through captive flock experiments at the University of Tennessee and University of Florida, data collected on un-manipulated wild flocks, field playback experiments, and observations of flocks before and after scheduled partial forest cuts at the University of Tennessee and Purdue University. The work will increase understanding of the function and mechanisms of complex communicative behavior and provide fundamental information about how complex behavior at the level of the individual emerges from the nature of the social and physical environmental setting in which the individual lives. Parid species are now commonly utilized as a model system for the study of social information use and its fitness consequences in animal communities. This work lays a solid foundation for understanding the nature of parid call complexity and, in turn, the generation of finely tuned information used by many species in fitness-related decision-making in a rapidly changing world.  The investigators intend to deposit the data in the University of Tennessee institutional repository, Trace (http://trace.tennessee.edu/), where University of Tennessee Libraries staff will provide appraisal for long-term preservation and stewardship. Trace addresses access, security, preservation, and copyright of deposited research, and ensures that global researchers can find the data, with the assignment of Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) encouraging proper citation and re-use.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit  Our research program focused on factors that regulate signal complexity.  The most important hypothesis in the field is the Social Complexity Hypothesis: species or populations forming complex social groups require more complex signaling systems than species or populations forming simpler groups because more complex social interactions require a broader range of information transfer. Social complexity stems from more individuals or greater diversity in social relationships among group members.  However, the Social Complexity Hypothesis has rarely been tested against alternatives. For example, reverberant habitats such as closed canopy forests limit the value of rapidly changing song elements such as trills, thereby limiting signal diversity. Such constraints can influence the precision and accuracy of information transfer. Alternatively, predators might influence signaling complexity. Predation-induced changes in signaling can, in turn, influence the precision and accuracy of information transfer. We tested the Social Complexity Hypothesis against these two hypotheses to evaluate the basis of complexity in the chick-a-dee call of species in the Family Paridae (the chickadees and titmice).  The chick-a-dee call system is particularly important because it is one of the most complex call systems known in any avian species.  We ran a set of field studies of mixed species flocks including Carolina chickadees, tufted titmice, white-breasted nuthatches and downy woodpeckers.  These flocks were studied at 3 sites that differed in the degree of disturbance caused by forestry practice.  The disturbance gradient was important because disturbance influences how birds use space, and therefore how birds interact with one another.  Thus disturbance alone can affect social complexity.   Predation risk was indexed using call rates of predatory birds (hawks and owls). Forest properties were measured using vegetation surveys of canopy trees and understory plants.  Avian responses to the habitat gradient were indexed using home range size, foraging budgets, fat scores, numbers of fledgling birds per family, bird survival rates, population abundances, and flock size and species composition.  The impact of forest cover on sound propagation was measured using playback studies of a variety of types of chick-a-dee calls from both chickadees and titmice.  Preliminary results indicated that sound propagation and predation levels were similar between sites.  However, energetic stress was highest at the most disturbed site.  High stress levels at the most disturbed site correlated with the largest home ranges, and social networks that were the least modular (i.e. fewer discrete clusters of individuals) with the strongest interactions between individuals of different species.  Moreover, mixed species flocking extended into the breeding season at the most disturbed site.   Vocal complexity, of both song and the chick-a-dee system, was highest at the least disturbed site.  This is important because the social networks were smaller at the least disturbed site but intra-specific interactions were stronger.  Thus broad social networks that cover large areas (as in the disturbed site) result in more global information transfer but presumably the sharing of limited types of information.  Smaller social networks covering smaller areas (as in the least disturbed site) result in local information transfer but also the sharing of a broad range of types of information, ranging from foraging, to predator-related information, to dominance and territoriality.  As we discussed in two theoretical papers, the latter set of conditions should indeed result in the development of the most complex communicative system.  Our study provides a unique insight into the evolution of an extraordinarily complex vocal system (chick-a-dee) although the level of vocal complexity results from only a subset of dimensions of the social system.     Broader Impacts  Our research program offered an important contribution to the broader society.  We trained 27 diverse undergraduates on how to read scientific papers, design experiments, analyze data and write a scientific report.  The writing component included several drafts of a proposal that were read by the PI, returned to the student, rewritten and subject to further feedback.  This feedback is critical in a student’s progress as a scientific writer.  Many of these students were involved with presentation of 23 talks at national and local meetings.  We trained a postdoc and three field technicians.  The post-doc went on to a permanent job with the Florida Wildlife Conservation Program.  Two of the field technicians are now graduate students (Wyoming and Colorado State); the third has a permanent position as a wildlife expert in Australia.  Our broader impacts also included talks given to citizen groups such as Audubon societies, student Wildlife Societies, universities, and forester groups.  Avian vocalizations are intrinsically interesting to the general public making these topics easily understood by broad audiences.  Finally, I was awarded an NSF IOS Supplemental Funding Request to fund an internship for Henry Legett at the Northeast Climate Adaption Science Center, where he worked on migration patterns in birds and fish.  Henry did extremely well with the projects and was able to network with a number of people working for the government.
