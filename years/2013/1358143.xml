<AbstractNarration>This study seeks to understand how international policy surrounding rights evolves among world policymakers. As global communication brings previously disconnected groups closer together, debates about rights are a focal point for understanding the preconditions for stable political and economic relationships between nations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses specifically on peasants, a group which has historically made up a bulk of the literature in cultural anthropology. The UN approved a landmark Declaration on Indigenous Rights in 2007 and is now moving to strengthen human rights protections for the one-third of the global population that consists of peasants, small farmers, and landless laborers. With the creation in 2012 of a new UN Intergovernmental Working Group on a Peasants' Rights Declaration, transnational agrarian movements hope to follow the example of the indigenous movements. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project's questions include: (1) How does the peasants' rights process reflect and/or contribute to norms evolution? (2) How do peasant stakeholders and their allies make their voices heard in the Intergovernmental Working Group and strategize to influence its activities? (3) What institutional changes in the UN will emerge from the Working Group? And (4) how have understandings of human rights changed since they initiated the campaign for a new rights instrument? The project employs documentary research, key informant interviews, and intensive participant observation in Geneva during all key periods when the peasants' rights Declaration is under consideration. The new Working Group provides an extraordinary opportunity to observe processes that are central to human rights scholarship in and outside of anthropology. It contributes to three bodies of scholarship: (1) contentious politics and transnational social movements; (2) the anthropology of human rights; and (3) the anthropology of the UN and research on how civil society influences global governance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research has broad societal impacts through enhancing our understanding of the evolution of international cooperation. The project also broadens participation of underrepresented groups in a STEM discipline by involving undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented groups in the analysis of data.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project documented and analyzed how international law may be co-created by states, international governance institutions, legal and other experts, and the rights holders. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Peasants and Other People Working in Rural Areas (UNDROP), adopted by the General Assembly in December 2018, originated in an initiative of agrarian social movements in Indonesia. Transnational peasant movements, particularly La Via Campesina, first brought a proposal for a new legal instrument on peasants? rights to the UN Human Rights Council in 2001.

Movements of peasants, indigenous peoples, artisanal fishers, pastoral nomads, rural women, Catholic farmers, and others, from dozens of countries, participated in the debates. The movements used a strategy that was "part inside, part outside," also attempting to build pressure for the adoption of the Declaration through high-profile meetings in different world regions and through lobbying campaigns in Geneva and in national capitals. Proponents of the Declaration sought to attract more states to their positions by engaging in systematic studies of each UN member state?s stance and prioritizing lobbying activities accordingly. Among the most contentious issues in the debates were the definition of the rights holders ("peasants and other people working in rural areas"), collective rights to land and natural resources, "food sovereignty," and the right to cultivate and exchange farm-grown seeds. Even though the text of the Declaration relied almost entirely on "accepted language" from other international agreements, the question of whether it was creating "new rights" also became controversial. The analysis the campaign for peasants? rights and international law construction potentially advances understanding of rural realities worldwide, of transnational agrarian social movements, of the ways in which international norms may be at least partially constructed "from below," and of the challenges involved in their implementation. The research has already resulted in several publications and several more are planned.       Last Modified: 02/28/2019       Submitted by: Marc Edelman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
