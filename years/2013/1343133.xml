<AbstractNarration>This workshop is to bring together the Rock Mechanics and COMPRESS Mineral Physics communities to gather requirements for the NSF-funded EarthCube initiative whose goal is to design and implement a new data and knowledge management system for the geosciences. The workshop will assemble a group of about 70 experts in rock deformation and high-pressure mineral physics to discuss their cyberinfrastructure needs in terms of data, modeling, and visualization. Goals will be to surface cyberinfrastructure needs that are presently holding these communities back and to enable their ability to address fault-slip behaviors, brittle-ductile transitions in lithologic materials, scientific drilling, deformation processes in subduction zones, and the physical, chemical, and electronic properties of geologic materials in the deep Earth. The two and a half day workshop will be held in Alexandria, Virginia in early November of 2013. A catalyzing issue of the workshop concerns the nature and reporting of experimental and observational data. Addressing these cyberinfrastructure needs represents a fundamental challenge to digital representation/integration and allowance of broad public access to data from this field that can be aided by involvement with EarthCube. This project is important for both the scientific and cyberinfrastructure development of the geosciences. Future progress of the geosciences will be based on the integration of rich and diverse datasets. This workshop will identify the needs of one of the most important and societally relevant groups in Earth Science. There will be a vast array of intellectually challenging tasks in describing and integrating data across a spectrum of scales as well as granularity that will be addressed at the workshop. Broader impacts of the work include provisions for improving public access to data from these fields, especially for those interested in studying earthquakes or assessing and manageing their impacts.  it also builds infrastructure for science in terms of helping create more effective and interoperable data and modeling frameworks. The workshop will also emphasize the inclusion of early career researchers, thus ensuring the needs are met of the next generation of rock deformation professionals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project funded a workshop that brought scientists together in the Washington DC area to discuss new opportunities for interdisciplinary interaction.   The workshop participants addressed the current state, future challenges, needs, opportunities, and directions of cyberinfrastructure as related to research in rock deformation (DEFORM) and mineral physics (COMPRES).  The workshop leveraged the high degree of compatibility that exists between the DEFORM and COMPRES communities.  An important outcome of the workshop was identification of scientifically transformative activities that could be facilitated by the new EarthCube activity of the NSF.  The workshop  fostered education and communication across geoscience and cyberinfrastructure disciplines.  The format provided an opportunity for young researchers to broaden their understanding of emerging problems in geoscience and to develop ideas for how they might become involved in related cyberscience initiatives.  Results included broad, community-based appreciation of the opportunities in cyberscience.  Workshop participants  focused on links between the traditional scientific objectives and emerging opportunities in cyberinfrastructure. The workshop is expected to have societal benefit associated with dissemination of data relevant to natural hazards. The DEFORM and COMPRESS groups are committed to outreach activities for local communities.  A total of 76 participants gathered for 2.5 days, including 18 pre-tenure faculty, postdocs and other early career scientists.  Workshop participants represented a variety of disciplines including mineral physics (36%), rock mechanics (34%), program managers from NSF/DOE/USGS (11%), cyber-science and engineering (9%), structural geology (5%), and geodynamics (5%).  The agenda included 15 keynote talks, 12 lightning talks, and 24 posters presentations during an evening session. The workshop featured vigorous discussion from every participant during three plenary sessions, three breakout sessions, 8.5 hours of scheduled, free form discussion, and 9 hours of informal discussion.
