<AbstractNarration>Metal sheet and foil are widely used or under consideration for use in advanced structural and magnetic product applications. Currently, sheet and foil are produced by multi-stage rolling processes. Rolling processes, while mature and large-scale, offer only limited control of sheet attributes. Furthermore, they are quite energy intensive and encumbered by high capital costs. In collaboration with three industrial partners, this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Indstry (GOALI) research will develop the processing science of a class of extrusion-cutting processes to produce sheet and foil in a single step. Simultaneously, the extrusion-cutting can tailor specific attributes of the sheet, via control of texture and microstructure, in ways not possible by the conventional rolling processes. Successful development and implementation of the extrusion-cutting will provide efficient routes for production of high-performance sheet metals of light-weight magnesium and titanium alloys, and magnetic silicon-iron. This will be a key enabling step for use of these alloys in automotive, bio-medical, aerospace and power systems applications. Complementing the research is an education and training program that includes industry internships, fostering of entrepreneurship in graduate study and undergraduate research internships, including a new dimension to training involving physically challenged students from the National Technical Institute for the Deaf.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The large-strain, extrusion-cutting processes can overcome some key barriers that limit the scope of rolling for producing sheet and foil from advanced alloys. Specifically, the extrusion-cutting can effect development of strong shear textures and fine-grained microstructures in sheet metals. Prior work has shown scalability of the extrusion-cutting, even for alloys of poor workability such as magnesium and titanium. These observations suggest a paradigm for creating new sheet metals with interesting structural, magnetic and formability properties. The project team will build on the preliminary findings with four coordinated thrusts. First, a deformation science initiative will measure, directly, the process strain, strain rate and temperature fields using in situ high-speed imaging. It will establish how special deformation paths can be exploited to control texture and microstructure. Second, structure development will be analyzed through texture analysis and electron microscopy. New shear-based textures, combined with fine-grained structures, and their effects on formability are of particular interest. Correlations will be established between deformation, texture and microstructure. Third, microstructure-property relationships will be assessed by characterizing orientation-dependent properties such as strength, formability and magnetic permeability.  Lastly, by integrating the results, process design for producing sheet with optimal properties will be assessed in collaboration with the industry partners.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project advanced understanding of a new class of cutting processes for producing metal sheet and foil.  The process is analogous to peeling, but uses a tool that additionally constrains the sheet to a predetermined thickness, as in extrusion.  Compared to the many incremental thickness reduction steps inherent to making sheet by rolling, the hybrid cutting-extrusion process produces sheet in a single deformation step.  High-speed microscopic imaging techniques revealed qualitative and quantitative details of material flow in the deformation zone, which is characterized by intense shear strain.  Conditions for maintaining stable flow and the effects of friction close to the tool/die interfaces were also characterized.  The shear deformation in cutting-extrusion is distinctly different from that produced in rolling and enables new crystallographic textures (shear textures) or preferred orientations of crystal grains to be produced to controllable degrees.  By controlling the cutting-extrusion conditions, shear-textured magnesium alloy strips were produced that demonstrated enhanced formability compared to rolled sheet.  Similar results were also obtained in aluminum alloys.  Controllable shear textures were also demonstrated in electrical steel (iron-silicon) sheet and correlated with changes in magnetic properties. Even high-silicon electrical steels, which are difficult or impossible to roll into sheet, were produced in thin sheet form by the cutting-extrusion process.  These outcomes provided the basis for another federally-funded research program to scale up the cutting-extrusion process for high-silicon electrical steel sheets for next-generation electric motors.  The materials processing science developed in this program has been disseminated broadly in eight archival journal papers, in conference papers and presentations, in popular scientific magazines/websites and on local public radio.  The program also accomplished significant education and training of researchers across the spectrum from high school students to undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral scholars.  Two of these students have taken up faculty positions in US universities and one has joined a National Lab.       Last Modified: 08/29/2017       Submitted by: Kevin P Trumble]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
