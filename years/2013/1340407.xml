<AbstractNarration>This project proposes an innovative approach integrating teamwork and distributed collaboration into the engineering curriculum by using scaffolds supported through information and communication technologies (ICT) to enhance critical skills in engineering students. Some of the specific skills sought include project management, teamwork and leadership. This study incorporates the design, implementation and empirical testing of a virtual team intervention in two project-based engineering courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed intervention will be implemented in the context of courses that provide authentic project learning experiences for engineering students through work on real-life engineering problems.  This initiative strives to place engineering students one step closer to acting as successful team members and team leaders in multidisciplinary and distributed teams.  The funding sought will support the development of a solid program in research and teaching in the area of distributed collaboration and global leadership that can make an impact on critical skills necessary for future engineers.</AbstractNarration>
