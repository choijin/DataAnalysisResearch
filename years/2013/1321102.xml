<AbstractNarration>This is a multidisciplinary research program combining medical informatics, human-computer interaction and behavioral science exploring effective user-centric technology mediated reflection (TMR) to promote psychological well-being.  It will design, develop and evaluate a radically new class of user-centric TMR system, thereby creating methods that will have much wider applications as well.  People currently experience problems of memory and compliance in carrying out TMR. However these problems are addressable by computational intervention using mobile tools for user-centric TMR to capture data about personal events and support reflection about emotional reactions to those events. These mobile augmentation tools will overcome critical limitations of unaided reflection, by being lightweight, user tailored and context-aware, and they will support adaptive reminding about positive and negative events. Novel visualizations should also improve people?s ability to infer general patterns in emotional behavior in order to promote long-term behavior change.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Using predictions derived from prior social science, this research will test the efficacy of TMR for improved well-being when users remind themselves about positive events, adaptively deal with negative past experiences, and modify long-term behavioral patterns in response to events. The research will then contribute fundamental new scientific knowledge to the social and psychological sciences, in part because collection of data about memory states during real life experiences goes beyond what it is possible to measure within the confines of academic laboratories.  In addition, the project will develop techniques to analyze how reminiscences about the same event change over time.  This will allow the development of new psychological and clinical models concerning the relations between memory, emotions and well-being.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;A significant fraction of the population experiences a major depressive episode at least once in their life, and other problems such as anxiety are also common, yet many people respond poorly to conventional forms of treatment, and the exact boundaries of these problems are poorly defined.  Effective TMR can address these pressing problems, by providing new tools and an experimental platform that will enable the rigorous testing of TMR interventions, addressing calls for disruptive interventions in mental healthcare.  It may be that one limitation of some current forms of treatment is that the benefits do not transfer well from the help-giver's office to the client's daily life, and mobile TMR may bridge that gap.  Diaries composed with mobile devices can also contribute to more formal accounts of historical events, thereby facilitating the emergence of citizen science in which ordinary users collaborate with each other scholars and social scientists, to complete valuable projects and experience the enrichment of life-long learning.  This project will also train undergraduates and graduate students in an interdisciplinary area of human computer interaction, medical informatics, and psychology.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The current proposal takes a computational approach to studying emotional well-being. The work develops new technology that we demonstrate improves mental health, extends theories of well-being and advances new principles for health technology design. Some of these well-being benefits persist months after interventions have finished. Experimental trials using standard assessment methods show that these applications help well-being in four main ways:&nbsp;</p> <p>(1) Promoting emotional insights: one system allows users to record and later reflect on everyday experiences allowing people to see how experiences affect mood. This both allows users to determine which of their remembered experiences promote positive affect, as well as to distance themselves from prior negative experiences.</p> <p>(2) Adaptive regulation of mood: another system encourages users to reflect on positive memories when in a negative mood, leading to improved affect. The same approach also allows people to adaptively reflect on prior negative experiences when in a positive mood, allowing distancing from these experiences.</p> <p>(3) Diagnosing relations between daily activities and subsequent mood: this system allows users to better understand which specific daily activities trigger positive and negative mood.</p> <p>(4) Recommending new activities to improve future mood: this system collects past data about user activities and moods, and uses that data to build statistical models that predict future mood. The system can therefore recommend new activities that boost future mood.&nbsp;</p> <p>Overall, these systems offer lightweight ways for people to personally manage their mental well-being, potentially addressing a significant societal issue.</p> <p>We also make important contributions to social science theories of memory and well-being. Some theorists have claimed that digital records are undermining adaptive memory processes and detracting from mental health. Contradicting this, our experiments show that computationally mediated memory processes share the same properties as regular human memory, promoting similar adaptive well-being benefits. Our data indicate that like regular human memory, mediated memory is adaptively biased, tending to edit past negative experiences, which is critical to support adaptive views of our past. Our theoretical results extend social science theory by confirming that reflecting on prior positive and moderately negative past experiences promotes well-being whereas reflecting on highly negative experiences damages it. We also extend well-being theory showing that mood-dependent reflection can be beneficial, as can processing negative memories when feeling positive. Finally, our work has developed new insights into the relationships between daily activities and mood, deriving accurate statistical mood models using large-scale computational methods. These models extend work in positive psychology in showing that carrying out Social and Health related activities has more significant effects on mood than Work or Leisure activities. Other large scale data analysis exploring relations between experiences and affect reveals that people's emotional reflexes to everyday events are driven by 4 main factors, feelings of competence, autonomy, social connection and hedonic reactions. These findings extend prior work on human motivation.</p> <p>In addition to developing and deploying 4 specific well-being applications, our work develops general principles for the design of such systems, thus contributing to human computer interaction (HCI) theory. In particular we inform the design of personal informatics systems. A recent design approach to personal informatics advocates automatic methods to collect data about user activities and emotions, in order to ease the users' burden in tracking such data. However our results indicate significant benefits to manual tracking, with mood models being more accurate when users actively record and reflect on their own data. To support such manual tracking, we therefore developed new lightweight system designs. We have also developed other new methods that allow users to explore and gain insights from complex personal data, including data visualisations and personalized activity recommendations. These have potentially broad application to other areas of HCI, particularly to behavior change systems. Our work shows that personalized recommendations about healthy activities can motivate users to adopt and maintain new adaptive behaviors, overcoming compliance issues with such systems. We have also developed new design principles for reflective systems that involve both event-based and adaptive reflection, as well as structured approaches allowing users to correlate mood and specific activity types.&nbsp; Finally, our findings have implications for algorithmic systems that interpret affect, showing that users are overly accepting of system interpretations, although our efforts to address this problem by developing transparent algorithm versions show limited context-specific benefits.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/29/2018<br>      Modified by: Steve&nbsp;Whittaker</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1321102/1321102_10264831_1543341732696_Echo-Screenshot--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1321102/1321102_10264831_1543341732696_Echo-Screenshot--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Emotional Reflection User Interface"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1321102/1321102_10264831_1543341732696_Echo-Screenshot--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Emotional Reflection User Interface"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Mobile application that promotes reflection on prior experiences supporting emotional insights</div> <div class="imageCredit">Stephen Whittaker</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Steve&nbsp;Whittaker</div> <div class="imageTitle">Emotional Reflection User Interface</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1321102/1321102_10264831_1543341939934_emotical_UI--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1321102/1321102_10264831_1543341939934_emotical_UI--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Emotional Forecasting UI"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1321102/1321102_10264831_1543341939934_emotical_UI--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Emotional Forecasting UI"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Mobile interface showing user's predicted future mood, recommended activities to improve mood and effects on mood of scheduling activities</div> <div class="imageCredit">Stephen Whittaker</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Steve&nbsp;Whittaker</div> <div class="imageTitle">Emotional Forecasting UI</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1321102/1321102_10264831_1543342126038_MoodAdaptorUI--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1321102/1321102_10264831_1543342126038_MoodAdaptorUI--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Mobile interface for mood adaptive reflection"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1321102/1321102_10264831_1543342126038_MoodAdaptorUI--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Mobile interface for mood adaptive reflection"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Interface supporting reflection about a positive memory when in a low mood</div> <div class="imageCredit">Stephen Whittaker</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Steve&nbsp;Whittaker</div> <div class="imageTitle">Mobile interface for mood adaptive reflection</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
