<AbstractNarration>This funding renews a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Texas State University - San Marcos. Undergraduate students will engage in summer research involving a variety of interesting and challenging problems associated with the Internet of Things.   Internet of Things represents a vision for the next generation of the Internet where everyday physical objects can be attached with sensors and seamlessly integrated with the Internet.  This REU Site provides opportunities for a cohort of undergraduate students to work during the summer on research and development of innovative Internet of Things technologies that could have significant societal impacts.   The site emphasizes the participation of a diverse group of students, in particular women, minorities, and non-traditional students. This project is co-funded by the Cyber-Physical Systems program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of the project rests with the project leadership, an experienced research group with excellent expertise and experience in the research area.  All of the student projects have a strong research basis derived from the synergistic research expertise of the five core faculty members from the Computer Science and Engineering departments.  The projects will advance the state-of-the-art in big data analysis and management, information retrieval, computer vision, and software engineering in the context of the Internet of Things.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts include providing a unique opportunity for undergraduate students with limited research opportunities to experience research in the interdisciplinary theme of Internet of Things.   The participating faculty members are committed to including under-represented and non-traditional students in their research and have an established recruitment network to reach these students.  Thus this project has the potential to produce new computer science graduate students and faculty members and to advance discovery and understanding while promoting learning.</AbstractNarration>
