<AbstractNarration>Io is one of the most remarkable bodies in our solar system, with volcanoes driven by tidal heating and complex interactions with Jupiter's magnetosphere. Despite extensive studies from the ground and from spacecraft, fundamental questions, concerning the nature and location of internal dissipation, the composition of the dominant magma, and the interactions among the volcanoes, surface frost, atmosphere, and Jupiter's magnetic field, remain unanswered. The proposing team will conduct an extensive observational program of imaging and spectroscopy to monitor Io's volcanoes and atmosphere, making use of a wide range of telescope facilities including the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA), the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-Wave Astronomy (CARMA), the Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF), and the Gemini and Keck Observatories. These observations will yield (1) global maps of Io at 1-5 microns, at least once a year, to map and monitor volcanic activity; (2) determinations of the sulfur monoxide gas distribution while Io is in Jupiter's shadow; (3) observations of sulfur monoxide and sulfur dioxide gases to constrain the structure of and dynamics in Io's atmosphere; and (4) correlations of atmospheric sulfur monoxide and sulfur dioxide gases with sulfur dioxide ice and volcanic hot spots. The global infrared maps of Io, will be integrated into the USGS global Io database. The project will support the work of undergraduate and graduate students, and proposing team members will be involved in a variety of public outreach activities.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><div class="WordSection1"> <p style="text-align: left;">Io is a most fascinating satellite: it is the most volcanically active body in our Solar System, and it is the only body with a SO2-dominated atmosphere. However, despite several spacecraft encounters and ground-based monitoring for&nbsp;&sim;50 years, we still lack a basic understanding of Io's volcanic activity.&nbsp;</p> <p>In this NSF proposal we investigated the relationships among Io's volcanic activity, its heat flow and its atmosphere through a multi-wavelength observing program.

We mapped the spatial distribution of SO and SO<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>gas using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 1-2 mm when Io went into eclipse (Jupiter's shadow) and emerged from eclipse. The SO spatial distribution was also mapped at 1.707&nbsp;mm with the Keck telescope.&nbsp;</p> <p>Several graduate and many undergraduate students participated in the project.</p> <p>Our findings are summarized within a broader context of Io in&nbsp;Annu.

While the number of hotspots and cumulative near-IR radiance is nearly identical between the leading and trailing hemispheres, bright transient eruptions usually take place on the trailing hemisphere, and at preferentially higher latitudes.&nbsp;&nbsp;A comparison to tidal heating models show a good correspondence between recent models incorporating a partially fluid interior and hot spots in the leading hemisphere as well as persistent hot spots.

Europa took about 10 seconds to completely cover Loki Patera, with a time resolution of ~2 km across Io's surface.
