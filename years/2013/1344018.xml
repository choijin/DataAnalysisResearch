<AbstractNarration>In this research project, the PIs will conduct laboratory experiments that examine the desire to ?do good? as an intrinsic motive for working.  The experiments involve a new incentivized game setting where worker effort, instead of benefitting an employer?s profit, instead benefits a third party: a needy individual, a group of such individuals, or a public good.  The experiments test the effects of incentive contracts (requests, rewards, and punishment) on productivity in these settings, and assess the potential for short-run and long-run crowding out of intrinsic motivation by extrinsic rewards.&lt;br/&gt;This project is inspired by recent developments in economic theory.  Economics is concerned with the extrinsic motivation provided by wages, which compensates for the disutility of work, while social and educational psychologists study intrinsic motivation, an inherent interest in the work itself. The prevailing finding of this research is that financial rewards crowd out intrinsic motivation.  Economic theory that incorporates nonpecuniary motives ? such as self-esteem, identity, and status ? concludes that the compensation of intrinsically motivated workers will involve smaller incentive-based payments.  This occurs in part because of the potential for crowding out, but in addition, low wages serve to limit the applicant pool to workers whose valuation of the organization?s mission is highest.  &lt;br/&gt;While theory incorporates a broad set of intrinsic motives, most experimental research has focused on reciprocity between the agent and the principal. In experiments based on trust or gift-exchange, high wages elicit high effort on the part of workers, but the introduction of incentive contracts that involve monitoring and sanctions robustly crowds out such intrinsic reciprocity.  Work environments where the worker?s effort produces a ?good? for someone other than the employer have not been tested previously. However, other motivations, such as altruism, may greatly impact effort choices in the workplace, particularly when the job involves positive externalities or some other form of ?doing good.? In these cases, incentive contracts may crowd out the desire to do good, as theory suggests, or may indeed reinforce intrinsic motivation.  Exogenously changing employment contracts in the real world is difficult or impossible, making laboratory experiments an ideal method to address this issue.  &lt;br/&gt;Broader significance and importance: In terms of broader impacts, the research will shed light on the interaction between worker motivation and the structure of employment contracts.  When deciding to accept employment or exert effort on behalf of an employer, workers take into account not only the monetary compensation, but also the type of work and the mission of the organization. This project focuses on settings where nonpecuniary factors are key aspects of the job, and individuals make choices not only about ?doing well,? but also ?doing good.? Many important organizations exist to benefit third parties, and are most effective when they can attract and motivate workers who support their missions. Our work contributes to the development of institutions that foster altruism and cooperation among workers who work for a cause, and not just for the money.  On a scientific level, our work contributes to understanding the impact of non-pecuniary motivations on decision making by individuals in a wide variety of settings. The project also implements and evaluates a mentoring component, which utilizes a novel structure and provides a valuable collaborative research experience to young scholars at all levels, from undergraduate students to post-doctoral scholars.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes report: It's Not Just About the Money  Lab experiments can be used in economics to understand phenomena and answer research questions that cannot be explored using standard data approaches, either because data are unavailable, or because multiple factors influence outcomes at once and their separate effects cannot be disentangled.  Well-designed lab experiments can thus fill the gaps in research conducted with observational data.   One approach is to experimentally model key aspects of a situation by setting up information condition and incentives that mimic the situation in the lab.  We use this approach to study worker motivation in the care sector of the economy. The care sector includes all jobs where one person directly provides care to another, including most obviously many health-related positions, as well as teaching and advising.  We have developed and implemented such an experimental model of the care sector and used it to complete two research papers.  The model has three roles: a care manager, a care worker, and a care recipient.  Care managers must employ care workers, and in many cases the quality of care of those workers is very hard to monitor.  Workers must be trustworthy to provide adequate care for patients.  The first paper, "Care Provision: An Experimental Investigation," introduces the Care Game, and explores several variations on the game to examine the motivation and efficiency of care workers. In the second, "It's All about the Relationship," we find that the historical relationship among the players matters more for care provision than rewards or punishments, both of which are largely ineffective in this setting.  Both are discussed in some detail in prior reports.   Two additional papers address how workers might respond to incentives in for-profit as compared to non-profit firms, using different types of experiments.  In the first, we use structured choices, with real monetary payoffs, to discover people?s preferences.  For example, people might work harder, regardless of incentives, for a firm whose mission they care about, and so incentives might matter less for worker productivity in the nonprofit sector.  To explore worker effort in these settings we developed a second experimental procedure for eliciting worker preferences over alternative work/compensation environments, and used it to collect data for a third paper.  We subsequently reworked the design, adding additional procedural elements, and reprogrammed the experiment to be conducted online.  We have just completed the data collection on this paper, "Working for Hurricane Harvey," using our access to a full cohort of students at Rice University.  This data can be used to understand what type of work people prefer, and how important incentives are in these decisions.   The second paper in this category, "How does the ability to do good...?" uses an experimental model of for profit and non-profit firms.  Each firm has a shareholder, a manager and a worker.  In the non-profit firm model, we choose a charitable organization to be the shareholder, and we send the profits generated in the lab to the charitable organization. Here we are interested in how the worker exerts effort under different wage levels, depending where the profit they generate goes ? to a private shareholder or a charitable organization. This lets us determine that people actually work harder when their effort benefits a charity.   The papers are listed below, together with their status.  Banuri, S., A.C.M de Oliveira and C.
