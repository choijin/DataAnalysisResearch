<AbstractNarration>1336132&lt;br/&gt;PI: Furst&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this work is to create and study a new class of responsive materials called endoskeletal  droplets. These are oil-in-water emulsion droplets that contain an internal scaffold of a soft network of crystalline solids. This endoskeleton provides the ability to mold and sustain a non-spherical shape. The balance of forces in these metastable structures can be used to trigger reorganization in shape in response to external stimuli, including changes to the droplet surface tension or weakening of the internal scaffold by increasing temperature. This project will study the structure, micromechanics, and responsiveness to stimuli of endoskeletal droplets. In addition, the fluid-fluid interfaces of these droplets will also be used to host or reject particles, which will further allow information flow through the droplet interface akin to the function of receptors in living cells. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Engineering shape anisotropy and shape change by colloids and particulates has applications in self-assembly, rheology, and drug delivery. Anisotropic shape leads to better deposition through enhanced collision cross-section, while the ability of structured droplets to adapt shape to curved surfaces will promote retention against hydrodynamic stresses. Prior work on shape changing particles has focused almost exclusively on solid materials. Preliminary studies of endoskeletal droplets highlight the rich possibilities for designing new responsive materials out of fluids and other simple materials that are of tremendous interest to technological applications as varied as commercial drug formulations, shampoos, detergents, cosmetics, and agricultural protectants. These broad impacts are enhanced by strong international and industrial partnerships. PhD students working at Delaware will have the opportunity to conduct research internships in the Complex Fluids Microstructures Group at P&amp;G and at the University of New South Wales. In addition, the education and outreach activities of the PI will boost the interest of K-12 students and teachers in research and applications of soft materials and colloids.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work is jointly funded by the Particulate and Multiphase Processes Program in Chemical, Biological, Environmental, and transport Division, Biomaterials Program in the Division of Materials Research,and BioMaPS funds from both divisions.</AbstractNarration>

We showed how to program droplets by controlling their internal structure to a geometry with a predictable response, either retracting directly to a sphere or going through multiple stages of transformation, such as rolling up, bending, or even snapping shut like a clam shell. Part of what enabled our work was the design and implementation of a microfluidic approach to generating these programmable emulsions continuously. Furthermore, this enabled us to implement a new technique for the optical measurement of crystallinity in microfluidic devices. Its application to endoskeletal droplets enabled us to measure the rate of internal structure formation in shaped emulsion droplets, which is useful for estimating the yield stress of droplets as they are produced. Hence, by tuning the crystallinity and stability (particle coalescence) of the droplets, we could engineer higher-order structures, much like the tertiary structure of proteins. These structures are bicontinuous fluids similar to bijels and they allow the responsive, programmable features of endoskeletal droplets to extend far beyond the size of individual droplets to macroscopic structures. Lastly, a careful study of the size statistics of droplet created in the devices also revealed information about the physics of T-junction droplet generation.</p> <p>In a second area of work, we demonstrated that endoskeletal droplets can be programmed to respond to additional stimuli?magnetic fields?by introducing magnetite nanoparticles. This added control allows ordered structures to be produced from disordered suspensions; these assemblies have predictable, staged responses, which enables fine-tuned control over droplet reconfiguration. External fields also provide another route to inducing shape change by using high-frequency, alternating fields, which cause magnetite particles to heat up without affecting the droplet surroundings.</p> <p>Our last significant result explored the suitability of programmable emulsions in a deposition application, where shape change allows control over droplet deposition and retention to surfaces. The result is a multiple order of magnitude change in droplet binding affinity to a substrate, which suggests that shape and reconfigurability are highly useful tunable parameters for the design of future programmable materials. In a related result, in collaboration with Patrick Spicer (Chemical Engineering, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia) we extended the application of endoskeletal droplets beyond emulsions to aerosol systems, demonstrating that the principles behind shape retention and reconfiguration apply outside of emulsion systems and have much greater applicability as a result.</p> <p>Overall, the results of our work are distinct and unique examples of the fundamentals, production, and application of programmable materials.
