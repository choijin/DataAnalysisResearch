<AbstractNarration>The PI (Nimish A. Shah) proposes to investigate, together with his graduate students, a wide range of limit distribution problems on homogenous spaces of Lie groups with an aim of applications to questions in number theory and arithmetic geometry. The following three areas will be focused on: (1) effective density and effective equidistribution of orbits of unipotent flows, (2) description of limit distributions of stretching translates of sub-manifolds on homogeneous spaces, and (3) equidistribution of relatively sparse set of points on unstable leaves under the action of a partially hyperbolic flow. This study will combine techniques and results from diverse areas of mathematics: theory of semi-simple Lie groups and their finite and infinite dimensional representations, ergodic theory and dynamical systems, probability theory, number theory and automorphic forms, algebraic geometry, etc. The work will further the development of bridges between these areas, and yield interesting new results and techniques, of dynamical, number theoretical, geometrical and combinatorial nature. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research links several important areas of mathematics: we apply concepts of ergodic theory and dynamical systems (the area with origin in physics) to solve a class of problems in number theory, using techniques of Lie groups, algebraic and differential geometry, and probability theory. All of these areas have deep connections with other sciences such as physics, astronomy, statistics, and computer science. The broad purpose of the proposed project is to investigate a range of ideas and create techniques that have the potential to impact many problems of interest in all of these fields. An important aspect of this project will be training of graduate students and post doctoral fellows to conduct research where ideas of one filed are applied to solve problem in another field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Recent years have seen great success in applying Dynamics of unipotent flows on homogeneous spaces to problems arising in Number theory. Till recently, most results in homogenous dynamics where not effective, or controlable, so the corresponding number theory results were typically qualitative or existantial type.  We have made a significat progress in obtaining Effective, or controllable, version of one of the deepest results which drives homogeneous dynamics, namely homogeneity of closures of orbits of unipotent flows. We have achieved some controls on how slow or fast a dense unipotent orbit can fill up the space. This work, or its sharpend equidistribution version, should start yielding quantitive results in number theory, and this is what one is looking for.   New results on equidistribution of expanding translates of curves on homogeneous spaces leads to new results on metric theory of Diophantine approximation in number theory.  The work involves introducing some new concepts, creating new bridges between different areas of mathematics, and developing new technical tools for the subject. These ideas will become very useful to researchers in this fast growing field.   Last but not least, the project has helped train and prepare a number of young graduates to carry out independent research in leading areas of Mathematics, and teach advanced Mathematics at the university level.
