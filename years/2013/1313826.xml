<AbstractNarration>This project will investigate the marine component of the Totten Glacier and Moscow University Ice Shelf, East Antarctica. This system is of critical importance because it drains one-eighth of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet and contains a volume equivalent to nearly 7 meters of potential sea level rise, greater than the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet. This nearly completely unexplored region is the single largest and least understood marine glacial system that is potentially unstable. Despite intense scrutiny of marine based systems in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, little is known about the Totten Glacier system. This study will add substantially to the meager oceanographic and marine geology and geophysics data available in this region, and will significantly advance understanding of this poorly understood glacial system and its potentially sensitive response to environmental change.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Independent, space-based platforms indicate accelerating mass loss of the Totten system. Recent aerogeophysical surveys of the Aurora Subglacial Basin, which contains the deepest ice in Antarctica and drains into the Totten system, have provided the subglacial context for measured surface changes and show that the Totten Glacier has been the most significant drainage pathway for at least two previous ice flow regimes. However, the offshore context is far less understood. Limited physical oceanographic data from the nearby shelf/slope break indicate the presence of Modified Circumpolar Deep Water within a thick bottom layer at the mouth of a trough with apparent access to Totten Glacier, suggesting the possibility of sub-glacial bottom inflow of relatively warm water, a process considered to be responsible for West Antarctic Ice Sheet grounding line retreat. This project will conduct a ship-based marine geologic and geophysical survey of the region, combined with a physical oceanographic study, in order to evaluate both the recent and longer-term behavior of the glacial system and its relationship to the adjacent oceanographic system.  This endeavor will complement studies of other Antarctic ice shelves, oceanographic studies near the Antarctic Peninsula, and ongoing development of ice sheet and other ocean models.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Two large cyclones are inferred over the continental shelf off Sabrina Coast, East Antarctica: an elongated upper cell connects slope waters to the eastern end of the escarpment in front of the Moscow University Ice Shelf, and a deeper zonally-oriented cell connecting the westward boundary current along the escarpment northern flank to the interior of the Dalton Basin.  Modified Circumpolar Deep Water is present near the local shelf break, but only lighter oceanic Thermocline Water is able to enter the shelf through its relatively shallow (~ 450 m) easternmost sill. This relatively warm (~ 0.3 &deg;C) bottom water continues poleward within the eastern boundary current west of Dalton Plateau, and reaches the escarpment (450 m &ndash; 550 m). At this intersection, the densest remnant of oceanic Thermocline Water descends (&gt; 650 m) to the bottom of the Dalton Basin and continues farther to the west and north within the basin. Relatively lighter Thermocline Water (&gamma;n = 27.90 kg m3) from about 150 m near the shelf break is able to turn westward and extend uninterrupted over the escarpment (450 m), filling trenches that are connected to the Moscow University Ice Shelf. It supplies source waters for basal melt with potential temperatures near -1.7 &deg;C at 560 m.  A prominent meltwater-bearing outflow is observed at a central trench of the Moscow University Ice Shelf, directly above the bottom water inflow. It is indicated by a ~ 300 m thick layer with potential temperatures well below -1.85 &deg;C and salinity ~ 34.22 (&gamma;n &lt; 27.90 kg m3). This outflow is incorporated to the westward-flowing boundary current north of the escarpment, and its influence is clear throughout the Sabrina Basin interior, where the deepest thermocline and thickest thermostad layer are found.  Ventilation of the oceanic Thermocline Water takes place off the tip of the Dalton Iceberg Tongue. A tight anticyclonic loop west of the Tongue brings relatively warm (&theta; &gt; -1.83 &deg;C) and saline (S &gt; 34.30) from ~ 200 m (&gamma;n &gt; 27.90 kg m3) southeastward onto the northern portion of the Ice Tongue, where lateral melt takes place. The result is fresher (S &lt; 34.22) and lighter (&gamma;n &lt; 27.80 kg m3) ventilated Thermocline Water. A distinct outflow is observed off the Tongue?s tip and it is injected northwestward into the Antarctic Slope Current.  There is no indication of dense Shelf Water locally formation within the shelf off Sabrina Coast, not even over the large Dalton Polynya which presumably features high sea-ice growth rates. This suggests that inputs of salt, rejected during sea-ice production, and/or freshwater, from continental and marine ice melt, to the thick subsurface thermostad layer observed in the Sabrina Basin during the austral summers of 2014 and 2015 are grossly underestimated.  Estimates of net sea-ice volume exchange across the shelf break and the variability in sea-ice volume remaining farther inshore indicate that an average of 197.41 km3/yr of sea-ice are        produced over the Sabrina Basin. About 97% of the local sea-ice production is exported offshore, and it is highly correlated (0.95) to sea-ice divergence within the shelf. In contrast, the Ad?lie Basin produces only 34.38 km3/yr of sea-ice and its productivity (production per unit area, 1.86 m/yr) is still lower than in the Sabrina Basin (4.59 m/yr); but it is a well-known producer of local Shelf Water and Antarctic Bottom Water types.  A salt budget of the Thermostad Water layer characteristics observed in 2014 and 2015 requires a meltwater input of 157.5 Gt/yr from the Moscow University Ice Shelf and Totten Glacier combined. Furthermore, three distinct regimes are indicated in the Thermostad salinity evolution from 2003 to 2016. An initial (2003 &ndash; June 2008) decrease of -0.35 &Delta;S per decade resulted from local meltwater input being suppressed by active sea-ice formation.

Since December 2011 a significant salinification (2.16 &Delta;S per decade) is observed, due to large overall sea-ice export.  At the estimated current rate of increase in the salinity of near-freezing Antarctic surface waters observed off Sabrina Coast, production of local Shelf Water may have resumed by 2017, and therefore this shelf area of East Antarctica may soon play a more active role in the global Meridional Overturning Circulation than in the past decade.
