<AbstractNarration>Understanding how complex characters evolve is central to developing fundamental theories of trait evolution.  One such theory, Dollo?s Law, which states that once lost, complex characters cannot be re-evolved, has challenged biologists for more than a century.  Despite recent evidence suggesting that complex characters can and do re-evolve, there is a lack of understanding of how and why these evolutionary reversals take place.  The proposed study will address these questions by elucidating the functional underpinnings and the developmental mechanisms of complex trait re-evolution. This project will result in an unprecedented integration of functional morphology and developmental genetics in an evolutionary framework, facilitating communication between these fields.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project will use an integrative approach that synthesizes developmental genetics and functional morphology in a phylogenetic framework to study limb and digit loss and subsequent re-evolution in the Southeast Asian burrowing lizard genus Brachymeles.  Objectives of the proposed research are to determine whether a phenotypic trait that has been lost re-evolves with the same or different functional capacities, and whether re-evolved digits develop via the same or different developmental mechanisms as ancestral digits.  Surface locomotor velocity, acceleration, and burrowing speed and force will be quantified using high-speed video and a force transducer for ancestrally and re-evolved pentadactyl, intermediate, and limbless species. The developmental basis of limb and digit reduction and re-evolution in Brachymeles will be characterized to identify hypothesized developmental constraints on limb and digit re-evolution.  Mesenchymal condensations of digits in embryos will be identified using histochemistry and in situ hybridization of nine genes associated with limb and digit patterning. The project will be also involve and train undergraduate and graduate students in research methods and will promote international collaborations.  Minority and female students will be actively recruited and encouraged to participate in the research training opportunities provided by the project.  Biologically themed outreach programs resulting from this project will target disadvantaged communities and local K-12 schools.  Findings from the proposed project will be publicly disseminated online as part of an established biodiversity information website (http://philbreo.lifedesks.org/), at scientific conferences, in peer-reviewed journals, and through other existing databases (http://datadryad.org/).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Together with the other PIs (P. Bergmann, C. Siler, and G. Wagner), Irschick focused on developing novel methods of assessing morphological body shape in Brachymeles skinks, and also working with Bergmann to develop methods for assessing burrowing and locomotor performance in these animals.  The basic goal of this grant is to understand the developmental, functional, and ecologial basis of body evolution and limb evolution among a group of diverse lizards.  This is a valuable goal, as the processes that result in snake-like body forms are still poorly understood.  Skinks offer a wonderful sytem to examine this issue as they display tremendous variation in body shape and limb development.  Irschick and his students used novel 3D methods (both with a single cameras, and with multiple cameras) to quantify the body shape of a subset of Brachymeles skinks from the Phillipines.  These methods work with both live and preserved lizards, and therefore can be used both in the laboratory and in the field.  These methods show that as these skinks change size over evolutionary time, there are also changes in overall body shape that appear to be related to their ability to burrow in, and move over surfaces.  This suggests that the evolution of size per se is closely related to the evolution of a snake-like body form.  Overall, these methods and results reveal that one can use 3D methods to understand and analyze complex body shapes such as found in these skinks.
