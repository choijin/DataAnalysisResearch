<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Douglas A. Klumpp of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Northern Illinois University will explore synthetic chemistry involving highly charged cationic species (superelectrophiles).  It has been previously shown that superelectrophiles exhibit large-scale electron delocalization and these charge-charge repulsive effects can be used to drive new types of synthetic reactions.  Specific synthetic goals include the preparation of technologically important heterocyclic products, such as indoles, indolizidines, 2-oxyindoles, and aza-steroids.  Several natural product syntheses will be explored using this chemistry.  Superelectrophilic reactions will also be done to identify synthetic routes to commodity chemicals from biorenewable feedstock.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The successful development of the proposed chemistry will improve access to a variety of organic products.  These chemical reactions could be valuable to the pharmaceutical, petrochemical, colorants/dye/pigment, and agricultural chemical industries.  With both synthetic and mechanistic components, the research will be an ideal training ground for graduate and undergraduate students in chemistry.  Moreover, summer research projects are planned for home-schooled, high school age students-typically, high achieving students with little access to formal laboratory sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this research project, organic synthetic methods were developed.  The chemistry utilized acid catalysts and reactive electrophiles.  Many of the developed synthetic methods provide new routes to heterocyclic compounds.  This class of compounds are exceptionally important in pharmacuetical syntheses. New synthetic methods in this area can improve access to drugs - perhaps lowering the cost for manufacturing medicines.   The research also discovered a previously unknown route to polychlorinated dibenzofurans, one of the most insensively studied industrial pollutants.  The new chemistry will provide chemists and engineers insights into their formation and it may help them limit formation of these pollutants.  A very efficient synthesis of 9,9-diarylfluorenes has been developed.  These compound have been utilized in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) by Chinese researchers.  The newly developed chemistry provides efficent access to these compounds.  The chemsitry was also extended to the synthesis of polymeric products.  A convenient synthetic route was developed leading to ferrocenyl amides. Despite 60+ years of ferrocene chemistry, a direct route to ferrocenyl amides from ferrocene had never been described.  This chemistry was developed and a variety of ferrocene derivative were prepared.  Ferrocene derivative have numerous uses, including as catalysts, medicinal agents, and in material science.  Much of the research has examined the chemistry of highly charged cationic species.  As part this work, one study demonstrated that the magnetic behavior of organic ions can be controlled or influenced by charge-charge reulsive effects.  Another study described the first ever tetracationic species to be directly observed and subsequently used in chemical transformations.  This chemistry provided key insights reagrding the behavior of positive charge on an organic structure.  Overall, the work fullfilled the mission of the Nation Science Foundation.  It has advanced the science of organic chemistry by providing new synthetic routes to useful chemical products.  Moreover, the research has been an outstanding part of the eductational experience of undergraduate and graduates student in chemistry.  It has provided the students with a comprehesive science experience - from activties in the library, to work in the laboratory, and to final publication of their research in the science literature.
