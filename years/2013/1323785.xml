<AbstractNarration>This project supports the creation of four textbooks and four open-content computer lab manuals with supporting materials for a new upper-division undergraduate curriculum in Applied and Computational Mathematics (ACM) that will modernize the mathematics major and better integrate it with the broader STEM community.  The new curriculum is being piloted at Brigham Young University as a new degree program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The textbooks are being published by a national publisher, and both the lab manuals and supporting materials will be made freely available online.  The assessment and evaluation plans focus primarily on student learning, student demand for the program, and employer interest in graduates of the program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new curriculum brings mathematical analysis, algorithm design, and mathematical modeling into the forefront of interdisciplinary study in the pure and applied sciences.  Scientific computing is taught in the context of big data and high performance computing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project creates a modern undergraduate curriculum which provides the foundation that students need to become world-class problem solvers and interdisciplinary innovators. This should increase student interest and participation in applied and computational mathematics, and expand the pipeline of young scholars in the mathematical sciences who are well equipped to face the challenges of the 21st Century and become leaders in the globally competitive STEM workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project developed curriculum materials, including textbooks and lab manuals for advanced undergraduates and masters students in applied and computational mathematics.  The subject matter covered is foundational to modern applications of mathematics and computing, including machine learning, dat science, and artifical intelligence, and a rapidly increasing number of students need to learn this material in order to be prepared to make contributions in these developing areas of great importance to our nation and society.   The project also facilitated the development of a highly successful new program in applied and computational mathematics at Brigham Young University.  This program has grown rapidly since its initial cohort in 2013, and students have been successfully placed in top graduate programs and high quality industrial careers that require advanced skills in applied and computational mathematics.  Specific materials produced include the following textbooks and lab manuals:   Humpherys, Jarvis, &amp; Evans. Foundations of Applied Mathematics Volume 1: Mathematical Analysis.  Published by the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, 2017.  Humpherys &amp; Jarvis. Foundations of Applied Mathematics Volume 2: Algorithms, Approximation, and Optimization.
