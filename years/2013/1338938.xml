<AbstractNarration>This award provides student travel and subsistence for the 2013 Oregon Programming Languages Summer School (OPLSS).  This summer school provides an important and valuable educational opportunity for students to study theoretical topics related to programming languages and methods/verification. The students who attend are from a large number of countries. The NSF support ensures participation of US students while paying attention to underrepresented groups. The broader impacts are include building international community and cooperation in foundational research areas, and enhancing education of students with exposure to and interaction with leading-edge research and researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Oregon Programming Languages Summer School (OPLSS) is a long-running and successful venue for disseminating cutting-edge ideas in the theory and practice of programming languages, formal verification, security, and related technologies --- topics of critical importance in the intellectual mainstream of CS research.   The school's main goal is the training of PhD students.  In recent years, about 100 students from around the US and Europe have participated, most with full or partial financial support from NSF, ACM, and several industrial sponsors.  Many come from institutions lacking strong graduate curricula in the topics addressed by the school.  A substantial number of the students at the school over the years have been women and minorities.   The present grant was used to support the participation of 56 students from universities around the united states in the summer of 2013.   Eight sets of lectures were presented by international leaders in their fields, including: Type Theory Foundations &mdash; Robert Harper; Linear Logic and Session-based Concurrency &mdash; Frank Pfenning; Software Foundations in Coq&mdash; Andrew Tolmach; Logical Relations &mdash; Amal Ahmed; Dependently-Typed Programming in Agda &mdash; Dan Licata; Adventure with Types in Haskell &mdash; Simon Peyton-Jones; Designing Dependently-Typed Programming Languages &mdash; Stephanie Weirich; andVerifying LLVM Optimizations in Coq&mdash; Steve Zdancewic.
