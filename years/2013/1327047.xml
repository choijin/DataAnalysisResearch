<AbstractNarration>Humans (Homo sapiens) are distinctive relative to other primates.  They have large brains and are behaviorally flexible, they eat nutritionally dense foods that are difficult to acquire and are extensively shared, and they depend on culturally transmitted information, including technology, for their survival.  This package of traits allows Homo sapiens to adapt to a wide variety of habitats.  Through excavation of ca. 2.0 million year old Oldowan archaeological sites on the Homa Peninsula, Kenya, this project will document adaptability of human ancestors under conditions of environmental variability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   While technology is a key component of the human adaptive strategy, the adaptive versatility of earlier species of Homo, and the importance of technology to their survival, has not been well-documented.  This project investigates the behavior and ecology of early Homo through the excavation of primary context stone tool and fossil assemblages at the localities of Kanjera South, Nyayanga, and Sare River on the Homa Peninsula.  These localities date between 1.7 and 2.0 million years ago, a significant time interval during which archaeological sites spread across Africa, and the human ancestor Homo erectus appears in, and ultimately disperses out of, the continent.  These localities preserve paleohabitats ranging from riverine woodland to open grassland, evidence of small antelope hunting as well as scavenging of larger animals, evidence of plant food acquisition (e.g., tubers), and technologically diverse tool assemblages.  This project provides an excellent opportunity to assess the adaptability of early Homo, by ascertaining whether they employed specific technological strategies and foraging behaviors in response to environmental variability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;   The project will expand our understanding of the evolutionary significance of Oldowan behavior, and the time depth of hominin dependence on culture for survival.   The broader impact of this project includes the training of four doctoral students from the USA, and one based at the National Museums of Kenya.  Four of these students are women, an historically underprivileged group in science. Finally, this project strengthens international collaboration, by bringing together researchers from the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, China, and Kenya.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Homa Peninsula Paleoanthropological Project (HPPP) conducted three field seasons (summers of 2014-2016) under the auspices of NSF funding.  The main focus was to improve our understanding of the behavior and ecology of human ancestors using early (Oldowan) stone tools based on the excavation of a suite of sites at three different locations (Sare River, Kanjera South and Nyayanga) on the peninsula.   Sare River is a seasonally flowing stream cutting through 1.75 million year old (Ma) artifact-rich deposits that can be traced laterally as "paleo-landscapes" for approximately 2 km.  We carried out five excavations in one "landscape" level, and found in our 200 meter transect that hominin activities were tightly focused at just one site that yielded over 1700 artifacts (Fig. 1).  At Kanjera South we completed Excavation 1, which has been under active investigation for 20 years (Fig. 2).  We found fauna and artifacts in close spatial association, and noted stone tool and carnivore damage on bones.  Our past work suggested that Kanjera hominins both hunted young small antelopes and scavenged larger mammals.  The current project produced more small antelope remains, as well as large antelope bones that can help us test our past conclusions about hominin foraging.  We excavated six sites at Nyayanga.  Study of fossils and shifts in the earth?s magnetic field through the geological section indicate that sediments at Nyayanga are older than Kanjera South, perhaps as old as 2.6 Ma.  This would make the archeology there coeval with the oldest known Oldowan sites in Gona, Ethiopia, and would represent a large range expansion for the Oldowan.  Artifacts and fossils were found in close spatial association at multiple points in the sequence, and at three different sites we have artifacts in direct contact with very large (hippopotamus and giraffe) skeletal parts (Figure 3).  Bones with stone tool damage have been found on the surface and are present in the in situ sample as well, though these are still being cleaned.  Nyayanga has the potential to expand our knowledge about stone tool usage at the dawn of the Oldowan.  The repeated association of megafauna and stone tools is striking, and may indicate that hominins were having at least occasional access to large quantities of meat even at this early date.  In addition to archeology, Nyayanga has provided the only hominin fossils (a surface collected Paranthropus tooth, and a partial hominin tooth found in situ in an Oldowan excavation) from the Homa Peninsula.    At every locality we collected geological samples to help reconstruct habitat structure using isotopes and phytoliths, and we are looking at the artifact edges to reconstruct the activities stone tools were used for.  We will thus be able to relate hominin behavior to their environments (e.g., grassland, woodland) at the different localities.   The broader impacts of this project include the training of graduate students from the United States and the United Kingdom in modern archeological and geological field methods.  The students also learned how to identify common bones from a variety of different animals, and how to identify stone tool and carnivore damage on bone.  This project also helped strengthen collaborative ties between researchers from the United States and the National Museums of Kenya.
