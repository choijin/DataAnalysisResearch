<AbstractNarration>Laskowski is continuing his research in model theory, which is a branch of mathematical logic.  The PI's research is in three areas. It is well known that almost all of the basic notions of first-order model theory are absolute, i.e., their interpretation does not change depending on the model of set theory one is working in. The situation is known to be much more complicated for similar concepts in infinitary languages, where even simple concepts such as categoricity in power  can fail to be absolute, even for cardinal preserving forcings.   A few years ago, it was noted that if one places extremely strong stability theoretic conditions on a theory, then these conditions limit the quantifier complexity of  the elementary diagram of any model of the theory.  These bounds immediately give upper bounds  on the computable complexity of definable subsets of such a theory.  The model theoretic notion of definability of types over finite sets is intimately related to the notion of a compression scheme in computational learning theory.  This connection has beein fruitful in both directions. A number of examples of concept classes that posess compression schemes have been identified, and conversely this connection has led to a deeper model theoretic understanding of dependent theories.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Model theory is concerned with the interplay between theories, i.e., sets of sentences in a very formal language, and the classes of algebraic structures (models) that satisfy these sentences.  There is a well established taxonomy of theories, which is based on the embeddability or non-embeddability of certain configurations of elements into models of the theory. Laskowski has identified certain classes of theories that have direct connections to limitations on data compression and computational learning theory, and will continue his examination of these theories.</AbstractNarration>

The general aim of this research is to explore the connections between theories, which are sets of sentences in a formal language, with its class of models, i.e., all structures that satisfy the theory.  Over the past several years, there have been many tools developed for investigating the uncountable models of a theory, but many of the results from this grant describe the class of countable models. New results were obtained for each of the four projects mentioned in the original proposal.  New methods of calculating the Borel complexity of a class were introduced; a determination of when prime models exist over certain subsets of a classifiable theory; sharp conditions were found on when the class of atomic models is aleph1-categorical, and new characterizations of mutually algebraic structures and their built-in quantifier elimination were described.  The latter characterization led to a classification of sufficiently sparse  hereditary classes of finite structures.   During the course of the grant, twenty papers were authored or co-authored by the PI and three of his graduate students.  All have been submitted to refereed journals, most have been accepted with a few still being refereed.  Two students received their doctorates under the PI's direction at University of Maryland.  Richard Rast wrote a very strong thesis and was awarded the James Alexander prize for the top doctoral thesis in Mathematics for 2016.  Douglas Ulrich defended his thesis in May 2018, and is now a postdoctoral fellow at University of California, Irvine.  A third doctoral student, Danul Gunatilleka is actively writing his doctoral thesis, which he will defend in Spring, 2019. The PI and all three of his students gave talks at prestigious national and international conferences, in addition to speaking at multiple seminars at universities throughout the country.
