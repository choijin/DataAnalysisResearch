<AbstractNarration>The Center for Aerosol Impacts on Climate and the Environment (CAICE) will tackle the grand challenge of elucidating the chemical complexity and reactivity of atmospheric aerosol particles. The primary objective of CAICE is to better understand how chemical heterogeneity, morphology, phase, and molecular composition, at the individual aerosol particle level, control the properties and reactivity of atmospheric aerosols. Detailed chemical knowledge is needed to predict how aerosol chemistry influences reactivity, light absorption and scattering behavior, and cloud droplet and ice crystal formation. A globally important type of aerosol, sea spray, has tremendous chemical variability that depends on ocean chemistry, biology, and physical conditions such as waves, wind, and solar radiation.  CAICE utilizes a unique experimental ocean-atmosphere facility to bring the real-world, complex chemistry of the ocean and atmosphere directly into the laboratory to replicate natural sea spray aerosol transformations in a controlled setting. An interdisciplinary team composed of chemists from all fields, as well as marine biologists, and oceanographic and atmospheric scientists will provide diverse perspectives and approaches to gain fundamental chemical insights into how aerosols form and subsequently behave in the atmosphere. New experimental tools for spatially-resolved chemical analysis along with new theoretical methodologies for molecular-level and coarse-grained simulations will be developed to explore the complex, heterogeneous, and dynamic aspects of aerosol particles bridging a broad range of length and time scales. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CAICE will advance a wide range of scientific disciplines, including interfacial chemistry, air quality and atmospheric chemistry, nucleation, climate science, multiphase and heterogeneous reaction processes, nanoparticle properties, and ocean biogeochemistry. The important societal benefits include: 1) improved ability to predict regional climate, atmospheric chemistry, and water resources via advanced models that incorporate aerosol impacts on clouds and precipitation processes, and 2) the interdisciplinary training and education of the next generation of scientific leaders who will develop solutions for large scale environmental systems. CAICE students will be at the forefront of fundamental chemistry while addressing global perspectives related to the ocean, atmosphere, and climate. All CAICE participants will receive training in effectively conveying their scientific findings to the public, entrepreneurship, and play active roles in the Center's education and outreach programs. The research will be communicated to the public in close collaboration with the UC San Diego's Birch Aquarium and other public venues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Center for Aerosol Impacts on Climate and the Environment is funded as part of the Centers for Chemical Innovation (CCI) program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Current and future climate depend on chemistry in many profound ways. Chemical processes alter the concentration, lifetime, and properties of atmospheric gases and aerosol particles, which in turm determine their net impact on climate and air pollution. Human activities have significantly altered Earth?s climate through the addition of greenhouse gases (GHGs) that display net warming of the atmosphere, whereas aerosol particles can either warm or cool the atmosphere depending on their chemistry via the direct absorption and scattering of incoming solar radiation and the alteration of cloud microphysical properties.  Despite significant advances in atmospheric chemistry research over the past several decades, there is still considerable uncertainty that stems from an incomplete understanding of aerosol chemistry, and more specifically:  the chemistry and physics of complex environmental interfaces, detailed reaction mechanisms, kinetic rates, and product yields for heterogeneous and multi-phase reactions, the dependence of water uptake and ice nucleation on the chemical composition, physical phase state, and morphology of individual aerosol particles.   The NSF Center for Aerosol Impacts on the Chemistry of the Environment (CAICE) was established to develop a fundamental understanding of complex chemical processes at a level of detail that can be used to improve our overall understanding of aerosol impacts on climate and our environment.  The scientific focus of CAICE is on aerosol particles derived from oceanic sources, which dominate the natural aerosol burden in marine environments and contribute significantly to global aerosol concentrations. Insights into the physical and biological factors controlling the chemistry of nascent sea-spray aerosol (SSA) have remained elusive due to interferences from other sources in real world marine environments. We successfully transferred the chemical complexity of the ocean/atmosphere system into the lab, enabling control studies which are providing unprecedented insights into the molecular composition and physical properties of SSA.  The symbolic cornerstone of CAICE is the atmosphere-ocean interaction facility at UC San Diego that has led to the:  creation of the first indoor phytoplankton bloom within a wave channel for the production of nascent SSA over multiple microbial loops, discovery of unexplored bioorganic species and reaction pathways present in nascent SSA, the complex interplay between anionic surfactants and metal cations that dictates interfacial composition, and surfactants that can enhance and even participate in reactions, and a new framework for distilling the chemical complexity of nascent SSA and the reactions and phase transitions that occur into general, yet representative models that can be used to create molecular mechanisms from which predictions can be made.   We are now uniquely positioned to address grand challenges in chemistry-climate interactions that are bridging the existing gaps between molecular level theory, laboratory experiments, field observations, and climate models.  Many CAICE products are already advancing the representation of SSA in climate models, while the tools and fundamental understanding that CAICE has achieved are generating novel innovations that are of use in the chemistry community. These innovations span both new theoretical tools for describing rare events such as nucleation, as well as novel experimental approaches for characterizing the chemical composition of soft materials at the nanoscale.  The education and outreach program disseminate CAICE research and fundamental chemistry in both formal and informal educational environments.  CAICE has created many innovative tools including the Automated Ice Spectrometer, Aerosol Impact Spectrometer, Mobile Quadrupole Ion Trap, and Marine Aerosol Reference tank (MART) and MiniMART.  CAICE also developed scientific devices to be used as education and outreach tools, such as the Collaborative Learning in Environmental and Aerosol Research (CLEAR CAICE) particle counters, and cellphones app-integrated devices such as a brown carbon sensor, pH meter, 3-color spectrometer, and 2-channel sun photometer.  Our CLEAR CAICE program has engaged  &gt;530 high school students in Iowa and San Diego since 2015, with evaluation surveys indicating the program increased their understanding of research methodology (by 16%). CAICE also developed a chemistry and climate kit for outreach at K-12 schools and public events; this kit has been used in over 95 events across the country. Our formal education efforts have focused on mentoring the next generation of chemists by training them to tackle complex environmental problems.
