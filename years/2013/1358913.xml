<AbstractNarration>The underrepresentation of minorities in STEM fields is one of the major challenges facing the United States workforce. Recognizing this problem, the "New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics" Decadal Survey, published by the National Academies, noted that a promising way to address this problem is to encourage strategic partnerships between minority-serving institutions and research universities, national centers, and national laboratories. This award will continue support for one such partnership: a multi-faceted collaboration between South Carolina State University (SCSU), a Historically Black College and University (HBCU) with a 94% African-American student body, together with Clemson University (CU) and other individual investigators.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The mission of the partnership is to increase diversity in astronomy by (1) strengthening the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities into graduate programs in astronomy in general and into CU in particular, (2) providing a strong mentoring program that includes enhancing students? research skills, and (3) boosting faculty involvement in astronomy research at SCSU. By the end of this program, it is expected that a long-term partnership between SCSU, CU, and others will be formed, which will provide a sustainable pipeline for minority students in astronomy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A Partnership in Observational and Computational Astronomy II (POCA II) was a highly successful project that brought together the faculty, students and resources of a four-year HBCU, South Carolina State University (SCSU), and a Ph.D. granting research institution, Clemson University (CU), to complete the establishment of a long-term partnership between the physics and astronomy programs at the two institutions that was originally begun under a previous NSF award.  During the period of the project, 2014-2018, the two programs engaged in a variety of activities including publishing of research by faculty as well as undergraduate and graduate students, improvement of the teaching skills of graduate students at CU, development of new research projects for the faculty at SCSU, shared coursework through distance learning and hosting of a number of educational and public outreach (EPO) programs at both institutions.              The most important and lasting outcome from this award was the signing of a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) between the two schools that establishes a unique career path for physics majors.  This program will allow students at SCSU to obtain a B.S. and M.S. degree in physics in only five years.  This 3+2 program is unlike traditional 3+2 programs in that it leads to a B.S. in physics from SCSU and a M.S. in physics from CU.  The student spends their first 3 years on the campus at SCSU, and then transfers to CU for their senior year.  The courses they take in their 4th year transfer back to SCSU, so that the B.S. degree is awarded by SCSU.  During their 4th year they will also take several courses that count toward their M.S. degree at CU.  By the end of the 5th year the student will have earned their master's degree from the physics program at CU. This MOA will expand opportunities for students at SCSU as well as serve as a recruiting incentive for high-achieving high school graduates.  The program will help CU recruit students for their graduate program, and since most students at SCSU are Underrepresented Minority (URM) students, this will increase the level of diversity in the CU program.              Astrophysical research was conducted at both schools.  SCSU concentrated on the poorly understood Semiregular variable stars as an extension of previous work from ground and space-based telescopes.  The SCSU work included published results using high precision data from the space-based Kepler Observatory. The faculty and students at CU supported by POCA II published work on the enigmatic AeBe stars, which have gaseous disks around young stars with material from the disk infalling on the star. Understanding the accretion of young stars remains among the most pressing problems in astrophysics.  As an example of the partnership developed under POCA II, the SCSU faculty was trained by CU graduate students for future participation in the study of AeBe stars.              EPO at the two schools during the project period included scores of activities that impacted thousands of K-16 students, teachers and the general public. A wide variety of activities were supported by POCA II including public talks, planetarium shows, observing sessions, teacher training and hands-on activities related to astronomy.  The most significant EPO event was the solar eclipse of August 21, 2017.  Coincidentally, the path of totality passed through the campuses of SCSU and CU.   In addition to large, stadium-type events on each campus, the two physics departments were part of a special project known as the Citizen CATE Experiment.  This involved 68 telescope sites of identical equipment set up from Oregon to South Carolina, to provide continuous coverage of the approximately 90 minutes it took for the shadow to cross the country.   SCSU was one of the original schools funded under the CATE project and was in charge of the sites in the state of South Carolina.  SCSU invited their POCA II colleagues at CU to host one of the 7 sites in the state.  Both CU and SCSU had clear skies and acquired data at their sites that contributed to the larger, national database of CATE observations.              The MOA between SCSU and CU along with the overlapping interests in physics and astronomy will ensure the success of POCA II long after the end of the award period.
