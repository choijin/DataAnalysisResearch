<AbstractNarration>Linking measurements of soil-derived volatile organic compounds to atmospheric emissions models&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Forests represent the primary source of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) globally, and VOCs significantly impact ecological and atmospheric processes, including the production of ozone. Most of what is known about VOC production in forests comes from studies of live foliage. However, recent work indicates that roots and soil microbes can be considerable sources of VOCs, with implications for models of atmospheric chemistry and ecosystem carbon budgets. In this project, soil and canopy VOC fluxes will be quantified in situ in forests dominated by different tree species. The physiological mechanisms and primary biogeochemical drivers responsible for VOC emissions from roots and soil microbes will be determined, leading to the development of mechanistic emission models that predict VOC effects on atmospheric composition and air quality. The results from this project will contribute a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of biological and physical controls over VOC emissions from the molecular-to-ecosystem-to-atmospheric scales. Results will be used to improve models of global VOC emissions and atmospheric chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Training objectives include the integration of molecular, biogeochemical, and mathematical modeling techniques to explore a pressing ecological issue with implications for local and global air quality.  Broader impacts include unique collaborative opportunities for research across diverse disciplines and between international institutions. Outreach activities include training and mentoring a number of underrepresented undergraduates through the Science, Technology, and Research Scholars (STARS) program, developing a research-related curriculum for a free science workshop series, and providing annual reports to both land managers and the general public.</AbstractNarration>
