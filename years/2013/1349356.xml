<AbstractNarration>The Frost Entomological Museum is an active research institution within the Department of Entomology at Penn State's flagship campus in University Park. The Museum houses a large collection of arthropods, estimated at almost 2 million specimens, and a public exhibition and educational space that receives &gt;1,000 visitors per year. This project will unify the storage system onto a single standard, and move specimens to storage cabinets that are more protective - that is, built using archival materials and properly sealed from environmental elements and museum pests. Specimens will be imaged and their collected event data entered into a publically-accessible digital database. There will also be substantial training and outreach components aimed at raising awareness of the importance of insects. Individuals from a broad array of backgrounds - grade school students, undergrads, grad students, and non-expert adults - will be educated in museum practices and the importance of natural history collections. Outreach activities include 'Bug Camp' for kids aged 8-14, meet-the-curator events at the museum, graduate student training, summer internships for undergraduates, public exhibits at the museum, and the 'Great Insect Fair'.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The museum's holdings include one of the largest, most diverse collections of sucking lice (Anoplura, which includes the medically important lice) in the world, alongside renown collections of aphids (Hemiptera: Aphididae, including economically important pests), dragonflies and damselflies (Odonata), substantial collections of parasitic wasps (Hymenoptera, which includes species used to control pestiferous insects), native pollinators (including bees and butterflies), and Pennsylvania insects. Despite their extensive use in research and substantial investment in this resource by the University, the collection suffers from poor storage conditions, evident from an abundance of inadequate specimen cases, and the absence of a modern, accessible database. The activities proposed in this project are designed to remedy these problems by: replacing all specimen cabinets with a purpose-built archival system, increasing storage space, reorganizing the slide-mounted and ethanol-preserved specimens into appropriate storage, and setting up a Web-accessible specimen database. The data will be further disseminated through InvertNet and iDigBio. The database avails Frost Museum data for public data mining and fundamental research in areas such as epidemiology, invasive species biology, global climate change, pollinator declines, and the evolutionary history of insect lineages.

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Frost Entomological Museum was established at The Pennsylvania State University in 1968 as a way to aggregate the myriad insect reference collections across campus into a single resource that could be used for research, education, and outreach. Since that time the collection has grown substantially, through the collection of new specimens (especially the large, diverse collection of sucking lice (Anoplura)) and through the acquisition of donated collections (including a substantial collection of dragonflies and damselflies, The George and Alice Beatty collection, and a large donation of butterflies from George Patterson). This growth, which filled all available collection space, combined with antiquated storage, left the collection in a perilous state. The collection also completely lacked digital access, and there was no full accounting of the specimens contained therein. This award was designed to address those threats to the longterm health of the collection, by providing the means to acquire new storage, to add additional storage, and to initiate the digitization process.</p> <p>The <strong>intellectual merit</strong>s of this project fall into three broad categories or goals: (1) preserving unique specimens for perpetuity, in a state that maximizes their research potential; (2) making the collection data broadly available; (3) using our experiences to improve collection practices, to refine digitization and conservation workflows, and to facilitate the development of efficient databasing interfaces in collection management software. The award allowed for a near total replacement of storage into archival unit trays, drawers, and well-sealed cabinets. More than 95% of the collection has been rehoused in a way that stabilizes and secures specimen storage. The entire Anoplura collection (&gt;15,000 slides and &gt;1,000 vials; one of the three largest in the world) has been imaged and cataloged. A substantial majority of the Beatty Odonata collection (~65,000 specimens) has likewise been photographed, and nearly half have had their labels transcribed into digital data. Close to 10,000 flower-visiting insects ("pollinators") have also been photographed and queued for transcription. The data associated with these specimens - where they were collected, when, how, and by whom - are available broadly for research for the first time. The dragonfly data have already contributed to niche-modeling analyses presented at national and international meetings. With respect to goal 3, the research team experimented extensively with different digitization approaches, different georeferencing workflows, and different, custom-made storage options. The results of these experiments were published on the Frost Museum Curators' blog and made available as Frost Museum Standard Operating Procedure (SOPs) documents, so that other collections can learn from these experiences.</p> <p>The <strong>broader impacts</strong> of this project are diverse and affect individuals from across a spectrum of experiences and backgrounds, from kids to adults, professional entomologists to non-experts, students and retirees. The specimens in the Frost Entomological Museum are now available for research in a broader and much more accessible way, and the research team has been engaging the natural history collections community regarding best practices and improvements to workflows. The collection space, which was reorganized during cabinet installation, now facilitates broader engagement with groups. During the life of the grant, the Museum team hosted students from at least eight different courses at Penn State, engaging the students on issues such as collections ethics, specimen preparation, biodiversity informatics (how we manage and share specimen data), and the history and broader relevance of natural history collections. The Museum also hosted four undergraduate interns and several other postgraduates, who were engaged in collection improvement miniprojects and digitization. At least three of these students are now pursuing graduate wok in collections-based research.</p> <p>The increased exposure of the Museum and engagement with its collections has established positive, forward momentum with the higher-level administration at Penn State, and the impacts of this CSBR grant will continue to be felt for generations.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 09/28/2017<br>      Modified by: Andrew&nbsp;R&nbsp;Deans</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1349356/1349356_10313789_1506629302845_pollinator--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1349356/1349356_10313789_1506629302845_pollinator--rgov-800width.jpg" title="wasp with labels and data ready for imaging"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1349356/1349356_10313789_1506629302845_pollinator--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="wasp with labels and data ready for imaging"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A hornet specimen readied for imaging and digitization.
