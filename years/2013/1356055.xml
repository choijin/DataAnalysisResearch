<AbstractNarration>The Latin American Conference on Probability and Mathematical Statistics (CLAPEM, by its initials in Spanish) is the main event in probability and statistics in the region, having been held roughly every two to three years for almost 30 years. The series of CLAPEMs has greatly contributed to the development of probability and statistics in Latin America, and the NSF has provided support for the conference during the last 15 years.  Accordingly, this award will provide travel support for four senior and at least eight junior U.S.-based researchers who will be participating in the XIII CLAPEM, to be held in Cartagena, Colombia, from September 22nd to September 26th, 2014. The event includes a diverse and high-quality scientific program with short courses (Theory of Statistical Learning, Mathematical Genetics and Bioinformatics, and Quantitative Risk Management), plenary talks (High Dimensional Data Analysis, Stochastic Processes, and Quantum Information Theory), special thematic sessions (Functional Data, Particle Systems, Sampling Methods and Random Segmentation Models, among others), and contributed oral and poster presentations.  The participants include researchers from all over Latin America, Europe and the United States, providing an excellent forum for the development of collaborations and for the recruitment of highly qualified foreign students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Science Foundation (NSF) has long recognized the importance to the United States of the participation of U.S.-based researchers in international scientific events.  In particular, NSF has long supported the participation of U.S.-based researchers in the Latin American Conference on Probability and Mathematical Statistics (CLAPEM, by its initials in Spanish).  This award will support the participation of both junior and senior researchers working at U.S. institution in the upcoming XIII CLAPEM, which is to be held in Cartagena, Colombia, from September 22nd to September 26th, 2014.  The participation of these researchers in the XIII CLAPEM will have a positive impact in the region (by increasing the quality of the conference's scientific program and facilitating collaborations between U.S.-based and Latin American researchers) and in the U.S. (by maintaining our country's international leadership in research on probability and statistics and helping to attract the best and brightest young Latin American minds to graduate programs in the U.S.).

The following senior researchers were supported with $1,750 each:  Liu, Regina Y. Rotnitzky, Andrea Gloria   The following junior researchers were supported with $1,500 each:  Diaz, Daniel A. Bansal, Prateek  Bourguin, Solesne Chattopadhyay, Bhargab Diaz, Daniel A.  Regueiro Martinez, PedroTorres-Saavedra, Pedro A.   The registration fee for all the participants mentioned above was waved by the organizers and the NSF funds mentioned above were used exclusively to cover trasportation, lodging and meal costs.  The XIII edition of the CLAPEM was structured around a high-quality scientific program that included world-class experts in probability theory, stochastic processes, mathematical statistics and machine learning, among other subdisciplines.  The participation of U.S.-based researchers in it was a strategic decision that contributed to maintaining our countryÆs international leadership in research on probability and statistics and, because of the impact on these disciplines in other areas, in science and technology. Additionally, supporting the participation of U.S.-based researchers at the XIII CLAPEM has contributed to attract the best and brightest young Latin American minds to graduate programs in the U.S., which is key in helping maintain and improve the competitiveness of our country. Furthermore, participation of junior U.S.-based researchers in the CLAPEM helped them build their own network of international collaborations, which is an increasingly important goal in a continuusly globalizing world. Finally, because of the characteristics of the conference, the funding will make a small contribution to promoting diversity in the U.S. SSTEM workforce.  In addition to funding the researchers mentioned above to participate in the XIII CLAPEM, the award funded two graduate students at the University of California, Santa Cruz to participate in domestic scientific conferences.  In particular:  Sisi Song was funded to give an oral presentation at the 2015 International Conference on Unmanned Aircraft Systems held in Denver, CO. Pedro Regueiro was funded to give a poster presentation at the 2015 Workshop on Nonparametric Bayesian Methods held in Raleigh, NC.
