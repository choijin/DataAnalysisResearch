<AbstractNarration>This award explores the premise that the recently developed theory of the Network Fundamental Diagram (NFD) can be extended to account for the main effects that transit systems' operational characteristics (such as bus frequency, number of stops, number of routes) have on macroscopic network performance measures (such as, network capacity, mean travel time and probability of gridlock) and for the effects of network performance on transit operations. To accomplish this, the research approach will be to combine NFD theory with traffic flow theory of moving bottlenecks to produce the proposed NFD-transit theory and evaluate its results using both empirical data and a microscopic simulation model especially developed for this project. The empirical data will come from the metro Atlanta region and includes traffic data from loop detectors at signalized intersections and transit data from buses' GPS devices and ridership surveys.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, this award will improve our understanding of the cause-and-effect mechanisms between transit systems and transportation network performance. The research could be potentially transformative since traditional travel forecasting models cannot address this problem satisfactorily because of their reliance on travelers' origins and destinations. The proposed method is macroscopic and therefore does not require microscopic travel patterns. Although it is expected that the real-world data will deviate from the assumptions of the theory, valuable insights will be obtained by carefully studying how these deviations affect predictions and how this theory can be improved. The project will develop urban congestion reduction strategies that consider both public and private transportation alternatives. The results will be beneficial to the population of large urban areas, especially to underrepresented groups who often live in transit-dependent areas. The main findings will be disseminated through graduate-level courses, simulation and analysis tools made available online and through two workshops for planning agencies.</AbstractNarration>

Our research approach combined MFD theory with the traffic flow theory of moving bottlenecks to produce the proposed MFD-transit theory, and evaluate its results using microscopic simulation model specially developed for this project.  Intellectual Merit.  This research project advanced knowledge and understanding in multimodal urban mobility by developing parsimonious analytical models, which require only a few dimension-less parameters and do not have to be re-calibrated for di?erent corridors or networks. The main results are summarized below:  1. A stochastic approximation method for the network MFD. We showed that the MFD of urban networks depends mainly on two dimensionless parameters: the mean block length to green ratio and the mean red to green ratio. This means that the complexity of urban networks can be approximated e?ciently with simple models.  2. Invariant transformation. This work also introduced a linear transformation of the vehicle density that turns most traffic flow problems parameter-free. This means that one may solve any tra?c problem using an arbitrary fundamental diagram to obtain the solution.  3. The network MFD is symmetric. The probability distribution of the MFD in free-flow conditions is identical to the one in congestion.    4. A stochastic approximation method for the e?ect of buses in the MFD. It was shown using micro simulation that the stochastic approximation method described above can be extended to account for the e?ects of buses.  5. The e?ect of buses. In the worst-case scenario were buses travel on all the network streets, which are all single lane, if the headways between buses is larger than two minutes then there are no significant impacts on network capacity. If the headway is less than two minutes, network capacity can be reduced by as much as 13 to 22% compared to the "no bus" case, depending on the values of the mean red to green ratio and the mean block length to green ratio. These results indicate that for typical urban areas (where buses tend to travel on a small proportion of multilane streets in with headways larger than two minutes) there is an ample margin to include buses without any significant impact on network capacity.  6. Design insights. Our results also suggests that a practical solution to gridlock due to short blocks is reducing cycle times, as this would increase the mean block length to green ratio while keeping the mean red to green ratio approximately constant. We can also say that designing cities with square blocks of constant length, and-or using a constant split ratio on main arterials should be beneficial since in these cases the system variance would decrease.  Broader Impacts  This project can have a significant impact on urban transportation planning. Understanding the cause and e?ect mechanisms of bus operations (and other types of tra?c disruptions) on capacity can help to develop more accurate tra?c models. Also, the application of these models is simple as it only requires a few parameters. This can lead to better informed decisions to alleviate congestion on multimodal tra?c. It is a robust alternative to traditional travel forecasting models, which cannot address the problem satisfactorily because of their reliance on travelersÃ† origins and destinations. The proposed method is macroscopic and therefore does not require microscopic travel patterns.  ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
