<AbstractNarration>Antarctic coastal polynas are, at the same time, sea-ice free sites and sea-ice factories. They are open water surface locations where water mass transformation and densification occurs, and where direct atmospheric exchanges with the deep ocean circulation are established. Various models of the formation and persistence of these productive and diverse ocean ecosystems are hampered by the relative lack of in situ meteorological and physical oceanographic observations. This is especially so during the inhospitable conditions of their formation and activity during autumn to winter transition and the polar night. The Western Ross Sea, downstream from two of the largest coastal Antarctic polynyas, happens to be a region where there continues to be net sea-ice production, as indicated by satellite measurements of areal extent, duration and concentration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Characterization of the lower atmosphere properties, air-sea surface heat fluxes and corresponding ocean depth profiles of the Terra Nova Bay (TNB) polynya, is sought for a more detailed understanding of the role of polynyas in the production of latent-heat type sea ice and the formation, through sea ice brine rejection, of dense ocean bottom waters. This observational program will simultaneously identify mechanisms responsible for water mass modification within TNB and document aspects of dense shelf water formation within a large Antarctic polynya system. This study will characterize the water masses within a polyna over the course of an annual cycle using moorings yielding in-situ column and near-surface oceanic observation.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  Coastal Antarctic seas, such as Terra Nova Bay (TNB) in the Ross Sea, are covered by ice throughout the winter.  However, strong winds, called katabatic winds, come across the land and push this ice offshore and open up the ocean to the atmosphere.  These open water regions are called polynyas and considered "ice factories" since the extremely cold air from the katabatic winds blowing over the near-freezing ocean generates sea ice.  When the ocean freezes, the ice rejects the salt of the ocean and leaves below very salty cold, and therefore, very dense ocean water.  This very cold dense ocean water formed in polynyas in the Antarctic is called high salinity shelf water (HSSW). The sea ice formed in the polynya is continually blown away from the shore by the katabatic wind.  When katabatic wind stops, the polynya freezes over and is considered closed.  This cycle will repeat throughout the winter.  HSSW is important because it sinks and eventually forms the Antarctic Bottom Water that drives our world's ocean circulation.  We use ocean measurements, weather stations and satellites to collect data to describe how HSSW is formed.  The satellite data shows the history of the opening and closing of the TNB polynya, which occurs approximately every ten days.  Our analysis shows that the polynya opens 3 days after the katabatic winds begin to blow and the average HSSW is formed two days after the polynya opens.  In the fall season in the Southern Hemisphere (March through May), we find HSSW is more strongly linked with the wind production because it takes less energy for the wind to open the polynya because the ice is thinner in the Fall.  In the winter season (June through October), HSSW is more closely linked with the polynya opening because it takes more time for the katabatic wind to open the polynya and become an ice factory that is more active.  We were successful in modeling the HSSW production using computer simulations.  These simulations confirm that the polynya opening is the most important part of HSSW production. Our work suggests there is a more complex relationship between the amount of salt produced, when the polynya opens, and when the katabatic wind begins than previously suggested.  Future studies of HSSW in Terra Nova Bay will include meltwater from ice shelves next to the coastal polynyas.  This meltwater impacts the formation of HSSW in TNB, can influence the salinity (saltiness) of HSSW, and impact other polynyas around Antarctica.     Broader Impact:   To support this project, we have developed an international group named "Land-Ice/Ocean Network Exploration with Semiautonomous Systems (LIONESS): A science-based collaborative framework for new initiatives in the Western Ross Sea."  The international partners are led by Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University (LDEO) and include the Korea Polar Research Institute (KOPRI), National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research/New Zealand Antarctic Research Institute (NIWA/NZARI), the Universita di Napoli "Parthenope"/Programma Nazionale di Ricerche in Antartide (PNRA), the University of California-Davis, the University of Waterloo, The University of Texas Institute for Geophysics, and the US-NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory. This project brought together skills around physical/chemical oceanography, lithosphere-ice, ice-ocean and air-sea interactions, glacial geophysics, ice dynamics, hydroacoustics, marine biodiversity and ecology, autonomous robotics, and airborne remote sensing.  Additionally, we have continued to collaborate with the concurrent NSF funded program "Polynyas, Ice Production &amp; Seasonal Evolution in the Ross Sea" (PIPERS).  The partnership is focused on the investigation of the relationship of our results from TNB Polynya to the larger-scale Ross Sea ice conditions, being investigated by PIPERS.  A collaboration with the Universita di Napoli "Parthenope" has continued to grow for over a decade.  During this project, principal investigator Zappa was invited to the Universita di Napoli "Parthenope" as a Visiting Professor in 2015 and returned as a Fulbright Scholar in residence in 2018.   We have expanded our capabilities to run the operational NOAA ocean wave computer model (WaveWatch III) after attending the NCEP/NOAA Wave Summer Workshop. Zappa has incorporated focused teaching modules on polynya and global ocean polar science problems into his Air-Sea Interaction course material at Columbia University, Department of Earth and Environmental Science. Two Columbia University graduate students have actively participated in the ocean mooring deployment and recovery cruises aboard the Korean icebreaker RVIB Araon, as well as the data analysis.  We participated in the Lamont Open House.  Zappa separately prepared a Teaching Module for the Earth2Class program (https://earth2class.org/site/?p=14454) in collaboration with Michael Passow.   This research project titled "Oceanic Response to a Coastal Polynya, Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica" has resulted in 3 peer-reviewed publications to date.
