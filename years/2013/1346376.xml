<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to create an innovative educational game that engages secondary school students in learning about the science of anaerobic digestion and the business of biogas production. The Simulated Anaerobic Digester Learning Tool is a casual, simulation-based game that teaches students about the physicochemical operation of an anaerobic digester, as well as an entrepreneurial game that teaches about the new economic model of the 'triple bottom line' of sustainable business practice of balancing the concerns of people, the planet, and profit. This innovative game experience meets the growing need for real-world interdisciplinary Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) problems as a motivational and driving force for education. There are no existing accurate anaerobic digestion simulators that are accessible to secondary school students. Currently existing models of anaerobic digestion, such as Anaerobic Digestion Model No. 1 (ADM1), are used by researchers at universities, and involve computational and mathematical complexity beyond the grasp of secondary school students. Phase I of the project involves simplifying the complexity of the model while retaining its accuracy in the creation of an engaging game for secondary school students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of The Simulated Anaerobic Digester Learning Tool are:  1)  The Learning Tool is aligned with current reforms in science education.  The new Next Generation Science Standards, based on the National Research Council's Framework for K-12 Science Education necessitate the increased use of real-world topics that can be made comprehensible only by drawing on ideas and methods from many scientific disciplines. Biogas generation through anaerobic digestion is complex and interdisciplinary in a real world context and thus is an excellent vehicle for STEM learning.  2)  The game incorporates research into gender inclusiveness and exploration of social and ethical issues, and its development will include traditionally underrepresented students. Beta-testing will take place in high school classrooms of a high-needs rural school district and a high-need urban school district with an 86% minority population and a 49% graduation rate, in which 88.4% of students qualify for free- or reduced-price lunches.  3) Commercially, the game has tremendous potential to be marketed in a variety of science courses in both secondary and post-secondary education, including Biology and Environmental Science as well as interdisciplinary courses in Integrated STEM, Sustainability, and Agriculture.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this research was to create innovative educational learning tools that engage secondary students in learning about the science of anaerobic digestion, which is the process of converting biodegradable waste products into a form of renewable energy called biogas, as well as the business of biogas production.  In order to accomplish this goal, an anaerobic digestion (AD) learning simulator, physical trading card game (as well as the framework for a digital card game) and supporting course materials were developed.  The AD Learning Simulator  The AD Learning Simulator is an interactive simulation learning tool that is designed to introduce students to the science of AD in an entertaining, active-learning experience that reinforces concepts related to Science, Technology, Engineering and Technology (STEM). This tool simulates the impact of different organic feedstocks on the anaerobic digestion (AD) process performance by taking the user through the selection of feedstocks for a digester along with several variables including temperature and the type of generator used to convert biogas into electricity. Students can run labs using the digester in order to experiment with different configurations and it is possible to save the results of up to 3 different runs for side-by-side comparison.  The AD Simulator has been tested with teachers and students in 10 different classrooms, in rural and suburban districts, in both advanced placement (AP) Biology and AP Environmental Science, as well as Honors biology and a mandatory New York State (NYS) freshman Biology/Environmental Science course called "Living Environment". Using written assessments and surveys, the results have consistently shown that all participants significantly increased anaerobic digestion content-knowledge after using the simulator.  In parallel, we have continued working on the development of a continuous anaerobic digestion simulator model (SIMAD) that is targeted to college and graduate students as well as industry professionals primarily involved in the fields of waste management, energy, and environmental conservation. The SIMAD will resemble the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems used in commercial AD plants for real-time monitoring and control of their processes.  Physical Card Game M.E.T.H.A.N.E.  While the AD simulator examines the science and processes of the internal workings of the digester, the card game gives a big-picture view of the social, environmental, and economic context. The card game emphasizes the broader aspects of anaerobic digestion in terms of how a business runs, the "triple bottom line" of sustainable economics (people, planet, and profit), and the reinforcement of anaerobic digestion terminology.  Additionally, a physical card game provides the ability to play without computers, and gives learners a tangible good that they own and can customize and trade, facilitating learning even outside of the classroom.  The physical card game is currently being tested in a variety of venues by college students and through playtests open to the public.      Digital Card Game Framework  A digital card game framework was created with the goal of converting the physical card game into a digital version that allows students in a classroom to play online against students in other schools.  The current framework has hooks for networking, a simple artificial intelligence (AI) player that operates based on rule priorities, and it is a data-driven framework that allows for the expansion and change of cards over the lifetime of the game.  AD Learning Tool Learning Modules  Initially, we had proposed to develop learning modules tied to each of the six unifying themes of the College Board Advanced Placement Environmental Science course.  One of the complexities of interdisciplinary experiential learning is that the learning objectives are not as explicit as they might be in a textbook with chapter headings and unit exams.
