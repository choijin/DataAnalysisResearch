<AbstractNarration>Ice shelf mass balance is controlled by net surface accretion (precipitation minus ablation and surface melt terms), calving and basal melt along the underside of the ice shelf cavity, which is in contact with a warming ocean. Estimating the rate of basal melt is the most challenging term in this balance because it is difficult to directly observe, but is also sensitive to changes in ocean temperature and other ocean-atmospheric processes such as the sea ice cycle.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will join the Ocean2ice program,  a UK led effort to integrate state of the art instrumentation, chemical analysis and modeling with the goal of improving the dynamical representation of ice shelf mas balance processes in Antarctic circulation models. In the Amundsen Sea, the shoaling warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) and surficial glacial meltwater are two important diagnostic and prognostic terms in the ice shelf mass balance. By measuring the distribution of these water masses, using a suite of  their distinct inert gas tracers ? 3He, 4He, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe -  together with their change over time, estimates of basal melt rates of some of the large West Antarctic ice shelves (e.g. Pine Island Glacier) are to be made. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Greenland and the West Antarctic Ice Sheets together represent potentially more than a 10 m of increase in mean (global) sea surface height.  How fast glacial mobilization rates may increase is of considerable societal importance.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Warmer water from further north flows into the Amundsen Sea and upwells onto the continental shelf.  Eventually, this warmer seawater penetrates beneath the floating ice shelves, which extend off the Antarctic continent and into the ocean.  These ice shelves provide a restraint or bottleneck on the flow of land ice into the ocean.  Consequently, this project sought to better understand what influences the stability of these ice shelves and the ice stream that is found landward of the ice shelf.  We measured and interpreted naturally-occuring noble gases, which can be used to identify glacier ice that has melted in the ocean.  We wanted to know the amount and distribution of glacier ice that is melting into the ocean, and want to understand how the meltwater is transported, once it becomes incoroporated into seawater.     We unearthed evidence of a volcanic heat source that appears to originate upstream of Pine Island Ice Shelf. This was a somewhat unexpected outcome, but it is also supported by previous research that identified at least two subglacial volcanos, buried beneath the Pine Island Ice Stream.  When we estimated the total heat that appears to contact the bottom of the glacier, we determined it to be 2500 Megawatts, with an uncertainty of 68%.  This large uncertainty reveals the difficulty we have in determining how the heat is delivered to the glacier, but does not diminish the overall conclusion that a volcanic heat source may be contributing to melt beneath the glacier.  However, we further demonstrated that this 2500 MW is less than 0.02% of the heat delivered to the ice shelf by ocean currents from the North.  In addition to the volcanic heat source, this study has revealed that a significant portion of glacier melt that forms in the Amundsen Sea, follows sea bottom contours and exits along the so-called "eastern channel" of the Amundsen Sea.  The work also distinguished between freshwater produced by rain and snow, freshwater from sea ice melt, and freshwater from glacial melt throughout the surface ocean. This study helped us to distinguish the contrasting roles of sea ice melt and glacial ice melt in the upper ocean, and how the two are acting to alter the upper ocean salinity distribution.  Finally, this award supported the analysis of 80 noble gas samples, collected in the Ross Sea during the PIPERS experiment (Chief Scientist Steve Ackley).  in late austral autumn 2017.  These data are being used to determine how sea ice influences the production of very dense water in the Ross Sea.  This water that is produced in the Ross Sea is thought to replenish water in the deep ocean and circulate along a pathway that takes nearly a millenium to complete.
