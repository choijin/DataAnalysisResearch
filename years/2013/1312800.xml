<AbstractNarration>This project is devoted to a mathematical study of some nonlinear partial differential equations in multi-dimensional conservation laws and related applications. In particular, the study focuses on the following topics from the theory of inviscid and viscous compressible flows and related applications: (a) Mixed-type PDE problems for transonic flows past an obstacle. (b) Mixed-type PDE problems for isometric embedding. (c) Existence and regularity of global solutions to the compressible multi-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations. (d) Global solutions to the viscous flows of related applications in liquid crystals. The goals of the research are: (a) To develop novel analytic methods and efficient techniques for solving some important problems in multi-dimensional inviscid and viscous conservation laws and applications. (b) To explore the qualitative behavior of flow motion. (c) To establish new connections of the isometric embedding problem with elastodynamics. (d) To gain insights into other multi-dimensional problems of conservation laws and emerging applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of this research program is to develop new methods of analysis and techniques for  studying some nonlinear partial differential equations governing the motion of compressible fluid flows and related applications.  Compressible fluids such as gases are important in nature. Their study is crucial for understanding aerodynamics, atmospheric science, astrophysics, plasma physics, biology, elastodynamics, etc. While the one-dimensional problems are rather well understood, the general theory for the multi-dimensional case is mathematically underdeveloped. The project will advance the mathematical understanding of the multi-dimensional equations of compressible flows and related problems in emerging applications, and will provide education and training to students in this important field.</AbstractNarration>

For the three-dimensional incompressible magnetohydrodynamic equations with multiplicative noise, the global existence of strong solutions in probability was established. For the three-dimensional stochastic compressible Navier-Stokes equations, the global martingale solution was constructed.   (6) The compressible flow of liquid crystals was studied with the following results: global existence of weak solution, large-time behavior, incompressible limit, and global existence of weak solution for a coupled compressible Navier-Stokes and Q-tensor system. For active hydrodynamics in biophysics, the hydrodynamics of active liquid crystals  was studied in the Beris-Edwards hydrodynamic framework with  Q-tensors, and the existence of global weak solutions in both the incompressible and compressible cases was established.   (7) The fluid-particle flows were studied, and the following results were obtained: the global well-posedness of strong solution in the three-dimensional whole space, and the existence of global weak soltuions to an initial-boundary value problem for the inhomogeneous incompressible flows coupled with the Vlasov equation in a three-dimensional bounded domain.
