<AbstractNarration>Climate-change-induced sea level rise and increases in storm intensity will affect barrier islands worldwide.  The traditional view of barrier island evolution considers only changes in environmental conditions (such as sea level rise, changes in storms) and physical processes (such as the transport of sand), and predicts that barrier islands will respond to climate change gradually.  However, recent work suggests that biological factors involving vegetation and interactions, or feedbacks, between vegetation and physical processes are also important in shaping islands and determining how they will respond to changing conditions in the future.  For example, anticipated climate-change induced shifts in the geographic ranges of dune-building grasses may increase the vulnerability of islands to storms by changing the shape and height of protective dunes.  And, just as interactions between vegetation and physical processes can build dunes (via sand trapping by dune-building grasses) they can also hinder, and even prevent, dune-building by maintaining areas of low elevation.  Such feedbacks may cause gradual changes in environmental conditions to produce rapid changes in barrier island evolution, which would make human adaptation difficult.  This project will allow us to better understand the processes that are important in determining how barrier islands will change in the future and the conditions under which the important processes and interactions will likely lead to rapid, rather than gradual changes in island behavior.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will test a hypothesis that ecomorphodynamic feedbacks have the potential to amplify the effects of climate change on barrier island evolution, causing a nonlinear response to gradual changes in forcing, i.e., tipping points at which barrier islands rapidly convert from a high-relief, stable, ecologically diverse state to a low-relief, rapidly migrating, ecologically homogenous state.  Through integrated numerical modeling and ecological experiments in the undeveloped barrier system of the Virginia Coast Reserve (VCR) LTER this project will address critical questions including: How do vegetation and physical processes interact in the formation and evolution of barrier island topography?  How do overwash events affect topographic recovery and colonization of vegetation following storms?  What is the role of ecomorphodynamic feedbacks in topographic recovery following storms? What combinations of factors lead to tipping points in the transition between high-relief and low-relief states as a result of nonlinearities in the ecomorphodynamic system? How are ecomorphodynamic feedbacks altered by climate change and what is the role of feedbacks in the transition between states?</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Barrier islands represent a dynamic landscape with shifting dunes and migrating shorelines.  These islands are common along the Atlantic coast and are important both economically and ecologically.  As climate shifts and sea level continues to rise it is important to understand how these relatively flat landscapes respond.  The focus of our project was to understand the interactions between sand movement and vegetation and possible feedbacks.  We designed a greenhouse study to examine plant response to sand burial and we used three common beach grasses:  American beach grass, beach cordgrass and sea oats.  American beach grass prefers cooler temperatures, is common in Virginia and northward, and often forms long dune ridges.  In contrast, sea oats is a warm season grass common south of Virginia and forms hummock dunes.  Beach cordgrass has a broad distribution but does not form extensive dunes.  We included mixtures of two species combination to determine if biotic interactions between species may also affect growth.     We found that American beach grass and beach cordgrass growth were both stimulated by burial, while sea oats was not affected.  American beach grass had higher rates of mortality and lower rates of growth when grown with sea oats.  This included reduced growth for both aboveground and belowground portions of American beach grass.  A number of growth characteristics for both species varied when grown together.  Interactions between the two species may alter effectiveness for trapping sand and forming dunes.  Beach cordgrass had little effect on the two primary dune building grasses, although there was a slight decrease in stem elongation rates for sea oats.     Field data from Hog Island, a Virginia barrier island, showed both American beach grass and beach cordgrass were distributed broadly across the island, whereas there was almost no sea oats present.  At higher elevations, American beach grass had greater ground cover on dunes near the ocean shoreline while beach cordgrass had higher cover on interior dunes.   At lower elevations, near the base of dunes, beach cordgrass had higher cover.     Differential growth strategies of American beach grass and sea oats, extensive runner vs. clumping of new shoots, form different dune types, ridges vs. hummocks.  Climate change scenarios predict warmer temperatures along the Atlantic coast, this may favor the northern migration of sea oats.  Our glasshouse experiments revealed when grown with sea oats, American beach grass growth was reduced.  Thus there may be future shifts in the distribution and abundance of these species that may lead to shifts in island topography from dune ridges to hummocks.     Our results contribute to an understanding of the importance of biotic processes in harsh environments and highlight potential interactions between plants and physical process associated with sand movement and accumulation.  Our data may be used to refine dune formation computer simulations to highlight potential effects on dune formation due to changes in species and growth forms.
