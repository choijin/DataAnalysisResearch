<AbstractNarration>In this project, funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Alan L. Balch and Marilyn M. Olmstead of the University of California, Davis will explore the structures and chemical reactivity of a promising group of endohedral fullerenes, cages of carbon atoms that encapsulate a variety of atoms, ions or small molecules. Work on the structural characterization of large fullerene cages and chiral fullerene cages by X-ray diffraction involves molecules that provide a bridge between smaller, nearly spherical fullerenes like the Bucky ball, C60, and carbon nanotubes.  The use of endohedral fullerenes in light harvesting and other electro-optical and electrochemical devices involves reduction and oxidation of these molecules, yet little is known about the structures and chemical reactivities of externally functionalized endohedral fullerenes and of the cations and anions formed by oxidation and reduction of these endohedral fullerenes.  The researchers intend to prepare crystalline salts of a variety of endohedral fullerenes to determine how oxidation and reduction behavior alters their structure, the location of the contents with regard to the cage, and the nature of interactions between atoms inside cages.  They have discovered several new families of fullerenes with compositions M3C106-124, M4C122-154, M3C107-125 and will explore the chemical reactivity and structures of these remarkable molecules.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will provide state of the art laboratory experiences for graduate and undergraduate students who will be learning the techniques of chemical synthesis, fullerene formation in an electric arc, chromatographic methods of fullerene separation and purification, crystal and cocrystal growth, and single crystal X-ray diffraction methods including both conventional in-house sources and synchrotron radiation. The students will also learn how to collaborate within the group and also with scientists in varied locations globally.  Once a rare chemical, the prototypical fullerene, C60, is now available in ton quantities.  Professors Balch and Olmstead anticipate a similar increase in the availability of endohedral fullerenes.  Endohedral fullerenes are versatile materials that have properties that reflect the nature of the atoms trapped inside.  Thus, gadolinium-containing endohedrals are effective contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging and have the advantage of safely trapping the toxic gadolinium atoms inside an unreactive carbon cage.  Lutetium-containing endohedrals are useful in X-ray contrast imaging.  Fullerenes are the molecules of choice in the design of new plastic solar cells, and endohedral fullerenes represent a promising new set of molecules to improve and enhance the operational characteristics of these cells.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Endohedral fullerenes are promising molecules for medical diagnostics and electro-optical applications. The determination of their geometrical structures is essential to understanding their chemical properties and electronic structures.&nbsp; The three dimensional structures of empty cage fullerenes, which are molecules involving closed cages consisting of an even number of carbon atoms, obey the isolated pentagon rule (IPR) with five hexagons surrounding each pentagon. However, the fullerenes that are not empty, called endohedral fullerenes, can utilize cage structures that do not obey the IPR. We have developed methods to crystallize fullerenes and endohedral fullerenes that allow their structures to be precisely determined through single crystal X-ray diffraction. This project has identified several new features in the structures of endohedral fullerenes. We have uncovered the first two examples of endohedral fullerenes containing a heptagon within the cage framework: LaSc<sub>2</sub>N@<em>C<sub>s</sub></em>(hept)-C<sub>80 </sub>and Sc<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>@<em>C</em><sub>s</sub>(hept)-C<sub>88</sub>. Remarkably, in these novel molecules there is no direct interaction of the metal atoms inside with the heptagon. Both of the heptagon-containing fullerene cages can be transformed into known IPR cages. Our confirmation of the presence of a heptagon in the cage structure allows us to envision the mechanism of fullerene formation. Additionally, we have studied the structure of an endohedral fullerene with three pentagons that are attached to one another, an endohedral fullerene dimer with a carbon-carbon bond connecting the two cages, and several endohedral fullerenes that have been chemically modified through addition reactions involving the outer surface. We have discovered several series of metallofullerenes that contain an odd number of carbon atoms including: Y<sub>3</sub>C<sub>105</sub>, Y<sub>4</sub>C<sub>127-147</sub>, Lu<sub>3</sub>C<sub>107-115</sub>, and Lu<sub>4</sub>C<sub>117-127</sub>. These molecules are likely to contain a unique carbon atom bound to the nearby metal atoms within the cage. We have determined that a related molecule (TiLu<sub>2</sub>C@<em>I<sub>h</sub></em>-C<sub>80</sub>) contains a single carbon atom surrounded by three metal ions within a cage of eighty carbon atoms that obeys the IPR.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Endohedral fullerenes with the stoichiometry M<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2<em>n</em></sub> may possess either the conventional, M<sub>2</sub>@C<sub>2n</sub> structure with two metal atoms inside the cage or the carbide structure, M<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>@C<sub>2<em>n</em>-2</sub>, with two metal atoms and two connected carbon atoms inside the cage. Generally, these two structural options are best distinguished through single crystal X-ray diffraction studies.

These polymers are potentially useful as optoelectronic components, as hosts for trapping, storing and sorting other molecules, and as materials capable of changing their properties in response to oxidation or reduction.

Thus, we have obtained a polymer that is capable of binding unfunctionalized fullerenes and distinguishing between C<sub>60</sub> and C<sub>70</sub>.&nbsp; We have constructed the first polymers that utilize an open-cage fullerene (a fullerene with a hole in the carbon framework) and a transition metal as the building blocks.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This project has provided state-of-the-art instruction for a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students at UC Davis.
