<AbstractNarration>The main research task addressed in this project is to construct a Data System for Structural&lt;br/&gt;Geology and Tectonics (SG&amp;T). SG&amp;T data are complex for a variety of reasons, including the&lt;br/&gt;wide range of temporal and spatial scales (many orders of magnitude each), the complex three-dimensional geometry of some geological structures, inherent spatial nature of the data, and the difficulty of making temporal inferences from spatial observations. To successfully implement the step of developing a SG&amp;T data system, the principal investigators must simultaneously solve three problems: 1) How to digitize SG&amp;T data; 2) How to design a software system that is applicable; and 3) How to construct a very flexible user interface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To address the first problem, the principal investigators introduce the "Spot" concept, which allows tracking of hierarchical and spatial relations between structures at all scales, and will link map scale, mesoscale, and laboratory scale data. A Spot, in this sense, is analogous to the beam size of analytical equipment used for in situ analysis of rocks; it is the size over which a measurement or quantity is applicable. A Spot can be a single measurement, an aggregation of individual measurements, or even establish relationships between numerous other Spots. They will implement both a Spot and a more traditional Mapping mode for data input. To implement these approaches into a software system, they will utilize a Graph database - as opposed to a Relational database - to better preserve the myriad of potentially complex relationships. A Graph design is ideally suited for the complex relations inherent in a SG&amp;T data system. Finally, they will construct a user interface that is intuitive, open source, and spans as many operating systems and devices as possible. For these reasons, they will develop a web-application that can run in both a connected (on the internet) and disconnected mode.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We have developed an application and database that we call StraboSpot, intended to be a geologic data system that allows researchers to digitally collect, store, and share both field and laboratory data.  To develop StraboSpot, we worked closely with geologists to understand how they collect data in the field.  The main idea was to make the barrier to data entry and collection as low as possible. StraboSpot organizes data into what we call Spots.  These are observations that are tied to a location on the Earth?s surface.  Spots also have an area over which they apply (centimeters to kilometers in scale). The organization of Spots is hierarchical in that one Spot can enclose multiple other Spots that themselves can encompass other Spots.  Because StraboSpot has this organization, we had to use a graph database, rather than a relational database approach, to record information.  A graph approach basically means that the observations are thought of more as a social network of information and not as a series of spreadsheets.  StraboSpot in this way preserves the relationships, however far and complicated they might be, between geologic features and measurements.  The other notable feature is that StraboSpot is designed to incorporate pictures with data collection.  In this way, the user or investigator can document fully the features they examine, and the data become more useful to a broader audience.  StraboSpot is available to download free and runs on both iOS and Android devices (phones and tablets). It can be found at the app stores for iOS and Android.  There is also the main website at https://strabospot.org that is used for storing and sharing data collected.  Anyone can register and use this website. StraboSpot is a combination of the words Spot (data collection method), and Strabo, the name of an ancient geographer who first described some of the aspects of geology and movements of the Earth?s crust.
