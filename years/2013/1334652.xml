<AbstractNarration>Resilience, and the related concept of recovery, provides insights into ecosystem function, connectivity, and succession. In the marine realm, most resilience studies have focused on shallow-water ecosystems but increasing anthropogenic impacts in the deep-sea are making studies of resilience and recovery in the deep-sea time-critical, with deep-sea hard-substrate habitats and large-scale disturbances having received the least attention. Ironically one of the key anthropogenic impacts to the seafloor, fish trawling, provides an experimental design to understand processes of recovery from large-scale disturbance. Seamounts, with a high proportion of hard-substrate habitat, discreet locations for sampling, and extensive disturbance from fish trawling, provide an excellent natural laboratory to study the recovery aspect of resilience. Additionally, the abundance, numerical dominance, high biomass, and diversity of deep-sea corals on seamounts make them ideal model organisms for these studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this project is to examine a series of locations in the far Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) and the Emperor Seamount Chain (ESC) to address the hypothesis, based on predictions of low resilience and decadal recovery times for disturbed seamounts, that deep-sea coral beds in the NWHI have not recovered despite the end of trawling 30+ years ago. To test this hypothesis, the PIs will survey a series of replicate seamounts at three levels of fish trawling intensity using autonomous and remote underwater vehicles to conduct surveys and targeted sampling of the seamount fauna and especially deep-sea corals. The PIs will focus on three specific aspects of the seamount communities: community structure, age structure of precious corals using a verified size-age curve, and genetic structure of precious corals using DNA microsatellites. Using these methods the PIs will be able to predict the time since coral colonization on any particular seamount as well as source populations of the recent colonizers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These seamounts represent a natural experiment with the added factor of time since the establishment of the exclusive economic zone, and provide an unparalleled opportunity to address seamount recovery on decadal time scales. The powerful combination of aging tools and microsatellites will allow the PIs not only to constrain time scales of deep sea coral colonization, but also rates of recruitment and source of the colonizers. The results will provide significant insights into key ecological processes on seamounts, thus serving to inform further science as well as management. This proposal will support two STEM scientists in the early stages of their careers. It will also contribute to developing a competitive STEM workforce through training of two graduate students as well as undergraduate students as  research internships. Besides the primary science, the PIs will also obtain samples and genetic data that will be made accessible to other researchers through museums and public databases, respectively.</AbstractNarration>

We also hypothesized that the initial colonization of a seamount may take decades, and that the initial colonizers would be the key source of propagules for subsequent recruitment to a given site.<strong> </strong>To test these hypotheses, we surveyed and sampled a series of replicate seamounts using an AUV and submersibles in 2014-2017.&nbsp; We focused on three specific aspects: community structure, age structure of precious corals, and population connectivity of precious corals.&nbsp;</p> <p>The seamounts of the far NWHI and ESC provided excellent test locations because they have had some of the heaviest trawl impacts in the world, from both fish and precious coral fisheries.&nbsp; Additionally, because of the coral fishery, we expected that the pre-trawling benthic community included precious corals and that they would be an important part of the recovering communities. Another advantage of this location is that the history of trawling allows for a three ?treatment? design that includes sites that have never been trawled, recovering sites that were protected from trawling with the establishment of the US EEZ in 1977, and sites that are still trawled outside the EEZ.</p> <p>The results of this study show that despite visible evidence of substantial historic fishing impacts, a subset of the seamounts that have been protected showed multiple measurable signs of recovery including corals re-growing from fragments, and higher abundances of benthic megafauna and deep-sea corals than still trawled sites. This indicates that protection of heavily trawled seamounts does allow for measurable recovery on time scales of 30-40 years.&nbsp; These findings are contrary to the expectations and previous observations of little or no recovery of seamount communities following disturbance. Further work is needed to determine if the recovering sites are returning to the same communities that were present prior to fishing.</p> <p>A second important outcome was the discovery of deep-sea scleractinian reefs. &nbsp;In the Central and Northeast Pacific, the shallow aragonite saturation horizon (ASH) and high carbonate dissolution rates fueled the hypothesis that reef formation was improbable. Despite this, live scleractinian reefs were discovered on six seamounts at depths of 535?732 m and aragonite saturation state (&Omega;arag) values of 0.71?1.33. Although the ASH becomes deeper moving northwest along the chain, the depth distribution of the reefs becomes shallower, suggesting the ASH is having little influence on their distribution.

This work included the most extensive seamount surveys that have ever been undertaken, and revealed that high levels of variability in benthic communities can occur over small spatial scales for both fishes and invertebrates. &nbsp;The most pronounced difference in all diversity, abundance and assemblage structure metrics was with depth, but there was also variation among sides of a seamount when controlling for depth.&nbsp;</p> <p>These findings are important to management of the region. &nbsp;Imaging surveys conducted on the four actively fished seamounts showed vulnerable marine ecosystem (VME) taxa (octocorals, scleractinian reefs, and sponges) were present in sufficient abundances and densities to constitute reproductively viable populations and to be acting as habitat for invertebrates and fishes (and therefore can be considered VMEs). Evidence of significant adverse impacts (SAIs) from bottom-contact fisheries was also observed including large areas with scars from bottom contact gear, the presence of lost gear, including many observations of coral rubble in or around nets, lines or floats, and the fact that coralliid octocorals, once sufficiently abundant on the seamounts to support the world?s largest precious coral fishery, were extremely rare.
