<AbstractNarration>The growth of large urban populations worldwide and the associated need to build on sites with problematic soils has increased the need for low-noise/low-energy ground improvement techniques to hinder soil settlements, increase soil strength, and prevent subsurface soil instabilities such as liquefaction. Microbial-induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) has emerged as a promising technique to improve soil sites because microorganisms capable of causing calcium carbonate precipitation are ubiquitous in earth systems, and naturally-occurring biogeochemical reactions can be augmented and engineered. However, MICP faces inherent soil type limitations and spatial variability issues, requires adequate quality control/adaptation, must satisfy required "permanency," and may pose unwanted environmental consequences. There is limited experience with upscaling successful laboratory results to field conditions, and there are high early costs inherently related to new technology.  The goal of this research is to combine emerging geophysical technologies with established soil strengthening techniques to first investigate the feasibility of MICP in the laboratory and then upscale the results in a field study case. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MICP has emerged as a promising bio-mediated soil improvement technique. Carbonate precipitation can be engineered by biostimulation, whereby selected nutrients are injected into the soil and indigenous soil microorganisms are used to catalyze carbonate precipitation throughout the sediment porous network as a direct consequence of byproducts formed during cell growth or active metabolism. The effect of cementation on soil behavior depends on the amount and type of cementing agent, grain size distribution of the soil, density, and degree of confinement at the time of cementation, i.e., the stress-cementation history.  Carbonate precipitation reduces porosity, stiffens and strengthens the soil mass, alters the response of the internal fabric to stress changes, and increases the dilative tendency upon shear. Quality control is a critical component of any soil improvement effort. The process can be quantitatively examined in real time to assess the evolution and spatial extent of the bio-treatment and to adapt/optimize it to increase its efficiency. This research will explore complementary, real-time monitoring concepts.  The non-invasive, geophysical tools selected for this study will be developed and optimized in the laboratory, and then will be scaled up to field conditions.  This research will include the following activities: (1) explore environmentally-safe, optimal deployment strategies, (2) identify conditions to minimize spatial variability and develop control techniques, (3) test complementary process-monitoring techniques (elastic shear wave velocity and electrical-spectral induced polarization using both local and tomographic test conditions and penetration CPTu in the field), and (4) scale up laboratory studies to the field.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Summary:   The growth of large urban populations worldwide and the associated need to use sites with problematic soils has increased the need for sustainable ground improvement techniques to hinder settlements, increase strength and prevent subsurface instabilities such as liquefaction. Microbial-induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) has emerged as a promising technique: microorganisms capable of causing calcium carbonate precipitation are ubiquitous in earth systems, and naturally-occurring biogeochemical reactions can be augmented and engineered. However, microbial-induced carbonate precipitation faces inherent soil type limitations, spatial variability issues, requires adequate quality control/adaptation, must satisfy required "permanency", may pose unwanted environmental consequences, there is limited experience upscaling successful lab-results to field conditions, and there are high early costs inherently related to new technology.  This project explored optimal deployment strategies and process monitoring techniques at field relevant scales.    Intellectual Merit:   Laboratory experiments tested the conditions for optimal MICP performance and confirmed the sensitivity of geophysical methods (induced polarization [IP], shear wave) on carbonate precipitation and ground improvement. Furthermore, semi-quantitative links between IP and MICP have been developed. The most exciting results came from the unprecedented field experiment at the Rifle IFRC (Rifle Integrated Field Research Challenge) site where we applied MICP in-situ. We successfully stimulated native soil micro-organisms for the formation, and subsequent precipitation, of carbonate minerals. Geochemical and microbiological monitoring confirmed the succesful MICP treatment. Field shear wave measurements confirmed the increased soil stiffness, while IP and spectral IP measurements successfully monitored the MICP progress in time and space. Subsurface images of IP parameters (phase and imaginary conductivity) appeared to correlate very well with MICP progress, while resistivity provided us with a clear image of the background geology. The interpreted IP images showed homogenous carbonate precipitation in the treatment area.    The results of this field experiment strongly suggest that:      MICP is viable, environmentally friendly, ground improvement method,      IP and SIP can be used to monitor MICP in field relevant spatial and temporal scales.      Further research is needed to verify the performance of MICP treatments over long periods of time (years, decades) and the use of the IP method as a long term monitoring tool.       Broader Impacts:   This project provided opportunities for 7 undergraduate students (3 under-represented minorities) to participate in active research, fully supported one PhD graduate student, and promoted interdisciplinary research collaborations. All undergraduate students performed independent research, addressing specific objectives of the project, under the direct supervision of the PhD graduate student and mentoring by PI Ntarlagiannis. This opportunity allowed the graduate student to develop managerial and leadership skills.   The project promoted international collaborations, with the Lancaster University (UK), for the development of a complete, and easy to use, package for electrical (IP and resistivity) data processing and inversion. The package, built around professor Biley?s inversion codes, will be available under an open source license for academic use. This opportunity allowed the funded graduate student to develop programing skills.         Last Modified: 11/14/2018       Submitted by: Dimitrios Ntarlagiannis]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
