<AbstractNarration>CBET - 1342028&lt;br/&gt;There is growing interest in the development of nanocomposites consisting of organic polymers&lt;br/&gt;and various nanomaterials. These new materials can provide unique functionalities as compared&lt;br/&gt;to unmodified polymers in terms of dielectric, magnetic, thermal, mechanical, optical, transport,&lt;br/&gt;permeation and separation properties. Although nanomaterials are considered potentially hazardous,&lt;br/&gt;they are often considered safe when encapsulated into the matrix. However, systematic research&lt;br/&gt;to confirm the abovementioned paradigm is lacking, despite the potential risks of nanomaterial&lt;br/&gt;release to human health and environment.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit :&lt;br/&gt;Current research on the stability of nanocomposites has focused primarily on short term stability&lt;br/&gt;and performance, whereas the longer term issues have not been properly addressed. This knowledge&lt;br/&gt;gap has the potential to hinder both applications and acceptance of polymers in various industries.&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, stability of both matrix and nanocomposites are of critical importance.&lt;br/&gt;It is known that the polymer matrix can undergo degradation when exposed to various environmental&lt;br/&gt;conditions during production, use and disposal. This can lead to nanofiller release, which&lt;br/&gt;can potentially cause various health and environmental problems. Therefore, it is absolutely&lt;br/&gt;critical to understand the behavior of nanocomposites under relevant environmental conditions.&lt;br/&gt;More specifically, evaluation of the amounts and rates of Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) release&lt;br/&gt;from composites has been a tremendous challenge for the existing analytical techniques so&lt;br/&gt;far. This project will utilize C-14 labeled CNTs which will allow us to quantify the released&lt;br/&gt;CNTs using a relatively simple analytical technique. This will be of tremendous value for&lt;br/&gt;advancing our knowledge of various CNTs exposure scenarios by developing accurate metrology&lt;br/&gt;tools. This tool can be also vital for development of accurate life cycle assessments of CNTs&lt;br/&gt;encapsulated into the polymer composites.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts :&lt;br/&gt;This project can significantly impact nanotoxicology, environmental engineering, materials&lt;br/&gt;science and green chemistry/engineering areas through evaluation of various strategies for&lt;br/&gt;delivering functional nanocomposites with reduced health and environmental impacts. These&lt;br/&gt;approaches are designed to make timely contributions to a basic understanding of the environmental&lt;br/&gt;health and safety of nanotechnology. During the course of this project, the students will&lt;br/&gt;gain fundamental and applied knowledge in many areas of science and engineering encompassing&lt;br/&gt;environmental health and safety of nanotechnology. Our team has already utilized the resources&lt;br/&gt;of a new NSF REU site in Nanotechnology for Health, Energy, and the Environment at Stony Brook&lt;br/&gt;University. We will continue to recruit students through the REU site, which focuses on students&lt;br/&gt;from non-research, 4-year institutions with this research project. Through several recruitment&lt;br/&gt;mechanisms already established at the Stony Brook University we will reach underrepresented&lt;br/&gt;groups, including students from minority and economically disadvantaged communities as well&lt;br/&gt;as females. All these activities will establish a good foundation to achieve notable broader&lt;br/&gt;impacts of this proposal</AbstractNarration>
