<AbstractNarration>To address scientific challenges resulting from a rapidly changing environment and complex scientific questions, many scientists have formed formal or informal networks comprised of experts across a range of pertinent disciplines. Despite the rapidly increasing number of these networks, there has been little systematic examination of this approach to answering large-scale science questions. Funds are provided for a workshop to examine the common challenges facing emerging grass roots networks such as identifying compelling scientific questions as well as leadership, coordination, governance, communication, social interactions, data access and management, authorship, and long-term organizational sustainability. The workshop will provide a forum to identify critical aspects of the creation and operation of these networks, as well as the kinds of scientific inferences that have been made by grassroots networks.  The workshop and resulting activities will enhance capacity of the scientific workforce by assembling a diverse (gender, career stage, institution type) set of participants that include leaders of individual grassroots networks as well as experts in the newly emerging discipline of the science of team science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It is increasingly clear that understanding the environmental grand challenges that humans face in the 21st century requires knowledge that crosses the boundaries of traditional disciplines, and expertise beyond the capacity of single scientists or lab groups.  In response, scientists have self-organized into grassroots (defined here as voluntary, self-organized groups, with common goal/mission/objective) networks to tackle the complex, knotty problems spanning both natural and social system science.    To the end of finding common lessons learned and paths forward, the experience, operations, and outcomes of twelve, grassroots networks were explored.  Network foci ranged from terrestrial to aquatic to atmospheric systems and utilized experimental, comparative, theoretical, long-term, and narrative approaches.   This diversity of examples highlighted the tremendous power, possibility, and promise of grassroots network science.  Many of the example networks have assembled community resources at scales and accessibility levels not otherwise possible; several of these networks are asking and answering scientific questions that require a network approach.   A comparison of lessons learned suggested that grassroots networks can enhance the practice of science as well as scientific outcomes through stimulating and catalyzing innovation, enhancing data and data products, as well as engaging a broad spectrum of participants.    Perhaps most important is that these networks are - first and foremost &ndash;people networks&ndash; whose skills can be brought to bear on addressing some of the most challenging problems in science, provided that best team science practices are put in place.  For example, networks are found to be most functional when there is a common mission, transparency in governance, strong communication, inclusive leadership, authorship guidelines are established and agreed upon, career development is part of the network mission, and trust is built among participants.   Grassroots networks were found to be most productive and innovative when they included scientists representing all career stages and institution types, a diversity of points-of-view, and functioned as "highly productive" collaborations or teams.  Moreover, networks were most successful when they developed an open and common framework and cyberinfrastructure for handling their data, which both enabled and expedited network science. Many grassroots networks are addressing&mdash;and will in the future address&mdash; wickedly complex problems in science that simply cannot be tackled effectively without the engagement of a group of committed, innovative, and passionate scientists.
