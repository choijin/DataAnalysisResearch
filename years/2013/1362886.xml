<AbstractNarration>Current technical sonar and radar technology follows an approach that appears to be fundamentally different from what can be observed in bat biosonar: Whereas engineered systems rely on large numbers of emitter and receiver elements that each have rather simple characteristics, bat biosonar operates with a very small number of intricate emitters and receivers. Bats emit their ultrasonic pulses and receive the echoes using baffle shapes that can be compared to megaphones and horn antennas to a first approximation. However, these shapes are not only geometrically much more complicated than their technical peers, they can also have a unique dynamic dimension in that they change their shapes on time scales that are similar to the duration of the animals' ultrasonic pulses. At the same time, bat biosonar appears to be far superior to engineered systems in dealing with structure-rich natural environments. Hence, developing an understanding of the role that the dynamic dimension plays in bat biosonar could lead to novel dynamic sensing paradigms that could improve the performance of sonar, radar, and related technical sensing modalities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will reproduce and investigate dynamic features seen in biosonar the biosonar system of certain bat species in a biomimetic prototype sonar. The principal underlying hypotheses to be tested is that the deformations of these baffle shapes add a dynamic dimension to this biological sensing system that could be used to (i) enlarge the system's general coding capacity for sensory information, (ii) enhance the encoding of certain salient features, (iii) adapt the system to different sensing scenarios. If this is the case, the unusual dynamic dimension of bat biosonar could be a key factor behind the superior ability of bats to meet the sensory needs for navigation in complex natural environments based on a very parsimonious sensory input. This hypothesis will be investigated by constructing a biomimetic sonar system that will employ baffle shape for emission as well as reception that can change their shapes in synchrony with the respective diffraction processes. The biomimetic sensory system will be used to investigate the dynamic encoding of sensory information in natural biosonar sensing tasks. The results of these experiments will be analyzed using numerical simulations and information-theoretic methods to deal with the random nature of natural biosonar scenes and the resulting echo signals.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><pre>Many bat species have the unique ability to navigate and hunt in complex natural environments, e.g., dense vegetation, by listening to echoes that are triggered by the animals' ultrasonic biosonar pulses. No technical sensing system is currently able to come anywhere near this performance. This research project has investigated the hypothesis that a unique dynamics in the periphery of the bats' biosonar system is a key factor enabling this performance. When bat species with sophisticated biosonar systems emit their echolocation pulses, they do so through nostrils that are surrounded by elaborate "megaphones" known as "noseleaves". Unlike any man-made technology for emission of waves, these megaphones are actuated by muscles and can change shape during ultrasound emission. Similarly, the outer ears of these bat species contain over twenty muscles that can change the shape of the ears in one 1/10 of second, about 3x as fast as a human blink of an eye.  To understand what happens during these fast changes in the emitting and receiving structures, the research project has studied a robot that mimics the interfacial dynamics seen in bats. Building and continuously improving this robot has been a multi-year effort that has involved 3 teams of senior undergraduate students who have worked on a new version of the robot as a capstone design project.  By applying information-theoretic methods to the data obtained from this biomimetic robot, it has been demonstrated that the fast shape changes in the periphery serve to encode additional, useful sensory information. Deforming a noseleaf or an ear was found to increase the maximum number of different target directions that can be resolved by the biosonar system by a factor 100 or even more (depending on the noise level) while the accuracy with which the direction can be resolved was increased several times.  Analyzing recordings from real bats as well as their robotic recreations, research in the project discovered that bats move their ears fast enough to create their own Doppler shifts. This means that the ultrasonic frequency content of the returning echoes is changes by the motion of the pinna surfaces just like pitch of a siren changes as an ambulance drives by. And as an observer could determine the approach of an ambulance from listening to the shifting pitch of its siren, the research has demonstrated that bats could use time-frequency signatures caused by their own ear's Doppler shifts for telling the direction of a target.  Hence, the research in this project has succeeded in finding fundamentally new ways to encode sensory information using time-variant and nonlinear (i.e., Doppler-based) mechanisms.  These mechanisms have no equivalent in current man-made sensing technology such as sonar or radar. The principles learned from the bats could have a transformative impact on technical sensing paradigms for autonomous systems, such as drones, that have to operate in complex, natural environments. Insights into how the bat use dynamic principles to encode useful sensory information in the time domain could be used to create drones that are capable of swift and reliable navigation through dense vegetation without requiring large amounts of electric power and computational resources. Achieving this could be an important step towards autonomous systems that can help with important technological/societal/environmental issues such as environmental surveillance and cleanup, precision agriculture and forestry, or disaster relief.   </pre> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/30/2019<br>      Modified by: Rolf&nbsp;Mueller</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
