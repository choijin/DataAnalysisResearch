<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics &amp; Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Robert J. McMahon of the Department of Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin-Madison will investigate the behavior of organic compounds under harsh conditions of temperature, pressure, or radiation.  These conditions, which are similar to the conditions found in flames (combustion) or in space, cause the degradation of organic compounds and generate a complex mixture of highly reactive products.  The proposed research will explore the chemical properties and chemical reactions of these reactive molecules.  This research provides a foundation for understanding two very different problems: one involving combustion and another involving the chemistry of space.  Combustion of organic fuels is central to our nation's energy supply and national economy.  A fundamental understanding of combustion offers the possibility of enhancing the energy efficiency of fuel combustion and minimizing pollutants (soot) that arise from incomplete combustion.  In interstellar space, it is now known that hundreds of different organic compounds exist throughout the galaxy in environments that are harsh because they are so hot (near stars) or because they are so cold (far from stars).  Studying these environments is a crucial step in understanding the distribution of organic material in the universe and identifying molecules that could be precursors to life.  Professor McMahon and his coworkers will also continue their engagement in a variety of science education and outreach activities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The fundamental chemical studies proposed herein would not have been possible only a few years ago.  Tremendous advances in both experimental and computational techniques now permit the analysis and interpretation of the experimental spectra obtained from complex mixtures of reactive species.  Direct studies of these species are challenging because these molecules typically exhibit high reactivity.  Nevertheless, it is the reaction chemistry of these ephemeral intermediates that governs the chemical behavior of the system.  In combustion chemistry, the determination of accurate equilibrium structures of reactive intermediates will provide important benchmarks for prototypical molecules, and theory can be further used to establish thermodynamic parameters that are important for modeling.  In astrochemistry, the Atacama Large Millimeter / sub-millimeter Array (ALMA), an astronomical interferometer of radio telescopes in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile completed in 2013, is generating a deluge of new radio-astronomical data.  These data can be interpreted only by comparison with laboratory spectra of the type that will be obtained through the proposed studies.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our research program explores fundamental aspects of organic chemistry with the goal of understanding the chemistry that occurs in harsh reaction conditions.  These harsh conditions include very high temperature, very low temperature, intense light, and electrical discharges (such as lightning strikes).  These studies provide a foundation for understanding  the chemical processes that occur in a variety of natural environments, including space (astrochemistry), flames and combustion, atmospheric chemistry, lithography, plasmas, and electrical discharges.    Because of the harsh conditions, these chemical environments are inherently complex.  To study them, in detail, requires an integrated approach involving several different branches of chemistry: organic chemistry, physical chemistry, quantum chemistry, and molecular spectroscopy.  We, along with our research collaborators, include experts from each of these areas.  We have a uniquely qualified team of researchers.  The study of the chemistry of space is known as astrochemistry.  People understand that space is comprised of stars and planets, but they do not appreciate that the very same chemical substances that exist on Earth also exist throughout our Universe.  We know this fact, unequivocally, because we are able to detect and measure the characteristic features of these molecules.  Even though it is not possible to collect samples of these substances and put them in bottles, we know, with certainty, that they exist in space - hundreds of light-years distant from Earth.   In order to detect molecules in space, it is first necessary to measure their characteristic features in laboratory experiments here on Earth.  Only after these features have been measured (on Earth) do astronomers "know what to look for" in order to detect these molecules in space.  At the current time, over 200 different molecules have been detected in space.  This may seem like a large number, but it is a very small fraction of the millions of different compounds that are known on Earth.  We are, however, on the verge of profound discoveries involving the detection of some of the simplest prebiotic molecules - the molecules of life!   Our research program builds from an extensive background in organic chemistry.  We draw on our expertise to identify key targets for detection in the complex chemistry of interstellar space.  Our ideas can be experimentally tested through an interdisciplinary program that draws on synthetic organic chemistry, molecular spectroscopy, quantum chemistry, and astronomy.  With support from the NSF, we built a sophisticated instrument that allows us to measure the characteristic features of our target molecules, in the hope of detecting them in space.   The scientific impact of the proposed research reaches beyond the field of chemistry.  In the area of astrochemistry, the program addresses fundamental questions concerning the nature of what is now recognized to be the dominant reservoir of organic compounds in the universe.  A deeper understanding of the organic chemistry of space may carry implications concerning the origin of life. Studies may also provide insight concerning the atmosphere on primitive Earth and on Titan, the largest moon of Saturn.  In the area of combustion chemistry, the program tests key hypotheses concerning the chemical mechanism of soot formation.   The program supports the education of graduate and undergraduate students.  Research collaborations provide an environment for training the next generation of students in the study of complex chemical problems as part of an interdisciplinary research team.  Training in mechanistic organic chemistry provides a valuable foundation for subsequent careers in industry or academia.  Half of the PI's former coworkers are employed in the chemical or pharmaceutical industry, half hold faculty positions in academia.  Of the twenty-one current or recently-completed Ph.D. students in the PI's research group, eleven are women.  The PI's involvement in recruiting a diverse group of both faculty and graduate students to the program at Wisconsin has been decisive in several cases.  The PI and coworkers continue their engagement in a variety of science education and outreach activities.        Last Modified: 10/26/2018       Submitted by: Robert J Mcmahon]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
