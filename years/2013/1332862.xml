<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to investigate nonlinear acoustic metamaterials with adaptive properties for the design of next-generation wave-based devices. The necessary nonlinear interactions and adaptivity will be derived from two primary material systems: one based on controllable post-buckled lattices, and the other based on piezoelectric tunable metamaterials.  The research will also exploit large deformations resulting from structural instabilities as an effective way to adapt the topology and the periodicity of a structured material. Stiffening and softening effects, amplitude-dependent dispersion, and stability will be studied in terms of their effect on the wave guiding characteristics. Fundamental understanding of nonlinear and adaptive acoustic metamaterials, and the exploration of their wave propagation behavior, will support the conception, fabrication, and experimental testing of innovative wave-based devices, to include tunable filters, waveguides, acoustic diodes, noise isolators, and directed-energy systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will significantly advance knowledge and understanding in the general area of tunable and adaptive nonlinear metamaterials. This understanding will be important for the development of innovative devices for use in communication systems (mobile phones, GPS units, etc.), noise isolation, energy redirection, and acoustic filters, logic ports and switches. Advances from the research topics will be disseminated widely through academic courses on wave mechanics at Georgia Tech and in undergraduate research opportunities. Broadening of participation will be achieved by specifically working with underrepresented students through ongoing programs available at Georgia Tech. In addition, educational laboratory activities and classroom modules, developed in partnership with the GIFT program at Georgia Tech, will expose high school and middle school underrepresented students to basic results of the research and to underlying wave mechanics principles.</AbstractNarration>
