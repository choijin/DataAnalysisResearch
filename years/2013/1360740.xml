<AbstractNarration>This project will support six semiannual AGNES weekend workshops in Algebraic Geometry, the first of which is to be held at Stony Brook University, April 25 - 27, 2014. Algebraic geometry is a dynamic subject with vital connections to physics, applied mathematics, and fields such as number theory, differential geometry and representation theory. The Northeastern United States are a particular nexus, with a density of researchers and an output rivaling any region in the world. AGNES weekend workshops bring together a spectrum of algebraic geometers from the region and beyond, as well as representatives from allied fields invigorating algebraic geometry. There is diversity both in speakers and participants, from senior experts to burgeoning young researchers. There is a special emphasis on students: AGNES hosts "students-only" introductory pre-talks, as well as professional development sessions. Through lectures, panels, problem sessions, poster sessions, and informal discussion periods, AGNES informs the community of developments, AGNES fosters new research collaborations, and AGNES trains junior algebraic geometers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometers study the geometry of shapes defined by the polynomial equations of Algebra. In fact, the geometric shapes occurring in nature -- in science, in engineering, etc. -- are frequently "algebraic", explaining the vital importance of algebraic geometry in physics and applied mathematics. This grant promotes research, dissemination and training in algebraic geometry through a series of conferences held throughout the Northeastern United States. There is an emphasis on supporting graduate students, highlighting the broad array of work in the area and its many connections to allied areas, and fostering communication in our broad research community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AGNES website is available at http://www.agneshome.org/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Algebraic Geometry NorthEastern Series had its 14th biannual meeting April 8-10, 2016 at Yale University.  The conference was widely advertised, through email lists, poster mailings, and online postings, and fielded over 135 participants from 46 universities and research institutions.  The majority of participants were graduate students and recent PhDs.    Universities sending multiple participants included not only those within the AGNES region such as Boston College, Columbia, Harvard, MIT, Princeton, Stony Brook, and University of Massachusetts, but also west coast and midwestern universities such as Berkeley, and University of Michigan.  Primarily undergraduate institutions, and others that do not grant PhDs in mathematics, were also represented, with participants from schools including Iona College, The College of New Jersey, Fordham University, Mount Holyoke College, and Swarthmore College.  Participants even included a few senior undergraduates and one high school teacher from The Proof School, all of whom are now in PhD programs.   The program featured seven one hour lectures, by established leading algebraic geometry researchers Antonella Grassi (University of Pennsylvania), Brian Harbourne (University of Nebraska), Daniel Krashen (University of Georgia), Martin Olsson (University of California, Berkeley), and Karen Smith (University of Michigan), along with rising stars Dustin Cartwright (University of Tennessee) and Alena Pirutka (New York University).  Harbourne, Krashen, Olsson, and Smith also delivered half hour pre-talks for graduate students.    A panel discussion on the topic of "What I wish I knew when I was in graduate school" featured Linda Chen (Swarthmore College), Harbourne, Brendan Hassett (Brown), Jessica Sidman (Mount Holyoke College), Smith, and Jenia Tevelev (University of Massachusetts, Amherst).  The main program was preceded by a "Connections for Women @ AGNES" program with 26 registered participants (5 tenured or tenure track faculty, 2 postdocs, 16 graduate students, 2 undergrads, and one high school teacher).  The program included a plenary talk by Lucia Caporaso (Roma Tre), which was open to all and had over 50 in attendance, and a lunch meeting for registered participants, which included short presentations and informal discussions.
