<AbstractNarration>Quantum mechanics is a fundamental branch of physics whose foundations were established during the first half of the twentieth century. The study of quantum mechanical phenomena in disordered environments has been an area of ongoing active study since the 1950's. The mathematical study of electronic properties of disordered structures is carried out within the framework of ergodic Schrodinger operators. This project therefore has a potential impact on physics as it improves our understanding of quantum mechanical transport properties of media exhibiting certain kinds of disorder. Through the training of graduate students the project has in addition an impact on human resource development. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will study direct and inverse spectral theory for quasi-periodic Schrodinger operators with applications to the KdV equation, the structure of the spectrum and the type of the density of states measure of the square Fibonacci Hamiltonian at intermediate coupling, transport in quantum systems and mechanisms that determine the associated transport exponents, the absolute of continuity of the density of states measure of the weakly coupled Bernoulli-Anderson model in one dimension, connections between bound states and essential spectrum for perturbations of periodic Schrodinger operators, and the interface between direct and inverse spectral theory for almost periodic Jacobi matrices. Methods from spectral theory and dynamical systems will be used in pursuing these goals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project investigates mathematical problems arising in mathematical physics, especially in quantum mechanics and in the study of shallow water waves. The concept of an almost periodic function is central. Such functions are similar, but not necessarily equal, to periodic functions which repeat their values after some time.  The PI has studied quantum mechanical models with almost periodic environments and shallow water waves with an almost periodic initial profile. The methods used in this study range across various disciplines, but dynamical systems and complex analysis play an especially critical role.  The major findings concern the time evolution of these systems and confirm some long standing conjectures that had been considered difficult and challenging by experts. For example, the Deift conjecture states that the KdV equation, which models shallow water waves, with an almost periodic initial profile admits a global solution that behaves almost periodically in time. This conjecture has been established under suitable assumptions, including the assumption that the initial profile is not too large. For quantum mechanical models associated with quasicrystals, structures that behave like crystals in many ways but lack periodicity, the major findings concern a description of the quantities of interest in terms of dynamical features of an associated system, which in turn can be determined or at least estimated quite well.  The broader impact of this project includes the training of several PhD students and postdocs as well as the writing of several survey articles that explain these recent advances to a broad audience.
