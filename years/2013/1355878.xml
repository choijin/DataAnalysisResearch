<AbstractNarration>Heat flow and seismic reflection data will be collected offshore the northern and southern Hikurangi margin in New Zealand, to develop a process-based understanding of the thermal structure of the subduction zone. The northern area is underlain by an aseismic creep-dominated subduction interface and is the site of repeated shallow (&lt; 15 km depth) slow slip earthquakes (SSEs). The southern field area contrasts strongly, with deep (&gt; 30 km) SSEs updip inferred to be associated with interseismic coupling on the plate interface, similar to Cascadia. Acquisition of ~15 high-resolution transects will increase the number of available heat flow measurements from this continental margin by 2 orders of magnitude. Using sediment seismic velocities and thermal conductivities obtained from this experiment, heatflow coverage will be expanded using regional observations of hydrate-related bottom simulating horizons.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project addresses fundamental questions about seismicity and deformation processes on a subduction  plate interface, and how they may be linked to hydrologic and geodynamic processes. Students training will cover a range of techniques, from marine data collection and analysis to numerical modeling. Results of the study will be incorporated in university courses as well as included in community science outreach efforts.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   The northern portion of the Hikurangi subduction zone, east of New Zealand?s North Island, has become a key area to understand shallow (&lt; 15 km) slow slip events (SSEs).  At this margin, shallow slow slip events occur at depths of &lt; 2 to 15 km every 18 to 24 months, last 1 to 2 weeks, have a cumulative slip of several to tens of centimeters each, and generate equivalent "earthquake" magnitudes of 6.0 &ndash; 7.0.  Globally, shallow SSEs occur in environments characterized by low effective stress and fluid pressures that exceed hydrostatic pressure.  One important aspect to understanding the mechanics of fault slip behavior is knowledge of the thermal regime and hydrogeology of the plate boundary and adjacent plates.  Although shallow SSEs do not appear to be directly tied to a particular temperature window, knowledge of the thermal regime provides important information on the background heat flow, the location of dehydration reactions, areas of advective fluid flow and, in some cases, the magnitude of frictional heating, which can be tied to estimates of the effective coefficient of friction along the plate boundary fault.     To better understand the thermal regime of this margin we collected 161 seafloor heat flow measurements, 880 km of seismic reflection profiles, and swath map bathymetric data on the Hikurangi margin. Our data and analyses indicate that the mean heat flow seaward of the deformation front is ~ 58 mW m-2, slightly higher than the conductive prediction of 51 mW m-2 for 120 Ma lithosphere, but within the variability of globally observed heat flow for lithosphere of this age. We also found that fluid flow is locally significant for moving heat in the ocean crust.  Landward of the deformation front heat flow decreases consistent with thickening of the margin and the downward transport of heat with the subducting plate.  Large observed variability is interpreted in terms of combined fluid and heat flow through splay faults.  These data are being used to better understand slow slip events in this and other settings.          Last Modified: 01/11/2018       Submitted by: Robert N Harris]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
