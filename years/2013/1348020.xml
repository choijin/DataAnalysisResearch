<AbstractNarration>This award will help to support student attendance at the 54th IEEE Annual Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS) in Berkeley, CA on October 27 through October 29, 2013, as well as to support attendance by some qualified postdoctoral fellows who do not have other sources of travel funding. FOCS and its sister conference, the ACM STOC meeting, are the premier broad-based conferences on the Theory of Computing. FOCS has a record of strongly encouraging participation by students, for whom the conference serves as a valuable educational experience, both for the technical content of the talks and for the opportunities for networking that it provides. In recent years, the annual FOCS conference has been attended by eighty to one hundred students who have comprised more than a third of all attendees. This award will provide partial support to twenty or more students, covering shared hotel rooms and travel. (Student registration will be supported by other means.)</AbstractNarration>

This project provided funding for young researchers, graduate students and postdocs, to attend FOCS in 2013 and 2014. The principle scientific merit of this project is this funding helps to advance the science by facilitating research that often starts at conferences such as these.  For broader impact, this grant serves an invaluable role in developing these young researchers - exposure to the emerging trends is an important aspects of their education, and is really most effectively way to expose young researchers to the ideas and researchers that are at the cutting edge of the field.
