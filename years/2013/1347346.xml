<AbstractNarration>The symposium and associated workshop at the 2014 Meeting of the Society of Integrative Comparative Biology (SICB) will encourage investigators in organismal biology to understand and employ recent experimental, computational and theoretical advances in flows involving water surfaces. Such flows are both ubiquitous and diverse, involving the drinking of birds and bees, the footprints of whale flukes, the flow of xylem in plants, raindrop impacts on animals, and disease transmission through raindrop impacts. The fundamental physical principles underlying such flows provide a unifying framework to interpret the adaptations of the animals and plants that rely upon them. The symposium will provide a much-needed unifying physical framework to understand surface-tension phenomena in biological systems. The speakers will provide the audience with a broad understanding of successful mathematical and biological techniques used in this area, such as scaling laws, calculus for describing water surfaces, as well as scanning electron microscopy, surface moulding using clay, and high-speed videography.  The workshop provides an opportunity for biology students to learn new tools from fluid mechanics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results will be disseminated through publication of a pair of journal articles. The first article will be a view of the future of the field of capillary biology in Integrative and Comparative Biology, as seen by the expert speakers in the symposium. The second article will be a synopsis of the Visualization Workshop, which will discuss the generation, presentation, and interpretation of flow visualization generated from experiments and simulation. The workshop will focus on the use of visual imagery to transcend the language barriers between biology and the mathematical sciences, and to disseminate science to the public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of the symposium was to encourage investigators in organismal biology to understand and employ recent experimental, computational and theoretical advances in flows involving water surfaces. Such flows are both ubiquitous and diverse, involving the drinking of birds and bees, the footprints of whale flukes, the flow of xylem in plants, raindrop impacts on animals, and disease transmission through raindrop impacts. The fundamental physical principles underlying these phenomena provide a unifying framework to interpret the adaptations of the animals and plants that rely upon them. This symposium follows a related 2012 symposium on modeling and computation.  We added to this momentum by attracting junior investigators to take on challenging interdisciplinary problems in organismal biology.     The goal of the workshop was to give the participants skills that would enable them to increase their effective communication about their research with the media.  Participants left with concrete ideas about how to frame their research, avoid misconceptions and develop materials that would form a media toolkit.     The day-long scientific symposium led to ten published papers in the Integrative and Comparative biology journal with the heading, Shaking, Dripping, and Drinking: Surface Tension Phenomena in Organismal Biology.  The citations for the papers are outlined in the products section.     In addition, we published a piece in SIAM news describing the press workshop and alerting SIAM members to a second workshop at the SIAM Annual Meeting in Chicago, July 7-11, 2014.
