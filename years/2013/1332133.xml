<AbstractNarration>The proposed work seeks to enable plug and play use of multiple platforms in the development of multi-robot teams that interact with human teams.  The research will develop a software engineering framework viewed as crucial for the proliferation of intelligent robots. The proposed approach will (i) Develop of a framework that allows quick integration of new robot designs into the robotic team; (ii) Develop a user-friendly human-team interface, (iii) Create methods to perform asset (robot) management, (iv) Software test to check the viability of the proposed solutions, and (v) Experimentally validate the system in real-world settings in consultation with center members.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Robot teams have the potential for significant societal impact given their design and implementation can be made more efficient and low cost.  Interchangeable use of hardware and software to achieve a wide range of functions is critical to achieving this potential and the associated economic impact that will accompany it.   The proposed software framework for robotics is supported by the Industry Advisory Board and has the potential to extend the center?s portfolio significantly through expansion into the area of robotic team system software engineering.  The research will impact and be used in the center?s annual robotics camp and other outreach activities.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

We used cloud computing to address this challenge. Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort of the service provider. Recently, the field of robotics has begun to make use of cloud computing resources. Cloud robotics exploits advances in cloud computing and big data, and allows for the potential of developing a new generation of robotics applications.  In our work, we do cloud robotics by looking at the problem of object classification. In fact, we introduce a dictionary learning framework using RGB-D covariance descriptors on point cloud data for performing object classification. Dictionary learning in combination with RGB-D covariance descriptors provides a compact and flexible description of point cloud data. Furthermore, the proposed framework is ideal for updating and sharing dictionaries among robots in a decentralized or cloud network. This work demonstrates the increased performance of 3D object classification utilizing covariance descriptors and dictionary learning over previous results with experiments performed on a publicly available RGB-D database.  We also present two algorithms that allow for the intelligent throttling of RGB-D data between a client (robot) and server (cloud) for the purpose of object classification and tracking. The client makes use of redundant information in point cloud frames to reduce the amount of data transmitted. The server analyzes the received data and makes adjustments to the client?s rate of transmission by employing an adaptive threshold setting. Together, the client and server maintain the usability of the network while performing the vision task at hand.  We have also conducted summer camps for middleschoolers from underrepresented groups the last ten summers.
