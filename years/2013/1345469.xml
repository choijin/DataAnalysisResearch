<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel electronic performance support system (EPSS), the Educators' Coach for Learner Interventions and Performance Strategies (E-CLIPS), to aid faculty in the design of online learning content. The face of higher education is dramatically changing in the United States. Shrinking state budgets have taken a heavy toll at public institutions, reducing the number of seats available for students to take courses needed to graduate. A significant number of courses are moving to online or blended formats, but without the corresponding focus on instructional design tools and methods to help faculty deliver a successful online learning experience. The goal of this SBIR project is to design, develop, and commercialize a virtual instructional design toolkit that that significantly enhances instructor capabilities and thus the online learning experience of students. This SBIR project seeks to conduct research on the instructional design coaching model and then develop an innovative EPSS to aid faculty in the selection and design of learning activities, thereby providing students with an engaging online experience. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of the project is in the potential to transform the way any educator or corporate trainer delivers online content and learning interventions. There are limited tools on the market that addresses the critical issue of transforming the way faculty use instructional design tools. Faculty desire a tool that allows them to be more strategic about course design and more tactical with respect to student performance. Student analytic data is limited, requires extensive IT support, and is rarely provided immediately. The project provides a scaffolding tool to college instructors that makes it easier to rapidly and quickly adapt lessons rather than wait for IT experts to help them. This is the equivalent of other tools, which have revolutionized blogging for all those people who do not want to learn computer programming to express their viewpoints online. The project is a step in the right direction to transform the way faculty deliver online learning with corresponding transformational effects on student success rates. Extensions of the project to government and K-12 (i.e., virtual high schools) are well within reach and provide additional markets to grow revenue.</AbstractNarration>

Additionally we sought to analyze methods for using learner analytics in the improvement of course design.     Our team of instructional design researchers worked alongside faculty from five colleges and universities to:  Define a course design workflow Define a learning activity taxonomy Build instructional design templates and tutorials to support the design and development of online courses Identify analytics to guide course design Develop an interactive prototype    Through surveys that provided an opportunity for self-identification we observed:  50% believed they get the support they need from campus administration. 17% self-identified as not having the skills they need to design and develop online education. 100% were confident or very confident: they can make their course engaging for their students, they can set and meet student expectations, and they are able to get to know students in an online environment. 83% were confident or very confident they could facilitate student-to-student interaction. Respondents perceived the most value from instructional designers in the following areas: Course planning and organizing (67%) Entering content into the LMS (83%) Editing content (67%) Configuring the LMS (e.g. gradebook, discussion boards) (50%) Creating interactive activities (50%)   However, through observation in working with faculty in course development projects, instructional designers reported faculty have limited instructional design proficiencies. This disconnect is difficult to pinpoint, but anecdotal evidence suggests the misalignment is caused by:  Lack of a definition of what it means to have an "engaging" or "interactive" course Lack of experience taking online courses, and an inability to understand the studentÆs perspective Lack of clarity about student expectations Abandonment of many types of student-to-student learning activities   In order to improve faculty instructional design proficiency we prototyped an EPSS with embedded coaching called E-CLIPS. The prototype was developed as an interactive paper prototype, allowing us to add minor interactivity to static images to simulate some of the navigation you might find in the developed version.     The following is a walk-through of some of the key screens and concepts covered in the prototype:     Begin New Course Wizard  The Begin New Course Wizard walks instructors through the course design workflow we identified using our focus group and instructional designers. The wizard asks a series of questions related to course development, ensuring the process begins with the right information. As shown in the example images, users are provided contextual support through templates and tutorials related to the answers given. By walking instructors through a wizard, two requirements are accomplished: (1) information about the course is captured, which will help filter activity types and set targets for later evaluation; and (2) coaching opportunities are provided for faculty members who are new to the process or who wish to learn more.
