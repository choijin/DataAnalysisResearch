<AbstractNarration>The University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) is the lead institution for PROMISE AGEP, a university system-wide effort for the state of Maryland to facilitate underrepresented STEM graduate student and postdoctoral professional development and pathways to careers. UMBC leads the alliance that consists of all 14 colleges, universities, and regional education centers in the University System of Maryland, four community colleges, and a former NSF Model Institution of Excellence Hispanic Serving Institution in Puerto Rico. PROMISE has been a critical catalyst for increasing enrollment, retention, and graduation rates of underrepresented minorities. The program also will contribute to the higher education literature on retention and professional development for graduate students and postdocs. The Rotating Postdoctoral Fellowship and the Professors-in-Training program for Maryland's institutions (including Master's serving institutions, HBCUs, community colleges, and an HSI) are among the innovations that respond to AGEP's call to support the national goal of increasing the number of underrepresented minorities who will enter academic STEM careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROMISE AGEP: Maryland Transformation will focus on four sets of alliance activities: &lt;br/&gt;1) Graduate student recruitment, retention, and success; to cultivate new students by creating a pipeline (pathway) for students to be prepared for and admitted to graduate school, participate in workshops that promote retention, and develop community to facilitate persistence; &lt;br/&gt;2) Ph.D. completion and career preparation; to develop activities that will focus on both degree completion and transition to careers; &lt;br/&gt;3) Programs for postdoctoral scholars; to facilitate coordinated policies and programs for mentoring underrepresented minority postdocs across the university system; and &lt;br/&gt;4) Programs to enhance faculty understanding of diversity issues in graduate and postdoctoral education; to open dialog among the faculty to develop promising practices for underrepresented minority recruitment, retention, mentoring, and transitions to careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new project will engage the University System of Maryland in a system-wide focus on diversity in STEM graduate education, and will share resources and facilities to provide professional development for participants that might otherwise be limited or non-existent at some of the institutions without the alliance. This state-wide alliance eliminates the "silo-effect" or independent STEM diversity efforts, and it promotes as a core mission the collaboration to expand and connect a community of scholars through the state. The state-wide alliance allows the institutions to provide pipelines and pathways between institutions for doctoral study, postdoctoral placements, and faculty appointments. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project includes a research component to explore three research questions: Does experience of micro-affirmations/micro-aggressions, a sense of belonging, professional networks, and mentoring experiences influence graduate student outcomes such as time to degree, persistence, job placement, and a sense of agency in career advancement? How do these outcomes and experiences differ by student demographics, discipline, or institutional type? What role does participation in the PROMISE AGEP play in these experiences and outcomes? The goals of the proposed research are first to determine whether students in the second group are more likely to experience a sense of agency in career advancement, persist in their degree programs and STEM, have shorter time to degree, and find academic appointments post-graduation. Second, the research will explore how the PROMISE program facilitates access to these experiences, promoting educational outcomes for underrepresented minority students in STEM.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>PROMISE AGEP: Maryland Transformation was designed to provide critical retention, degree completion, and faculty career transition support for Maryland&rsquo;s underrepresented STEM graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. PROMISE AGEP-T impacted 12 universities by engaging University System of Maryland (USM) administrators (e.g., chancellor, vice chancellor), university presidents, provosts, vice presidents, deans, and faculty in discussions around graduate student and postdoctoral success, and barriers to such success. PROMISE AGEP-T had three partners working with the USM: the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC), the University of Maryland College Park (UMCP), and the University of Maryland (UMB). PROMISE AGEP-T successfully institutionalized several graduate student and postdoctoral success programs that have now been replicated and scaled at various universities around the country. These include 1) the &ldquo;Dissertation House&rdquo; which supports doctoral degree completion, 2) the &ldquo;Summer Success Institute (SSI)&rdquo; &ndash; an annual professional development program that serves 200+ participants and includes high-level administrators, faculty, postdocs, students, and professionals, and 3) the &ldquo;Research Symposium&rdquo; which engages graduate students as presenters, and postdocs and faculty serve as mentors within an environment that facilitates learning and continuous improvement. These PROMISE programs invoke the social science frameworks of McMillan &amp; Chavis&rsquo; &ldquo;Psychological Sense of Community (PSOC),&rdquo; Yosso and colleagues&rsquo; work &ldquo;Cultural Capital,&rdquo; and O&rsquo;Meara and colleagues&rsquo; adaptation of Oldenburg&rsquo;s &ldquo;Third Place&rdquo; to develop the notion of the PROMISE AGEP as a &ldquo;Third Space&rdquo; to build egalitarian, supportive academic community.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In 2016, PROMISE AGEP-T earned the imprimatur the USM.

Here, we share a few examples in Computer Science, as it is one of the fields that has very low traction among scholars from underrepresented groups. Dr. Patricia Ordonez (PROMISE @ UMBC), earned tenure at the University of Puerto Rico Rio Piedras in early 2019. Dr. Jaye Nias (PROMISE @ Bowie State University) accepted a tenure-track (TT) assistant professor position at Spelman. Dr. Robin Brewer (LSAMP @ College Park, PROMISE @ UMBC) completed her PhD at Northwestern and postdoc at the University of Michigan (connecting to NSF ADVANCE at Michigan), and accepted a TT position at Michigan. Patrick Carrington (LSAMP BD &amp; PROMISE @ UMBC) accepted a TT position at Carnegie Mellon, and LeChelle Hatley (PROMISE @ College Park), is a TT professor at Coppin State University in Maryland. PROMISE facilitated opportunities for these scholars to remain connected through participation in the Latin and Caribbean Consortium for Engineering Institution&rsquo;s (LACCEI) international conferences, participation in the Southern Regional Education Board&rsquo;s (SREB) Institute for Teaching and Mentoring, and in other conferences.
