<AbstractNarration>This project will be part of the international DEEPWAVE campaign which will seek to understand the generation and propagation of atmospheric gravity waves from orographic and other sources from ground-level up to 100 km altitude, and will use airborne and ground-based instrumentation as well as modeling. It will take place in June/July 2014 in the region over New Zealand, Tasmania and the surrounding Southern Ocean. This project will provide ray-tracing analysis and forecasts for DEEPWAVE, with an emphasis on mountain waves. Two complementary ray formulations will be used: Fourier space ray-tracing and spatial ray-tracing. The Fourier-space ray-tracing is mainly for the region directly above mountains, where wave amplitudes tend to be highest and where spatial ray-tracing often fails to satisfy slowly varying requirements. The Fourier-space ray-tracing can also be coupled to a mesoscale model simulation to improve initial conditions for the Fourier-space rays. The spatial ray-tracing is mainly for mountain-wave propagation through the Polar Night Jet, with a new treatment of the three-dimensional geometrical spreading by horizontally and vertically varying wind shear.&lt;br/&gt;The work will involve a new analysis of geometrical spreading, a process that is omitted from almost all ray-tracing studies of gravity waves and that is likely to be important in the DEEPWAVE region. Aspects such as the directionality and anisotropy of the geometrical spreading will be examined for the first time and may provide clues for improved gravity wave parameterizations.&lt;br/&gt; The DEEPWAVE project will promote international scientific collaboration. Understanding gravity wave propagation and breakdown in the middle and upper atmosphere is related to a number of strategic and societal issues, including the safety of high altitude aircraft, the accuracy of weather and climate models, and the ability to forecast certain space weather phenomena that affect satellite communication.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Mountain waves are generated by wind flow over mountains. They cause large fluctuations in atmospheric temperature and winds, and they are sometimes visibly exposed as lee wave clouds.  Mountain waves can reach great heights in the atmosphere,  for example producing turbulence along airline flight paths, and affecting chemical reaction rates for life-protecting ozone in the  stratosphere.      This study was focussed mainly on mountain waves generated by Auckland Island, a small archipelago south of New Zealand.  Measurements were made from a research flight that passed over Auckland Island four times in a few hours to monitor the amplitude,  upward extent, and time evolution of the mountain waves. There were two unexpected results. The first  was that mountain waves from Auckland Island were so clearly identifiable in data at altitudes  as high as 80 km,  well above the clouds and passing weather systems. To reach this altitude, the mountain waves had to penetrate strong wintertime winds along their upward propagation path.  The winds normally trap and confine mountain waves to much lower altitudes,  or cause them to break down into turbulence. The second unexpected result was the ability of wave physics models to explain the data so well. The models revealed how the mountain waves reach such high altitudes against strong winds and showed remarkable agreement with measurements of  wave patterns,  time evolution,  and even the location where the waves ultimately break down into turbulence, the latter typically being the most difficult to forecast but also the most important for understanding the largest impacts of mountain waves on winds and temperature.   The results of this project have provided direct observational support for recent conjectures that mountain waves due to small south Pacific islands contribute significantly to the dynamics of the high atmosphere, including its winds, ozone chemistry,  and climate.
