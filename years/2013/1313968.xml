<AbstractNarration>Project Summary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SEES Fellows: Sustainable Nanosilicon Production through the Electrochemical Reduction&lt;br/&gt;of Diatoms and Integration into Wastewater Remediation and Biofuel Industries&lt;br/&gt;PI: Steven N. Girard, University of Wisconsin  Madison&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nanostructures of abundant and non-toxic silicon can serve a significant role in various renewable&lt;br/&gt;energy technologies, including solar cells, Li-ion batteries, and thermoelectric materials. To realize&lt;br/&gt;the potential of nanosilicon for renewable energy applications, mass quantities must be economically&lt;br/&gt;and sustainably produced. Current silicon production relies on an energy- and material- consuming&lt;br/&gt;carbothermal reduction process, in which the reaction between carbon and sand (silica) at very high&lt;br/&gt;temperatures yields metallurgical silicon and carbon dioxide. Metallurgical silicon is subsequently&lt;br/&gt;dissolved, refined, and recrystallized in multiple energy- and material-consuming steps to generate&lt;br/&gt;nanosilicon for renewable energy applications. For nanosilicon to be used for renewable energy, the&lt;br/&gt;large scale production of silicon must be redesigned from a sustainability perspective. I propose to&lt;br/&gt;develop an altogether new process of direct electrochemical conversion of nanosilica-to-nanosilicon&lt;br/&gt;that will be energy and material efficient, and therefore inexpensive and sustainable. In collaboration&lt;br/&gt;with industrial partner AlgaXperts, we will also analyze the scalability and feasibility of this&lt;br/&gt;approach through the integration into existing wastewater remediation and algae-for-biofuel&lt;br/&gt;industries by essentially recycling the nanostructured diatoms (silica) from these processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit.&lt;br/&gt;A novel process of sustainable and direct nanosilicon production through the&lt;br/&gt;electrochemical reduction of nanostructured silica frustules of diatoms will be developed. The&lt;br/&gt;naturally nanostructured silica microshells of diatoms (unicellular algae) are inexpensive and easily&lt;br/&gt;obtained either from mined diatomaceous earth deposits or from diatom algal cultures. Under host&lt;br/&gt;mentor Prof. Song Jin, Department of Chemistry at UW-Madison, the proposed research seeks to&lt;br/&gt;develop electrochemical reduction of nanosilica within novel eutectic salt electrolytes, which will&lt;br/&gt;enable single-step nanosilicon production at very low temperatures, consuming considerably less&lt;br/&gt;energy. If the starting nanomorphologies can be retained following conversion to silicon, this&lt;br/&gt;process will represent the most sustainable means of nanosilicon production to date.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact.&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will be immediately useful for a variety of industrial&lt;br/&gt;applications and expose the SEES fellow new chemical techniques. We further propose harvesting&lt;br/&gt;specific diatom genera from industrial-scale algal cultures used for the bioremediation of wastewater&lt;br/&gt;effluent and production of lipids for biofuels. Obtaining specific diatom genera allow control over&lt;br/&gt;the types of nanostructures obtained. In collaboration with partner mentor Jun Yoshitani, President&lt;br/&gt;of AlgaXperts LLC, we will analyze the feasibility of the integration of these approaches at a&lt;br/&gt;Midwestern water treatment facility. Furthermore, this collaborative research will involve chemical&lt;br/&gt;analysis of the wastewater effluent nutrients, selectivity of specific genera in industrial-scale cultures,&lt;br/&gt;and analysis of the associated costs. The SEES fellow will gain a better understanding of the&lt;br/&gt;industrial considerations connected to implementing large-scale sustainability technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Educational Outreach.&lt;br/&gt;In collaboration with Prof. Greg Nemet, Nelson Institute of Environmental&lt;br/&gt;Studies at UW-Madison, and Dr. Andrew Greenberg, Director of REU programs at UW-Madison, a&lt;br/&gt;highly interdisciplinary summer practicum focusing on public policy and sustainability science will&lt;br/&gt;be designed and implemented. Lessons learned in the primary research will be integrated into the&lt;br/&gt;REU summer practicum. In collaboration with Dr. Greenberg, underrepresented minority&lt;br/&gt;undergraduate researchers will be mentored by the SEES fellow in summer research projects related&lt;br/&gt;to the proposed research. The SEES fellow will gain experience in sustainability policy, teaching,&lt;br/&gt;course design, integration of teaching and research, and undergraduate mentoring.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The industrial synthesis of silicon is a multi-billion dollar industry, primarily serving the microelectronics market, with growing importance in renewable energy technologies, such as solar cells, batteries, and thermoelectric materials.   While silicon is the second-most abundant element in the earth?s crust, the cost of silicon remains high due to the energy- and material-demanding chemical processes used in its production.  Current silicon manufacture is accomplished at extremely high temperatures above 1700 degrees C, followed by a series of energy- and material- consuming steps to generate nanostructured silicon and silicides for technological applications.  Consequently, the high cost of silicon stems primarily from unsustainable means of synthesis.  The primary objective of this work was to develop an altogether new approach to generate nanostructured silicon more sustainably by enabling these reactions at much lower temperatures and with fewer steps.  This researched developed more sustainable methods of producing nanostructured silicon and silicides at low temperatures and with high yield.  By using low-cost silica and oxide materials that comprise sand and glass, it was shown that nanostructured silicon and silicon-containing materials could successfully be generated using molten salt reduction/oxidation chemistry. This research demonstrated that by using inexpensive and non-toxic molten salt solvents, silicon and silicon-containing nanostructures could be synthesized at low temperatures of between 500 and 700 degrees C. Additionally, this research revealed that the solubility of silicon oxides in molten salts can be manipulated within molten salt electrolytes.  The broader impacts of this work demonstrated that silicates, the primary components of rocks, glass, and shells of diatoms (diatomaceous earth), can be used as an extremely low-cost and earth-abundant feedstock for the generation of nanostructured silicon.
