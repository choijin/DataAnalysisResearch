<AbstractNarration>Examining and comparing the flow field structures of both ionosphere and thermosphere can tell us why they might be aligned at certain times but not at others. As part of this CAREER award, the PI will integrate geospace science, plasma dynamics and remote sensing education to a diverse range of backgrounds. Educational activities include 1) Earth and space science outreach to underrepresented minorities at area high schools through the Boeing Scholars Academy; 2) undergraduate education through interdisciplinary project-based learning via the IIT Interprofessional Projects program (IPRO); 3) undergraduate research training and undergraduate mentoring of the IIT AIAA student chapter high altitude balloon project; 4) curriculum development at the graduate level; 5) graduate mentoring for multiple Ph.D. and M.S. theses. These activities will be undertaken in addition to dissemination efforts via publications, presentations, and workshops to the broader scientific community. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A common problem in many areas of physics is the motion of material in a moving medium.  In recent years, a mathematical technique called Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) has been used to model how these materials drift and spread with time.  LCS represent the material surface in an unsteady flow separating regions that evolve in qualitatively different ways. Whether the dynamical equations are unknown or unsolvable, the LCS can be an organizing structure in the flow that provides a new context and framework for understanding the system interactions. LCS analysis draws upon the latest knowledge in other disciplines, and it treats the unsteady flow, a historically complex and unpredictable phenomenon. LCS can help to refine our understanding of the underlying dynamics, by providing evidence of the physical processes that lead to unsteady flow divergence.  Although LCS has been used to study the motion of clouds of material in wind, aerodynamic flows, and fluids, it has never been applied to the upper atmosphere.  In this study, the investigators will use LCS to investigate the behavior of structures (e.g., meteoric smoke particles; climate change-related pollutants; space debris) deposited in the upper atmosphere. The goal is to use LCS to determine the mid-to-high-latitude flow fields and their time evolution, the ability to detect and follow these structures during disturbed conditions, and the seeding and propagation of turbulent mixing at equatorial latitudes, which leads to small-scale disturbances and radio signal scintillation that affects HF communications and satellite-based navigation. Successful development of LCS in this study can enable future studies of LCS analyzing the motion of vertical flow in equatorial regions. LCS analysis can be used to understand the chaotic mixing in IT fluid that may cause scintillation, leading to better operational forecasting.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The atmosphere above 100 km altitude consists of neutral atoms and molecules (the thermosphere) and charged particles (the ionosphere).  This part of the atmosphere where low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and the International Space Station orbit behaves differently than the lower atmosphere does.  Neutral winds carry particles around, while Earth's magnetic field moves the ions and electrons.  Just as particles of smoke get carried away from fires on the surface of Earth, material in the upper atmosphere gets transported by neutral winds and charged particles drifting. We would like to have some idea about where the material may or may not end up.  Where charged particles travel determines whether and how well radio communications and satellite-based navigation systems may work when used at Earth's surface.  Certain chemicals such as nitric oxide affect the temperature of the thermosphere, affecting other layers of the atmosphere and possibly affecting LEO satellite drag, so knowing its transport matters.  In fluid dynamics, Lagrangian coherent structures are ridges separating different regions of material transport in a fluid. For example an LCS in the air near the Earth's surface might be the dividing line between a neighborhood whose air is smoke-filled and one whose air is still clear after a certain amount of time.  We are interested in the same kind of dividing lines, but in the upper atmosphere.  The primary objective of this work was to develop the Lagrangian Coherent Structure (LCS) as a key form of analysis for insights into upper atmospheric dynamics. We asked and answered: Where are Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) in the thermosphere, and what do they look like?  Where are the LCSs in the ionosphere, and what do they look like?  Is there a similarity between them, and if so, why?  To answer these questions, we developed an algorithm for calculating the location of LCSs over a spherical domain, handling particles that circle around the globe or traverse the poles.  Then we used models of thermospheric horizontal winds, and calculated the amount of stretching in the wind field over time by tracing particles and seeing how far they separated.  The areas where fluid was most stretched over a time interval was the LCS.  We compared these LCSs with observations of water vapor deposited during several space shuttle launches and observed by satellite and ground-based measurements.  To investigate the LCSs in the ionosphere, we used a general model of electric potential and magnetic field to calculate the degree of stretching in the ion drift field and found the LCSs.  We also used data assimilation, a way of combining models with measurements, to more accurately represent specific events.  We used observations of 1000 km-size patches of charged particle during space weather storms, to track where they would be transported and see how these compared to the LCSs.  We now know LCSs exist in the thermosphere and ionosphere.  Thermospheric LCSs are present in global scale models, are more prominent at 250 km and 350 km than at 150 km altitude, and respond to geomagnetic activity. Thermospheric LCSs, by acting as a barrier in the flow, may help explain where space shuttle water vapor plume cannot be transported.  Ionospheric LCSs are present in global scale model drifts and in data-driven drifts at high latitudes.  The LCSs are approximately horseshoe-shaped (like a "U" or "W") around the magnetic pole, oriented with the opening on the nightside, and respond to geomagnetic activity.  High-latitude ionospheric LCSs, by acting as a barrier in the flow, may help explain where polar cap patches may form.  Thermospheric LCSs and ionospheric LCSs are located in the high latitudes and are fairly well-aligned with each other.  The LCSs change latitude across the dayside.   This project supported the research and training in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) of an ethnically and gender-wise diverse group of individuals at several stages of higher education.  The project fully supported one PhD student and partially supported three PhD students in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering. Two students have received their PhDs, one of whom was partially supported as a post-doctoral scholar and continues research in this field.  Two of the PhD students are members of underrepresented groups in STEM. This project provided undergraduate research experience for seven undergraduate students, four of whom are from underrepresented groups.  Three of the undergraduates were paid by this award, two of them (both from underrepresented groups) through the Research Experience for Undergraduates supplement.   This project was a key element of the research and scholarship record of the PI (a member of an underrepresented group), who was granted tenure as an associate professor of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering in 2018.  The project enabled the PI to gain visibility, assume leadership roles in the research community, and promote inclusion and diversity in STEM in the public through career events for students at all levels.
