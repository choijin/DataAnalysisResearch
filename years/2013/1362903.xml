<AbstractNarration>With this new award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism Program A (CSDM-A) of the Division of Chemistry supports Professor Jeffrey A. Bartz of Kalamazoo College in a project investigating the dynamics of photochemical bond breaking in a series of gaseous molecules.  The studies will evaluate the influence of the shape of the starting molecules on the mechanics of their dissociation. This research, which will be carried out by undergraduate students who will receive training in chemical dynamics, vacuum techniques and laser technology, will contribute to our understanding of processes involved in atmospheric chemistry.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The project will involve photodissociation studies of NO and OH containing molecules in which velocity mapped ion imaging will be used to measure the dynamics and orientation of the NO and OH fragments. An important goal of the project is the elucidation of the role of the conformations of the starting molecules on the dynamics of photodissociation.</AbstractNarration>
