<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site is a joint effort between Syracuse University, SUNY Oswego, and SUNY Upstate Medical University and constitutes a well-structured program for a cohort of 10 students each year. The objective is to train veterans and non-veterans to conduct trauma-related research with veteran participants.  The site offers an online 2-week orientation as well as research mentoring and coursework during a 4-week summer institute by highly qualified and productive faculty members that have a track record of involving undergraduates in their research. In addition to these faculty mentors, several consultants from various military and non-military backgrounds provide a novel combination of perspectives to address multidisciplinary research questions as part of a speaker series. The program draws on resources including seminar rooms, laboratories, and housing through Syracuse University, SUNY Upstate Medical Center, and SUNY Oswego. With respect to impact on program participants, we expect to increase students' ability to conduct trauma research and increase their chances of admission into graduate school. With respect to scientific merit, multiple projects involve students and address important research questions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Current interests include research designed to gain a better understanding of the chemical, clinical, cognitive, and family factors associated with various trauma outcomes.  Being able to better predict the development of PTSD following trauma can support efforts at prevention and treatment of PTSD.  Moreover, our society would benefit from a better understanding of PTSD since the lifetime prevalence of PTSD among adult Americans is relatively high, estimated at 6.8%. This REU site broadens the participation of underrepresented groups by recruiting veterans (particularly minorities and women, when possible) as participants. We also provide an opportunity for veterans to re-integrate to an undergraduate research culture in a safe environment with appropriate supports. Moreover, this veteran participation in the design and implementation of trauma-related research with fellow veterans constitutes a novel application of "participatory research". Beyond the direct benefit to veteran participants, non-veteran participants can learn to appreciate the value of veteran participation in trauma-related research, particularly when that research involves a veteran population.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This REU site provides hands-on training in trauma research methodology; more specifically, the focus is on trauma experienced by service-members while on active duty.  Research training on the impact of trauma in Veterans was successful for the diverse groups of Veteran and non-Veteran undergraduate students funded by this award.  The students, who were recruited from a national pool of applicants, worked in teams with faculty mentors from three institutions to research how well a 6-week online Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction program assisted volunteer Veterans in reducing post-traumatic symptoms utilizing cross sectional studies on this data set.  Students also helped develop a study on Genomic Biomarkers in combat Veterans, which has now been completed.  This genomic project will provide cross sectional survey data and genotyped DNA information, collected by salivary samples, for future cohorts to study and develop their research posters.  Students, from each cohort, consistently have presented their research at annual conferences such as the Eastern Psychological Association Conference, Association for Psychological Science Convention, and the Council on Undergraduate Research's REU Symposium, to highlight these studies and their outcomes.  Graduate school admissions were another succesful outcome of this award, providing a springboard to research-based graduate programs in Psychology, Public Health, and Social Work.
