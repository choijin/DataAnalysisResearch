<AbstractNarration>The goal of this research will be to improve the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) by inclusion of air sea interaction processes over the ocean and the coastal zone.  The WRF is a widely used meteorological mesoscale model that has been used to simulate a large variety of meteorological phenomena.  In collaboration with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) of the Department of the Interior, NCAR scientist will be modified to accurately simulate the atmosphere, especially boundary layer processes over the ocean and in coastal areas.  The scientist will utilize data and results from completed BOEM studies to help improve model physics and for model validation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Successful completion of this research will result in an improved version of the WRF that will be of benefit to the research community.  It alos will provide the BOEM with a valable tool for understainding the atmosphere and air quality in the marine and coastal environment.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During this project, National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) performed Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulations and data assimilation over the Gulf of Mexico, with a focus on processes of air-sea and air-sea-land interaction. NCAR evaluated the model's performance for winds, temperature and moisture in the planetary boundary layer, diagnosed causes of model bias, and explored improvements to the model.  The WRF model together with its companion data-assimilation system (WRFDA) were also used to produce better estimates of meteorological fields, which were needed for assessments at BOEM of the potential for pollution from Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) sources to be transported to the Gulf Coast. WRF enhancements were needed to ensure the highest quality inputs for those assessments.  The intellectual merit of this proposed work includes direct improvements in the WRF model and WRFDA, whose development and refinement is a central objective of NCAR/MMM. Improvements in WRF's simulations of the boundary-layer over the Gulf of Mexico have aided NCAR?s ongoing efforts in the experimental prediction of hazardous weather, especially hurricanes. In addition, the interaction between cycling data assimilation with WRF and efforts to improve WRF was central to this project and is an important element of MMM's refinement of WRF and its physical parameterizations, which is important to the research community that actively uses the WRF model. The system enhancements and new functionalities resulting from this work will be released to the university and broader WRF user communities through MMM's WRF release process.  The broader impact of this work has been to further understanding of the fundamental physics of the WRF meteorological model and the elements necessary to high-fidelity simulations of transport in the boundary layer over the Gulf of Mexico. This is important to the research community for assessing air quality in coastal environments, as transport is one factor controlling the ultimate fate of air emissions from the OCS sources.  Major Outcomes:  The team performed numerous WRF data-assimilation experiments in preparation for extended-period production runs over the Gulf of Mexico. Resulting improvements to WRFDA and refinements to the configuration for the production runs include better use of buoy and CMAN observations by carefully accounting for the specific measurement heights from each observing platform and better use of AMSU radiances through channel selection and tuning of bias correction. The team also developed monitoring procedures to check for consistency and unexpected problems, such as periods of degraded observation quality, in long runs of cycling data assimilation.
