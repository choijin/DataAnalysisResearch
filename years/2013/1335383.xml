<AbstractNarration>The search for new nanomaterials with the right physical and chemical properties for power and energy applications is very intense and is likely to play an ever increasing role as discovering alternatives to fossil fuels becomes ever more urgent. Much less effort is being put in the pursuit of manufacturing of these newly discovered materials. This grant provides funding to fill this niche and investigate a novel approach to the manufacturing of thin films of nanomaterials for energy storage and harvesting applications. The approach is based on the electrospray?a device that has unique capabilities to produce nanoparticles of uniform size and deposit them with control over size, shape, structure and composition. Using clean-room microfabrication techniques for the construction of multiple spray nozzles, one can operate several sprays in parallel for increased deposition rates, to match the needs of practical applications. Specific aims of the proposed research include: deposition of nanomaterials with controlled structure, assembling and testing semiconductor thin films in functional devices and scale-up for inexpensive manufacturing in industrial applications. Applications considered are cells for solar energy harvesting and Si/C electrodes in lithium-ion batteries for energy storage. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The adoption of an inexpensive electrospray ?printing? capability will result in substantial cost reduction in the fabrication and installation of solar cells. In the case of lithium-ion batteries, nanostructured electrodes using synthesized Si/C nanoparticles will lead to increased energy density and, in turn, to greater range for battery use in the transportation sector. Si/C nanoparticles are chosen since they can accommodate large volume changes occurring during charge and discharge cycles of the battery. Importantly, the proposed electrospray manufacturing approach can be extended to other materials, including biomaterials, which will impact broadly the rapidly evolving field of nanomanufacturing.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The project overarching goal was the well-controlled synthesis and deposition of nanoparticles in thin films for solar energy harvesting and energy storage. Principal objectives included: developing a well-controlled but inexpensive synthesis and deposition approach, optimizing it, verifying improvements in the performances of prototypes, and demonstrating its feasibility for scale up. All objective were met. The approach is based on the use of the electrospray, a liquid atomization technique that is capable of dispersing liquids into fine droplets of uniform and controllable size. The electrospray disperses a suitable liquid precursor or a particle suspension into droplets that are either dried in their flight to the deposit area (Figure 1) or undergo chemical reaction (pyrolysis) in a furnace before being collected on a deposit (Figure 3). Two proof-of-concept applications were considered: the synthesis of porous deposits for dye-sensitized solar cells and the fabrication of a Li-ion electrode for high energy density battery developments. In the first application, charged droplets were generated, carrying TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, and deposited using an electric field. We showed how morphology, structure and performance of the resulting films can be controlled by varying: a) nanoparticle loading in the solvent suspension and, consequently, the size of the nanoparticle clusters, b) droplet evaporation rate before impact on the substrate and, consequently, contact of the clusters, and c) film density. We demonstrated examples in which the film structure affected device performance and used electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to rationalize our findings in terms of changes to electrical properties, namely resistance and capacitance, of the electrosprayed cells. Performance merits of this approach and of the alternative standard based on spincoating can be combined synergistically into a two-layer structure of highest efficiency (Figure 2), with densely packed spincoated particles at the bottom of the deposit, where light absorption is critical, and a more loosely packed electrosprayed layer on top, which is advantageous for hole transport in the electrolyte and as a back-scattering layer.</p> <p>In the second application, we developed an approach that uses two electrosprays of opposite polarities to attain a controllable and scalable method for synthesizing nanoparticles with precise control over size, composition, shape, and morphology. It relies on electrospray pyrolysis in which charged, uniform sized liquid precursor droplets are first generated, then electrically neutralized by a second ES of opposite polarity and finally carried through a furnace for the synthesis of the desired nanoparticle, with each droplet serving as a nanoreactor in an environment of independently controlled temperature and residence time. We applied the approach to metal nitrates and synthesized a variety of metal oxides and mixed metal oxides, carbon coated nanoparticles, and hybrid structures of metal oxide-decorated graphene. In a proof-of-concept demonstration of inexpensive scale-up of the technique, we synthesize metal oxides using an array of ESs operating in parallel and a corona discharge to neutralize them. We then investigated the synthesis of a Mn<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>-graphene hybrid nanomaterial and tested it in a Li-Ion battery, verifying improvements in performance by comparison with alternative manufacturing techniques (Figure 3). The research activity was disseminated through three conference presentations and four peer-reviewed articles, all acknowledging NSF support.</p> <p>The broad impact of the research activity is reflected in two areas. First, the work has the potential to streamline energy material fabrication resulting in substantial cost reduction in a continuous flow process. The approach is versatile and adaptable to new materials in the rapidly evolving field of nanotechnology, beyond the specific examples that were contemplated in the present project.<strong> </strong>The developed platform will be useful also in other energy applications, including supercapacitors and technologies for hydrogen production and fuel synthesis, as well as thin film sensors and applications of heterogeneous chemical catalysis and biomaterials.</p> <p>A second area of broad impact is the spillover of this research activity in teaching and outreach activity in the training of students, including: one graduate student, who successfully defended his doctoral dissertation; two undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities and one high school student, who were hosted for two-month research stages in the Summers of 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively, working on various aspects of the project.
