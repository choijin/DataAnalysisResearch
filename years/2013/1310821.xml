<AbstractNarration>Soil organic matter is the largest land reservoir of carbon and nitrogen, the two major building blocks of all life on earth. Warmer temperatures may accelerate the breakdown of soil organic matter by microorganisms, causing major shifts in the dynamics of carbon and nitrogen. Among other impacts, the transformation of soil organic carbon into carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could intensify climate change. But warming will accelerate soil organic matter breakdown only if microbes have access to it. Stabilization of organic matter in soils by minerals is the dominant control on the availability of soil organic matter to microbes and so is the key to understanding how soil carbon and nitrogen will respond to warming. The approach proposed here uses a simple, realistic soil incubation experiment involving plant material labeled with isotopes to reveal the effects of warming. This experiment improves upon previous work by enabling tight control over carbon inputs and other driving variables (temperature, moisture, etc.), while using real plant material and soils. The results will improve our ability to predict future climate change and advance our understanding of the global carbon and nitrogen cycles. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Throughout this study, the results will be disseminated through the mentoring of undergraduate students and presentations made at scientific meetings. The investigators will work with the Academic Advancement Center at Colorado State University, to recruit a low-income, first-generation and disabled student into a new program for undergraduate research. This student will take part in a series of workshops designed to improve scientific literacy and critical thinking and will be involved in every aspect of this project. At the culmination of this work, results will be presented at the 6th International Workshop on Soil and Sedimentary Organic Matter Stabilization and Destabilization and at the Colorado Front Range Student Ecology Symposium. By attending meetings designed for different audiences, the results will be made broadly available and integrated into research in multiple fields.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Soil contains huge amounts of stored carbon and nitrogen, and it has the capacity to store even more. Soil carbon is vulnerable to environmental change; for example, changes to our climate or to soil management can cause soil carbon to be released to the atmosphere, where it can accelerate climate change. Nitrogen in soil is an essential plant nutrient, and plays many other important roles in ecosystem functioning. Hence, the large stores of carbon and nitrogen in soils &ndash; also how carbon and nitrogen enter the soil, and how long they remain there &ndash; are of great interest to the scientific community. In this project, we sought to better understand the pathways by which carbon and nitrogen from plant material enter and remain in the soil, and how changes in the type of plant material, or the temperature of the soil, would affect those processes. We performed two separate experiments, one that showed that plant material type (leaves versus roots) does affect the amount of carbon and nitrogen stored in soil, and one that showed that warming also affects the amount of carbon and nitrogen stored in soil. This research is an important step toward a better overall understanding of soil carbon and nitrogen, and how changes to our environment might affect soil fertility and feedbacks to climate change. This work has been disseminated to the scientific audience at two scientific conferences, and two manuscripts for peer-reviewed publications are underway. As part of this project, we mentored an undergraduate student from Colorado State University, who took part in his own research project, and presented his results at a symposium for undergraduate research at Colorado State University. We also used this opportunity to recruit students from the Academic Advancement Center at Colorado State University to a specialised, year-long course that paired them with research mentors and provided them with hands-on experience in environmental research.
