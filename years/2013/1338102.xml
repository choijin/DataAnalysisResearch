<AbstractNarration>Proposal #: 13-38102&lt;br/&gt;PI(s):  Yu, Shucheng&lt;br/&gt;  Chiang, Chia-Chu; Xie, Mengjun; Yoshigoe, Kenji&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Arkansas-Little Rock&lt;br/&gt;Title:   MRI/Acq.: Cloud Computing Infrastructure for Research and Education     &lt;br/&gt;Project Proposed:&lt;br/&gt;This project, acquiring private cloud instrumentation, aims to conduct six research projects spanning areas of social networks, secure cloud data system, cryptography, biomedical computing, and data stream analysis. The instrumentation will enable the following projects:&lt;br/&gt;- Analysis of Sybil Attacks in Large-Scale Social Networks,&lt;br/&gt;- Secure Data Access Control for Cloud Storage Systems,&lt;br/&gt;- Study of Cache Pollution Attacks in Named-Data Networking,&lt;br/&gt;- Development of a Cloud-Based Graph Theoretical Analysis Framework for Human Brain Connectomes,&lt;br/&gt;- Parallel Processing of Fully Homomorphic Encryption, and&lt;br/&gt;- Performance Real-Time Stream Analysis on the Cloud.&lt;br/&gt;This private cloud, serving three universities (U AR-Little Rock (UALR), U AR-Pine Bluff (UAPB), and &lt;br/&gt;U Central AR (UAC)), will be the first in the state dedicated to research and teaching.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The instrumentation enriches the research and educational activities within the universities and overall state. Hence, new courses can be developed and implemented. Moreover, the cloud infrastructure provides unique opportunities for minority students that will then have access to cutting-edge high-performance ubiquitous computing resources. The computing infrastructure creates many education and training opportunities for the students through the process of its installation, operation, and maintenance. A Summer Undergraduate Program of Entrepreneurship and Research (SUPER) program and the ACM club at the university will offer training within and beyond the institution. Also, an undergraduate summer research program on cloud computing will be established to expand the opportunities throughout this EPSCoR jurisdiction.</AbstractNarration>
