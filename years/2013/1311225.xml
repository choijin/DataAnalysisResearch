<AbstractNarration>Dispersal allows species to persist globally despite local extinctions by tracking environmental conditions. Reef-building corals are declining worldwide, largely attributable to global warming. Climate models indicate that existing coral habitats will continue to deteriorate, suggesting that dispersal to higher-latitude reefs might allow escape from poor conditions. However, the question remains if corals possess enough dispersal potential to escape, and can they evolve to increase their dispersal capabilities? We hypothesize that coral dispersal potential is a heritable, and therefore evolvable, trait associated with specific larval energetic profiles, including lipid and protein metabolism rates reflected in differential expression of metabolic genes. Our research quantifies the genetic variation in these processes and investigates the underlying molecular mechanisms that may be the targets of natural selection under climate change. Establishing the extent to which corals might be able to avoid the adverse effects of climate change through range shifts will enable improved predictions of coral persistence and add to our basic understanding of adaptive evolution in the sea. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project provides broad opportunities for public outreach and education. Coral biology is enticing for undergraduate volunteers and the co-PI has mentored twenty-five undergraduates from diverse backgrounds. Students learn how to use genetics and bioinformatics to answer questions of ecology and evolution. This research also involves students from James Cook University in Australia. Public dissemination of science is also extensive ranging from public lectures at ?Science Under the Stars? series to participating in Woman in Science events.</AbstractNarration>
