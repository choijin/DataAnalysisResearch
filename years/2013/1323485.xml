<AbstractNarration>This research and development project explores the mechanisms that initiate and support innovation in early childhood education, especially in combining informal learning via public media and technology with teacher and family interactions to maximize children's math learning.  Deliverables include 27 episodes of Peg+Cat, an animated math adventure series on PBS, 8 related online games and apps, summer math institutes and school-year training for preschool/Head Start teachers, and complementary activities and resources to support parent's knowledge and practice and student's engagement, interest, and learning of foundational math concepts. The research agenda will test several hypotheses regarding the strategies to extend teacher's math content knowledge and pedagogy and parent/ caregiver's understanding and valuing of math.  A key question will focus on how coupled learning opportunities (professional development for teachers, transmedia, and support for families) enable and sustain children's engagement and learning in math.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Formative evaluation of the media components will use focus groups of 3-5 year olds to assure develerables are engaging and accessible.  The summative evaluation by Rockman et al will focus on how well the project met its overall goals including the project implementation, and impacts on Head Start teachers, parents/caregivers, and preschoolers.    &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project's transmedia deliverables will reach millions of preschoolers through daily PBS broadcasts and online games and apps.  Fifty Head Start teachers will participate in the two-year professional development program and will be using new content knowledge and pedagogy to teach 550 Head Start children in southwest Pennsylvania and engage their parents/caregivers.  The Head Start infrastructure will provide further dissemination of the project's findings and resources.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Background  Early exposure to STEM, including math, supports children?s academic growth, cultivates early critical thinking and reasoning skills, and enhances later interest in STEM careers (National Research Council, 2011). While all children have the capacity for math achievement, teachers often do not regard math as critical to young learners? development, and many lack the confidence to help children learn math. Early childhood educators also often have negative attitudes and low self-efficacy regarding math and inadequate knowledge of math content (Clements &amp; Sarama, 2009). This may explain why they spend, on average, only 7% of instructional time on math (Farmer, 2012). Programs designed to improve early childhood educators? confidence and pedagogical content knowledge have the potential to enhance children?s math learning in early childhood education (ECE) classrooms. Project Overview  Peg + Cat Early Learning of Math Through Media (ELM2) was a three-year project, funded by the National Science Foundation Advancing Informal STEM Learning program. The project encompassed production of Peg + Cat, an animated math-based PBS television series for preschoolers and complementary games and apps, piloting of a professional development (PD) institute for Head Start teachers, development of family engagement resources, and research to advance the field?s understanding of how to help teachers effectively support young children?s math engagement and learning.
