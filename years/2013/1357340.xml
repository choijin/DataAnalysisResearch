<AbstractNarration>This project examines the emergence of novel organizational forms by studying changes in and re-combinations of social networks that are based on kinship, economic, and civic linkages.  The research focuses on  social networks as foundations for other institutions and collects unusually detailed data on a specific  historical case that produced organizational novelty and inventions so prolifically that it influenced the development of western civilization. This study continues a trajectory of research by the investigator in which previous findings from research on Florence Italy have been generalized and applied to analyses diverse cases.  Specifically, this past research has been used in generating better understandings of the rise of capitalism in Europe, the transformation of Communism in the twentieth century, and the biotechnology industry in Silicon Valley. A central outcome of this project will be the completion and public release of a relational data base on changing economic, civic, and kinship networks among about 70,000 citizens. This will be further generalizable to modern and diverse cases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The "emergence of organization novelty," the subject of this research, has broad relevance. The Florentine economy has been exceptionally resilient in the face of shocks, wars, plagues, and social revolts. Florentine industry shifted from wool-manufacturing, to international banking (the economic foundation of their extraordinary wealth and cultural patronage), to silk production during this time frame. Similarly, Florentine governmental and civic institutions were remarkably inventive and flexible. Many constitutional systems of representation have been experimented with, ranging from democratic to oligarchical to centralized in effect. By studying these specific cases, this research will contribute to answering the broad general question of what makes macroeconomic, civic and governmental flexibility and resilience. The findings from this research enable theoretical development that can be applied to similar modern conditions. Increasing and improving general knowledge about causal interrelationships between (easily visible) institutional order and (hard to see) social-network foundations has potential for wide application beyond this particular case study.</AbstractNarration>
