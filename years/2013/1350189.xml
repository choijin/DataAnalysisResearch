<AbstractNarration>Global nitrogen needs are likely to be met through a combination of chemical fertilizers and cultivation-induced biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). The majority of cultivation-induced BNF occurs in symbiotic nodules of legumes such as soybean. Understanding the development of symbiotic nodules and enhancing biological nitrogen fixation would help reduce chemical fertilizer usage, and provide a sustainable supply of clean water, fertile land and a benefiting habitat for future generations, an immense benefit to the society. This project will provide research training for three graduate students and multiple undergraduate students in plant biology. Undergraduate and graduate exercises in bioinformatics will be developed using data from the project and disseminated for use by other educators. Results from the project will be disseminated through a project website, public databases, and relevant biological repositories. "Rhizodive", a statewide integrated research and training pipeline involving high school students, teachers, and university students to examine rhizobial diversity using trap legumes will be executed (with targeted recruitment of schools with significant minority enrollment). These activities will cultivate and promote scientific interest among the younger generation, promote participation of minorities in STEM areas, help develop a competitive STEM workforce, and enhance STEM curriculum and educators. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will utilize novel genomics-empowered approaches to discover molecular signaling mechanisms that regulate legume nodule development. Based on evidence from gene expression, microRNA sensor and suppression assays, one emerging hypothesis is that microRNAs are one of the crucial determinants of the development of different nodule zones. The project will test this hypothesis utilizing a combination of genetic, molecular and micro-imaging approaches. Specifically the results from the project will help identify early signaling pathways that cause distinct development of different nodule zones. This knowledge in combination with other advances in plant breeding and biotechnology will enable the optimization of BNF (or possibly transfer it to non-legume crops) thus helping to meet global N needs in a sustainable manner. This is especially relevant in the context of a growing world population (expected to reach 8-11 billion by 2050), reduction in cultivable area due to urbanization, and the essential nature of nitrogen in maintaining plant productivity.</AbstractNarration>

Humans and animals obtain nitrogen from plants which in turn obtain it primarily from the soil. Therefore, nitrogen is a major plant nutrient and is supplied in the form of fertilizers in agricultural production. Nitrogen supplied in the form is fertilizers is susceptible to leaching and only ~50% of it is used by crop plants. The leached nitrogen leads to water pollution (e.g. algal blooms) and excess soil nitrogen can contribute to greenhouse gas emission (e.g. N<sub>2</sub>O). In addition, production, transport and application of nitrogen fertilizers are energy intensive processes. Biological nitrogen fixation is a sustainable alternative to the use of nitrogen fertilizers. Biological nitrogen fixation is a process where some bacteria and bacteria-like organisms convert nitrogen gas into plant-usable ammonia. Association of plants with such microbes enable them to meet at least part of their nitrogen needs through biological nitrogen fixation. Legume (bean-family) plants are the best at this; They produce small bead-like structures called root nodules where they house a group of nitrogen-fixing bacteria called rhizobia. The plant provides carbon energy to the bacteria who provide nitrogen nutrition in return. Biological nitrogen supplied by root nodules meets ~60-70% of nitrogen needs in soybean, a major legume crop in the United States. A better understanding of this process including what plant genes are involved in housing the bacteria, obtaining and using the fixed nitrogen, and regulating the entire process can help select for and develop soybean varieties that can obtain all their nitrogen needs from root nodules. This project adapted newly developed molecular tools for use in soybean to determine which genes are expressed specifically in two important nodule domains: the central zone where the rhizobia are housed and the peripheral zone that plays a key role in transport of nutrients. The project also helped develop imaging tools to determine how key plant hormone signals varied between the two nodule zones. The results have yielded a better understanding of processes involved in the functioning of these nodule zones and have provided a selected list of genes and strategies that can be potentially used to enhance nitrogen fixation capacity of soybean nodules. The project was leveraged to improve bioscience research infrastructure in South Dakota. In addition, this project developed educational resources for high school teachers to use soybean and other legume nodules to teach key concepts in biology in collaboration with South Dakota science teachers. A 2D puzzle to teach functions of nodule zones, and a fishing game to understand the impact of excess nitrogen on water quality were also developed in collaboration with South Dakota discovery center. The project contributed to skilled workforce development in biotechnology by training five graduate students and four post-doctoral students.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/16/2020<br>      Modified by: Senthil&nbsp;Subramanian</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1350189/1350189_10330649_1608154803873_RhizoDiveCover--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1350189/1350189_10330649_1608154803873_RhizoDiveCover--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Cover of RhizoDive laboratory manual"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1350189/1350189_10330649_1608154803873_RhizoDiveCover--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Cover of RhizoDive laboratory manual"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A laboratory manual with exercise modules for use in middle/high school science classes was developed through this NSF-IOS-PGRP-funded project.
