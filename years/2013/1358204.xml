<AbstractNarration>Technical Description &lt;br/&gt;This U.S.-Ghana International Research Experience for Students (IRES) award supports collaboration in water resources science between Southern University, LA and the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, Kumasi (KNUST). This IRES project establishes a joint effort between the STEM faculty at these institutions, who will undertake effective, innovative, and transformative research that ensures the sustainability of global water resources and large-scale water purification. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The US-investigative team consists of two faculty members from the Dept. of Mechanical Engineering at Southern University and A&amp;M College, the nation's largest Historically Black College and University; the international participants are faculty members of the Department of Materials Engineering at KUNST. KNUST is the host institution for this IRES project and will facilitate arrangements to enable successful research, scholarly visits, and access to the research laboratories for IRES students. Five faculty members from Southern and Kwame Nkrumah will be directly involved in the research and mentoring activities. Student participants from the U.S. include five undergraduate and one graduate student for five weeks each year over three years. This project will train the next generation of researchers and contribute to developing a globally- engaged workforce. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to develop a low cost but technologically efficient composite material for sustainable water purification. It will examine the process of adsorption of the fluoride and other microbial contaminants onto the composite material developed for enhanced fluoride removal. Three separate research tracts that students can choose are: 1) Characterization of fundamental micro-structural properties of laterite, 2) Evaluation of a composite Laterite with alumina and magnesium oxide nano-particles to enhance adsorption of fluoride, and 3) Evaluation of a composite laterite with calcium oxide and silica nano-particles to enhance adsorption of fluoride.&lt;br/&gt;Students will learn data acquisition techniques and the ability to analyze and interpret scientific information. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Description &lt;br/&gt;Students majoring in STEM fields will have the opportunity to engage in research in an international environment where they will have to adapt to solving non-traditional problems. &lt;br/&gt;Additionally, the IRES experience is expected to: 1) enhance US-student global awareness and perspectives, 2) provide experiential learning opportunities for students through multidisciplinary&lt;br/&gt;and multi-institutional partnerships; 3) enhance the ability of water resources science faculty to conduct collaborative research through international engagements. The project will raise&lt;br/&gt;general awareness about related issues and the need and advantages of studying the topics&lt;br/&gt;in multidisciplinary and internationally collaborative environments. The research findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations at conferences organized by the World Health Organization and the American Society of Civil Engineering.</AbstractNarration>
