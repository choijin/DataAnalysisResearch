<AbstractNarration>The PIs request funding to develop a rapid vertical profiling autonomous underwater vehicle with biogeochemical sampling capabilities. This system will add a new, and much needed, biological dimension to the GEOTRACES program, and would most likely become the central instrument for a GENOTRACES microbial and enzymes research initiative - ultimately enabling the global marine mapping of microbial DNA, RNA and proteins, including key biogeochemical enzymes. The PIs will develop a wireless water-column sampling technology: a 6000m rated autonomous vertical sampling vehicle with a high throughput sampling and sensing payload. The combination&lt;br/&gt;of rapid vertical transport, the 6000 m depth range, and the need to stop at numerous target depths represents a novel and significant engineering challenge and developing a vehicle capable of this task with the sampling capacity needed for GENOTRACES "-omic" sampling is the objective of this proposal.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project leads oceanic sample collection into the future where they will need to be collected from a variety of autonomous platforms. This is of great societal importance because understanding the ocean, its sheer magnitude, and its role in global processes will require more than ships and moorings, it will take samples from many parts of the ocean and their analysis by many techniques for many different analytes. This project will also sponsor two consecutive teams of undergraduate female engineering students from Smith College's Picker Engineering Program during their senior engineering design course. This is seen as a real plus and an innovative outreach effort. The PI has very successfully done this in the past.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This collaborative project developed a new underwater vehicle that is capable of rapidly and autonomously collecting samples from the ocean water column for biological and chemical analysis. Such sampling of the oceans is critical in order to understand how marine organisms interact with physical and chemical components of the oceans, and how these interactions underpin processes that are of global importance to human society, such as the support of fisheries and the sequestration or release of carbon from the oceans.   The specific goal of the project at the University of Michigan was to evaluate the capability of the new sampler to collect and preserve biological samples for subsequent extraction and sequencing of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA).  Rapid collection and preservation of samples for this purpose is highly valuable because it allows researchers to determine which microorganisms are in a sample and how they are interacting with other organisms and with their environment.  The development of an autonomous sampler with this capability, which does not require additional ship time because it can sample in parallel with other types of sampling, opens up new possibilities for integrated (physical, chemical, biological) studies of the oceans.    The results of this project show that the newly developed sampler, named CLIO, is able to rapidly and efficiently collect microbial samples that are comparable in quality to conventionally collected samples (those collected by niskin bottles).  We find that the estimated extent of contamination (i.e., microbes introduced as artifacts during sample collection/handling rather than those of interest in the ocean sample) of samples collected by CLIO is comparable to that collected by conventional methods.  The composition of microbial communities from surface and mid-depth waters (&lt; 500 m) collected by CLIO were indistinguishable from those collected as the same depths through conventional means. However, at greater water depths, the composition of samples collected by the two methods diverged.  This effect was interpreted as distinct imprints of contamination from the two different collection methods, and was only apparent at greater depths due to lower biomass of target samples.  More extensive spatial and temporal sampling is required to confirm this hypothesis.  Overall, this project shows that CLIO is an effective method of autonomously collecting samples for microbiological and biogeochemical studies.  The results pave the way for the use of CLIO in new initiatives aimed at characterizing how microbial communities vary across the world?s oceans and their physical and chemical gradients.  This project also supported and trained one PhD student.          Last Modified: 11/29/2018       Submitted by: Gregory J Dick]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
