<AbstractNarration>Loss of personal data or leakage of corporate data via apps on mobile devices poses a significant risk to users. It can have both a huge personal and financial cost. This work is designing new novel techniques to help reduce the risks for end-users who use a single device for multiple spheres of activity.  Getting security right when a single device is used for multiple spheres of activity is a major research challenge, with unforeseen information flows between various subsystems that are currently difficult to control. This project is developing mechanisms to better manage flows between apps on a mobile device so that users are able to compartmentalize different spheres of activity, such as work and personal use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact: This research benefits both end-users who are concerned about the privacy of their data on mobile devices as well as businesses who wish to permit use of mobile devices for improving efficiency of their operations but are concerned about resulting security risks. Graduate and undergraduate students are trained in the area of security and privacy of information on mobile devices.</AbstractNarration>
