<AbstractNarration>This is a study of radioactive contamination of food. Using semi-structured interviews, surveys, GIS mapping and participant observation, the PI will determine what kind of information was available in the aftermath of a nuclear disaster and will document the coping strategies citizens employed including engaging in their own monitoring and research and collaboration with scientists and groups abroad. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will help identify strengths and weaknesses of food safety assurance systems and nuclear disaster preparedness.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This study examined social dynamics around radioactive contamination of food in the aftermath of the nuclear disaster of March 11, 2011 in Japan. The Fukushima nuclear accident was the worst in the history of Japanese nuclear industry and it resulted in one of the most serious controversies around food safety in Japan. The project explored how the regulatory and scientific experts responded to the threats of radioactive contamination of food and what shaped their decisions; how regular citizens tried to cope with uncertain hazards in daily lives; and how science played a role in citizens? coping strategies. The project?s particular interest was on citizen radiation measuring organizations and other citizen mobilizations-- an instance of "citizen science" by lay people. The study found more than 70 citizen radiation measuring organization established across Japan after the accident. Their activities focused on data taking, service provision as well as advocacy, although each organization had varying degree of emphases on different missions. Data also suggested differences between women and men in terms of how they articulated their fears about contamination and motivations for taking up citizen science to respond to the accident, and kinds of barriers for collective mobilization for environmental justice. The project data was published in journal articles as well as a book, Radiation Brain Moms and Citizen Scientists: The Gender Politics of Food Contamination after Fukushima (Duke University Press).  The study?s broader implications include the need for the authority to be clear about the limits of scientific knowledge and data on radiation; the significance of citizen science to fulfil knowledge gap; and the need to pay attention to gender differences not only in terms of perception of radiation harms but also of freedom to express fears and to take actions in the public realm.
