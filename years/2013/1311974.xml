<AbstractNarration>Cell locomotion plays an essential role during embryonic development, angiogenesis, tissue regeneration, the immune response, and wound healing in multicellular organisms.  The major problems to be addressed in this project are (i) movement by shape changes, (ii) modeling of the intracellular mechanics, and (iii) integration of signaling, actin dynamics and mechanics in an integrated computational model of cell movement.  Heretofore mathematical modeling has primarily focused on the mesenchymal mode, but the investigators first address the other end of the continuum.  The overall objective is to produce a unified description for locomotion in a three-dimensional extracellular matrix that integrates signaling and mechanics.  Movement by shape changes has not been studied in the context proposed, but it has recently been shown to be important in the movement of a number of cell types, and understanding the factors that affect the speed and efficiency of such movement is a challenging problem.  This project develops mathematical models that can be used to study and quantify the importance of various factors, such as properties of the surrounding medium, that affect the efficiency of movement.  The third component continues previous work by the principal investigator on signaling and will integrate a model of the control networks with the mechanical components that comprise the first topics.  This will lead to the first model that incorporates both signaling and mechanics, and will result in a computational tool that should be very useful to the broader community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cell movement is a very complex process that involves the spatial and temporal control and integration of a number of subprocesses, including the transduction of chemical or mechanical signals from the environment, intracellular biochemical responses, and translation of the intra- and extracellular signals into a mechanical response.  While many single-celled organisms use flagella or cilia to swim, there are two basic modes of movement used by eukaryotic cells that lack such structures--mesenchymal and amoeboid.  The former, which can be characterized as ?crawling? in fibroblasts or ?gliding? in keratocytes, involves the extension of finger-like pseudopodia and/or broad flat lamellipodia, whose protrusion is driven by actin polymerization at the leading edge. In the amoeboid mode, which does not rely on strong adhesion, cells are more rounded and employ shape changes to move--in effect 'jostling through the crowd' or 'swimming'.  However, recent experiments have shown that numerous cell types display enormous plasticity in locomotion, in that they sense the mechanical properties of their environment and adjust the balance between the modes. Thus pure crawling and pure swimming are the extremes on a continuum of locomotion strategies, but many cells can sense their environment and use the most efficient strategy in a given context.  This project uses innovative mathematical approaches to better understand the dynamics of cell locomotion, combining novel models with experimental data.  Additionally, the research team includes postdoctoral researchers and graduate students, with the project providing an opportunity to work in an inherently interdisciplinary field.</AbstractNarration>

The reasons for this focus are twofold. Firstly, cell locomotion plays an essential role during many basic processes in biology, including embryonic development, angiogenesis, tissue regeneration, the immune response, and wound healing in multicellular organisms. Moreover, the movement of tumor cells from the site of origin to other parts of the body, a process called metastasis, is responsible for a significant portion of deaths due to cancer. Movement is a very complex process that involves the spatial and temporal control and integration of a number of sub-processes, including the transduction of chemical or mechanical signals from the environment, intracellular biochemical responses, and translation of the intra- and extracellular signals into a mechanical response.  Recent laboratory experiments have shown that numerous cell types display enormous plasticity in locomotion, in that they sense the mechanical properties of their environment and adjust the balance between different modes. At one extreme is pure crawling and at the other is pure swimming, but many cells can sense their environment and use the most efficient strategy in a given context.  Our research had several major objectives. One was to understand how shape changes can propel cells, the forces that drive the shape changes, and what determines the efficiency of a stroke. In that regard we have developed mathematical and computational models that enable us to study how cells can propel themselves, either separately or collectively, and how the type of shape change employed affects the speed and efficiency of movement. While our investigations have focused primarily on movement of biological cells, some of it can also be used to understand the movement of mini-robots, and thus lead to better design of them.  Another major aspect of the research concerns the signaling networks that control how the cell alters it's shape dynamically. The pathways involve molecules that act as molecular switches that relay extracellular signals, both receptor-mediated signals and mechanical signals transduced via molecular contacts with the cellular environment. Experimental work by others has shed light on the networks involved, but a synthesis of these results into an integrated model that can predict how the balances between the pathways determine which mode prevails has not been done in detail, but we have taken an important first step by developing and analyzing a mathematical model of the major components of the network that transduces extracellular chemical signals. The model is based on the current experimental information and is able to replicate numerous observations in several different cell types. Thus the  predictions derived from the model can be used to guide future experiments, which can then be used to refine the model as new facts emerge.       The broader impact of the funded research lies in both the breadth of   potential applications of the work, and in the scientific training of students   and postdocs that were involved in the research.  The results will find   applications in many normal processes involved in development, wound healing,   the immune system and in aspects of cell division and in apoptosis, and adds   to our understanding of cancer metastasis.  Our results on swimming in Stokes   flows are applicable in robotics, where there is significant interest in   designing mobile nano-robots or robotic `cells' powered by stored energy.   Because there was a significant training component of the research that   involved undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs, it   has contributed to the development of human resources in applied mathematics,   specifically, in mathematical modeling and analysis of biological problems.</pre> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/01/2018<br>      Modified by: Hans&nbsp;G&nbsp;Othmer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
