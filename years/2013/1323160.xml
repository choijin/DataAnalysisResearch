<AbstractNarration>University of Tennessee doctoral candidate, Jaymelee Kim, under the supervision of Dr. Tricia Redeker Hepner, will conduct an ethnographic analysis of the use of transitional justice method and theory. The researcher hypothesizes that there is a relationship between perceived efficacy of transitional justice mechanisms and current indigenous rights-related issues. Methods include semi-structured and informal interviews as well as participation observation.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Research sites include Vancouver, British Columbia; Winnipeg, Manitoba; Toronto, Ontario; and Red Deer, Alberta. From 1874-1996, indigenous people of Canada reported suffering from forced assimilation, sexual abuse, and physical abuse in government and church administrated boarding schools; the Canadian government began to actively address these concerns in 2006 with the negotiation of the Indian Residential School Settlement Agreement. The agreement outlines transitional justice mechanisms typically employed in countries undergoing political changes in which historically disadvantaged groups gain degrees of political autonomy. Using transitional justice theory and based on data gathered from Vancouver, British Columbia and the lower mainland, the research presented here focuses on the similarities and differences in goals, perceptions of transitional justice efficacy, and the relationship between past and current human rights grievances of indigenous people. The findings of this project will contribute to critical anthropological discussions about the meaning of justice and reconciliation, specifically in a non-transitioning society that struggles with a legacy of institutionalized discrimination. The research will illuminate how human rights discourse is interpreted by government officials, indigenous peoples, and transitional justice facilitators. Such contextual analyses of transitional justice processes are especially critical due to their increasing use in North American contexts (i.e. the Maine Tribal-State Truth and Reconciliation Commission). This research also funds the education of a female doctoral student in the sciences.</AbstractNarration>

Transitional justice can include an investigative truth commission and survivor statement-taking, a judicial criminal tribunal, amnesty for perpetrators, memorialization and commemoration efforts, excavation of mass and unidentified graves, and reparations in the form of money, goods, or services. Transitional justice originated as a framework for countries that experienced violent conflict and, in turn, a change in governance from authoritarian to democratic. However, because this approach is now used in diverse contexts, this research asked can a transitional justice framework be used to effectively address "historic" human rights abuses that are part of ongoing colonialism?     Observation, participant observation, and interviews were used to collect data from different stakeholders (e.g. Indigenous leaders and community members, lawyers, government employees, grassroots organization members) in CanadaÆs transitional justice process from 2013-14. The process was intended to provide justice, accountability, and reconciliation for Indigenous survivors of CanadaÆs Indian Residential Schools and the framework was created as the result of a class action lawsuit.     Findings reveal that the primary concern of Indigenous people is the presence of structural violence, including institutionalized racism that allows human rights violations against Aboriginals to persist. Individuals and leaders from all aspects of the Indigenous community believe that justice cannot be served and that reconciliation cannot occur until structural violence against Aboriginals is remedied. Examples of structural violence that appeared in the findings include:  the disproportionately high number of Native children in the Canadian foster care system the disproportionately high number of missing and murdered Indigenous women the continued desecration of Indigenous graves and lifeways the recurring toxic contamination of Indigenous land and health due to natural resource extraction   Of the hundreds of Indigenous participants in this project, every person appeared directly affected by the residential schools, desecration of Native graves, the missing and murdered women, the foster care system, or environmental development.     Awareness of these highly polarized sociopolitical issues between Indigenous peoples and the government of Canada is critical to understanding the relationship between survivors of human rights abuses and the perpetrating government, especially for Indigenous peoples with histories of colonialism.

The government-administered, top-down initiatives exist exclusively to address the residential school legacy, which is not viewed by Indigenous people as separate from their current experiences of violence. Even if viewed separately from other forms of violence, the intergenerational effects of residential school assimilation and trauma continue to permeate Native lifeways. The residential schools created countless individuals who comprise a large component of the homeless population, have high suicide rates, and have become an even more vulnerable and marginalized population.
