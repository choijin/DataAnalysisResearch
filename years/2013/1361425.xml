<AbstractNarration>This project centers on the development of principled statistical methods for understanding the formation and growth of amyloid fibrils, protein aggregates with broad functional and disease-related biological relevance.  Protein fibrillization is a basic biophysical phenomenon that underlies problems of immense social concern. These include diseases such as Alzheimer's, cataract, and type II diabetes that are increasingly prevalent in our aging population, as well as economic costs and food security concerns related to prion disease in cattle and other non-human animals.  The proposed research has the potential to inform the search for solutions to these serious societal problems, resulting in both economic savings and improvements in individual lives.  By developing new predictive and data analytic techniques and validating them with novel experimental data, the project will advance our understanding of the factors that enhance or inhibit protein fibrillization while also producing statistical innovations that can be potentially applied to other problem domains. This project will also provide a unique interdisciplinary training program for graduate and undergraduate students, incorporating novel statistical methods, programming, and experimental techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research project combines modeling techniques from the mathematical social sciences with theoretical and experimental methods from biophysical chemistry, enabling us to approach biological problems in novel ways. The technical innovations of this project are focused on two areas.  First, it will develop new approaches to Bayesian model integration in which integrated predictions will be obtained from multiple, potentially non-statistical models in cases with little or no test data. Second, the project will develop novel model families for fibrillization kinetics, extending methods originally developed for social networks to capture interactions between individual proteins in solution over time scales of hours to days. The modeling work will be validated by combination of existing experimental data and by biophysical data collected by the research team. The research will result in new Bayesian techniques for predicting phenomena related to protein aggregation (especially in a high-throughput setting), and for modeling the kinetics of fibrillization process itself. The proposed research will also lead to novel methods for Bayesian integration of predictive models for phenomena with complex dependence, new Bayesian inference, model selection, and simulation techniques for large-scale dynamic network models, and a body of biologically relevant empirical data on protein fibrillization.</AbstractNarration>

This work combined modeling techniques from the mathematical social sciences with theoretical and experimental methods from biophysical chemistry, making it possible to approach biological problems in novel ways.  These methodological developments were coupled with the collection of new experimental data and analysis of existing data sets, with the goals of producing novel methods for the study of protein aggregation that are statistically principled and empirically grounded, and of advancing our understanding of the factors that shape protein aggregation.   The intellectual merit of the work included the first general typology for amyloid fibril structures, based on the topology of non-covalently bonded interactions among monomers.  We introduced a practical energy scoring procedure for identifying such interactions from solved NMR, X-ray, or cryo-EM structures, showing that all fibrils reported to date belong to five topological classes.  We also introduced a network analytic modeling approach adapted from methods originally developed to study social networks (the exponential family random graph models, or ERGMs), allowing us to recapitulate all observed fibril types in equilibrium.  Using a kinetic extension of this ERGM family, we recapitulated subtle features of experimentally observed fibrillization kinetics (including formation of off-pathway oligomers and transient gel states) and demonstrated the presence of multiple distinct pathways for certain fibril types.  This approach models aggregation topology directly, and is orders of magnitude faster than atomistic or more conventional coarse-grained schemes, allowing large systems to be modeled from independent monomers to mature fibrils within minutes on a standard laptop.  This work also led to innovations in the study of ERGM reference measures required for realistic model scaling.  These developments are essential for meaningful biophysical network models and have also informed applications of similar models to social networks.  Given the high-dimensional nature of models for both aggregation processes and IDP behavior, other contributions involved techniques for comparative analysis of structural and trajectory data.  These include kernel-based strategies for conformation-space segmentation and inference for separatrices in high-dimensional phase spaces from sampled trajectory data, as well as novel network-analytic methods for comparing protein structures; the latter includes a new network-analytic approach to comparative analysis of active site structures, which we subsequently applied to clinically observed mutants of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (a therapeutic target for combating the COVID-19 pandemic).

The project also supported innovations in NMR instrumentation of potential importance for studying protein aggregates.   Broader impacts of the project including the training of ten undergraduates (five from underrepresented STEM groups), one Masters student, seven doctoral students (four from underrepresented STEM groups), one postdoctoral researcher, and several high school students who participated in research activities (two of whom became authors on published work from the project).  Six of the seven doctoral students have successfully completed their Ph.Ds, going on to postdoctoral or industry research positions.  One project Ph.D. and the project postdoctoral researcher transitioned to academic positions.  The project supported curricular development activities, and project research was featured in several week-long summer tutorials offered as part of the UCI Chemistry and Materials Physics program.  The project supported two five-week summer sessions of the Chemical Biology cluster of COSMOS, the California State high school Summer School for Math and Science.  Project members assisted with a STEM Preparation Program run by UCI's Center for Educational Partnerships, bringing 100 disadvantaged students from regional high schools to to campus to tour chemistry labs, learn about how to become a scientist, and find out what a STEM career entails.
