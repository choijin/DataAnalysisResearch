<AbstractNarration>As environments change over time, vegetation must adapt, migrate or die. The ability of plants to migrate is one of the more intractable and unanswered problems in both biogeography and ecology. Recent advances in genetics allow analysis of plant migration potential that previously had been impossible to assess. Under a changing climate, vegetation zones may shift. The magnitude of those shifts as well as the speed at which those shifts occur can be determined by both the rate of climate change and the rate at which elements of vegetation communities are able to respond to those changes. The ability of plants to disperse their seeds and for those seeds to become established under climate change is not well known. This research will make a vital contribution to the literature on transition zones (ecotones) among different vegetation types by finally answering the question whether new individuals at one wide-spread vegetation transition (the alpine treeline) are derived from the local environment versus if they are traveling long distances. The procedures developed to determine dispersal distances at treeline could also be extended to other ecotones or ecosystems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will examine the central questions above by employing microsatellite (short sequence) analysis of genomic DNA to identify the genetic sub-populations of both white spruce and mountain hemlock in southcentral Alaska. These populations will be used to determine if recruits to the treeline are more closely related to near or far populations, thereby determining the prevalence of long versus short distance dispersal. A parentage analysis will also be conducted to estimate actual dispersal distances and directions. This research will aid in the training of both graduate and undergraduate students and strengthen ties between scientists in the US and Germany. Efforts will be made to recruit under-represented groups of students in the study. Furthermore, interaction with the general public will be facilitated through the connections that have been made and will be further strengthened with the US National Park Service (NPS) and the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Educational outreach opportunities will include public presentations to NPS personnel as well as dissemination of key findings to visitors to the Kenai Fjords National Park, the Kenai National Wildlife Refuge, and to local schools in Texas.</AbstractNarration>

This research addresses the pattern of seed movement within the alpine treeline ecotone using a combination of biogeographic and genomic methods to determine its short and long term migration potential.  We used high throughput genome sequencing to identify 1000s of useful molecular markers spread throughout the mountain hemlock genome. These markers were then used as a way to assess seed movement at the alpine treeline ecotone on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska. We addressed three broad objectives in this research.

Lastly, we assessed the relationship between genomic diversity and growth stability within the alpine treeline ecotone.  We found that at mountain hemlock treelines the primary mode of reproduction was sexual, with 100% of multilocus genotypes being unique. A parentage analysis identified 11% of dispersal events as occurring within the alpine treeline ecotone at distances up to 326 m. Long-distance dispersal was assessed at the tail (99thpercentile) of the dispersal curve where we identified frequent long distance dispersal (&gt; 450 m) and both high seed and pollen immigration at mountain hemlock treelines.  Lastly, our analysis of genomic diversity found that there was no significant correlation between individual tree genomic diversity (observed heterozygosity) and tree growth (measured as both average tree ring width and variance in tree ring width).  However, average tree ring width and variance in tree ring width were significantly correlated (P&lt; 0.01) suggesting that under poor growing conditions, such as those found at the alpine treeline ecotone, trees grow poorly regardless of the level of individual genomic diversity.   Broadly, our results show that seed production within the alpine treeline ecotone is not necessarily required to propel the treeline to higher elevations and that long-distance dispersal and immigration of seeds is sufficient to maintain treelines. What is still unknown is if the rate of effective dispersal can sufficiently track the velocity of climate change in the future.    This project resulted in 1 doctoral dissertation, 3 published manuscripts, and the training of multiple undergraduate students based both at Texas A&amp;M University and UCLA.
