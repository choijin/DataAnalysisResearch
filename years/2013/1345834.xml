<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to demonstrate successful pilot&amp;#8208;scale production of stereoblock polypropene (sbPP) thermoplastic elastomers that can be produced, in programmed fashion, over an unlimited range of different fundamental forms by virtue of the ability to exert external control over the relative rates of reversible processes that are competitive with the rate of propagation.  The research effort will involve investigation into the rate of these processes in order to develop a commercially viable procedure for the production of sbPP  materials.  The  anticipated  result is that commercially relevant volumes (&gt;  1 kiloton)of sbPP thermoplastic elastomers can be produced  with tailored  physical properties as technologically viable replacements for existing commercial materials. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is that the large-­&amp;#8208;scale (&gt;1 kiloton) production of sbPP thermoplastic elastomers as technological replacements for existing commercial materials will serve to capitalize on the increased availability of inexpensive propylene monomer that is the product of a recent shift by the petrochemical industry from crude oil to abundant North American natural gas. This shift has contributed significantly to increased cost volatility and global shortages of crude  oil  derived  higher  carbon-­numbered   monomers  that  have  been  historically utilized   for   the   commercial   production  of   thermoplastic elastomers. Successful realization of the stated goals of this project will serve to deliver, with high chemical efficiency, a variety of different grades of high purity sbPP materials with tailored properties that can be transformational for the adhesives, film-packaging and medical markets. The procedures developed during this project will also facilitate future commercial production of a wider range of propylene based polymers utilizing the same catalyst technology. Society will further benefit from the introduction of a more environmentally benign andsustainable chemical technology that provides an alternative to current commercial thermoplastic elastomers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Funding was provided for the development of new initiators and living polymerization technologies that can  support the controlled pilot-scale production of well-defined stereoblock polypropylene (sbPP) materials of targeted molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distribution (also known as polydispersity) as a unique new class of thermoplastic elastomer (TPE).  The principal goal of this research was to secure the availability of multiple kilogram quantities of sbPP TPE materials for commercial evaluation as polymer additives, modifiers, and formulation components within several targeted markets and end-use applications, such as hot melt adhesives.  The crucial primary objectives of the SBIR Phase I/IB research program were achieved during the award period - and most significantly, the successful validation of new initiator and polymerization technology within a pilot-scale, 200 Liter reactor that yielded 9 kilograms of the well-defined isotactic-atactic sbPP diblock possessing a targeted molecular weight (Mn) and narrow polydispersity.  Importantly, this sbPP material is now currently under evaluation by a large corporate partner as a technologically-viable replacement for existing styrene based thermoplastic elastomers.  Work performed under the SBIR Phase I/IB period also led to the successful pilot-scale validation of PPL's living coordinative chain transfer polymerization (LCCTP) technology in which 23 kilograms of a targeted ultra-low molecular weight atactic polypropylene (aPP) oil of very narrow polydispersity was produced in a 200 Liter reactor with a greater than 95% chemical yield for a 50% reactor volume efficiency.  LCCTP is also one of the critical underlying chemical processes for the scalable production of well-defined sbPP materials.  In addition, the aPP oils, which PPL intends to market under the XPURETM trade name, show great promise for use as base stock oils, lubricants, and viscosity modifiers in a range of markets and applications.  The successful validation of PPL's technology on the pilot-scale will facilitate the production of sbPP elastomers and a portfolio of related products, which can be produced in a programmed fashion with physical properties targeted for specific applications, on commercially relevant (&gt;1 kiloton) scales.  This project has demonstrated the technological feasibility of producing previously inaccessible advanced polymeric materials utilizing a commodity propylene feed-stock, which is increasingly available and cost advantaged in the North American market due to the shale-fracking boom.  Capitalizing on this economically important North American resource will provide significant societal benefits in terms of increased economic competitiveness of the US, reversed off-shoring of chemical production, and increased self-sufficiency in energy and chemical feed stocks. Additionally, the successful outcome of this project has highlighted the benefits of NSF financial support for both academic research and subsequent small-business commercialization activities.
