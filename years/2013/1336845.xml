<AbstractNarration>PI: Somasundaran, Ponisseril&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1336845&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Columbia University&lt;br/&gt;Title: SusChEM: Rational design of aqueous interfaces of Earth abundant and nontoxic transition metal sulfides for photocatalytic conversion of CO2 to fuels&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project focuses on understanding aqueous interfaces of Earth abundant and nontoxic transition metal sulfides to engineer a cost-effective photo-electrocatalytic CO2 reduction system. The biggest roadblock to making scalable the sun-light powered synthesis of carbonaceous fuels from CO2 and water is the lack of a catalysts which is simultaneously efficient, cheap, and environmentally benign. The development of such a catalyst is hindered by the infancy of the mechanistic understanding of the proton-coupled multiple electron transfers involved into the CO2 reduction beyond CO and formate. The proposed interdisciplinary research will bridge this knowledge gap by systematically studying for the first time copper and iron sulfide minerals as novel and cheap photocatalytic materials. A novel molecular cocatalytic approach is suggested to overcome the thermodynamic and kinetic limitations of CO2 reduction towards energy-dense fuels. The objective is to determine the mechanisms of the reaction dependence on molecular cocatalysts at the interfaces and in bulk electrolyte, with the ultimate goal to develop more sustainable and efficient photosynthetic systems. Towards this ambitious goal, a team from Columbia University will study for the first time the multiscale physics and chemistry driving artificial photosynthesis of carbonaceous fuels by iron and copper sulfides, using advanced operando FTIR and Raman spectro-electrochemical, (photo)electrochemical, and theoretical (e.g., Density Fuction Theory) methods. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The new more efficient photosynthetic systems based on copper and iron sulfides developed during the research will be a practical step towards scaling up renewable energy. It will lead to novel scalable strategies for the rational design of the interfaces of metal sulfides with water. Apart from artificial photosynthesis, this outcome can find application in immobilizing radionuclides in environmental remediation, as well as in mineral processing (selective separation) of sulfide minerals, in the design of greener chemicals. In addition, this knowledge will broaden our understanding of biogeochemical process including processes in acid-mine drainage, cycling of iron and cupper in deep oceans, and eventually the origin of life. The general results of the research and the new methodology will be included in the PI's undergraduate/graduate level courses.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The ability of certain materials to electrocatalytically convert CO<sub>2</sub> to chemicals and fuel has been capturing imagination of scientists since 1869.<sup>1</sup> Like a plant, such a material can convert external energy into chemical energy. A particular interest to this reaction has been ignited by realization of its potential in the on-going shift from fossil fuel to clean renewable energy (solar, wind, tidal). Indeed, this energy is intermittent and hence has to be stored. As compared to the more evolved alternatives?hydrogen and batteries?CO<sub>2</sub>-derived fuel is energy denser and cheaper. &nbsp;The CO<sub>2</sub> electroreduction technology can also sustain manned Mars missions by supplying fuels and chemicals (CO<sub>2</sub> makes 95% of the Martian atmosphere).</p> <p>However, a commercially viable catalyst for CO<sub>2</sub> electroreduction is yet to be developed. To accelerate the technology development, a research team of Drs Irina Chernyshova and Ponisseril Somasundaran at Columbia University have found answers to several critical questions. One of them is: <em>What is the very first step of CO<sub>2</sub> electroreduction?</em></p> <p>In collaboration with Dr. Ponnurangam, University of Calgary, the team has proved that the reaction starts with the formation of a carboxylate CO<sub>2</sub><sup>&minus;</sup> intermediate which is attached to the catalyst surface via its C and O atoms (Figure 1).<sup>2</sup> It was very challenging to nail this species because CO<sub>2</sub> can adopt a lot of possible structures. It can bind to a catalyst surface O-down, C-down, O,O-down, and C-O down. At the same time, conventional electrochemical methods are not sensitive to these structural details, while the results of advanced microscopic theoretical (quantum chemical) and spectroscopic methods are highly controversial.</p> <p>The breakthrough became possible because, instead of the more frequently used surface enhanced infrared spectroscopy (SEIRAS), the team employed surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). As compared to SEIRAS, SERS offers very important advantages which allow to identify the structure of the reaction intermediate more accurately. Empowered by quantum chemical simulations and conventional electrochemical methods, operando SERS has allowed the researchers to get the first detailed look at how CO<sub>2</sub> is activated at the electrode-electrolyte interface. This result is of the paramount importance because the first reaction intermediate controls the reaction products (selectivity) and their energy costs (energy efficiency). Hence, armed with this knowledge and computational power, researchers are now able to predict CO<sub>2</sub> activation on different catalysts and specify the most promising ones, which opens up an exciting possibility to rationally control this reaction. This insight also allows researchers to better understand photocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> conversion and model the prebiotic pathways from CO<sub>2</sub> to complex organic molecules and hence the origin of life on our planet.</p> <p>Another critical questions being answered in this project is: <em>How CO<sub>2</sub> activation can be promoted? </em></p> <p>Among the most effective of CO<sub>2</sub> electroreduction catalysts, copper Cu is the only earth-abundant material. Moreover, Cu is the only catalyst that can effectively synthesize energy dense fuels such as ethylene. However, its overall electrocatalytic performance is plagued by low selectivity and energy efficiency. In addition, Cu is not robust. Its surface corrodes (changes due to dissolution-reprecipitation/recrystallization). In addition, its catalytic sites are poisoned by strongly adsorbed reaction intermediates and heavy metal contaminants of the electrolyte. Even though these problems are recognized, the main research effort has been focused on solving the problem of the reaction selectivity and energy efficiency, while the criticality to address these two problems <em>simultaneously</em> has been grossly neglected.</p> <p>To bridge this gap, the Columbia team has applied a more holistic approach. Specifically, it was the first to demonstrate that both conversion efficiency and robustness of Cu can be improved by employing N-heteroaromatic polymers.<sup>3, 4</sup> The discovered polymer-metal architecture (Figure 3) is easy to fabricate and it does not include expensive components (e.g., precious metals, enzymes, or macrocycles). In the follow-up detailed mechanistic study,<sup>5</sup> the team has attributed the promoting effect of N-heteroaromatic polymers to the direct interaction of the electron-rich pyridyl groups with the Cu surface and their ability to complex heavy metals.
