<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division, Susanne Striegler of the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville studies selected glyconoamidines as putative transition state analogs of glycoside hydrolysis reactions, evaluates copper(II) complexes as catalysts for glycoside hydrolysis in alkaline solution and investigates microgels catalysts derived from inverse miniemulsions. The research encompasses synthesis, spectroscopic evaluation, molecular recognition and material science and provides training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed catalysts are of outstanding scientific and industrial interest and are expected to provide a novel platform for a shortened synthesis of glycoconjugates and biomarkers of potential pharmacological importance as a long term goal. Further broader impacts on society include outreach efforts of the team to local high and middle schools, and the development of new classroom teaching styles to facilitate student retention, increase graduate rate, and decrease costs and preparation time until graduation.</AbstractNarration>
