<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project investigates the merit of a novel capacitive generator design for use in the wind energy sector. The general design utilizes electric fields to exert forces on mechanical systems, a concept that is routine on the Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) scale but is nonexistent at the macro scale common to most industrial power applications. The technology is synthesized from a multidisciplinary approach of electrical, mechanical and chemical components which provides a novel approach for wind turbines, electric motors, and generators, yet which is theoretically capable of higher sheer stress and lower power loss than any currently available machine. In this project, these various components and the resulting machine will be prototyped, tested, and evaluated against competing, current state-of-the-art wind turbine generator technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to decrease the levelized cost of energy for wind power generation compared to fossil fuels and current methods of wind power generation, while simultaneously enabling a suite of fundamentally new types of motors, generators and actuators for use in global industry. Commercially, the technology resulting from this project will offer a lower cost of torque in a smaller and lighter unit than competing technologies by leveraging electrostatic versus electromagnetic forces. Furthermore, the inherent high torque capability increases system reliability by eliminating gearboxes and their maintenance. Wind energy is a large, global, and high-growth industry, particularly in the ?large wind? market segment (&gt;100 kW). Under the increasing pressures of climatic change, demand for and investment in renewable energies such as wind will continue to increase. Additionally, wind power is most commonly farmed in rural areas; therefore it offers new revenue streams for rural populations and increased investment in rural areas while minimizing detrimental ecological impacts. From a technical perspective, the proposed capacitive machinery is naturally high-torque and low-speed, making it ideal for direct drive applications outside of wind as well, namely as a prime mover for large pumping, drilling, or mining installations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[C-Motive Technologies Inc. is researching the commercial potential of electrostatic motors and generators. The greatest potential advantage of electrostatic machines lies in the low-speed region where the high-torque capabilities can enable direct-drive applications where mechanical gear-boxes were previously required. This technology promises significantly lighter and smaller power conversion systems. The C-Motive platform also projects that motors can be developed with significantly higher torque density than current state-of-the-art electric motors.  This Phase I SBIR grant enabled many advancements, which were primarily attributed to improvements in materials and mechanical design of electrostatic machinery. Using a combination of computer simulation and experimental work, the highest levels of torque and power output from an electrostatic machine were produced, which also exceeded the goal stated in the Phase I application.  This project is potentially revolutionary in that the traditional method and materials used to design and build an electric motor or generator have essentially been established and unchanged for the past 150 years.  Electrostatic technology has the potential to be disruptive, enabling the use of new materials that are potentially cheaper and allowing for more application-specific machines, as well as enabling new applications.  The potential impact is quite large, not only lowering overall cost of power generation/utilization, but enabling new applications and markets.   An electrostatic machine does not require rare earth elements and instead utilizes common materials such as aluminum, steel, or plastic that may be sourced domestically.  By cutting our dependence on foreign supply chains of rare earths (which current wind turbines and electric vehicles depend on), market volatility is avoided.
