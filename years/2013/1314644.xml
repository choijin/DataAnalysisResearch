<AbstractNarration>Cyber security is increasingly seen as the management of economic trade-offs: balancing losses from actual  attacks (e.g., monetary costs, psychological costs due to loss of privacy, etc.) against the costs   of  threat/attack   mitigation   mechanisms   (e.g.,   monetary   costs,   degradation of performance and productivity, etc.). While tackling this multi-attribute decision problem in a highly dynamic and uncertain environment, individuals frequently diverge from rationality. To better understand the deviation from rational behavior and to find effective ways to remediate this (when necessary), a systematic study will be undertaken with the results used to model the human behavior of malicious actors (attackers), non-malicious actors - those who intend to maintain the security of a system (defenders) and actors whose behavior/attitudes are indifferent to system security, but do not intend to attack the system (end users).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The  research  methodology  involves:  (1)  generating  representative  scenarios  of various attack / mitigation decision problems, (2) conducting surveys using scenario simulations to identify the drivers of human behavior relative to each scenario, (3) developing models of human behavior that involve the application of various normative and descriptive models from behavioral economics, (4) comparing the outcomes of the models, (5) conducting controlled laboratory experiments with human subjects to reveal differences between predicted and observed user behavior, (6) using the developed models to help determine what measures can be employed to change human behavior, and (7) implementing, simulating, and evaluating the developed models in a multi-agent system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has three key tasks:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(1) Explore what factors drive an adversary to select a particular cyber-attack and what motivates the benign user to either take or not take action. The proposed research also will examine what steps can be taken to change human behavior - either to not attack, take certain attack paths, or, for a benign user, take steps to avoid or mitigate an attack.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(2) Explore the potential difference between optimal and actual security decisions, to determine when and why deviation from the optimal decision occurs, and identify effective means to correct deviations from rationality that impede the realization of good security outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(3) Investigate how attackers can take advantage of the gap between perceived and actual risk, as well as attackers? risk taking behavior. This is critical to ensuring the development and implementation of effective monitoring and mitigation technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research will develop techniques and models delivering the foundation for future security-focused behavioral modeling research, provide much needed empirical data, and produce a software toolkit for developing, testing and evaluating methods and models to study human security decision-making.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Traditionally, research into cyber-security has focused on improving access control (e.g., firewalls), detection and recovery technologies. In many cases, research and implementation of these technologies has been undertaken in the absence of understanding the motivations and behaviors of the key players in the cyber environment &ndash; the attackers, defenders - those who intend to maintain the security of a system - and end-users - those whose behavior/attitudes are indifferent to system security, but do not intend to attack the system. The research in this project attempted to address this gap between the traditional engineering/computer science disciplines and the social sciences.    Cyber security is increasingly seen as the management of economic trade-offs: balancing losses from actual attacks(e.g., monetary costs, psychological costs due to loss of privacy, etc.) against the costs of threat/attack mitigation mechanisms (e.g., monetary costs, degradation of performance and productivity, etc.). While tackling this multi-attribute decision problem in a highly dynamic and uncertain environment, individuals frequently diverge from rationality. To better understand the deviation from rational behavior and to find effective ways to remediate this (when necessary), a systematic study was undertaken with the results used to model the human behavior of malicious actors (attackers), non-malicious actors (defenders) and  end users.  A general game theoretic framework was developed that models interactions in the cyber environment as a three-way security game between attacker, defender, and user. The framework helps to adopt a structured and focused view on the interactions between the stakeholders and serves as a guideline for developing human studies to understand and model the roles, motivations and conflicting objectives of the players in the security game. The framework shows the inherent relationship between the features of adversarial interactions and different types of game models and identifies the conditions underwhich a specific game type is suitable.  This project had the following impacts:  (1) Help advance the fields of cyber security and psychology through increased understanding of the psychological factors that influence security and privacy decision-making. In particular, the research is focused on what drives an adversary to select a particular cyber-attack vector and what motivates the benign user to either take no action or take a particular action. The project team examined what steps can be taken to change human behavior - either to not attack, take certain attack paths, or, for a benign user, take steps to avoid or mitigate an attack.  (2) Explore the potential difference between optimal and actual security decisions, to determine when and why deviation from the optimal decision occurs, and find effective means to correct deviations from rationality that impede the realization of good security outcomes.  (3) Provide a deeper understanding of how attackers can take advantage of the gap between perceived and actual risk,as well as attackersÆ risk taking behavior. This is critical to ensure the application of the effective monitoring and mitigation technologies.  This understanding has helped form a basis for future research by other investigators, by developing new approaches for realizing effective security prevention, monitoring, and mitigation technologies. Acquired knowledge and technology has and will continue to be exported to a broad community through publication in refereed conferences and journals.   This project has also had an impact on other disciplines in two ways. First, the behavior models being developed are based on motivations and behaviors that are similar to other the behaviors of actors encountered in other domains. For example,greed not only plays a part in motivating some cyber attackers, it also motivates people in the theft of physical property. The project team envisions that the cor...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
