<AbstractNarration>This award supports the high-energy gamma-ray group at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in their participation in the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) experiment.  HAWC is a large field-of-view Teraelectronvolt (TeV) gamma-ray detector currently under construction near Pico de Orizaba in Mexico.  HAWC will map TeV gamma-ray sources with daily coverage of half the sky.  The observation of Galactic and extragalactic TeV gamma-ray sources with HAWC and the measurement of their energy spectra will greatly enhance our understanding of the origin of cosmic rays. HAWC will also map the arrival direction distribution of TeV cosmic rays with unprecedented sensitivity and help us understand the large- and small-scale structure observed in cosmic-ray sky maps.  The observation of distant blazars will constrain the extragalactic background light and the intergalactic magnetic field, which may have been formed during primordial phase transitions in the early Universe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The group at UW-Madison is participating in the development of the trigger and readout electronics, the data acquisition, and the development of the analysis software.  The HAWC electronics integration site is located at UW- Madison, and new electronics are integrated into the system and tested there before being shipped and installed at the site.  The UW-Madison group is also engaged in data analysis.  With early data from the 100-tank configuration, the group will begin a detailed study of the Crab Nebula and the shadow of the Moon to understand and fine-tune the detector performance. They will also study the large- and small-scale cosmic-ray anisotropy.  The group will draw on its experience studying the cosmic-ray anisotropy in the southern sky with IceCube, and eventually combine the HAWC and IceCube data sets for a full-sky analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The HAWC group at UW-Madison will continue to contribute to outreach activities that enhance the general public's appreciation and understanding of science.  The group will also participate in local outreach programs like "Bringing the Universe to Wisconsin."</AbstractNarration>

HAWC is a ground-based gamma-ray and cosmic-ray observatory located at 4,100 m above sea level on the slopes of Sierra Negra near Puebla, Mexico. &nbsp;The main characteristics of HAWC are its large field of view and high duty cycle.&nbsp; It is designed to continuously monitor the northern sky and produce an unbiased map of gamma rays and cosmic rays in the energy range from 300 GeV to 100 TeV.&nbsp; Construction of the observatory was completed in 2015.&nbsp; With this grant, the UW&shy;&ndash;Madison group has contributed to the construction and operation of the experiment, the development of data analysis tools, the analysis and interpretation of data, and the publication of scientific results.</p> <p>One of our main activities was the development and implementation of a real-time monitor for flaring activity in extragalactic gamma-ray sources. &nbsp;Rapid changes in flux, often by orders of magnitude within a few hours or even minutes, are one of the primary features of most known extragalactic gamma-ray sources.&nbsp; As a survey instrument, HAWC scans about 2/3 of the entire sky every day and can identify such extreme flares in real time to issue alerts to other instruments.&nbsp; Multi-instrument and multiwavelength campaigns during extreme flaring episodes can provide insight into the mechanisms powering these sources.&nbsp; As part of this grant, the UW&ndash;Madison HAWC group has developed and implemented an online flare monitor, aimed at detecting episodes of rapid flaring from blazars and other transient sources.&nbsp; The flare monitor uses the Bayesian block algorithm to detect flaring episodes in real time and can identify the majority of strong short flares in less than an hour, allowing for a rapid trigger of follow-up observations.&nbsp; The monitor has been tested with archival data and has been operational in real time since November 2016.</p> <p>HAWC is currently one of the most sensitive detectors for TeV cosmic rays in the Northern Hemisphere.&nbsp; Over the last decade, several instruments observing the northern and southern skies have observed a significant anisotropy in the cosmic-ray arrival direction distribution at these energies.&nbsp; The anisotropy has a complicated shape and shows both large-scale and small-scale structure, with the relative excess of the large-scale structure at the per mille level and the smaller structure about an order of magnitude weaker.&nbsp; Our group has analyzed the arrival direction distribution of TeV cosmic rays with HAWC and confirmed previous results that show anisotropy on all angular scales, from a dominant dipole structure down to excess regions of a few degrees in size.&nbsp; In particular, the HAWC sky map shows three regions of significantly enhanced cosmic-ray flux.&nbsp; The anisotropy is also a strong function of the cosmic-ray energy. &nbsp;These measurements have significant impact beyond cosmic-ray physics, as the origin of the anisotropy remains unknown.&nbsp; While a small residual dipole anisotropy is expected when cosmic rays diffuse from their sources to us, the observed anisotropy has a structure that is considerably more complex than simple diffusion models suggest.&nbsp; Effects from nondiffusive propagation of cosmic rays in perturbed magnetic fields need to be taken into account to interpret the results.</p> <p>In addition to the study of the cosmic-ray anisotropy, we have also measured the cosmic-ray energy spectrum above 10 TeV.&nbsp; Results for the all-particle spectrum are in good agreement with measurements by other instruments.&nbsp; Together with the detection of the cosmic-ray Moon and Sun shadows, these measurements give us confidence that the energy scale of the detector is understood and enable us to quantify the systematic errors on the energy estimation and the detector pointing.</p> <p>The UW&shy;&shy;&ndash;Madison group has also contributed significantly to the construction of the experiment and to the development of analysis techniques and software.&nbsp;
