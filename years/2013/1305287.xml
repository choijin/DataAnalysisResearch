<AbstractNarration>The goal of this proposed infrastructure is to enable research towards the creation of the first buildingwide, pervasive, life-long learning, multi-robot intelligence that is situated within an existing building. This buildingwide intelligence (BWI) infrastructure will be comprised of multiple robot appendages, as well as a suite of static sensors and interactive displays. The ultimate goal of the facilitated research is to enable BWI to interact naturally with all of the buildings users, both learning about the patterns and preferences of its long-term inhabitants, and aiding first-time visitors. In addition, it will be robust to continual changes to the capabilities and availability of its component robots and other sensing and actuation resources; and it will consist of readily available components and open source software for ease of replication. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The most important broader impact of this proposal will be the development and dissemination of a new, open infrastructure suitable for cutting-edge research across the department and university, including reusable components suitable for installation in buildings everywhere. The concept of BWI will also provide impacts on education, including a new curriculum for a project-based course, serving as a platform for graduate and undergraduate research (including as a part of UTs novel Freshman Research Initiative), as well as a very public facade, which will enable public demonstrations at outreach events targeting underrepresented groups such as women in CS and Hispanics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The major goal of this project was to develop the infrastructure  necessary to support multi-disciplinary research towards a new, open,  reusable multi-robot framework for a building-wide intelligence that  interacts with and aids both long-term residents of the building and  visitors.    In order to realize this long-term goal, the first step, and the one  we focused on in this project, is to engineer the underlying  infrastructure.  To this end, we created a flexible, adaptable, and  reusable software and hardware infrastructure.  We created a  smart-building environment that can be programmed and used by building  occupants and visitors, as well as multi-disciplinary researchers  across the university community.  Though executed within a particular  building, namely the new UT Austin Bill &amp; Melinda Gates CS Building,  an important engineering goal was to design the system so that its  software components can be reused with relative speed and ease in  other buildings with different characteristics and usage patterns.    Leveraging this infrastructure, the primary goal of this overall  project was to facilitate and broaden the cutting-edge research of a  large cross-section of the UT Austin AI and robotics community, as  well as members of the broader campus community.  Four specific  research themes were particularly supported:    1.  Vision-based activity recognition and summarization;  2.  Optimization of multi-robot activity in a hybrid centralized/distributed architecture;  3.  Human-robot interaction in a building-wide interface; and  4.  Long-term learning and knowledge acquisition in a large-scale cyber-physical system.       Last Modified: 08/05/2018       Submitted by: Peter H Stone]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
