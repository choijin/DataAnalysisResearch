<AbstractNarration>This is funding to support next year's CSCW doctoral research consortium (workshop) of approximately 10 promising doctoral students from the United States and abroad, along with about 5 distinguished research faculty.  The event will take place in conjunction with the 16th ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW 2013), to be held in San Antonio, Texas, on February 23-27, 2013, and which is sponsored by ACM's Special Interest Group on Human Computer Interaction (SIGCHI).  The CSCW conferences, now an annual event, are the premier venue for presenting research in the design and use of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and networks.  CSCW 2012 was attended by approximately 650 professionals from around the world.  The development and application of new technologies continues to enable new ways of working together and coordinating activities. Although work is an important area of focus for CSCW, technology is increasingly supporting a wide range of recreational and social activities.  CSCW has also embraced an increasing range of devices, as we collaborate from different contexts and situations.  The conference brings together top researchers and practitioners from academia and industry who are interested in both the technical and social challenges encountered when supporting collaboration.  Research reports published in the CSCW Conference Proceedings are heavily refereed and widely cited.  More information about the conference may be found at http://cscw.acm.org/.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Doctoral Colloquium at CSCW 2013 will take place on Saturday evening, February 23 and all day Sunday, February 24, with follow-up activities (including poster sessions) during the conference's main technical program.  Goals of the doctoral consortium include building a cohort group of new researchers who will then have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of new researchers by having experts in the research field mentor them and provide constructive advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference.  Student participants, who are chosen by a review committee based on materials submitted by applicants in response to the CSCW Call for Participation, will make formal presentations of their work during the workshop, and will receive feedback from the faculty panel.  The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other CSCW research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  Extended abstracts of the students' presentations will be published in the CSCW supplemental proceedings, which will be available to conference attendees.  The organizing committee will take proactive steps to ensure and increase participation from institutions and ethnic groups that have been traditionally underrepresented at CSCW.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The CSCW doctoral consortia have been highly successful in providing a forum for the initial socialization into the field of young doctoral scholars, and many of today?s leading CSCW researchers participated as students in earlier consortia.  These workshops traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of CSCW researchers, allowing them both to sharpen the research skills and to create a social network among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development.  Maintaining and fostering research dialog among the diverse disciplines that are present in the CSCW community results in synergistic and transformative research collaborations.   Because the students and faculty constitute a diverse group across a variety of dimensions, including nationality/cultural and scientific discipline, the students' horizons are broadened to the future benefit of the field.</AbstractNarration>

The Colloquium mentors and organizers provided structured feedback designed to help the student develop their thesis ideas further. The other students in the Colloquium were also encouraged to reflect and comment on the work.      The CSCW 2013 Doctoral Colloquium helped a set of PhD students develop critical social networks, and garner intellectual feedback from a number of top mentors in the CSCW research community. Those individual students will go on to complete their dissertations, contributing back to the CSCW community. The Doctoral Colloquium forms a critically important means of developing interdisciplinary research through the intellectual training and development of promising young researchers.
