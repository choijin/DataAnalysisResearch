<AbstractNarration>This research applies anthropological methods to study cybersecurity analysts working in Security Operation Centers (SOC). These analysts process large amounts of data while handling cyber threats. The job requires intelligence and high levels of skills but has many mundane/repetitive aspects.  Adequate tool support is largely lacking and many of the skills and procedures involved are uncodified and undocumented resulting in a large body of "tacit knowledge." This project places researchers trained in both cybersecurity and anthropology into SOCs, working side by side with the analysts. This "participant observation" approach provides a means to access the tacit knowledge of the analysts and to convert it into more explicit knowledge, leading to the development of algorithms that can help automate the tasks. The ethnographic fieldwork also provides an opportunity to observe real security operation centers' work processes and identify factors that influence the effectiveness and efficiency with which cybersecurity incidents are handled. This helps to explain why some cybersecurity problems are hard to address in practice, what roles humans and organizational structures play, and where procedures might be inefficient or completely fail for non-technical reasons. The research is carried out through a collaborative effort involving researchers from Kansas State University and two companies. Results from the research will create practical tools that leverage tacit knowledge in security analytics and automate tasks such as incident response and forensic analysis. Research findings also inform the training of cybersecurity professionals by making explicit the tacit knowledge of effective security analytics acquired during participant observation.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project used anthropological research methods to study cybersecurity operation centers (SOCs) with the goal of understanding what technical and non-technical bottlenecks hinder a SOC to be more effective and efficient. The research team deployed researchers trained in both computer science and anthropology to conduct field work in five SOCs: two in universities and three in major multi-national corporations. The fieldworkers became cybersecurity analysts and conducted the same jobs as the SOCs' employees. In addition, they made detailed field notes and used the notes to analyze the observations. Working together with an anthropologist and multiple industry researchers experienced with SOCs, the fieldworkers conducted thorough and deep analysis of the field note data, under highly disciplined use of social science research methods such as grounded theory and template analysis. The result of the analysis revealed a number of deep insights into SOCs' operation that were not previously known by the cybersecurity community. First, the research re-confirmed anecdotal knowledge of the burnout problem for SOC analysts, and provided a model to explain the burnout phenomenon in SOCs from the grounded-theory analysis of the fieldwork data. This model reveals that analyst burnout is a human capital (mis)management problem and provides specific guidelines as to how management can break the vicious cycle that creates burnout, and thus improve SOC operations. Through further analysis of fieldnote data, the research team provided a deeper model to explain the activities and problems experienced in SOCs, based on template analysis using the Activity Theory model, a well-established theory in social science literature. This model explains that many problems (including burnout) in SOCs are not unique to SOCs, but rather deeply rooted in some fundamental contradictions in how humans organize their activities. These contradictions will never be fully resolved, but their manifestation is in fact opportunities for creating useful innovations -- both technical and organizational -- to mitigate these conflicts so the SOCs can become more effective and efficient. The researchers were able to apply this understanding to make positive changes in the SOCs they did fieldwork in. Many of those changes involve co-creating tools with the analysts to mitigate the manifested contradictions in the SOC's work, after first understanding them through the anthropological research method of participant observation -- researchers participate in the same activities as the people they try to understand. This indicates that useful technical innovation can only be adopted by a SOC and be helpful to its operations, if the tool builders possess deep understanding of the social and organizational dynamics of the SOCs.
