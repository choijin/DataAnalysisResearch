<AbstractNarration>The Workshop: "Physical and Mathematical Principles of Brain Structure and Function" will take place between May 5 and May 7, 2013 in Arlington, VA. Understanding how the human brain works has emerged as a major international focus of research in the coming decade, identified as such in President Obama's State of the Union Address in February 2013 and further developed in President Obama's BRAIN initiative announced on April 2, 2013. This workshop will bring together more than one hundred scientists to discuss how to enable major progress in understanding the brain, an important intellectual challenge of the 21st century. This conference of leading neuroscientists, mathematicians, physicists, materials scientists etc. will identify the specific intellectual challenges that can be met in the coming decades with focused effort. Panels of neuroscientists with expertise in different experimental approaches and model systems will identify important long-term goals that would transform their respective fields and drive progress across neuroscience. In addition, many important questions in neuroscience cannot be pursued with current tools. Bringing together neuroscientists and technologists will catalyze discussions that spur us towards transformative new scientific insights. Advances in systems neuroscience made by integrating existing technologies and devising new methods will provide an intellectual foundation. The workshop will also include many young scientists along with the established leaders in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and by the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems in the Directorate for Biological Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ On April 2, 2013, President Obama, building on earlier comments in his State of the Union address, announced a grand challenge for the scientific community termed the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) initiative. This new æbig scienceÆ project calls for government agencies, private foundations and others to join hands for a historic investment in brain research&mdash;in many respects aiming to accomplish for neuroscience what the Human Genome Project did for genetics.   Soon after the PresidentÆs announcement, on May 5th-7th 2013, the National Science Foundation and the Kavli Foundation jointly sponsored the Physical and Mathematical Principles of Brain Structure and Function Workshop in Arlington, VA. Bringing together over 100 esteemed neuroscientists, this workshop identified key priorities in basic neuroscience research and technology development that should be addressed in order to move forward with the BRAIN initiativeÆs overarching goal of giving scientists "the tools they need to get a dynamic picture of the brain and better understand how we think, learn, and remember".     Following two days of breakout sessions, a number of key aims were identified in each of the nine categories:  (i)  Brain Structure  High-Resolution Anatomy    (ii)  Brain Activity  Pan-Neuronal Recording using Electrical Probes Pan-Neuronal Recording using Optical and Magnetic Probes   (iii)  Animal Behavior  Quantifying and Simulating Behavior   (iv)  Linking Brain Structure &amp; Activity to Animal Behavior  Different Model Organisms  Multiscale and Multimodal Approaches Theories of Brain Function   (v)  Facilitating æBig ScienceÆ in Brain Research  Collecting, Curating and Disseminating data Research Systems, Funding and Incentives     Over 80 white papers addressing these weighty questions were received. The rapporteurs then reviewed these papers and used them to develop topics of discussion for the workshopÆs breakout sessions, A full report on the recommendations are available from the NSF. Here afre some summarties:  While attendees had a range of views regarding the best methods for anatomical studies, most agreed that tools for making synapse-level anatomical maps of the whole brain would be of tremendous value. After raw data of this type is acquired for model organisms, it could be made available online&mdash;so that the broader neuroscience community can contribute to the massive job of analyzing such data, and zoom in on a variety of different circuits of interest.  Attendees concluded that it would be beneficial to develop a wide range of electromagnetic probes, from multicolor fluorescent voltage indicators to probes for comprehensively identifying neurochemical or metabolic changes or conducting magnetic imaging in humans. It was widely agreed that developments in probe technology should be accompanied by advances in microscopy&mdash;allowing faster, deeper tissue imaging in a wide range of model organisms.  Behavior is the final output of the nervous system, representing a drastic reduction in dimensionality that can be measured via video, audio and muscle recordings.  Behavior should be studied at high resolution, on multiple spatiotemporal scales and in ethologically natural, yet dynamically controllable settings. One goal is to develop large databases of context-specific behavioral reperotoires for various model organisms. Unsupervised machine vision and data mining methods will then hopefully reveal quantitative links between behaviors and their underlying neural circuits.  Attendees agreed that research on æsimpleÆ model systems should be encouraged under the BRAIN initiative, as these systems offer the unique opportunity to directly link brain activity and wiring diagrams to behavioral outputs, across a range of experimental paradigms. To study these systems more fully, we should encourage the development of methods that permit remote monitoring of animal behavior under naturalistic condi...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
