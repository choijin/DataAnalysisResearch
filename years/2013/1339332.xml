<AbstractNarration>PI: Andrew Doust (Oklahoma State University - Stillwater)&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;CoPIs: Julie Angle (Oklahoma State University - Stillwater), George Chuck (University of California - Berkeley), Jennifer Hawkins (West Virginia University - Morgantown), and Clint Whipple (Brigham Young University - Provo)&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Tillers are axillary branches that are initiated at the base of the grass plant and that create the characteristic tufted form of most grasses.  They play important roles in grain yield and biomass accumulation, and understanding the genetic signals that regulate the number, size and fertility of tillers is of critical importance for optimizing yield potential in the world's major food, animal feed and biofuel grass crops. In addition, the initiation of tillers is important for perenniality in many grasses, and as such, full knowledge of the tillering pathway will contribute to the development of perennial biofuel and grain crops. The panicoid grasses are immensely important for all of these uses, and the full suite of genes that comprise the tillering pathway and the components that have been selected during domestication are largely unknown.  This project exploits evolutionary variation and changes during domestication in three panicoid cereals (maize, sorghum and foxtail millet) and their wild, highly tillered ancestors to uncover the genetic regulation and evolutionary modification of tillering.  Forward and reverse genetic approaches and transcriptomic analysis in both ancestral and domesticated backgrounds will provide insight into the gene networks necessary for growth and development of tillers in panicoid grasses. It is anticipated that the results from this comparative project will extend to and inform experiments across a wide range of agronomically important taxa.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to training postdoctoral associates and graduate and undergraduate students, this project aims to immerse high school science teachers from rural schools and from areas serving high proportions of underrepresented student populations in a research environment that will be combined with professional development activities. This immersion experience will help educators gain an explicit view of how scientific knowledge is generated and will assist with their own curriculum development.  They will implement this new content knowledge and pedagogical skills into their existing curriculum, mentoring students and preservice teachers in student research projects, and coaching students in science fair competitions.  Scientific findings and educational outreach experiences will be shared at science and education conferences and through publication in scientific and practitioner journals. All data produced in this project will be accessible through a project website (http://tillering.okstate.edu) and long-term through public repositories including GenBank, Gramene, MaizeGDB and PLEXdb.  Curriculum materials and lesson plans will be made available as they are produced at http://tillering.okstate.edu. Germplasm resources will be available upon request or through the Maize Genetics Cooperation Stock Center (http://maizecoop.cropsci.uiuc.edu).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the grasses, increases in vegetative branching, especially of tillers (branches that originate from the base of the grass plant), can be a major way to increase grain yield, whilst the production of too many tillers can lead to unproductive vegetative growth at the expense of yield.  Our project investigated the genetic networks that control branching in domesticated and wild grasses.  We specifically targeted three warm season C4 crop species from the panicoid subfamily, maize, sorghum, and foxtail millet, and their wild ancestors, teosinte, wild sorghum, and green foxtail.  These grasses were domesticated on three separate continents by different cultures, yet all share a similar reduction in branching. The driving question of our research has been, does the same genetic network underlie the control of branching in all three crop species and their wild progenitors?  By creating a domestication pathway based on the identification of the suite of genes responsible for branching in maize and applying it to other grasses, the answer is a (qualified) yes.  However, our research has also highlighted the fact that alternative methods of inquiry, based on different assumptions, can lead to different subsets of the genetic network being identified in different grasses.  Thus, our combined efforts indicate that the developmental and environmental control of branching follows a common roadmap, although with distinct differences, between the three pairs of wild and domesticated grass species.     Our most informative results come from uncovering the genomic architecture of branch suppression in the well-studied model developmental system, maize.  Using CHiP-seq and RNA-seq of the well-known domestication/branching mutants teosinte branched1 (tb1) and grassy tillers1 (gt1), along with fine-mapping of several suppressors of branching, a detailed understanding of the central importance of TB1 in integrating a variety of both hormonal and environmental inputs in suppressing branch activity was revealed.  This work showed that TB1 functions by controlling a downstream gene cascade through GT1, including several hormone pathways and well as sugar sensing. However, TB1 is not within QTL intervals derived from analysis of mapping populations derived from crosses between wild and domesticated forms of sorghum and millet, even though our knockouts of tb1 and gt1 in green foxtail, the wild progenitor of foxtail millet, produce mutant plants with more branching, as would be predicted from maize.  This suggests that TB1 and GT1, while fundamentally important in branching, were not the main target of selection during domestication in sorghum and millet. The fact that TB1 is not differentially expressed between buds of the multi-branched wild progenitors and the few-branched crop plants of sorghum and foxtail millet indicates that other pathways are responsible for branching differences, even though TB1 and GT1 are still essential for producing branching.  Differential gene expression analysis suggests that other candidate genes in sorghum such as DRM1, a dormancy-related  gene, or the ortholog of AtMAX2 in Setaria, a gene in the strigolactone pathway, are more likely to drive differences in branching between wild and domesticated forms in those species.  These results point to a parallel, or possibly alternative branching pathway as being key to domestication of sorghum and Setaria.     We have been able to use the investigations associated with this project to facilitate the training of multiple post-docs and graduate students, and to educate many undergraduate students at all four participating institutions.  In addition, we have created a successful Research Experience for Teachers (RET) program at Oklahoma State, where education majors and high school science teachers collaborate in six week research projects, receive professional development to translate those research experiences into lesson plans, and receive support and funding to teach those lesson plans in the classroom and to start science fairs.  Many of these projects have involved the effect of shading and other environmental signals on plant architecture and have enlarged the scope of our research whilst equipping teachers to teach better science content and to better appreciate and pass on modern views on the nature of science.     Our work has established a framework for creating ideal plant architectures for crop cultivation from wild ancestors with variable branching.  The findings lay the groundwork for refining the architecture of any grass, and open the doors to re-imagining crops for multiple needs and new environments.
