<AbstractNarration>1322264&lt;br/&gt;Plata&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal is for support of a dedicated track on Nanotechnology and Public Health at the ASME Nanoengineering in Medicine and Biology (NEMB)Annual Global Congress.  Funds will be used for travel to bring speakers and other participants to the meeting who would not otherwise attend, thereby enlarging and enriching the community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NEMB provides in-depth coverage of recent advances nanomedicine, nanobiology, and nanotechnology and public health. The event has become a premier conference in the field of nanomedicine internationally and encompasses a vast range of multidisciplinary ideas. For students, postdoctoral researchers, and principal investigators alike, this is an ideal platform for exposure to the state of the art developments in a broad range of fields. This is uniquely beneficial to the study of EHS issues related to nanotechnology because it allows EHS-nano researchers a unique opportunity to see novel developments in fields that have potential for direct human and elevated ecological exposure (i.e., through excretion and wastewater discharge). It will allow these researchers to target the most pressing materials and fill vacancies in the knowledge base that could allow early prediction and remediation of potential consequences associated with novel nanotechnologies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NEMB also provides an opportunity for those who are currently the primary practitioners of nanotechnology to better understand the downstream and potentially unforeseen impacts associated with their novel technologies. Armed with such knowledge, these architects of novel nanomedicines may incorporate environmental and public health objectives into the design of their materials and treatments at an early stage. Such an exchange of ideas is critically needed in order to enable the environmentally sustainable development of nanotechnology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impact&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students and post-doctoral researchers will participate through presentations in technical sessions and discussions. Posters will be on display throughout the duration of the Congress, allowing students and postdocs to maximize interactions with senior colleagues. Furthermore, each session is planned with experts from industry, academia, and government to help provide future directions and career advice. The session moderators are familiar with the participants and many audience members and will actively solicit interaction from students and postdoctoral associates. Lastly, ASME has targeted the Nanotechnology and Public Health Track for the professional production of a meeting podcast to be posted on asme.org, intended to target the broader public. Track organizers have already contributed to an ASME-sponsored public news piece highlighting the important topics that will be covered in the conference and the relevance to the public at large. Additionally, track organizers are in the process of reaching out to local radio producers in Boston to cover the event and interview speakers for a public media broadcast.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The ASMEÆs Nanoengineering in Medicine and Biology 3rd Annual Global Congress (NEMB 2014) has quickly become a preeminent meeting for the development and advancement of the application of nanomaterials with intended biological applications.  As such, it is critical for the Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) community to not only be aware of and anticipate developing applications, but also to make the designers of nano-enabled medicines aware of EHS concerns specific to nanomaterials.  This award facilitated the first incorporation of a Nanotechnology and Public Health Track (Track 8) into the NEMB 2013 Congress.  The Track served to expedite the interaction of the EHS-Nano and Nano-Medicine/Nano-Materials communities, and it was both well attended and well received.   To ensure continued cross talk between these critical groups and highlight the great needs and advances in the field, an extension of the previously awarded funds was requested and granted.  NEMB 2014 then hosted a similar Track with a slightly modified focus: "Nanotoxicology, Metrology, and Enviornmental Sensors" (Track 9), and the remaining funds from our 2013 effort were made available to suppor that  The 2014 Congress focused on the integration of Engineering, Materials Science, and Nanotechnology in addressing fundamental problems in Biology, Medicine, and Public Health and in developing devices, materials and methods for the early detection, imaging of pathological and physiological mechanisms, treatment of disease, and prevention of exposure to unintentionally-relased nanomaterials. Plenary lectures, symposia with keynote lectures and regular presentations, poster sessions for students and postdoctoral researchers, were all integral to the Congress' success. In addition, pre- conference short courses  addressed advances in current topics of interests in NEMB sciences and engineering. The conference organizers made special efforts to assure representation of a broad range of traditional and emerging areas. Details of the organization are available on the internet at http://www.asmeconferences.org/NEMB2014/index.cfm  Specific topic areas in Track 9 (2014) included:(a) Nanotoxicology and nanoparticle in vivo, with Gunter Oberdorster (University of Rochester) serving as the invited keynote; (b) Sensors and Metrology, with Frank von der Kammer (University of Vienna) serving as the invited keynote, and (c) Biological interactions of nanoparticles, with Christopher Hogan (University of Minnesota) serving as the invited keynote.  Specific topic areas in Track 8 (2013) included: (a) Benign-by-design nanomanufacturing, with Tom Seager (Arizona State University) serving as the invited keynote, (b) Nanomaterial fate and monitoring applications, with Mark Wiesner (Duke University) serving as the invited keynote, (c) Enviornmental health and toxicology, with Sally Tinkle (National Nanotechnology Coordination Office) serving as the unfunded invited keynote.  Student travel awards were conferred upon Yikun Zhao (PhD Candidate, Duke University) for best poster presentation and Meghan Creighton (PhD, Brown University) for best talk; both awarded in 2013.  The publications generated included (in 2013 and 2014) (i) A Book of Abstracts containing 2-page abstracts of papers presented at the conference via a CD, distributed to all conference participants and (ii) ASME Podcasts related to NEMB content (e.g., microfluidics and tumor progression and muscle-powered biological robots).  The Intellectual Merits, while difficult to measure directly, result from enhanced interaction and collaboration between enviornmental health and safety (EHS)-focused scientists and nanomedicine scientists and engineers.  This is particularly valuable, as medicines represent a primary route for human and ecological exposure to nanoengineered chemicals and devices, especially via direct injestion and discharge to waterways. An emergening topic in the EHS nano community is to investigate the fate of...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
