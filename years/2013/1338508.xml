<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to develop a research community and infrastructure for learning analytics in digital games for learning.  The project will convene a series of meetings that will: 1) establish standards for capturing and storing click-stream data from learning games and other sources; 2) define analytic methods for organizing and querying data to facilitate a variety of analytic processes; and 3) defining a set of APIs that will guide developers to build games that can contribute data to a national database.  The project is a partnership of researchers from academia, private non-profit research institutions and for-profit entities</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The core goal of the project was to start and foster the Learning Games Play Data Consortium ("PDC") &ndash; a national consortium on learning analytics in games and learning &ndash; and transform the way that members of this consortium use data from games as evidence of learning. We built a large member base of hundreds of individuals across dozens of organizations. We organized workshops aimed at helping deeper and practical understandings of how to use data from "play" (for example, digital games) in contexts like schools and museums. These workshops invited both experts which included professors and professionals from industry, as well as novice industry professionals and graduate students, who worked in fields related to learning, games, and the design and implementation of similar digital environments with educational goals. The workshops introduced participants to a variety of novel work in the design of educational games, ways to think about learning from games, and data analysis techniques to use play data collected from these games and understand what people learned from playing them. These workshops provided places for people to see others? work, and make social and professional connections with other experts and colleagues in related fields, to learn from and work with.    The intellectual merits of our project include:    Introducing experts from a breadth of fields, to data mining techniques which apply to a breadth of play data. This demonstrably provided participants with tools which were relevant to their work, or helped them think of data in new ways. Supporting emerging scholars by introducing them to current experts, enabled many productive collaborations &ndash; not just for newcomers to learn more, but also for experts to gain through their mentees? contributions. We innovated modes of learning analytics in games and learning, creating frameworks, activities, games, and infrastructure needed to support new research questions across fields.        Broader impacts:  We connected hundreds of teachers, game designers, researchers, game developers, and programmers from dozens of organizations. Dozens of articles, games, projects, and other collaborations resulted from these connections. We created more shared understandings across field, shared values, concerns, and ethics, making the fields more responsible and conscious of contributing in important and valuable ways.
