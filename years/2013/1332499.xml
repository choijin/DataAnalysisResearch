<AbstractNarration>The project aims to find a powerful new route towards exfoliated clay/polymer nanocomposites at high clay loading. A recently discovered self-organizing process is able to disintegrate (exfoliate) clay particles into their individual thin sheets (leaves) when being gently mixed into a suitable polymer. The phenomenon is called self-exfoliation,  since no external energy input is required. In the resulting nanocomposite, the clay leaves were found to distribute uniformly throughout the polymer matrix (i.e., random leaves), which can be beneficial for many applications that require high connectivity (mechanical, electrical, and thermal). While such self-exfoliation has great potential as a novel nanocomposite synthesis process, it has not yet been applied due to the lack of a better understanding of the self-exfoliation mechanism. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The planned research has the objective of explaining the origins of the self-exfoliation so that it can be utilized systematically as a new path for creating novel polymer nanocomposites at high loadings of random leaves including graphene. The synergistic expertise of the PI and co-PI will allow a full characterization of the nanocomposite formation. Diverse experimental methods will probe the four relevant length scales of this system. The macro-scale bulk properties and their mechanical evolution during exfoliation, which are most relevant industrially, will be studied through rheology. Rheology will also provide the time scales of the exfoliation dynamics and will guide the other experiments in this way. The micron-scale will be probed with optical microscopy to observe aggregate swelling and the homogeneity and randomness of the final exfoliated state. The nano-scale structure/dynamics will be observed with SAXS (small angle x-ray scattering), USAXS (ultra-SAXS), and SANS (small angle neutron scattering) to monitor clay gallery spacing and a polymer conformation anchored to a clay leaf, and AFM (atomic force microscopy) to test for the presence of an entropic-pulling force from the tethered polymer chains. The bonding at the atomic scale will be probed with NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy to confirm the presence of hydrogen bonds and determine if hydrogen bonds form on the face and/or sides of a clay leaf. The initial part of the research will be guided by hypothesizing two possible self-exfoliation mechanisms and by following up with experiments on several different self-exfoliating clay/polymer systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Based on these research findings, other self-exfoliating material combinations (graphene instead of clay; semicrystalline polymers instead of amorphous polymers) and their processing conditions will be explored. Research results from the two research groups will feed into each other and lead to a broad education of graduate and undergraduate students of the two research groups. This includes the co-PI's SAXS/WAXS beamline at the National Synchrotron Light Source, which will provide undergraduate/graduate students with an unusually broad perspective on scientific research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Polymer nanocomposites (PNs) have been of great interest to the broad materials community for the last three decades, because these materials can have significantly improved properties relative to the native polymers. While property improvements with nanoparticles are empirically well recognized, the link among the compounding conditions, dispersion structures, and improved properties has not been understood on a scientific basis yet. In this funded project, we focused on two PNs, i.e., clay/polymer and carbon black/polymer nanocomposites that have been successfully implemented in industry, and aimed to provide the better understanding of the structure-property relationship.</p> <p>Firstly, we studied the self-exfoliation process where stacks of clay sheets exfoliate into individual sheets when gently mixed into a suitable polymer. Montmorillonite organoclay and end-functionalized telechelic polybutadiene (PB) were used as a model. The techniques utilized were small angle X-ray scattering (to see the microscopic structure) and mechanical spectroscopy (to characterize the macroscopic viscoelastic property). We found that the &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; PB molecules quickly attach to the outer edges of the clay sheets and push against each other. In this way, the adsorbed polymer chains cause the clay stack to expand, facilitating the macromolecules to enter the stacks and hence exfoliating the clay sheets. With the understanding of the mechanism, optimization and extension to other materials should be more achievable. Self-exfoliation has the potential to be a valuable technique in creating industrial applicable and affordable nanocomposites.</p> <p>Next, we studied polybutadiene (PB) nanocomposites filled with carbon black (CB) used for automobile tires. It is believed that a nanometer-thick adsorbed polymer layer (&ldquo;an adsorbed nanolayer&rdquo;) is formed on the CB surfaces and affects the overall rheological and mechanical properties. However, it is challenging to distinguish the adsorbed polymer chains from the bulk, because they are all composed of the same component. To overcome this difficulty and provide detailed nanometer-scale descriptions at the interface, we extracted the adsorbed nanolayer on the CB fillers using solvent leaching of a CB-filled PB compound and characterized the structure and dynamics using small-angle neutron scattering and neutron spin echo (NSE) techniques. The results demonstrated that the adsorbed nanolayer is composed of two regions: the inner region (less than 1 nm thick) does not swell even in a good solvent, while the polymer chains in the outer region display a parabolic profile with a diffuse tail. In addition, the NSE results showed that the nanosecond dynamics of the swollen outer bound chains can be explained by the so-called &ldquo;breathing mode&rdquo;, which is determined by a balance of a restoring force due to the osmotic pressure gradient and a viscous force exerted on a polymer (Fig. 1). The structural and dynamical knowledge can be then linked to the rheological properties, serving to fill the gap between the molecular scale structures/dynamics and macroscopic dispersion, reinforcement, mechanical properties of PNs.</p> <p>Thirdly, we mimicked the nanoparticle surfaces by using planar solid substrates since the clay sheet or CB aggregates are much larger than the thickness of the adsorbed nanolayer. This planar film configuration offers more opportunity to characterize the structures, morphologies, and properties of the adsorbed nanolayers using a variety of experimental techniques. We used an array of non-end functionalized homopolymers and sought the general principle of the formation process of the adsorbed nanolayer. It was found that the adsorbed nanolayers are composed of two distinct density regions in the direction normal to the film surface: the inner higher-density region (~ 10 % higher than the bulk) composed of the flattened chains (~ 2 nm in thickness) regardless of molecular weight (<em>M</em><sub>w</sub>) and the outer bulk-like density region whose thickness increases with increasing <em>M</em><sub>w</sub>.
