<AbstractNarration>This project is being supported under a special funding focus for STEP, "Graduate 10K+," an activity of the National Science Foundation, supported in part by donations from the Intel Foundation and the GE Foundation, to stimulate comprehensive action at universities and colleges to help increase the annual number of new B.S. graduates in engineering and computer science by 10,000 over the next decade. Building on Cornell Engineering's strong record of recruitment of underrepresented minority (URM) students, the goal of the Cornell University Engineering Success Program (CUES) is to realize the promise implicit in the recruiting success by increasing the retention and graduation rate of URM and first generation college (FGC) students to a level equal to the overall engineering student body. CUES is leveraging investments already made in recruiting, in the pre-freshman summer and in the first year experience to increase the number of Cornell-educated engineers. The CUES project team is implementing three research-proven interventions that address known barriers to the success of highly qualified and talented engineering students: a spatial reasoning course; an engineering math institute combining tuition support for summer courses, collaborative learning and research; and enhanced tutoring.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The three proposed interventions, coupled to existing support programs such as mentoring, early intervention and tutoring for first and second year courses support students at points where both the literature and experience at Cornell show it is most needed.  The spatial reasoning course is developing a lasting, foundational skill needed for success in gateway mathematics and science classes.  The Engineering Math Institute is giving students a chance to get back on track with the core mathematics curriculum and to gain exposure to learning through discovery in a research context.  Enhanced tutoring is supporting the success of students in the majors where retention data show that additional attrition occurs. A direct result of the CUES program is the expectation of an additional 170 Cornell Engineering graduates, most of them URM students. Beyond the immediate impact of these additional engineers, the CUES Program is developing a model of how the integration of proven interventions with a comprehensive support network for URM and FGC students can make a significant impact on one of the most difficult challenges to overcome in increasing the number of U.S. engineering and computer science graduates.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The College of Engineering at Cornell University has a strong record of recruiting underrepresented minority students (URM). The goal of the Cornell University Engineering Success Program (CUES) is to increase the retention and graduation rate of URM and first generation college (FGC) student from 66% in 2012 to 84% by 2018, a level equal to the overall engineering student body. The CUES includes three programs designed to address known barriers to the success of highly qualified Cornell Engineering students. These programs include: a spatial reasoning summer course for incoming freshman (Ryan Scholars), Engineering Summer Math Institute, and Enhanced Tutoring for upper-level courses.          The CUES Program leveraged current investments by placing the spatial reasoning course over the summer through the pre-freshman summer program, thereby creating a solid foundation for a group of students that would become part of the Ryan Scholar Program. We used the Purdue Spatial Visualization Tests to conduct pre and post testing of spatial visualization skills. Through the development of the spatial reasoning course, the teaching team made exciting findings that have implications in the field of engineering education. The instructors believed that skills application in authentic spatial visualization projects could provide deeper learning, in contrast to demonstrating course-based understanding through online quizzes and problem sets. The course changed its model of the type of instructors used in response to feedback. In the most recent iteration, a Physics instructor applied the concepts beyond engineering courses deemed most successful.         Engineering Summer Math Institute is a nine week-long program that allowed 10-19 rising sophomores and juniors to take a core math course (multivariable calculus, differential equations, or linear algebra) and participate in research. Tuition, housing, and a small stipend were provided. ESMI students are either placed in faculty research labs, or participate in an applied math group project. Additionally, all attended Collaborate Learning Groups which are held twice a week led by peer facilitators in a small group setting to work together on concepts and sample problems. At the end of the summer, the ESMI participants present their work at the Cornell LSAMP and McNair Research Symposium. The most common course that the students needed assistance with was Linear Algebra. After impacting 80 students, 83% of the students obtained a B- or better in their respective summer math course. ESMI participants reported satisfaction with their experience and appreciated gaining research skills, networking with graduate students, and the opportunity to focus on a single course. Overall, 88% of ESMI participants were retained in Engineering majors and 91% were retained at Cornell in any major.        Although there are some tutoring programs on campus that support students in introductory courses, the Enhanced Tutoring program provided one-on-one peer tutoring in distribution courses. Many of these courses are necessary for affiliation within a major and upper-level classes required to remain in good standing in a major through graduation. After offering 37 different courses, the most common matched were: Discrete Structures, Dynamics, Thermodynamics, Statics and Mechanics of Solids, and Basic Engineering Probability and Statistics. The impact of this program assisted in recognizing that both Statics and Mechanics of Solids and Basic Engineering Probability and Statistics were courses that a larger population could benefit from tutoring. Due to this discovery, both courses were added to the College of Engineering general tutoring offerings beginning the 2017-2018 academic year.         The combined population of URM and/or FGC students in the 2012 baseline cohort who did not utilize CUES interventions was retained at only 75%, and the average GPA for all URM and/or FGC students in the Fall 2012 semester was 2.986. CUES participants saw an increase in both metrics, with 90% retention and a 3.066 average GPA. Importantly, the students who utilized two or more interventions were retained at 92% despite having an average GPA of 2.904, lower than any of the baseline populations. This finding shows that the students most in need of support were able to utilize multiple CUES interventions and be retained at a very high rate.         The CUES Program overall impacted 363 students from a variety of disciplines, academic years, and even assisted students seeking Engineering minors. By retaining 90% of CUES participants in Engineering majors, the program surpassed the original goal of 84% retention. In comparison, the projected 5 year graduation rate for the College of Engineering class starting in 2014 is 84% for URM and 94% for FGC, with about one third utilizing at least one CUES Program intervention. The 2014 cohort of Engineers had access to all three interventions of the CUES Program.           Last Modified: 11/30/2018       Submitted by: Jami P Joyner]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
