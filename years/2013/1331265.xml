<AbstractNarration>The research team will work with agricultural extension agents, policy makers, multilateral development agencies and organizations, and farmers, employing a range of methods including document analysis, open-ended interviews, surveys, participatory mapping, and ethnographic observation to explore relationship between the professionalization of agricultural scientists and extension agents and the spread of agro-industrial commodity production. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results will contribute to understanding the complex factors affecting food security. Results will include a doctoral dissertation, undergraduate course materials, and multiple publications. The PI has a strong track record of presenting to relevant agencies and meeting with high level staff and will seek to present the results of the project in such venues.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project analyzes the organization, production, dissemination and impact of public agricultural research in Mozambique from the colonial period to today. The project drew on both qualitative, participatory and archival methods. For qualitative methods, the PI conducted interviews with key stakeholders, including domestic and foreign researchers, foreign aid practitioners and officials, government leaders, extension agents, and rural community members. The PI also participated in scientific research and extension activities, including trainings, field days and research seminars. For participatory methods, the PI along with research assistants examined the nature of community participation in rural development projects around conservation agriculture and created a documentary with community members on the value of conservation agriculture techniques for soil fertility, water retention and crop improvement. For archival methods, the PI analyzed documents dating back to the creation of the public agricultural department in the colonial territory of Mozambique under the Portuguese. Drawing on the data collected through these methods, the project makes several contributions. First, the PI argues that contemporary development projects designed to re-make the Mozambican savannah and bring Mozambican agriculture &ldquo;into the 21<sup>st</sup>century&rdquo; reflect colonial-era priorities and principles because racialized power dynamics continue to allow political and business leaders as well as scientists to imagine the Mozambican territory as a blank slate, one that demands wholesale and rapid transformation of the sort that can only be provided by bringing science and capital together in the form of large-scale agriculture for export. The erasure of local livelihoods, indigenous land management or internal markets both requires and legitimates the &lsquo;discovery&rsquo; of new land, technologies, cultivars and markets.

The project drew on both qualitative, participatory and archival methods.

Drawing on the data collected through these methods, the project makes several contributions. First, the PI argues that contemporary development projects designed to re-make the Mozambican savannah and bring Mozambican agriculture "into the 21stcentury" reflect colonial-era priorities and principles because racialized power dynamics continue to allow political and business leaders as well as scientists to imagine the Mozambican territory as a blank slate, one that demands wholesale and rapid transformation of the sort that can only be provided by bringing science and capital together in the form of large-scale agriculture for export. The erasure of local livelihoods, indigenous land management or internal markets both requires and legitimates the ?discovery? of new land, technologies, cultivars and markets. Research suggests that rural development projects that rely on external funding and visible results privilege the production of new cultivars over land management, export markets over internal ones, and rapid, transformative mega-projects over more gradual, bottom up development.      The intellectual merit of this project lay in the multi-method and comparative historical approach as well as in the articulation of three academic literatures not often put into conversation: science and technology studies, geographies of development, and critical agrarian studies. From Science and Technology Studies, I analyzed expertise as a socially constructed and situated relationship; there is no expertise without the prior delineation of scientific fields, and there can be no expert without others who value the knowledge. From Geographies of Development, particularly those inspired by a material focus, I conceptualized agricultural research projects in Mozambique within a longer history of programs intended to "improve" subjects through the construction of a new set of everyday practices shaped but not determined by the broader structure of the economy and geopolitical relations. Finally, from criticalagrarian studies, I focused on the political economy of transformations in land acquisition and use, focusing on rural livelihoods and state-farmer relations.      This project has broader implications for food security, rural development and public science.
