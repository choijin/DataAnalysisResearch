<AbstractNarration>Savannas, which are among the most diverse but understudied ecosystems, are severely threatened due to the ease of converting these areas to agriculture. The savannas of Brazil are the largest on Earth, and conservation and management of the biota in the remaining savanna patches requires documenting the evolutionary and ecological factors that gave rise to and maintain this biodiversity. Treefrog species are excellent models for this research because they are highly sensitive to vegetation type, temperature, and humidity levels. Thus, climatic alteration is quickly revealed by declines in populations of these species. Using new methods in computer modeling that describe environments on a large scale, and advances in DNA technology, this research will assess the genetic well being of frog populations in relation to their changing environment and their prospects for survival.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The diverse sources of data to be collected will provide baseline information critical to efficiently protect and manage these endangered habitats and biotas. These methods and research approaches will be transferrable to other groups of organisms in different ecological regions. This project will contribute significantly to promoting integrative, multidisciplinary research involving international collaborators, and will train students as future scientists and science educators.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Past climate changes of the ice age are thought to have greatly impacted the distribution of organisms on Earth. Such changes can imprint a genetic signature on the genomes of the affected populations. Although the genetic consequences of the ice age are very well documented for many organisms in the Arctic and Temperate regions, less evidence exists for tropical organisms, possibly due to a reduced impact of the glaciations in this region. Our research aimed to understand the main promoters of diversification in the Cerrado region, a highly diverse tropical savanna in central Brazil. Facing current deforestation rates much higher than the Amazon forest, the Cerrado savanna currently comprises only 34% of its original vegetation. We investigated how recent climatic fluctuations of the ice age might have affected the current spatial structure and population differentiation of treefrogs in this savanna. Treefrogs are excellent models for this kind of research because of their increased sensitivity and response to shifts in temperature, vegetation, and humidity levels. Using genome-wide sequencing, we revealed a strong genetic structure and great level of differentiation among treefrog populations across the west-east axis of the Brazilian Cerrado. Moreover, using species distribution models across the ice age up to the present, we found substantial support for the role of past climatic instability explaining the observed genetic divergence. As the outcome of an international collaboration with Brazilian researchers, this study provides an important guideline towards the conservation of four main regions within the Cerrado where we found a substantial level of genetic differentiation in areas of stable climate over time. This study demonstrates the strong effects of past climate changes on organisms of tropical savannas and could be extrapolated to understand how future climate changes associated with current levels of vegetation fragmentation will adversely affect biodiversity in this tropical region.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/29/2016<br>      Modified by: Mariana&nbsp;Vasconcellos</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1311517/1311517_10244174_1472500846111_IMG_1116--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1311517/1311517_10244174_1472500846111_IMG_1116--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Cerrado treefrog"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1311517/1311517_10244174_1472500846111_IMG_1116--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Cerrado treefrog"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Treefrog Hypsiboas lundii.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mariana Vasconcellos</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Mariana&nbsp;Vasconcellos</div> <div class="imageTitle">Cerrado treefrog</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1311517/1311517_10244174_1472500689379_Cerrado_AltoParaiso--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1311517/1311517_10244174_1472500689379_Cerrado_AltoParaiso--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Cerrado landscape"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1311517/1311517_10244174_1472500689379_Cerrado_AltoParaiso--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Cerrado landscape"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Cerrado savanna landscape</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mariana Vasconcellos</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Mariana&nbsp;Vasconcellos</div> <div class="imageTitle">Cerrado landscape</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1311517/1311517_10244174_1472500930998_IMG_1120--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1311517/1311517_10244174_1472500930998_IMG_1120--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Hypsiboas lundii"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1311517/1311517_10244174_1472500930998_IMG_1120--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Hypsiboas lundii"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Treefrog H. lundii.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Mariana Vasconcellos</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Mariana&nbsp;Vasconcellos</div> <div class="imageTitle">Hypsiboas lundii</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
