<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Melanie Sanford of The University of Michigan focuses on the development of new catalysts that can ultimately be used for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals via more efficient, direct, and environmentally friendly processes. To meet this challenge, the project will establish a more detailed scientific understanding of the challenging steps of the catalysis processes. In addition, new catalysts based on less toxic and earth abundant elements will be explored and developed. In addition, an outreach program led by Professor Sanford (UM FEMMES, Females Excelling More in Mathematics, Engineering, and Science) exposes middle school girls from Ann Arbor and surrounding communities to hands-on science activities. The broader impacts of this work include potential societal benefits from the discovery of more efficient catalysts and catalysts derived from less toxic, earth abundant metals. This project serves as a training ground for undergraduate and graduate students for careers at the interface of catalysis, inorganic and organic chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research focuses on detailed mechanistic studies of the challenging steps of the catalytic cycle, primarily alkyl-heteroatom bond-forming reductive elimination processes. Ligands will be designed to stabilize the reacting metal centers (high valent Pd, Ni, and Cu complexes) in order to investigate the scope, mechanism, and stereochemical outcomes of these processes. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Group ten transition metal catalysts are widely used for a variety of chemical transformations, and many of these reactions are proposed to proceed via high valent intermediates. The nickel and palladium complexes studied in this project serve as useful models for such proposed intermediates, allowing for careful study of reaction details in the course of bond formation or functionalization. The use of nickel-based catalysts is especially desirable due to their low cost and unique reactivity relative to more commonly used precious metal systems. The fundamental knowledge gained through these studies will have a broader impact on the fields of catalysis and organic chemistry by informing the rational design of new reactions for organic synthesis. The reactions that have been examined over the course of this project are ultimately expected to find applications in the chemical industry for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and/or medical imaging agents.   In addition to the direct impact on the field of organometallic transition metal catalysis, this project has had a profound impact on the professional development of the researchers who participated. A diverse group of graduate students and post-doctoral researchers have worked on the project and gained valuable technical and scientific training as well as professional development opportunities. In addition, the PI and group members have participated in a variety of activities aimed at increasing the engagement and participation of women in science.
