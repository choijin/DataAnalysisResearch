<AbstractNarration>Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia virus (VHSv) is one of the world's most important finfish diseases, impacting both sport fishing and commercial fishing ventures around the globe. VHSv emerged only recently in the Great Lakes, and little is known about how it arrived and why it periodically leads to large scale fish die-offs. The proposed project will examine how VHSv's evolution in the Great Lake region has contributed to its ability to cause disease, and should aid informed predictions about future outbreaks. Thus, the investigations will integrate studies on VHSv evolution with identification of the means by which the virus disrupts immune systems of infected fish, leading to sickness or death. These results should help to identify how specific genetic changes in the virus can lead to either enhanced or reduced impact on infected fish, and thus will provide critical data for understanding the connection between viral genetic changes (i.e., viral evolution) and the host's response. Results will contribute towards more effective prevention, prediction, and control of VHSv, aiding national and international management efforts. Although the work will focus on the spread of VHSv within the Great Lakes region, the studies will have application to other viruses (fish and otherwise). The PIs will design an attractive mobile display for museum exhibits and broader distribution at conferences and public meetings to assist in disseminating the information beyond the scientific community, and will train both graduate and undergraduate students as part of this project. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Each of the aims of the project addresses a specific question about the spread of this disease in the Great Lakes region. Evolutionary diversification patterns and rates of VHSv genes will be evaluated using each protein gene (nv, N, M, L, and P) in strains and substrains, using new and existing samples. Results will determine how these are related to viral selection in new outbreak taxa and areas, and whether and how strains become endemic or epidemic. Cellular and host responses will be assessed to determine how mutations within viral genes that repress fish innate immune responses affect function by comparing VHSv M and P (and other) gene functions among VHSv strains. The project leaders will use reverse genetics to assess the role of M, P and L in modulating innate immune responses and viral pathogenicity. Taken together these results will be valuable in the present understanding of a new emerging and challenging infectious disease.</AbstractNarration>

High mortality outbreaks have affected up to 28 fish species in the Great Lakes since 2003, due to VHSV-IVb genotype virus.  This virus produces six proteins from its genome and our goal was to identify the gene(s) responsible for causing high mortality (100%) in yellow perch.  Using reverse genetics method, we generated chimeric VHSVs in which the matrix protein (M), nucleoprotein (N), and phosphoprotein (P) genes were substituted with the analogous genes from a European VHSV-Ia genotype virus, which is virulent for trout but avirulent for yellow perch.  Chimeric viruses were stable after several passages, and these will be assessed in vitro and in vivo infection studies by my collaborator, Doug Leaman, who will ascertain the function of viral proteins in viral replication, modulation of immune responses, and viral pathogenicity.  In previous study, Doug Leaman?s group had shown that VHSV-M protein inhibits the function of host transcription, and a mutant VHSV-M generated from our lab was shown to be attenuated.  The results of this study were published online last month in a peer-reviewed "Journal of Virology".  Based on the information gained from the chimeric VHSVs study, we should be able to decipher which gene(s) of VHSV are involved in virulence, which in turn would aid in the development of effective vaccines and potential control of VHSV.
