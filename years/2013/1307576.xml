<AbstractNarration>The objective of this project is to develop a novel framework for wireless sensor networks which exploits a joint design of the latest wireless power transfer technology with mobility to achieve high performance with low system cost and maintain perpetual operation of the network.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is to adopt the latest wireless power transfer, controlled mobility for energy replenishment and data gathering techniques in wireless rechargeable sensor networks. This research develops a novel integrated approach to addressing several closely coupled issues: (1) Efficient and scalable energy information collection; (2) Energy replenishment and energy-aware data collection; (3) Sensor-mission assignment with quality assurance. This project develops a new class of algorithms that improve data throughput, network utility, surveillance quality, and most importantly, guarantee the perpetual operation of network. The proposed work combines protocol design, algorithm design, probability modeling, combinatorial optimizations, software simulations and testbed implementations to conduct a full-scale study on the above issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are to provide a new paradigm to reliably power wireless sensor networks which is transformative to conventional sensor networks. This project would be beneficial to a wide spectrum of applications, including military, environmental, health care, target tracking and commercial business areas. The important findings of this project will be disseminated to the research community by ways of conferences, journals, and web site access, and to the industry by facilitating the partnership between the industry and the academia through New York State Center of Excellence in Wireless and Information Technology.</AbstractNarration>
