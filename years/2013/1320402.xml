<AbstractNarration>How much power is a set of wind farms likely to generate over the next 24 hours? How will occupants in a commercial building interact to consume energy? Being able to answer prediction questions like these is vital to developing a more sustainable energy infrastructure: If we can predict renewable energy production and demand ahead of time, we can schedule energy resources more efficiently and reliably, leading to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Unfortunately, these are also inherently uncertain quantities we need to predict; for example, no matter how good our algorithms are, we can't predict human behavior with perfect accuracy. In order to use such predictions, we need to be able to properly model the uncertainty inherent in these domains. We need to make predictions that are not only correct on average, but which capture the complex random fluctuations and correlations between predicted quantities.  Only then can we schedule energy resources in a way that accounts for these uncertainties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project develops and uses a recently-proposed framework for modeling --- sparse Gaussian conditional random fields --- a generalization of the commonly used Markov random field. This framework efficiently models high-dimensional distributions by exploiting sparsity in the inverse covariance matrix.  The project extends the state of the art by greatly accelerating model learning, by extending existing theory to understand when these models can effectively learn high-dimensional predictors, and by generalizing the predictions to the non-Gaussian setting through copula methods. The project uses these algorithms to build forecasting models in four crucial domains in the energy sector: energy demand, wind power, user occupancy in homes and commercial buildings, and personal energy consumption from smart meters.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has exemplary broader impacts. First, the research deals directly with application domains crucial to efficient energy management, where even small advances can have a sizable impact on sustainability. Second, the PI leverages the research to bring the power systems and machine learning communities closer together, disseminating the results at both machine learning and power systems venues, and releasing material and video lectures to practitioners in energy. Finally, the project harnesses the research to increase diversity within STEM fields by advising under-represented minorities at the graduate and undergraduate level, and by engaging High School students and teachers with talks illustrating how computation can be used to address problems in sustainability.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Energy forecasting broadly refers to predicting the future of some quantity related to energy systems: predicting how much energy occupants in a city will consume, or predicting the energy generated by non-controllable renewable sources like wind or solar farms.  Better forecasting directly impacts the efficiency or sustainability of electricity: because electrical power must be balanced at every instant (generators must generate exactly a much power as people wish to consume), grid operators always generates some additional "reserve" power, additional power that is being generated but not used, so that it can be quickly connected to the grid to balance demand.  Better forecasting can lead immediately to less need for reserve and thus more efficient energy usage.  The difficulty with forecasting energy quantities like demand, wind, or solar generation is that these are inherently random processes to a certain extent; a perfect forecast is a mathematical impossibility.  Thus, over the course of this project we instead developed a framework for probabilistic forecasting, a method that tries to exactly quantify the uncertainty of the future signal.  This problem is made challenging by the fact that there are dependencies between this signal in both time and space: if our forecast predicts low at hour 10, it's likely that it will predict low at hour 11, and similarly for spatially-related areas.  Over the course of this grant, we have developed a new mathematical framework for high-dimensional probabilistic modeling and control.  Specifically, we have build models for representing this high-dimensional forecast distributions efficiently.  At a high level, the methods work by exploiting sparsity in the independence properties between different predicting quantities; even if all quantities being forecast are collected to some extent, we can often create a representation of this distribution with very few parameters, letting us learn the models efficiently.  In particular, we have developed two main models called the sparse Gaussian conditional random field, and the multiple quantile graphical model, which, using slightly different mathematical formulations, let us predict these high-dimensional forecasts efficiently.  Through the project we have also developed a new framework for using these predictions to control power generation systems using these uncertain forecasts.  Specifically, we have begun to build a system that lets users easily specify what are called stochastic programs, optimization problems that include multiple predictions from these uncertain models, to best balance risk and minimize the need for excess generation.  In addition to the above application, we have applied the techniques to a number of other real-world scenarios of critical importance to sustainability.  We have participated in two energy forecasting competitions organized by the IEEE, and in four such competitions tracks obtained high (top five out of more than 100 teams) results across a wide variety of prediction problems, including demand prediction, wind prediction, solar prediction, and energy price prediction.  Most teams ranking higher than us had focused on only one or two of these problems, whereas our methods applied generally.  Finally, this project has also launched a partnership with Duquesne Light, the local utility in Pittsburgh, to use these methods to forecast outages in their network due to storm events.  We are in the process of building a fielded system that can be used by operators at this utility to better plan for these extreme storm events, saving costs and increasing reliability of the electrical grid.
