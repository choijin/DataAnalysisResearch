<AbstractNarration>This award is to support undergraduate students attending and participating in the Laser Science XXIX Conference, October 6-11, 2013 in Orlando, FL.  Specifically, the students present their research in the "Symposium on Undergraduate Research" on Monday Oct 7, 2013.  Previous years' programs are at http://www.aps.org/units/dls/meetings/symposium/index.cfm. The intellectual merit of this project is that the undergraduate students present and disseminate the results of the research, many from NSF-supported REU programs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact is to provide the opportunity for these young students to attend a national meeting of this stature and give their first public talks. A secondary benefit arises because collaborations among them are often born in these sessions since very often students in different universities are involved in similar projects. A third impact is to initiate networking among these students that will be vital to their future careers as professional scientists, and to encourage them to continue along such a career path.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The thirteenth annual DLS Symposium on Undergraduate Research at LS-XXIX took place in Orlando, FL on Monday, 7 October, 2013. The Symposium has grown from ten presentations in 2001 to forty-two this year on projects done at about 30 universities or research institutes in the US and Europe.  These Symposia have brought nearly 400 students to our annual meeting to present what are often the first research papers of their budding careers.  Programs, articles, further information, and photos from past symposia can be found at the DLS website http://www.aps.org/units/dls/meetings/symposium/  The 2013 Symposium began with a buffet-style welcome dinner on Sunday evening, 6 October, at the Wyndham Resort Time Share near the Wyndham Grand Orlando hotel where most of the students were housed. This was an especially convenient location because the students who arrived at any time during the evening could check into the hotel and then go directly to the dinner.   The FiO/LS conference events began Monday morning with Plenary Session talks by several outstanding people, including the new OSA Honorary Member Donald Keck.  Nobel Laureate David Wineland was prevented from attending by the government shutdown, but his talk was presented by his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Chris Monroe.   Our Symposium events began at noon with a sandwich lunch for its participants and honored guests, who included several of the speakers at the Plenary-Prize session earlier in the morning.  The students were especially fortunate this year to have so many of the prize recipients meet and talk with them during the lunch.  Highly visible attendees besides Bob Alfano and Margaret Murnane were Henry Kapteyn (DLS chair), Lou Dimauro (Meggers Award), Nergis Mavalvala (MIT, LIGO leader), Anne Kelley (DLS SecÃ†y-treasurer), Peter Delfyett (conference co-chair), Grover Swartzlander, and mentors Jenny Magnes, Samir Bali, Chris Greene, and others. We heard inspiring remarks and lively discussion from several of these distinguished guests.

The quality of the talks was uniformly very high, and the two oral sessions were an unqualified success.  Students enjoyed snacks between the sessions, courtesy of one of our corporate sponsors, Thorlabs.  A sign board with logos of all the corporate sponsors was prominently displayed at all Symposium meals and sessions.   It was gratifying that these very young scientists could give their first presentations at a professional meeting, and it was clearly a memorable event for them.  About 1/3 of this year's presenters were female, a fraction comparable to the national average among undergraduate physics students.  Many of the students were thrilled to meet famous and/or highly visible scientists, including the authors of som...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
