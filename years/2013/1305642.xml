<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is an integrated research and educational effort in the area of polarization induced transport in all-polymer field-effect transistors (FETs). The goals of the research are to elucidate the role of long-range polaronic interaction in ferroelectric-based FETs, to study plasmonic effects on transport by combining light scattering and transient photocurrent spectroscopy, and the development of experimental methodologies for strain mapping in pressure sensing devices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is in the development of a universal model for temperature-dependent FET mobility incorporating the effect of Fr√∂hlich polarons. The research activities involve development of polymer FETs with solution processable polar and non-polar polymer dielectrics along with a new series of push-pull-type donor-acceptor polymers. Combining surface-enhanced Raman scattering with photocurrent spectroscopy will provide a diagnostic tool to visualize transport using surface plasmons. The development of flexible pressure sensing devices based on organic FETs in conjunction with ferroelectric dielectrics is likely to have a transformative impact on technology via the feasibility of tactile electronic surfaces.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are on the science and technology of pressure sensing devices and multi-discipline education and outreach. The participation of high school students in a new summer program - Fielding Science - with projects on inkjet printing techniques to be further developed by undergraduate students in an Advanced Laboratory course, will advance the area of flexible electronic surfaces. Public lectures on flexible electronics will be delivered by the PI and graduate students participating in the program as part of an existing Saturday Morning Science series.</AbstractNarration>
