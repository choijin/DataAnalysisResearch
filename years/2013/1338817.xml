<AbstractNarration>The proposal requests Phase II funding for the North Carolina State University (NCSU) and Georgia Tech (GT) to remain as active sites in the Center for Silicon Solar Consortium (SiSoC). NCSU is the lead institution while GIT is a "Partner" site. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed center's goal is to help reestablish a global leadership role for the US Silicon PV industry by having government together with the solar-electric power industry jointly stimulate high quality university level research and education, while developing an expanded and skilled workforce. The NCSU research center will emphasize materials characterization leading to a fundamental understanding of impact of defects/impurities/mechanical behavior of solar cell materials emphasizing the development of advanced characterization tools to accommodate the various needs of both single- and multi-crystalline Si wafers, thin films and nanoscale PV science and technology. The GT research will focus on reducing the cost of PV generated electricity and designing and fabricating high efficiency solar cells. Their demonstrated expertise in developing low-cost materials and rapid thermal processes for next generation silicon solar cells will provide training and enriching the educational experience of PV knowledgeable students. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SiSoC will actively develop a skilled workforce, while meeting the rapidly growing demand for clean energy with an emphasis on minimal environmental impact on our planet. This will be enabled by having other government agencies, together with the solar-electric power industry jointly stimulating high quality university level research and education. The specific scientific results will be widely disseminated through semi-annual SiSoC review meetings, conference presentations, and publications. The research activity will also be amplified through student internships at industry member locations. The PIs plan to hire undergraduates as lab assistance under NSFs REU Program to create an excellent outreach opportunity for underrepresented minorities/women to participate in PV materials research.</AbstractNarration>

It provided a platform to conduct fundamental and applied research at Georgia Tech ranging from silicon PV materials, characterization, device modelling, technology innovation, and cell fabrication.

SiSoC provided a unique opportunity for University, Industry and National Lab collaboration. SiSoC was successful in attracting more than twenty leading industry partners at its peak. Industrial Advisory Board (IAB) and Industry collaboration played a major role in the success of this program. It gave students an opportunity to conduct industry relevant R&amp;D which helped the industry in reducing cost, improving material quality, and increasing silicon solar cell efficiency. SiSoC also provided the financial support for a number of Ph.D students, some of whom were hired by the SiSoC industry members.  Quality and significance of SiSoC research is documented in technical papers in prestigious journals and conference proceedings. SiSoC helped Georgia Tech take a leadership position in this field by developing some of the worldÆs highest efficiency solar cells through improved material quality, device modeling, technology innovation and cell fabrication.     Project 2013-GIT-1: Key accomplishments (Figure 1)  Successfully modeled a simulated road map for high efficiency n-type solar cells Determined that wafer resistivity and bulk lifetime are very important factors to determine cell efficiency Oxygen and carbon concentration in the range investigated in this study do not affect cell efficiency. ~21% efficiency was achieved through cell design, modeling, and technology developments Considerable optimization of front grid and of rear contact formation through laser ablation of dielectrics and PVD Al metallization.      Project 2013-GIT-2: Key accomplishments (Figure 2)  Validated the "sister wafer" assumption. Wafers cut side by side "sister" of the same brick within the same ingot have similar residual stresses induced by melting and solidification and induced by wire-sawing Established a polarized micro-raman spectroscopy measurement system and a procedure to determine crystalline orientation and stress near grain boundaries for multicrystalline Si wafers with unknown orientation based on the technique by Becker et al. Validated using Si wafers of known crystalline orientation and using near-infrared birefringence polariscopy. Correlated residual stress results in loose abrasive slurry wire sawn wafers and fixed abrasive diamond wire sawn wafers using a surface measurement (micro-raman spectroscopy), and a through thickness measurement, (near-infrared birefringence polariscopy). This enabled measurement of stresses in the saw damage layers as well as in the bulk of the...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
