<AbstractNarration>The research of the planned I/UCRC for Sensory Sciences and Innovation aims to support basic and applied research in several areas across the spectrum of chemosensory science, providing a focal point for industry-university collaboration. The planned center targets new understanding through multi-disciplinary, cross-cutting research of such topics as how flavors and fragrances influence memory, cognitive function and mood; the full range of benefits of flavors and fragrances in fighting infection (e.g., citral), supporting immune function and protecting food against spoilage (e.g. rosemary oil). The center vision seeks to transform the sensory sciences by integrating the discovery and characterization of taste and flavor molecules, with the study of their physiological and psychological mechanisms, to ultimately understand their effects on human behavior.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The flavor and fragrance industry represent a $ 23 B sector of the U.S. economy and is a critical driver of innovation across a broad range of consumer and industrial products from foods, beverages, and medicines, to personal care, home care and cosmetics. The planned I/UCRC?s holistic approach will likely lead to greater insights than the ?piecemeal? approach that is typically practiced in this field. Moreover, in cooperation with industry partners, the Center will establish a blueprint for training students and workers as multi-disciplinary sensory scientists. Partnering with industry will foster the rapid translation of this new knowledge into the next generation of innovative goods and services, resulting in broad societal impacts.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We requested a no-cost extension in February 2015 which was granted for our planning grant to develop a I/UCRC in Sensory Sciences and Innovation which would be a collaboration between Rutgers University (New Jersey) and the University of California, Riverside.  The no-cost extension allowed for travel and related expenses for Prof. Beverly Tepper who is the Director of the Center for Sensory Sciences and Innovation to travel from New Jersey to California.  University of California, Riverside PI Dr. Mary Lu Arpaia and Prof. Tepper visited with UC Riverside faculty to strategize regarding seeking members for the Center for Sensory Sciences and Innovation. The campus meeting identified additional potential faculty on the Riverside campus that could be approached to participate in the I/UCRC as well as additional possible collaborations with Rutgers faculty.  Additionally, M. L. Arpaia and B. Tepper visited potential members in the greater Los Angeles and Orange County areaover a 3 day period.  Two companies are involved in the flavor industry through the production of juices, botanicals and other related products.  They both emphasize the use of natural products rather than synthesized products and were therefore were quite interested in working with UC Riverside to gain access to the campus' large citrus variety collection.  UC Riverside and Rutgers have followed up on these leads for potential CSSI membership.       Last Modified: 10/26/2015       Submitted by: Mary L Arpaia]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
