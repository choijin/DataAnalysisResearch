<AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of historian, Graham Burnett, the Ph.D. student Anthony R Acciavatti will produce a history of multi-disciplinary, trans-national scientific cooperation. The student will document innovative ways scientists, engineers, and economists worked with bureaucrats to bring about liberal economic integration. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to a dissertation, this project will produce a traveling multi-media exhibition.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ My dissertation, entitled "Schools to Satellites: Educating and Enlightening Village India, 1947-76," examines how an Indo-American network of scientists, economists, engineers, artists, and bureaucrats instituted a new political and economic project in India in 1952&mdash;the Community Development Programme&mdash;that sought to enlist IndiaÃ†s 558,000 village communities in nation building. Members of this international network used film, artisanal handicrafts, and satellite television to persuade villagers on the virtues of community development and liberal economic integration. Drawing on published materials, films and videos, as well as extensive archival research in India, France, Great Britain, and the United States, "Schools to Satellites" reframes the stakes of international development and science during the Cold War. Following an introduction that explains the history of the village as a global human settlement type and its importance to the Cold War, the five chapters of the dissertation examine the history of three institutes designed to build a national economy around village development. Each of these institutes developed instructional materials to educate supposedly illiterate villagers. By braiding the history of science and technology with media studies, this dissertation sharpens our sense of the changing boundaries of scientific expertise and authority during the Cold War.  Along with the dissertation, I have developed a multi-media traveling exhibition of the films, videos, and objects studied in the dissertation. A multi-media exhibition has the potential to not only reach a larger and varied audience, but also reframe the production and reception of scientific knowledge in village India.
