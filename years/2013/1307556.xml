<AbstractNarration>The Environmental Chemical Sciences Program in the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation supports the research of Professors Benjamin Bostick from the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, and Bill Casey of the University of California-Davis, who will perform collaborative research that will investigate the solution speciation and adsorption properties of tungsten in aqueous solutions. The thermodynamic and kinetic stability of polyoxometalate clusters, and their reactivity towards mineral substrates will be examined using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and complementary solution and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This research will address fundamental, long-standing questions about the reactivity and properties of complex ions in the environment, and the role that such complexes play in enhancing their solubility and transport.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;To accurately assess the environmental fate of a contaminant (or anything else), it is critical to understand the chemical processes that control their concentrations in water. This research examines the solubility and reactivity of tungsten, and emerging contaminant of concern that has seldom been studied in complex environmental systems. More broadly, the principles of chemical speciation in solution and its role in regulating adsorption and mineral precipitation behavior are widely applicable to understanding the properties and behavior of many chemical species, including a variety of nutrients and contaminants. This research will train students in the fundamental chemical principles that affect the environment, and provide the perspective needed to use those principles to be better stewards of it.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of this project were to evaluate the role that nanometer-sized tungstate polyoxometalate ions played in polluted settings in Vietnam.  After pulsing on natural samples, and expanding the scope of the work to embrace molybdate clusters, I believe that the polyoxometalates are probably relatively innocuous.We could not detect the tungstate polyoxometales in natural samples or sediment via NMR.  The project suffered from poor access to international field samples from Vietnam, but a positive result was that a researcher who was partly supported by the grant, Dr. Anna Oliveri, used the work to help land a faculty position at Southern Oregon University.  The scope was expanded to include molybdate polyoxometalates and we examined the interaction of molybdenum with phenolic organic ligands, including fulvic acids, to assess their stability.  The organic molecules seem to strongly destabilize the polyoxometalates, suggesting that the breakdown products of natural cellulose will prevent polyoxometalate formation.  This latter work is conducted in collarboration with researchers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories, who complement the UC Davis effort in nuclear magnetic resonance measurements with UV-Vis spectroscopy and synchrotron measurements at the Advanced Light Source.  This work is part of the undergraduate research of a UC Berkeley student and is part of the PhD thesis of Mr. Chris Colla at UC Davis.
