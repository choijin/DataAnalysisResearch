<AbstractNarration>A workshop for recipients of research awards in the Enhancing Access to the Radio Spectrum (EARS) program is being held at the National Science Foundation on October 7 &amp; 8, 2013. An important component of the EARS program is interchange of information among the awardees, and between the awardees and stakeholder communities, such as wireless providers, spectrum regulators, public safety, the defense and national security communities, and others. This project provides travel support to small business and academic awardees under the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program to attend the workshop, and interact with their academic colleagues who are performing research in the same domain.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award was used to fund travel to the first NSF EARS PI meeting for participants in the STTR Phase II proposals related to dynamic spectrum sharing.  This meeting took place in October 2013.  This award was granted because the STTR Phase II program had not completed its review and award process at the time of the meeting. As a result, they would not yet have the travel funds to participate in the meeting.  The proposal sought to exploit synergies between the more theoretical EARS projects and the more practice-oriented STTR Phase II proposals.  The proposal funded the travel of 22 people who submitted STTR Phase II proposals and was completed within budget.   The meeting took place over two days and was structured such that both the EARS PIs as well as the STTR Phase II proposers gave presentations or posters.  The intention of this was to provide a medium for learning and discussion among the meeting participants.  The meeting worked well, as there was significant discussion during and after each presentations as well as during the informal sessions (meals and breaks).  The discussion included both the EARS PIs as well as the STTR Phase II proposals, indicating that the hoped-for learning and cross-fertilization of ideas took place during the meeting, as intended by the proposal.
