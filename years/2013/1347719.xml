<AbstractNarration>This Widening Implementation &amp; Demonstration of Evidence-Based Reforms (WIDER) planning grant provides faculty at the University of West Georgia's College of Science and Mathematics (COSM) with increased support in the use of evidence-based teaching and learning practices. A Core Learning Team (CLT) comprised of at least ten faculty members from six departments (Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Geosciences, Mathematics, and Physics)is participating in professional development activities designed to increase their ability to develop and implement effective evidence-based teaching practices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Aligning with best practices in facilitating institutional change, this program (Wider Implementation of STEM Educational Reforms, WISER) Practices] is focusing on changing the knowledge and attitudes of STEM faculty and university administrators with the goal of institutionalizing practices that will increase student success. Additionally, a rigorous evaluation of the program is providing both quantitative and qualitative data that will advance knowledge and contribute to the growing literature on evidence-based teaching and learning.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: As COSM faculty increasingly value and engage in best practices in STEM learning, and as the University of West Georgia shows a commitment to rewarding these faculty, the institution expects to see significant increases in student learning, STEM majors, and retention in STEM courses. As a result, the University will be better able to meet the demands for graduates in STEM fields who can contribute to the economic growth of the state of Georgia and beyond.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NEED  There is a well-identified need at the national and state levels for the preparation of STEM majors.   The impetus for the WIDER grant at West Georgia (UWG) was that evidence-based teaching and learning practices were found to be critical for student success in STEM disciplines, based on several successful pilot projects funded by the Georgia Board of Regents (2011-2016).  Nevertheless, the Dean of the College of Science and Mathematics (COSM), the PI of the NSF-WIDER grant, and several key faculty members concluded that it was necessary to develop a strategic approach to expand the university?s commitment to evidence-based teaching and learning (EBPs) in STEM disciplines.      GOALS  The overarching goals of this project (2013-2016) were (1) to facilitate the creation of a shared vision across the STEM disciplines for using evidence-based teaching and learning practices to (a) improve student learning, (b) increase the number of majors, (c) increase retention and (d) increase timely graduation, and (2) to create a plan to institutionalize this vision.     APPROACH  Our approach was based on the theoretical framework of Kezar (Understanding sensemaking/sensegiving in transformational change processes from the bottom up. Higher Education, 65, 761-780), and consists of three steps:     (1) Collection and examination of data on EBPs as well as barriers, support structure, and institutional cultural factors affecting implementation of EBPs. This was obtained via anonymous surveys conducted by the grant?s external evaluator at the beginning and end of the project, and conversations with administrators and several faculty members.      (2). A Core Learning Team (CLT), consisting of seven COSM faculty, along with the PI and co-PIs, took part in several professional development activities that align with best practices outlined by Kezar to increase their knowledge of evidence-based practices and research methods useful for examining their effectiveness.  The CLT attended a two day STEM pedagogy conference Transforming STEM Higher Education Conference co-organized by the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&amp;U) and PKAL (2014).  In addition, the PI, a co-PI and several CLT members visited University of Maryland-Baltimore County (UMBC), a model university that has created an institutional commitment to EBPs, and also visited the Emporium classroom at Georgia State University, designed to increase student success in introductory mathematics courses.      (3). Dialogue on evidence-based teaching and learning practices among faculty members in the college was facilitated via the COSM Dean?s Teaching and Learning Seminar Series.  The topics included the "flipped classroom", and interventions such as Supplemental Instruction (SI) and Peer-Lead Team Learning (PLTL).  In addition, invited speakers from the University of North Georgia described an innovative inter-disciplinary approach to laboratory instruction in introductory STEM courses.         OUTCOMES AND BROADER IMPACT  Anonymous surveys, conducted by the external evaluator at the beginning and the end of the grant, show a general increase in faculty members? awareness of EBPs.  The data gathered through the faculty and administrator surveys as well as through the interviews with the key individuals (CLT members and the Interim Dean, Provost and President) suggest that faculty and administrator knowledge and value of EBPs increased during the time that the WISER grant was in place.  While this cannot be attributed solely to the NSF-funded initiative, it nevertheless provided synergy surrounding the improvement of teaching in the COSM with the concurrent Georgia Board of Regents initiative.       A key goal of the project, envisioned at its beginning in 2013, was the development of the vision for the COSM in support of EBPs.  This has not yet been accomplished, and can be attributed to a number of barriers (as gleaned from interviews of CLT members by the external evaluator), most notably the change in the status of the PI from the position of Dean.  Data do suggest that institutionalization in certain departments and movement toward greater support for EBPs was apparent. It also should be noted that, among the outcomes of the grant, institutionalization and policy-creation require the greatest amount of time to accomplish; subsequently, the full impact of the grant may fall beyond the scope of its implementation window.  Indeed, this is ongoing in the COSM under the leadership of the new Dean.      We note that UWG serves a diverse student population (62% female, 34% racial minority underrepresented in STEM, and 67% from rural counties).       Dissemination of our work beyond our institution consisted of a presentation, Evidence-Based Teaching and Learning: Steps toward increased faculty buy-in and institutional support at the symposium, The Envisioning the Future of Undergraduate STEM Education (EnFUSE): Research and Practice on (April 27-29, 2016, Washington, DC), co-hosed by NSF and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).
