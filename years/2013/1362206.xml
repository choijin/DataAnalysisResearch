<AbstractNarration>In this project, the PI Russell Miller will continue his work using computability theory to analyze the difficulty of problems in other areas of mathematics.  These areas include field theory, commutative and differential algebra, model theory, and number theory, as well as the possibility of describing uncountable structures and studying them effectively.  Traditional computability theory examines the capabilities of digital computers and the limits on the problems which can be solved using such computers.  Since the pioneering work of Alan Turing, it has been known that many problems cannot be solved by any digital computer running any program whatsoever.  Even these "noncomputable" problems can be ranked by difficulty, however: problem A is easier (or at least, no more difficult) than problem B if we can show how a hypothetical program solving B would allow us to solve A as well.  Indeed, in certain cases we can learn whether a particular problem is computable or not by determining where related noncomputable problems sit in this hierarchy.  Recently, the PI has made contributions ranging from solutions to concrete problems about deciding whether certain polynomial equations can be satisfied using rational numbers, to more abstract questions about the difficulty of solving algebraic differential equations and the relative difficulty of considering structures from different areas of mathematics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI recently collaborated with several number theorists to produce new evidence for the undecidability of Hilbert's Tenth Problem for the rational numbers, the problem which asks for an algorithm to decide which Diophantine equations have rational solutions.  He plans to continue this work, considering the specific question of subrings of the rationals of density 0 (i.e., "very close" to the integers).  In field theory, he has made substantial progress, both by asking and answering natural computable-model-theoretic questions about the difficulty of computing isomorphisms between fields, and also by using computability theory to answer general questions about the complexity of fields in relation to the complexity of other mathematical structures. He hopes to address a key question in differential algebra, whose solution would help mathematicians better understand differentially closed fields and solutions to differential equations. (These are analogous to algebraically closed fields, but are much less well understood at present.)  For some years now he has taken the lead in introducing computability techniques to researchers throughout mathematics, and has often been able to interest such people in his questions and his methods.  With this grant, those efforts will most certainly continue.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Hilbert?s Tenth Problem, for a ring R, is the question of which polynomial equations (with several variables, and with coefficients from R) have solutions in R.  Hilbert originally asked this question, in 1900, for the ring of integers, and it was shown in 1970 that it is impossible for a computer to be programmed to solve this problem.  On the other hand, when R is the ring of all rational numbers (which is actually a field), it is unknown whether any computer program can solve the problem or not.   Of course, there are many rings in between the integers and the rational numbers: the rationals have continuum-many subrings, the smallest of which is the subring containing just the integers.  With so many subrings, it is impossible to describe many of them effectively; indeed, the vast majority of them have no description whatsoever:  they just exist, without any finite way to say what numbers are in them.  (Of course, with infinitely many subrings, "majority" here needs a specific meaning, which arises from the Lebesgue measure on the subrings.)  Nevertheless, the work in this project has shown that the answer for the ring of rational numbers itself depends in a strong way on what happens in the majority of these subrings.  If, for most of the subrings, deciding Hilbert?s Tenth Problem would be possible just from knowing what numbers are in the subring, then there is a program for deciding Hilbert?s Tenth Problem for the rationals.  Conversely, if most of the subrings have the property that it is even harder to decide Hilbert?s Tenth Problem than it is to know which numbers are in the subring, then there is no program deciding Hilbert?s Tenth Problem for the rationals.   As the decidability of Hilbert?s Tenth Problem for the rationals has proven to be an extremely difficult question, any new method of studying it is welcome.  The results of this project suggest such a method:  studying the subrings of the rationals en masse and figuring out the "most common" answer, without needing to know the answer for any specific subring.
