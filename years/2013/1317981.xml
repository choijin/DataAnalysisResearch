<AbstractNarration>The broad research goal of this project is to better understand the mechanics, balance, and energetics of bipedal walking.  The first specific goal is to design, build and test a two-legged walking 'platform', a waist-down robot, and its computer controller.  One can think of this platform as a legged Segway, for use by others putting on robotic upper bodies with arms and heads. The goal is to match the robustness of existent bipedal robots but with no need for electrical cords or hydraulic tubes and with approximately a 90 percent reduction in energy use. This will be achieved by the development and use of a reflex-based controller that minimizes the needed sensor bandwidth and on-board computation.  The second goal is to advance the theories of walking balance and energetics including, especially, basic models for understanding the tradeoffs between robustness, versatility, energy efficiency, sensor accuracy and motor size. Deliverable outcomes include a demonstrable robot with a new 'reflex-based' controller, public access to complete design and control information, basic design formulas for the fundamental design trade-offs, student design and research experience, and inspiring demonstrations for public viewing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, robots based on this platform design could replace wheel and tread based systems used for, and proposed for use for, service robotics. The advantages of legs over wheels include a more anthropomorphic look, for human interaction, and, ultimately with further development, the ability to function on rough terrain. The basic theories of balance and energetics developed in this work will add insight concerning human walking, ultimately helping with the diagnosis and remediation of human disabilities, including aiding the design of assistive and prosthetic devices. The hands-on development work will educate and inspire engineering students working on the project. The demonstrations and demonstration videos will serve as an inspiration to those considering engineering careers.</AbstractNarration>

Understanding walking control could enhance understanding of control of similarly complex systems.</span></li> </ol> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">At present, the best bipedal robots, scaled for weight and speed, use at least 3 times the power of a human. No bipedal robot is reliable, energy-effective and affordable. No robot can, like a human or bird, reliably walk on two legs for thousands of steps without fear of falling once. And no robot can function for a full day on a single battery charge. &nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">At the start of this project, our lab specialized in walking energetics.

Rather than seeking a minimally-powered design we approach the optimization more directly. We state a desired control outcome - reliably not falling and low energy use - and optimize the control for that. If we include all possible control-design choices, such an optimization problem is too difficult. This is because of &ldquo;the curse of dimensionality." With so many moving parts and so many possible ways to move them, seeking out the best way takes trying too many ideas, even in simulation on a fast computer. So, we use an appropriate simplified model. </span></p> <p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Now (January 2018), we almost have hardware with which to test/prove our reduced model optimization approach. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <ol style="margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;"> <li style="list-style-type: decimal; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Simulatable hardware.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> &nbsp;Our nearly complete robot Tik-Tok is designed so that, for a given initial state and given commands, it has consistent and repeatable behavior. Learning and optimization need such consistent outcomes. This consistency comes from making parts with low friction and small clearances (low backlash). Rounded feet preclude the indeterminacy of flat-foot collisions. &nbsp;Inconsistency from safety limits, saturation, and overload conditions, are avoided by the contoller architecture. <br /></span></li> <li style="list-style-type: decimal; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Balance is dominated by stepping.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> Balance means keeping, at least on average, the effective support point (the force from the ground on the feet) below the body&rsquo;s center of mass (CoM). There are four ways to control this alignment: a) Body motions. Bending at the hip and swinging the arms can move the CoM 2 to 3 cm. b) Ankle torques can move the effective support point 2 to 5 cm. c) Stepping can move the support point about a leg length (say, 100 cm). d) Pushing off with a tipped leg can add substantial speed to the CoM, moving it up to about 100 cm. That is, the main way to prevent falls, to adjust the relative lateral positions of the support point and the CoM after a disturbance, is to step quickly and forcefully. Our robot is about as strong and quick as a human.<br /></span></li> <li style="list-style-type: decimal; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">A point-mass model captures the essence of balance.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> As noted, foot placement and push-off are most important for not falling. So, robust balance control only needs a model which well captures stepping and push-off. Thus we arrive at our inverted pendulum (IP) balance model for understanding and achieving balance: all mass is at a point at the belly.</span></li> <li style="list-style-type: decimal; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Global optimization.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> With the IP model, we can seek the best strategies. Our approach maximizes the controllable region, the set of disturbances from which falling can be avoided. Within the IP approximation, no other controller design could balance our robot better. Our global optimization is computationally feasible because of our luck in having a model that is both simple enough and useful enough. The result is a policy table which takes relevant robot sensor data and converts it, in real time, into joint control commands that maximize resistance to falling while minimizing energy use.</span></li> </ol> <p style="line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;" dir="ltr"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">At project conclusion we are well enroute to our goal: we expect Tik-Tok to be the closest to a &lsquo;good&rsquo; bipedal robot (by robustness and energy use standards), of any robot thus far.</span></p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/07/2018<br>      Modified by: Andy&nbsp;L&nbsp;Ruina</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1317981/1317981_10270430_1518317678387_Tik-Tok-physical--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1317981/1317981_10270430_1518317678387_Tik-Tok-physical--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Photo of Tik-Tok"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1317981/1317981_10270430_1518317678387_Tik-Tok-physical--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Photo of Tik-Tok"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The physical robot (photo), under construction.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[We have worked towards making of a reliable, energy-effective and affordable bipedal robot. Here are four reasons why:    The productivity and average welfare of society could be enhanced by delivery and simple service bipeds.  Dangerous emergency and rescue tasks could be done, keeping people out of danger (fires, radiation, poisonous gases). Human walking impairments could be better diagnosed and remediated by the better understanding of walking that comes from designing walking robots.  Walking is a difficult control task (many moving parts, non-smooth motions, complex contact mechanics, etc.). Understanding walking control could enhance understanding of control of similarly complex systems.      At present, the best bipedal robots, scaled for weight and speed, use at least 3 times the power of a human. No bipedal robot is reliable, energy-effective and affordable. No robot can, like a human or bird, reliably walk on two legs for thousands of steps without fear of falling once. And no robot can function for a full day on a single battery charge.    At the start of this project, our lab specialized in walking energetics. We had advanced the science of  "passive-dynamic" walkers which are to robots as gliders are to airplanes. With no motors or electronics, they can only walk downhill.

With so many moving parts and so many possible ways to move them, seeking out the best way takes trying too many ideas, even in simulation on a fast computer. So, we use an appropriate simplified model.   Now (January 2018), we almost have hardware with which to test/prove our reduced model optimization approach.       Simulatable hardware.  Our nearly complete robot Tik-Tok is designed so that, for a given initial state and given commands, it has consistent and repeatable behavior. Learning and optimization need such consistent outcomes. This consistency comes from making parts with low friction and small clearances (low backlash). Rounded feet preclude the indeterminacy of flat-foot collisions.  Inconsistency from safety limits, saturation, and overload conditions, are avoided by the contoller architecture.   Balance is dominated by stepping. Balance means keeping, at least on average, the effective support point (the force from the ground on the feet) below the body?s center of mass (CoM). There are four ways to control this alignment: a) Body motions. Bending at the hip and swinging the arms can move the CoM 2 to 3 cm. b) Ankle torques can move the effective support point 2 to 5 cm. c) Stepping can move the support point about a leg length (say, 100 cm). d) Pushing off with a tipped leg can add substantial speed to the CoM, moving it up to about 100 cm. That is, the main way to prevent falls, to adjust the relative lateral positions of the support point and the CoM after a disturbance, is to step quickly and forcefully. Our robot is about as strong and quick as a human.  A point-mass model captures the essence of balance. As noted, foot placement and push-off are most important for not falling. So, robust balance control only needs a model which well captures stepping and push-off. Thus we arrive at our inverted pendulum (IP) balance model for understanding and achieving balance: all mass is at a point at the belly. Global optimization. With the IP model, we can seek the best strategies. Our approach maximizes the controllable region, the set of disturbances from which falling can be avoided. Within the IP approximation, no other controller design could balance our robot better. Our global optimization is computationally feasible because of our luck in having a model that is both simple enough and useful enough. The result is a policy table which takes relevant robot sensor data and converts it, in real time, into joint control commands that maximize resistance to falling while minimizing energy use.  At project conclusion we are well enroute to our goal: we expect Tik-Tok to be the closest to a ?good? bipedal robot (by robustness and energy use standards), of any robot thus far.
