<AbstractNarration>The objective of this award is to establish a comprehensive knowledge base in network design for the optimal allocation, distribution, and packaging of needed healthcare resources to remote and rural locations, as it pertains to providers, services, and equipment. The developed techniques will be used to increase the scalability of problems solved in this area.  Specifically, the research will develop innovative techniques related to integer programming and mathematical structures called branch decompositions to solve these problems.  To this end, the developed techniques will be compared with other exact algorithms in the literature to validate and assess the computational efficacy of the techniques.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of this research will lead to improvements in the design of healthcare networks for rural and remote locations.  In particular, this research will assist Rice University's Beyond Traditional Borders program to provide healthcare services within the African country of Malawi.  In addition, this research could also have a significant impact for the some 3800 rural health clinics throughout the United States. More generally, this research will increase the scalability and efficiency of solving associated computationally hard problems related to network design, which have applications in fields seeing increased demand. Thus, this research will have a transformative impact on the economic feasibility and delivery of these services, affecting the public, government and business sectors.</AbstractNarration>

The p-median problem is a foundational problem for any network design problem associated with distribution. To this end, the developed techniques were compared with other exact algorithms in the literature and validated the computational efficacy of the techniques by showing that the developed techniques were significantly better in time and quality than previous methods.  Hence, the validated techniques have increased the scalability of network design problems related to distribution.  Research was also conducted predict how influence or information propagates amongst social networks.  This is of particular importance in rural and remote areas where social interaction is not as frequent as densely populated areas.     In addition, this research grant also supported research related to mathematically finding structures called k-assemblies in the brain networks.  The concept of k-assemblies is used to model tightly connected neurons found in the brain and are related to memory. In all, research from this grant has resulted in 8 published research articles with two more pending approval.  This grant partially supported the work of 3 doctoral students (2 being underrepresented in STEM fields) and engaged 2 undergraduates in a research experience.
