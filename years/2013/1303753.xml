<AbstractNarration>Nearly 60 years post the landmark case Brown v. Board of Education (1954), inequality still plagues the nation's education system. While explicit barriers to educational equity (e.g., laws) have been put in place, implicit attitudes and beliefs that foster educational disparities remain. For example, the cultural belief that Black Americans are less intelligent than their White American counterparts still persists, and has implications for children's self-concepts, development, and academic outcomes. The existing research on stereotyping and identity processes focuses primarily on adolescents and adults, and chiefly on the ways that individuals adhere or accommodate to these stereotypes. Yet, recent empirical research suggests that the influence of cultural stereotypes may start earlier than middle-school. The dual objectives of this postdoctoral project are to understand (a) the origins and early development of racial identity in childhood and (b) the ways that youth challenge or resist prevailing cultural stereotypes. These objectives are achieved through interdisciplinary work conducted by Drs. Andrew Meltzoff (Sponsoring Scientist) and Leoandra Onnie Rogers (Postdoctoral Fellow), and the support of the Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences (I-LABS), a state-of-the-art research center at the University of Washington. In these studies, in-depth interviews and tests with elementary school-age children in racially diverse public schools provide a measure of how racial stereotypes shape racial identity across developmental ages and racial groups. These data, which come from explicit verbal reports, are then used as input to refining tests of implicit cognition to capture the ways that racial stereotypes inform children's implicit racial identities. This research aims to add to the  knowledge of how stereotype processes operate prior to adolescence, and also to lay the groundwork for exploring psychological factors related to educational inequality. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual merit:  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The racial identity literature is vast and diverse in theory and methods. This research integrates theoretical perspectives and methodological approaches to examine racial identity formation. The focus is on early childhood responds to a gap in the literature concerning racial identity processes prior to the adolescent years. The use of new research techniques from developmental and social psychology adds an interdisciplinary perspective to the racial identity literature. The research also contributes new information on the ways that youth challenge stereotypes. By recognizing that children possess the ability to resist negative racial stereotypes, and investigating why some children are successful at this, it allows us to uncover how resistance processes might counteract the pernicious effects of cultural stereotypes. Moreover, the project provides new methodological tools for identity research by using explicit, in-depth interview techniques to help design more quantitative measures that are suitable for studying young children. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts: &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The findings from the study have the potential to impact educational inequality by diminishing the effects of stereotypes on youth development, for minority groups in particular. With better understanding of how children interpret racial stereotypes, such as those related to intellectual ability, teachers are better positioned to teach them to contest pernicious beliefs that otherwise may undermine their academic performance and career pursuits, particularly in disciplines where they are underrepresented such as STEM fields. Such information is useful for parents, teachers and other practitioners working with children, and the children themselves, with considerable benefits at a societal level. I-LABS has established partnerships with federal, state, and local agencies and public-private partnership on childhood learning and education. Operating this research through I-LABS creates the ability to disseminate the scientific discoveries to people who can use them.</AbstractNarration>

Analysis of the implicit measures and&nbsp;their association to the explicit measures is ongoing.</p> <p>On the explicit measures of racial identity, we find that White children rate racial identity as significantly less important than children of color. We also asked children to define what racial identity means to them (&ldquo;What does it mean to be Black/White/etc.?&rdquo;). Children's answers covered a range of concepts which we coded into six themes describing the meaning of racial identity: <em>physical appearance, inequality and group difference, humanism/equality, family, pride, </em>and <em>I don't know </em>(Table 1). The most frequent concept that children referenced to define the meaning of race was <em>physical</em> <em>appearance </em>(e.g., skin color, hair texture), mentioned by 32% of the sample, followed by <em>humanism</em>/<em>equality </em>(race doesn't matter; we're all the same), which was mentioned by 30% of the sample. Notably, these two concepts often occurred together: &ldquo;Being Black doesn't really matter. &lsquo;Cause if you're Black or White, you're still the same thing. &lsquo;Cause God created you the same in the inside. You probably just look different on the outside&rdquo; (Black girl, Grade 2).</p> <p>We also found that children of different racial backgrounds emphasized different racial meanings. Black children emphasized racial <em>pride</em>: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m happy that I&rsquo;m Black. It is good and happy. I like being me,&rdquo; whereas Mixed-Race children focused on <em>family</em>: &ldquo;[I]t means having a mix between Hispanic and American and having different races from different states&rdquo;; and White children stressed <em>humanism/equality: </em>&ldquo;I believe race doesn't matter at all. It just matters about who you are. It matters how you care about other people.&rdquo;</p> <p>Moreover, there was&nbsp;an association between the importance of racial identity and the meaning of it. Specifically, children who stated that race was <strong>very important</strong> were nearly 4 times as likely to define racial identity in terms of <em>pride</em> and 3.5 times as likely to reference <em>group differences and inequalities</em>.

The broader impact of the study is its relevance to educators and parents alike. The study makes clear that children (as young as 7 years old) can reason about race and how it matters to them. In particular, it underscores the tangible impact of&nbsp;the belief that race doesn&rsquo;t matter, or colorblindness. It is also noteworthy that the meanings children ascribed to their racial identities varied based on their racial group.
