<AbstractNarration>This project is a continuation of the NSF-supported California State University-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (CSU-LSAMP). Initiated in 1993-1994, CSU-LSAMP is an alliance of the 23 campuses of the California State University (CSU) system, which supports a coordinated and comprehensive system-wide approach to broadening participation in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. CSU-LSAMP's overall goal for the project is to contribute to the development of a STEM workforce, which is broadly inclusive, globally competitive, and prepared to participate at the frontiers of science. Specifically, CSU-LSAMP aims to: &lt;br/&gt;a)Enhance the academic and professional preparation of CSU-LSAMP participants, most of whom are students from underrepresented minorities (URM), for careers in STEM. &lt;br/&gt;b)Further improve persistence and graduation rates for CSU-LSAMP participants. &lt;br/&gt;c)Increase aggregate production of STEM degrees awarded by the CSU to URM students.&lt;br/&gt;d)Increase the number of CSU-LSAMP students who advance to STEM graduate study. &lt;br/&gt;e)Document, disseminate, and replicate undergraduate intervention models that increase access to, and success in STEM baccalaureate degree programs and facilitate admissions to STEM graduate programs.</AbstractNarration>
