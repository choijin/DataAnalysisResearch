<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms A (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Stephen R. Leone of the University of California - Berkeley and his graduate student researchers are investigating the fundamental processes that govern chemical reactivity, namely how electrons in molecules move, and how the movement of these electrons influences the movement of the heavier nuclei.  In doing these experiments, Prof. Leone and his group are developing new tools and methods for conducting these studies, based upon attosecond lasers.  Graduate students working on this project will receive  training in experimental physical chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Prof. Leone and his research group are conducting experiments on atoms and molecules, using attosecond laser-based methods.  Among the projects being carried out are:  (1) the study of attosecond dynamics of strong-field ionization in atoms; (2) the investigation of coherences in doubly-charged ions and a study of the phases of electronic coherences; (3) the exploration of alignment in sequential and nonsequential double ionization of atoms; (4) the detection of electron reconfiguration of the ion core during tunnel ionization; (5) the study of spin-orbit state superposition in methyl bromide; (6) an investigation of charge migration in the strong-field ionization of a series of 1-bromo, n-iodo alkanes (where n is the length of the alkane); and (7) the study of the dissociation of bromine in mixed electronic states.  Over the course of these measurements, Prof. Leone and his students will further develop new experimental tools and methods in attosecond chemical dynamics, a domain in which the US has lagged until recently.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In the last decade, it has become possible to produce so-called attosecond laser pulses, the shortest possible pulses of light made in the laboratory.  One attosecond is one billion billionth of a second, and the pulses are typically one hundred attoseconds in duration.  The attosecond time domain is characterized by the ability to measure elusive electronic processes and correlated electron dynamics in atoms and molecules.  Correlated dynamics is when two electrons feel each other through their mutual charge repulsion and cause their motions to be disturbed or altered.  The attosecond field provides opportunities to investigate time dynamics of electronic structure changes, such as when one electron fills a vacancy left behind by another, and all of this also depends on the locations and motions of the atoms in a molecule.   To produce attosecond pulses, powerful short pulse lasers are required, as well as optical methodologies to transform the laser pulses to the extreme ultraviolet or x-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum and to time-gate the production of such very short pulses.  In this program, attosecond pulses in the extreme ultraviolet are produced by use of intense laser pulses using a process called high harmonic generation.  Optical laser pulses as short as 3 femtoseconds are first produced, and these, in turn, form the desired isolated attosecond pulses reliably for the real time measurements.  In addition, the entire laser apparatus needs to be stabilized to measure very short timescales without interferences due to vibrations and temperature fluctuations.  The measurements focus on electron dynamics occurring on time scales of hundreds of attoseconds to a few-femtoseconds.  The investigations resolve electron dynamics in atoms and small molecules triggered first by another laser pulse.  Important results are discovered when electrons are released from atoms and molecules by very short pulses from a laser.  It is well known that the resulting product molecules can be formed in different states of excitation after the electron departs.  The different states that are formed in the atoms or molecules after excitation are frequently born in synchronism, indicating that they have a memory of the time relationship of when they were born.  This results in phenomena known as coherences, and the memory of the time relationship glimmers on, observed by oscillating state amplitudes.  In this work it is also found that the resulting states are sometimes initialized on slightly different timescales of a few hundred attoseconds, a slippage of the precise times when they are born.  This suggests correlated motions of the electrons when one electron tries to depart from all the other electrons in the atom or molecule.  The electrons feel each other and respond differently when different final states are born.  These exciting outcomes provide some of the first examples of directly visualizing the effects of electron motions in time.
