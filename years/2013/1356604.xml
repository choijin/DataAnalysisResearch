<AbstractNarration>The Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Texas Tech University, Midland College, Odessa College, and Mesalands Community College (Tucumcari, NM) are establishing the South Plains Mathematics Fellows program, in which academically talented students from underrepresented, low-income families receive scholarships for undergraduate study leading to a degree in mathematics. Over the five-year life of the program, 52 students will each receive scholarships of up to $10,000 per year. Intense mentoring, focused coursework, and participation in research opportunities are preparing the scholars for successful careers and/or smooth transitions to graduate school. The program is being advertised through websites and in regional high schools, with focused efforts to reach underrepresented student populations. Intellectual merits of the program lie in the comprehensive nature of the program that is supported with an effective recruitement network. Retention strategies include a carefully mentored and cohesive cohort, with new courses and projects to enrich the learning experiences of the students. Mentoring practices are being studied and publishable results should be beneficial to other institutions seeking successful retention of underrepresented rural students. &lt;br/&gt;Participants get a sense of the work of research mathematics, while students outside the program benefit from new courses. Integration with regional partners is developing a new pipeline for math students. The broader impacts are significant regionally in providing exposure to STEM education to economically disadvantaged groups and in geographically isolated regions with higher populations of Hispanics and first generation college students.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Texas Tech University, in conjunction with our community college partners, Midland College and Odessa College, provided financial and mentoring support to mathematically talented students.  With the support of the program, 42 students have graduated or are on track to graduate with their bachelorâ€™s degree.     Texas Tech is a Hispanic-serving institution, and a special emphasis was placed on finding and supporting students from under-represented groups and first-generation students.     Students participated in special seminars and were matched with faculty mentors who could guide them through the labyrinth of the university bureaucracy and assist them in choosing courses and activities which would best prepare them for their future career goals.  Faculty mentors underwent a special training program to assist them in connecting with their students.     Many Texas Tech students chose to engage in undergraduate research with their faculty mentor, and independent learning projects designed by Texas Tech faculty were also made available to the community college students to encourage them to delve deeper into mathematics and to pique their interest in transferring to Texas Tech.     Students from the community colleges were given the opportunity to visit Texas Tech, discover their career options after transferring, and learn to envision themselves as university graduates.  Texas Tech faculty visited the partners in turn, recruiting students and describing the opportunities afforded by continuing their education at the university.
