<AbstractNarration>This is a post-doctoral study, during which the PI will be trained in ethnographic methods and will conduct an ethnographic study of  laboratories in which in tissue engineers are working on developing a sustainable source of protein. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The topic is of general social importance because it pertains to biotechnology, animal welfare, and food security. The PI plans to produce academic journal articles, a book, and to share his results with the public through a workshop and museum exhibit. He has experience writing for a broad audience and this will contribute to the project having a broad impact.</AbstractNarration>
