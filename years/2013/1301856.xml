<AbstractNarration>Plasmas (i.e., charged, ionized gases) are pervasive.  From stellar nurseries to the Earth's ionosphere, plasmas represent a fourth state of matter that is the most common form of matter in the visible universe.  Moreover, a phenomenon known as a "dusty" or "complex" plasma is formed when charged particulate matter, such as dust or ices, becomes incorporated in the plasma environment.  In space, phenomena such as in comet tails or the rings of Saturn are examples of dusty plasmas.  Closer to Earth, control over particulates in plasmas are important in high-technology and microelectronic fabrication.  In both astrophysical and technological plasmas, the presence of magnetic fields can have a profound influence on the properties of the plasma.  This research project supports a new, state-of-the-art, multi-user, superconducting, high-magnetic device to understand the basic properties of a strongly magnetized plasmas and magnetized dusty plasma.  The intellectual merit of this work is that it will enable the study of new regimes of plasma physics and dusty plasma physics that have not been accessible in previous experiments.  The main project goal is to investigate how the structural, thermal, charging, and stability properties of a dusty plasma evolve as the system is taken from an unmagnetized state through a progression of regimes where first the electrons, then the ions, and then charged microparticles become magnetized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact of this work is substantial.  This project is a direct collaboration among three US universities (Auburn University, The University of Iowa, and University of California-San Diego) that perform leading research in the field of dusty plasmas.  The researchers from these three organizations will coordinate a broad team of collaborators representing universities, national laboratories, and international partners.  And, this project will provide excellent opportunities to train the next generation of plasma scientists through the training of graduate and undergraduate students as well as providing partnerships with dusty plasma researchers at predominantly undergraduate institutions.</AbstractNarration>
