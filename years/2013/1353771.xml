<AbstractNarration>The project supports 5 scholarships to enable attendance by students and junior faculty of the diversity workshop organized by the PI along with the upcoming SoSP conference. The workshop will be held on Nov 3 in Farmington, PA. The  goal  of  the  workshop  is  to  strengthen  the  pipeline  of  systems  students, providing them with advice and networking opportunities that they might not otherwise receive.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[The Workshop on Diversity in Systems Research (Diversity) provides technical and career mentoring to researchers from all backgrounds and nationalities. Unlike traditional systems workshops that develop specific, ongoing research projects, this workshop focuses on attendees, helping students become strong, well-rounded researchers regardless of their chosen research areas. The work- shop especially targets students from historically under-represented groups.  Students at every level, from undergraduates to senior graduate students, participate. The goal is to produce a mentoring ladder where the youngest students get concrete advice for the next 3-4 years from senior graduate students who in turn network with early career researchers invited as speakers. In 2013, PI Stewart co-chaired Diversity along with Vishakha Gupta, a research scientist at Intel.  The workshop was co-located with SOSP, a premier conference on operating systems research.  The colocation gave attendees access to elite researchers. Further, colocation also made it easier to recruit speakers and panelists.  The program can be found at http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~cstewart/Diversity2013.  It included: + Rising Star talks from young researchers in the Diversity community.  The speakers were Hakim Weatherspoon of Cornell University and Mona Attariyan of Google. Their talks were 70% technical, describing their ongoing research (Super Clouds and Distributed System Debugging, respectively) and 30% focused on career advice.   +  The Still Rising Star talk came Mooi Chooi of Lehigh University.  This talks was also mostly technical but focused on Dr. Chooi's research on wireless systems.  Dr. Chooi also spoke about the Career path at small academic institutions. + A keynote talk on cloud computing and solid state memory was given by Richard Uhlig of Intel Labs. + A panel discussion on career planning +  A student poster competition of peer-reviewed posters  with prizes for students at the undergraduate, early graduate, and senior graduate student levels.      Intellectual merit and broader impact:   NSF sponsored the attendance of 9 students, 5 were men, 4 were women and 1 was an underrepresented minority.  These students have since published papers in WWW, ACM Computing Surveys, HotNets, and HotPower.   After the workshop, we surveyed student and speaker participants.  Images of parts of the survey are included with this report.  The results for speakers showed the strength of multi-layer mentoring: Almost all speakers felt they had the opportunity to network with younger people and people at the same career level.  Further, more speakers felt that we found the right mix of technical and career content.   Among student participants the workshop increased their interest in 1) a research career in systems research (80%) and 2) research careers in general (55%).  Further, the workshop had the effect of only boosting confidence among attendees in all areas related to research careers. Finally. over 70% of students felt they "learned new things from the technical content" presented at the workshop.
