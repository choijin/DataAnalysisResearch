<AbstractNarration>The Fairfield University Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program in Mathematics and Computational Science is an eight-week summer program designed to engage talented undergraduates in original mathematics and computing research, beyond the college curriculum. The program hosts nine students per summer, providing on-campus housing and student stipends. The participants spend their time working and learning in small groups, with each group in close consultation with an individual Fairfield University faculty mentor on research topics drawn from the mentor's field of expertise. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The principal goal of the program is to prepare the participants for research-based scientific careers, and to engender in each student a deep understanding not only of the importance of individual scientific research, but also of the broader context of collaboration into which that research fits. This is achieved by providing the students with the experience of a research cohort. This collaborative research environment - students working with faculty and with each other - also allows for the general advancement of the mathematics and computing disciplines, and fosters the continuing scholarly and pedagogical development of all the academic professionals involved.</AbstractNarration>
