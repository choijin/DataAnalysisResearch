<AbstractNarration>The results of this research will advance basic understanding in the Earth sciences and will have practical implications for understanding Earth's carbon cycle and the potential for carbon sequestration in mineral substrates. The chemical breakdown of minerals ("mineral dissolution") regulates the availability of carbon and other nutrient elements across a range of scales in space and time. This means that understanding mineral dissolution is fundamental to the study of the Earth system, and particularly to the study of Earth's climate and biosphere. The rate at which minerals dissolve is known to depend on a number of factors. Of these, the roles of biological activity and the approach to thermodynamic equilibrium remain particularly poorly understood. This knowledge gap stands in the way of efforts to develop models that scale laboratory observations to field conditions and makes it difficult to use the results from experimental studies to address large-scale Earth system problems. Meanwhile studies of weathering in natural systems are often confounded by multiple variables. The project proposed here will use novel experimental methods to take a major step forward in understanding how microbial activity and the approach to equilibrium affect the dissolution rate of the silicate mineral olivine. Olivine plays a key role in the carbon cycle as a primary constituent of highly weatherable rocks, and has been proposed as a substrate for carbon dioxide sequestration, making it a noteworthy mineral for focused investigation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Numerous field observations have shown that biological activity drives higher increased silicate weathering rates, but a mechanistic understanding is lacking because prior experimental efforts have been complicated by variations in the activity and phenotypic expression of organisms within and between experiments. To minimize this variability, experiments in the proposed study will be preformed using microorganisms with targeted genetic mutations. With this approach, the effects of a single microbial process can be isolated and quantified over a range of environmental conditions, allowing for a more robust determination of the effects of biological activity on olivine dissolution rates than have previously been possible. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The dependence of mineral dissolution rates on the departure from thermodynamic equilibrium is a critical factor that controls dissolution rates in natural environments. Theoretical predictions vary significantly in both the functional form of the thermodynamic equilibrium dependence as well as the value of the thermodynamic equilibrium at which a significant change in rate is observed. For olivine, near-equilibrium experiments are complicated because solutions become supersaturated with respect to secondary magnesium silicate minerals that precipitate at non-negligible rates, making it impossible to quantify dissolution rates using standard methodologies. To circumvent this problem, a novel method of determining dissolution rates by isotope dilution will be used to study the near equilibrium dissolution kinetics of olivine.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will support the training of a doctoral student, who will supervise high school students from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds. The doctoral student will also lead the development of a laboratory exercise that demonstrates the carbon dioxide sequestration potential of the mineral olivine while teaching basic science concepts. This exercise will be incorporated into a display at the University of Southern California and will be provided free of charge over the Internet for educational use at other institutions.</AbstractNarration>
