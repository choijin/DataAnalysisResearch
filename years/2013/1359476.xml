<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates Site "Bringing Us Together, Improving Communications and Lives" at the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSM&amp;T) is an integrated 10-week summer undergraduate research program in electrical and computer engineering (ECE).  The focus of the research projects will reflect the strengths of the ECE department at SDSM&amp;T, namely applied electromagnetics, autonomous/embedded systems, wireless communications and power.  The site is designed to expose a diverse group of undergraduate students, particularly veterans and women as well as others underrepresented in ECE, to a research environment.  The recruitment goal is for veterans and women to comprise at least half of the participants with the intent of expanding the national engineering and science talent pool.  In light of evidence that students are motivated to learn when a broader context for the research is established, the students will engage in professional development, research, and historical development seminars on an ongoing basis as well as in collegial activities to foster an appreciation for the historical development and current applications of ECE and the role they play in improving communications and lives.  The weekly professional development activities will feature a strong emphasis on technical communications led by the Communications Coordinator (an English professor) that develop the skills needed to pursue higher level work.  Also, a comprehensive assessment program will be implemented by the Assessment Coordinator to quantitatively assess student gains in skills related to research, the impact of the program on students from differing backgrounds, and their long-term development as professionals.  Further, the students will engage in outreach activities to secondary students, particularly those of underrepresented groups, as well as to active duty service members and veterans.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates Site "Bringing Us Together, Improving Communications and Lives" at the South Dakota School of Mines &amp; Technology (SDSM&amp;T) is designed to expose a diverse group of undergraduate students, particularly women and veterans as well as others underrepresented in electrical and computer engineering (ECE), to a research environment and help them develop as professionals with the intent of expanding the national engineering and science talent pool. The research projects deal with topics related to improving communications and the lives of people which are of vital importance in our global society as well as in the economic and defense interests of the nation.  These projects led to the unifying theme of the site "Bringing Us Together, Improving Communications and Lives."  In addition to hands-on research, the students will engage in professional development, research, and historical development seminars. The purpose of the seminars is to develop the skills needed to pursue higher level work, as well as to foster an appreciation for the historical development and current applications of ECE and the role they play in improving communications and lives.  Further, the students will engage in outreach activities to secondary students, particularly those of underrepresented groups, as well as to active duty service members and veterans.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;"This award is co-funded by the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EHR/EPSCoR)."</AbstractNarration>
