<AbstractNarration>This project supports an I-Corps Site at the University of Minnesota (UMN). The Site will provide infrastructure, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to I-Corps entrepreneurial teams. With this grant, UMN leverages and extends its assets in science and engineering, research, entrepreneurship education, and technology commercialization to create the Minnesota Innovation Corps (MIN-Corps). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;MIN-Corps will: &lt;br/&gt;1. Expand UMN's outreach to its STEM researchers - faculty, postdoctoral, graduate students, and undergraduates - to engage more of them in the process of translating discoveries and technological developments into commercializable products. &lt;br/&gt;2. Train entrepreneurial talent through STARTUP, a course that incorporates the Lean LaunchPad concepts and tools. &lt;br/&gt;3. Provide modest, early-stage funding ($1,000 to $3,000) to approximately 30 entrepreneurial teams per year who are engaged in the course and show potential, bridging the funding gap between early stage development and translation into the market. &lt;br/&gt;4. Support ongoing customer development and commercialization efforts by connecting teams with UMN and community resources. &lt;br/&gt;5. Leverage research expertise to contribute to and support collaborative program evaluation and research across the national I-Corps network. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By engaging teams from UMN's STEM research base, MIN-Corps will create new ventures based on sustainable business models and customer-focused product design. MIN-Corps will prepare teams to seek follow-on funding through public grants and private investment. MIN-Corps will engage with stakeholders to make broader impacts in the community including: &lt;br/&gt;Talent Development. MIN-Corps will expand awareness of resources supporting innovation and entrepreneurship among students and faculty in STEM fields, particularly among women and under-represented groups. The training experience offered to high-potential entrepreneurial team members through the STARTUP course will increase their readiness for innovation roles in industry and infuse a more entrepreneurial mindset in UMN's culture. &lt;br/&gt;Network Development. MIN-Corps will expand UMN's current engagement with seasoned entrepreneurs, angel investors, and venture capitalists from the local innovation ecosystem as mentors throughout the educational and commercialization process. The program will also help harness the energy of individuals and organizations currently supporting entrepreneurship and innovation across Minnesota, including 19 Fortune 500 companies that make their home in the state.&lt;br/&gt;Economic Development. MIN-Corps will increase the translation rate of STEM-based innovation to new commercial ventures positioned for subsequent funding from NSF I-Corps, SBIR, NCIIA E-Teams, accelerators, incubators, competitions, angel investors and venture capitalists. The program will spur economic prosperity by expanding access to Lean Launchpad training and increasing the number of start-ups, entrepreneurs, and high-tech jobs in the state.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ During its first five years, the University of Minnesota (UMN) I-Corps Site, MIN-Corps, delivered technology commercialization education and coaching to 3,516 individuals and 301 teams that raised $12.7 million in commercialization grants and/or equity investment.  Thirteen (13) teams have participated in the I-Corps National Teams program, with 4 more accepted into second-half 2019 cohorts. MIN-Corps generated 22 startups, 7 of which attracted SBIR, STTR or PFI grants. Seventy two percent (72%) of the MIN-Corps innovation team members were affiliated with the College of Science and Engineering, with the balance coming from 21 other University of Minnesota colleges.  We positioned I-Corps training as a form of professional development, not just to commercialize specific technologies.  As a result, 45% of participating innovators were graduate students and postdocs, 37% were undergraduates, 9% were staff, 8% were faculty and 1% were external to the University.   The MIN-Corps Lean LaunchPad workshops have earned a 75% Net Promoter Score from participants (meaning that they would recommend the program to a friend or colleague, and about 95% indicated that the programs increased their understanding of commercialization ?a lot? or ?a great deal.?  To achieve these results, MIN-Corps applied a four-part theory of change:  Building Awareness (seminars on commercialization considerations and opportunities), Building Skills (Lean LaunchPad for-credit courses as well as noncredit workshops), Building Connections (with a mentor pool of over 200 industry leaders and entrepreneurs), and Ongoing Support (through ongoing coaching and strategy clinics).  Lean LaunchPad content has been incorporated into senior design courses in Biomedical Engineering (since Fall 2016) and Electrical and Computer Engineering (since Fall 2018).   We have made a focused effort to attract women to MIN-Corps teams, with about 36% female participation ? in addition to outreach to various women?s academic organizations, we also built a pipeline of female STEM innovators through the MIN-Corps annual Women Innovators Conference.  Other outreach efforts included the Walleye Tank life science venture competition in collaboration with Mayo Clinic, joint programming with MN-SBIR (the State of Minnesota SBIR navigator), and the Medical Devices Industry Connect customer discovery program at UMN?s Design of Medical Devices Conference in collaboration with the I-Corps Midwest Node. Finally, we strengthened the connection between the UMN Carlson School of Management and STEM innovators through MIN-Corps Fellows, a program in which teams of MBA students work with University of Minnesota scientists to advance the commercialization of their innovations.
