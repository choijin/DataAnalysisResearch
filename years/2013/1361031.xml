<AbstractNarration>John Stanton of the University of Texas at Austin is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry Division and the Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering program (CDS&amp;E) to develop theoretical methods and software to describe the properties of molecules in which the electrons have been excited.  The major thrust of the work is to develop and use quantum mechanical methods to understand experiments in the field of molecular spectroscopy and to predict the results. Spectroscopy probes how molecules interact with electromagnetic radiation.   By investigating how a particular molecule behaves at various wavelengths (energies) of irradiation, one can determine the structure of the molecule as well as infer most of the detailed information that governs the chemical reactivity and other behavior of the molecule.  A major goal of the project is to develop quantum-mechanical methods that are useful for analyzing the spectra of molecules in the visible and ultraviolet energy ranges, which is the most relevant region for the electrons that drive chemistry.  The computational methods and tools developed by the Stanton group are embodied in a free and publicly available computer program, CFOUR, which computes very accurate quantities that can be compared with experiment.  This computer code takes advantage of state-of-the-art computer architecture. Both graduate and undergraduate students are involved in these projects.  The work has relevance to many fields including interstellar and atmospheric chemistry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In terms of traditional quantum chemistry,  Stanton and his research group focus on methods development at very high levels of coupled-cluster theory, specifically those that involve quadruple excitation effects.   This includes methods for energy and gradient calculations, as well as extension to radicals, ions and excited states that can be accessed by the equation-of-motion approach. All methods are incorporated into the CFOUR program package, leading to new program modules that will exploit advantages offered by massively parallel computers.   Additional research focuses on non-adiabatic effects in spectroscopy, both in the development of interpretive tools as well as development of programs. While computer program development is a major focus of the planned research, the aforementioned investigation of interpretive tools is not computational in nature.  Similar in his respect are two other project activities:  the establishment and benchmarking of a tool for analyzing the adequacy of particular levels of coupled-cluster theory for treating specific problems; and analysis of some formal properties of Miller's semiclassical transition state theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In our NSF-funded research, we have sought to better understand the fundamental chemical physics governing molecules.     To a large degree, the chemistry of molecules (how they interact and react with one another) is determined by the behavior of their electrons.   The field of quantum chemistry deals specifically with the behavior of electrons, and is largely concerned with obtaining accurate solutions to the so-called Schroedinger equation.    This formidably difficult equation cannot be solved exactly, and methods are continually being developed which best balance computational cost and accuracy.    Our work has largely focused on extremely accurate methods, which are quite expensive.   However, they can be applied to small- to medium-sized molecules to help reveal their fundamental behavior.   We hafve developed methods for such calculations and made them available in computer programs.      Traditionally, the way that molecules are probed in the laboratory is through "molecular spectrosocpy".   This field of science involves the use of electromagnetic radiation to determine the presence, structure, and internal states of molecules using sources that range from the microwave region to the ultraviolet.   Our group's research is - to a large extent - focused on spectroscopy in all of these wavelength ranges, and the tools that we have developed have enhaced our ability to understand, predict and otherwise interpret these experiments.   In addition to the work on electronic structure and the Schroedinger equation mentioned aboe, we have developed tools that use the electron structure results to calculate (simulate) the spectra of molecular movements from the tumbling and rotation (microwave region) vibration (infrared) and the movement of the electrons themselves (ultraviolet).
