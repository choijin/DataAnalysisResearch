<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to study the use of cognitive prediction paradigms for online fault diagnosis and prognosis to enable condition-based smart maintenance for wind energy systems.  The approach is to:  (1) study the use of time and frequency domain data mining methods to effectively extract the features of faults in a wind turbine from the signals acquired from the wind turbine condition monitoring system; and (2) study the use of artificial neural networks and machine learning for intelligently diagnosing and prognosing faults, predicting the lifetime, and quantitatively evaluating the physical condition of the wind turbine using the extracted fault features.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  This project will create innovative cognitive prediction-based models and computational algorithms to enhance condition awareness of geographically distributed wind energy systems.  The findings of this research are highly transformable and will provide capabilities for enabling condition-based intelligent maintenance for other energy conversion and engineered systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The outcome of this project will further exploit the benefits of wind power by successfully reducing cost and improving reliability of wind energy systems and, therefore, will make wind energy a reliable, cost-competitive source of clean electricity.  The increasing use of wind power will benefit various sectors of the nation's economy and contribute to sustainable development of society.  Multiple fields covered by this project are areas where a talent shortage is projected in the United States, particularly in the Midwest.  The proposed activities will provide a unique learning platform for young individuals to become skilled professionals.</AbstractNarration>

These improvements will make wind energy a reliable, cost-competitive source for clean and renewable electricity generation.     The findings of this project have generated 15 peer-reviewed papers published in top-ranked journals, 20 peer-reviewed conference proceedings papers, 2 U.S. patent applications, 2 Ph.D. dissertations completed, and 2 Ph.D. dissertations to be completed by the end of 2017.  A paper entitled "adaptive feature extraction and SVM classification for real-time fault diagnosis of drivetrain gearboxes" published by the Proceedings of the IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition in September 2013 won the First Prize of the Best Paper Awards of the Renewable and Sustainable Energy Conversion Systems Committee of the IEEE Industry Applications Society.  One Ph.D. student received the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL) College of Engineering Outstanding Graduate Research Assistant Award in 2016 for his outstanding achievement in the Ph.D. dissertation research supported in part by this project.       The principal investigator developed new course materials on cognitive recognition and prediction methods based on the results of this research.  The materials have been integrated in the course Computational Intelligence, which was developed and is taught annually by the principal investigator at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  The course has attracted students from different disciplines, such as electrical engineering, computer engineering, computer science, biomedical engineering, civil engineering, mechanical engineering, material engineering, biological systems engineering, mathematics, etc.  Models and software used to implement the fault diagnosis and prognosis methods developed in this project, two laboratory wind turbine testbeds with different electrical generators, and a power electronic converter testbed have been developed.  In addition, a wireless-sensor-network-based online condition monitoring system has been developed and installed on four wind turbines in the field.  These models, software, testbeds, and systems have been used for teaching undergraduate and graduate students about wind energy systems and are open to the public in the form of system demonstrations.  A large amount of data generated from computer simulations and hardware tests conducted during this project is providing excellent resources for teaching and research in the field.  Moreover, the principal investigator and graduate students have offered various demonstrations and laboratory tours for K-12 students to learn the basic principles of wind energy conversion and renewable energy systems.     The principal investigator has collaborated with academic and industrial leaders from around the world in organizing conferences on wind energy and a Special Section on Condition Monitoring, Diagnosis, Prognosis, and Health Management for Wind Energy Conversion Systems published in the October 2015 issue of the IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics.  The conferences and special section provided unique platforms for academic and industrial communities to report recent technology advances and breakthroughs, identify technology gaps, and guide research and technology development in the field.
