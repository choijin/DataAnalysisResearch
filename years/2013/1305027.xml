<AbstractNarration>Fossil insects provide a unique deep-time record of ecological and evolutionary response to past environmental changes and therefore are invaluable for understanding the impacts of climate change on the current biodiversity crisis.  Given current models of future climate change and the important role that insects play in human society (biodiversity, pests, pollination, vectors of disease) the ability to access these data and make predictions about future insect populations becomes even more urgent. The Fossil Insect Collaborative will make available all the major collections of fossil insect specimens in the United States by creating electronic specimen records consisting of digital images and associated collection data. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The digitized fossil insect collections will be made broadly accessible to the research community, K-16 education, government and industry, the general public, and the media through the project website and a central site integrating all the paleobiological Thematic Collections Networks called iDigPaleo.  Mobile apps and activities that allow a wide variety of users to experience and interact directly with the collections data will be developed. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Observations on the response of plants and animals to climate change (including sea level change) are helpful for making predictions about the likely impact of climate change on biodiversity and changing habitats in the future. Historical records expand our observational record and make for better predictions, but fossils provide a record of <em>millions of years</em> of changing climate and biodiversity on Earth. Fossils in museum collections are an extraordinary resource for researchers investigating the effects of climate change, but in order to use them it is necessary to digitize the information they hold. Digitization involves electronically cataloging, georeferencing (providing both map coordinates and the geological context of the fossil collecting locality), and photographing specimens.</p> <p>Insects are one of the most successful groups of animals to have ever lived, and are also extremely important to humans; they include many species that are agricultural pests or responsible for spreading serious diseases, but they also play a vital role in pollinating plants, including crops, and producing materials like silk and honey. The distribution of insect species is likely to change along with the climate, exposing humans to new risks and challenges. Looking at how insects have responded to past climate change is a good way of predicting what those challenges might be and developing effective strategies for meeting them.</p> <p>Many of these challenges will be faced by the generation of students that we are training today. Undergraduate students and high school students participated in this project through hands-on digitization and mentoring. Along the way, they learned the relevance of museum collections to scientific research and the particular importance of the fossils we investigated to documenting changes in paleoecology and biodiversity, especially as it relates to climate change. We are also bringing this experience to a much wider audience of students through the development of iDigPaleo (<a href="http://www.idigpaleo.org">www.idigpaleo.org</a>) an online tool with associated educational materials that allows students in the classroom to use digitized collections in the same way that scientists do. We worked with teachers from across Connecticut to develop the system, refined it with input from high school interns involved with the Peabody EVOLUTIONS program, and had those interns evaluate it with visitors to the Peabody Museum of Natural History. We increased the impact of this project by sharing protocols, workflows, and the iDigPaleo system at conferences, workshops, and webinars.</p> <p>The final results have been two-fold. First, we have added tens of thousands of new fossil records to iDigBio for research use; second, the pilot version of iDigPaleo developed for the project is already in use as an outreach tool for a second TCN project (Cretaceous World) and we are in active discussions to develop and employ it more widely on other projects, increasing the range of collections that students can access and use.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/01/2017<br>      Modified by: Christopher&nbsp;Norris</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1305027/1305027_10242166_1501613211784_digitization--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1305027/1305027_10242166_1501613211784_digitization--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1305027/1305027_10242166_1501613211784_digitization--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A Yale University undergraduate student gains valuable scientific and museum experience cataloging fossil insects at the Peabody Museum.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Susan Butts</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Christopher&nbsp;Norris</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1305027/1305027_10242166_1501613319686_evoidigbiodemo--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1305027/1305027_10242166_1501613319686_evoidigbiodemo--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1305027/1305027_10242166_1501613319686_evoidigbiodemo--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">High school students from the greater New Haven area, participating in the Peabody EVOLUTIONS afterschool program beta tested and evaluated user experience on iDigPaleo and informed major renovations to the site.
