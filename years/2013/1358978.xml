<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;Each year, nine undergraduates from diverse backgrounds and a broad spectrum of institutions will be recruited for a 10-week summer research experience in materials physics at Georgetown University.  Students will engage in experimental, computational, and theoretical research projects in nanoscale physics, soft matter, device physics, active matter, biophysics, and cold-atom systems.  Taking advantage of Georgetown's location in the nation's capital, students will also be exposed to the role of science, particularly materials research, in public policy.   These activities build on Georgetown's existing programs designed to engage undergraduate science majors directly with the government on issues of national importance, and will help build an understanding of the connection between scientific research and the world outside of the laboratory.  Students will also participate in a variety of professional development activities, many of which will be held jointly with the REU program in the Georgetown Chemistry Department.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY&lt;br/&gt;The National Science Foundation supported Research Experiences for Undergraduates program in Materials Physics at Georgetown University will provide undergraduates from diverse backgrounds and a broad spectrum of institutions an opportunity to engage in important and challenging research in the fundamental science of materials, while developing technical and professional skills necessary for a successful career in science.  In addition, students will be exposed to the role of science, particularly materials research, in public policy, and will meet with science policy practitioners in the Nation's Capital.  Recruitment efforts will focus on students from schools with limited research programs, as well as members of underrepresented groups.  It is anticipated that engagement in focused research projects, exploration of the broader role of science and scientists in society, and development of lasting relationships with faculty mentors will positively influence student perceptions of careers in science and help increase the pool of future materials researchers.  In addition, students who complete this program will be uniquely qualified to understand and communicate the importance of materials science in technological progress and in addressing societal challenges.</AbstractNarration>
