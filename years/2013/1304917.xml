<AbstractNarration>Development and Application of Genetic Programming in Design and Optimization of Ultra-wideband Metamaterials&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The objectives of the proposed work are; (1) explore the applications and investigate the fundamental capabilities of the metamaterial technology in electromagnetics through the use of Genetic Programming and  true 3-D structures, as opposed to traditional multi-layering approach, (2) Examine possible miniaturization through true 3-D  implementation to facilitate possible metamaterials applications in what has been noted as the no man's land frequency bands of a few hundred Megahertz, and (3) Use developed strategies to develop ultra wideband (50:1) Artificial Magnetic Conductor (AMC) and absorbing ground planes using novel flexible lightweight patterned materials in these frequency bands. To create unique and non-intuitive 3D metamaterial structures, this work will employ a novel approach combining Genetic Programming (GP), a novel multidisciplinary bio-inspired optimization procedure generating optimized computer programs as solutions, Lindenmayer-system (L-system) for creating 3-D structures, non-linear optimization, and scripted text-based geometry input to full wave EM simulators. Candidate metamaterial geometries will be fabricated and tested using the rectangular transverse electro-magnetic (TEM) transmission line test chamber that was utilized in our earlier work in this area. The metamaterial performance will be further evaluated with antenna measurements using an UWB dual polarization cylindrical long-slot antenna array.&lt;br/&gt; Broader Impact&lt;br/&gt;GP, having produced unique and quite successful results in other fields but has seen limited application in electromagnetics and promises to provide innovative solutions particularly when designing ultra wideband systems and devices. GP provides an authentic and bio-inspired insight in the fundamental development of the solution, thus has the potential for guiding innovative designs, and providing avenues to break new grounds in the optimization of electromagnetic structures. The proposed integrative and  multidisciplinary  approach, therefore, is aimed at using Genetic Programming and associated L-system to provide unique solutions and lead to more in-depth fundamental understanding of the capabilities of the metamaterial technology particularly in challenging application areas such that ultra wideband antenna designs, ground penetrating radar for Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) and IED detection, and in Radar Cross Section (RCS) applications requiring UWB performance at lower microwave frequencies.  The developed GP programs will be disseminated via the Internet and described via publications. Additionally, the resulting programs and the optimization approach will be incorporated into antenna and electromagnetics courses in the University.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The objective of the proposed work is to examine the feasibility of using Genetic Programming and associated optimization codes in developing metamaterials with unique topologies and engineered characteristics that may not exit in nature. Genetic Programming is a technique whereby computer programs are encoded as a set of genes that are evolved evolutionary and provide computer programs that are solation to engineering design problems.  The example application in this project is the design of a metamaterial broadband and low loss perfect magnetic conductor in the lower MHz frequency band. The design of broadband metamaterial in this relatively low frequency band is very challenging as much of the available multilayer structures include lossy materials to help achieve the desired bandwidth.  Significant progress was made in this project including:  1. Successful determination of the capability of the developed GP codes in achieving successful 3D broadband metamaterials  designs with unique low loss perfect magnetic conductors in the 225-450 MHz band.  2.The project also demonstrated the ability to overcome the computational challenges of GP algorithms through code parallelization in an 8 odes computer system and the use of lower lever optimizer at the local single node level.  3. Simulation resulted from 2D designs of broadband antennas, show that GP designs meet or exceed performances of human developed designs that are published in literature.  Two journal articles were published and several conference presentation were made including:  J. Rayno, M. F. Iskander, and N.
