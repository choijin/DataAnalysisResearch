<AbstractNarration>The project, "Lie Groups, Lie Algebras and their Representations," involves the delivery of three or more weekend workshops per academic year devoted to current research topics in Lie theory and applications, the first of which will occur October 12-13, 2013 at the University of California at Berkeley.  The remaining workshops for 2013-14 will take place at Stanford University during the winter of 2014, with an emphasis on quantum groups, and at USC in Spring 2014, with an emphasis on Hopf algebras.  The URL for the Workshop series is https://sites.google.com/site/lietheory/home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of the workshop series is to give advanced graduate students, post-docs, and other junior researchers the opportunity to attend state-of-the-art lectures by, and interact with, leading researchers in the field of Lie groups and Lie algebras, and to encourage collaborative initiatives.  Lie theory is an active area of mathematical research with connections to algebra, analysis, geometry, topology, and mathematical physics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The 2016-2017 program of the Intercampus Workshop: Lie groups, Lie algebras, and their  representations was extremely ssuccessful.  There were three areas of concentration: "Transformation Groups in Complex Geometry" for the first workshop, "Infinite Dimensional LieTheory" for the second, and "Tensor Categories" for the third.  The participation of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars was definitely increased over previous years, and the percentage of female students, postdocs and speakers was sharply increased.  In addition, minority participation has increased. At this point let me note that half of the local organizers were female and one was minority.  Each workshop had a number of talks -- but with adequate time for informal research discussions, especially between continuing researchers and between graduate students and established researchers.  The graduate students definitely benefitted.   Given the area of concentration we took advantage (in the first two workshops) of the partcipation of iconic researchers in the corresponding areas, and publicised this as "Conference in Honor of Alan Huckleberry" and "Conference in Honor of Ivan Penkov.  That participation was  especially good for younger mathematicians.  Also, of course, NSF support for this workshop series was quite important for the participation of many of the graduate student and postdoctoral scholars -- who otherwise would have had problems with transportation and accomodation costs.  Further information is available on the workshop series web page,  https://sites.google.com/site/lietheory/home and the individual workshop pages listed there.
