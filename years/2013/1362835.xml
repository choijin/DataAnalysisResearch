<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Marsha I. Lester of the University of Pennsylvania and her graduate student and post-doctoral researcher colleagues are investigating the chemical properties of reactive atmospheric intermediates. The ultimate goal of the work by Professor Lester and her group is to develop a better understanding of the chemistry of the troposphere, the lowest part of the atmosphere, where we live and breathe.  Ultimately, studies like that of Prof. Lester will lead to the development of better models of atmospheric chemistry.  The young researchers working on this project will receive sophisticated training in state-of-the art methods from a leader in the field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The so-called Criegee intermediates that Professor Lester and her group are studying are produced in the reaction of ozone (a tropospheric pollutant) with alkenes (a type of volatile organic compound).  These interesting chemical species represent important intermediates in the oxidation of alkenes in the atmosphere.  The experimental work in the Lester laboratory will look at: the dissociation (unimolecular and photo-induced) of the Criegee intermediates; the spectroscopy of a series of related compounds; and the bimolecular reactions of the Criegee intermediate with other atmospheric species</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Ozonolysis of volatile biogenic and anthropogenic alkenes is an important source of hydroxyl radicals, a key oxidant in the troposphere.  A critical step in the generation of hydroxyl radicals is a hydrogen-atom transfer reaction involving a carbonyl oxide species, known as the Criegee intermediate.  This research has obtained an infrared "fingerprint" of several prototypical Criegee intermediates.  It has also revealed the direct time-resolved rates for appearance of hydroxyl radicals arising from decay of the Criegee intermediates at energies in the vicinity of and much lower than the classical barrier to reaction.  Complementary calculations have shown that quantum mechanical tunneling through the barrier contributes substantially to the decay rates.  Modeling has further demonstrated that the thermal decay rates of Criegee intermediates under atmospheric conditions are significantly enhanced by tunneling in the hydrogen-atom transfer process.   Finally, deuteration is shown to result in a large kinetic isotope effect indicative of tunneling under both laboratory and atmospheric conditions.  This program has broader impacts in training of young scientist at the graduate and postdoctoral level in forefront scientific research with potential impact in atmospheric chemistry.  The results of the research have been disseminated broadly in peer-reviewed publications, at local, national and international scientific meetings, and through seminars at research universities and undergraduate institutions.
