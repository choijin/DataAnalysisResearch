<AbstractNarration>The PI will continue his work on the arithmetic of Shimura varieties and applications. One goal is to apply the PI's recent results on the mod p points on these varieties to compute their zeta functions. Another aim is to extend some of these results to cases of bad reduction. One possible application is a result about the structure of de Rham-Tate cycles on abelian varieties.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Shimura varieties are a class of geometric objects which have played a very important role in many advances  in number theory during the past 50 years. They can be thought of as parameter (or moduli) spaces for abelian varieties. The project aims to study the number theoretic properties of Shimura varieties, and their applications to the arithmetic of abelian varieties.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project studied various problems in Number Theory, and specifically in arithmetic algebraic geometry. In particular several results about the geometry and cohomology of Shimura varieties were obtained.  Shimura varieties are moduli spaces of abelian varieties. The study of their arithmetic has had numerous application in number theory, including the construction of Galois representations attached to automorphic forms.   One of the aims of the present project was to prove a point counting formula for Shimura varieties of abelian type and then to use this to relate the cohomology of these Shimura varieties to automorphic L-functions. This aim has largely been completed in the paper 'mod p points on Shimura varieties of abeliam type' by the PI, and a joint paper of the PI, Yihang Zhu and Sug Woo Shin which is nearing completion.  Other results of the project include a paper by the PI and Pappas on integral models for Shimura varieties of parahoric type and a joint paper with Esnault on D-modules and their monodromy.  Fifteen graduate students were involved in the project and seven of these have graduated and gone onto jobs in academia and finance.   The results of the project were disseminated at a number of conferences and workshops.        Last Modified: 07/28/2017       Submitted by: Mark Kisin]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
