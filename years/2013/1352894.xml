<AbstractNarration>Understanding how brains function to specify behavior, thoughts and memories of an organism is a major challenge of the twenty first century. Brain initiatives in the US and other countries tend to focus on the human brain, but understanding how neural circuitry and activity control behavior in non-human species may also yield important insights into brain function. Of course, exploring the neural circuitry, activity patterns responsible for behavior in many different animal species requires large amounts of work. Therefore, careful planning for these efforts is required to maximize their impact on the field. To facilitate this planning process, this workshop will convene a group of 40 experts in comparative neurobiology, brain research and allied disciplines to debate critical questions, such as whether one should functionally map entire brains or subsystems, whether to focus on closely related animal species or distant relatives, how to integrate developmental with adult data, how to identify equivalent brain components in seemingly very different brains across species, and how to integrate information about brain structure with data on brain function and behavior. Workshop participants will discuss these questions in small groups and then report their answers to the entire group, which will synthesize those answers into a coherent research agenda with short- and long-term goals. An important outcome of this workshop will be a written report or published journal article that will offer guidance to both researchers and funding agencies. To maximize the workshop's impact, video recordings of key sessions will be disseminated through a publicly accessible web site, which will also host the report and some related documents.  One quarter of all workshop participants will be postdoctoral researchers. They are expected to make important contributions and, simultaneously, gain valuable experience. A strong effort will be made to include women and members of underrepresented groups to broaden participation in this important area of neuroscience.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[As a direct result of this award, a group of 31 experts (mainly from the US but also including one Canadian, two Germans, and two Japanese) gathered at the Janelia Farms campus of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute for a 2&shy;-day workshop to discuss how "brain mapping" initiatives may best be extended to non-human species.  Nine representatives from NSF and other federal agencies (NIH, WH Office of Science and Technology Policy) also attended. Before the workshop, participants submitted brief statements of their pre&shy;-workshop ideas about brain&shy; mapping, which were then circulated to all participants. The workshop itself opened with brief opening remarks and keynote address, followed by long break&shy;-out sessions in which participants focused on specific questions.   The group recommended that groups of researchers 1) identify "reference species" that may serve as anchors for comparative brain mapping research, 2) develop standards for data collection, annotation, archiving and distribution, and 3) create training opportunities for young evolutionary biologists and comparative neuroscientists. After the workshop, the PI drafted a report of the workshop, which was then revised with feedback from the participants and, ultimately, published by the group in the two most important journals for comparative neurobiology ("Brain, Behavior and Evolution" and "The Journal of Comparative Neurobiology"). A science writer who attended the workshop took the lead in preparing a "White Paper" on the group's activities and recommendations, which was then revised in light of feedback from the PI and other participants. This white paper (available at http://understandingthebrain.org) was printed as a glossy brochure and distributed within the NSF to highlight the group's recommendations.  The workshop laid the foundation for subsequent discussion both within the NSF and among comparative neurobiologists, but is too early to judge the workshopÃ†s long-term impact.
