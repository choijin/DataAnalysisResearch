<AbstractNarration>Despite our firm understanding of large-scale and long-period waves in the ocean from theoretical and numerical studies, many paradigms of planetary propagation have not yet been tested in the real ocean for lack of suitable data that resolve the long temporal and large spatial scales involved. The simplifying assumptions necessary for theoretical and numerical treatment (e.g. vertical side-walls, idealized stratification, and constrained temporal responses) all reduce the range of allowable motion and so are incomplete descriptions of the real ocean. However, nearly the entire wave spectrum across a subtropical gyre can now be examined using extensive and prolonged measurements from the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) moored array located at 26Â°N (the MOCHA/WBTS/RAPID project). Seven years of AMOC array data extend the previous satellite observational basis below the surface and over long periods and allows testing of hypotheses about wave signals and pathways in a subtropical basin. Through the analysis of subsurface observations, this study will investigate wave energies and wave patterns over a broad frequency range. Particular attention will be given to planetary waves (Kelvin and Rossby) and internal waves (tidal and inertial), resolving waves with periods ranging from 2 hours to 2 years using reprocessed high-frequency full-depth measurements of dynamic height and bottom pressure at 8 moorings across the basin and horizontal velocity at the 4 western moorings. With diagnosis of potential energy (dynamic height) and kinetic energy (velocity), the energy equation can be partially diagnosed as a function of frequency at the western boundary. Inferences about energy transfer between frequencies and between moorings can be made by examining spectral slopes in depth- and mode-space. Decomposition of pressure and velocity into mode-space allows the calculation of energy flux and the array's linear geometry enables a 2D estimate of energy flux divergence, lending insight into the propagation and possible dissipation of these waves. A particularly salient aspect of the energy flux decomposition is the ability to examine the low-frequency variability of wind and tidal internal waves, which is not well understood due to a lack of long term subsurface data.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Though there have been clear observations of cross-basin Rossby wave propagation in the open ocean, their fate upon reaching the western boundaries remains unclear. These fates might include local dissipation, reflection or even transformation to Kelvin waves that radiate southward along the western boundary. Due to the long time and large spatial scales, previous observational studies have not resolved these processes. Utilizing the temporal and spatial resolution of the array and applying theoretical relations (ratios of kinetic to potential energy, polarization relations and dispersion equations), will help identify the variance contained by these signals, and quantify the energy pathways for these classes of waves at the western boundary. To complement the subsurface sampling, a high frequency satellite altimetry product will be investigated in collaboration to examine horizontal scales and propagation. At any frequency the sources, pathways, and sinks of large-scale waves are largely unknown, and this study is a first step toward quantifying their roles in the western subtropical Atlantic.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This project will characterize a broad spectrum of wave motion and elucidate pathways of waves, increasing our understanding of both large-scale, low-frequency planetary waves and tidal and wind-generated internal waves. These analyses provide added benefit to the data already collected by the AMOC array.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This project supports two junior scientists in establishing their research careers. Scientific results will develop methods for investigating large-scale waves and will greatly extend the observational basis of waves that participate in meridional coherence, ocean predictability, and ocean-atmosphere feedback patterns. Educational components consist of training an undergraduate student and of disseminating results through a web-based outreach program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project analyzed 8 years of mooring data from the 26N Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation Array in terms of internal motion and energy levels, covering planetary waves, boundary waves, inertial waves, and tidal internal waves.  These observations were unusually extensive, in terms of variables measured (density and velocity), sustained duration, vertical resolution, and horizontal extent across an ocean basin.  Such extensive observations permit diagnosis of energy pathways in the ocean that have not been previously characterized, pathways that relate to the fluid dynamics that govern ocean circulation.     At low frequencies, the observations show the well-known structure of high (potential) energy in the center of the basin, caused by the accumulation of random wind-forced planetary waves that propagate westward.  Our new results indicate that energy (potential energy PE, and zonal kinetic energy KEu) decreases rapidly close to the western boundary, while the meridional kinetic energy (KEv) is uniform close to the boundary.  Although there is a larger proportion of kinetic energy at the boundary compared to total energy, neither kinetic energy nor low-frequency energy flux (Fx or Fy) increases toward the boundary.  These findings let us assess two theoretical hypotheses: that slow planetary waves either reflect off of the western boundary (frequency is conserved, but kinetic energy is increased close to the boundary), or convert into along-boundary waves (increase in frequency and in meridional kinetic energy close to the boundary).  Although these theoretical transformations may happen, their lack of dominance suggests that the real ocean does not efficiently transfer energy from planetary scale motion.  Rather, we infer that a significant proportion of the incident energy scatters in the horizontal, in the vertical, and in time domain, into smaller scales that are not resolved by the moored array.     At inertial and tidal frequencies, the multiyear record shows local generation of internal wave and with limited propagation across the basin.  Overall, internal tide generation is weak at 26N. The magnitude of the semidiurnal internal tide follows the amplitude of the surface tide: mode-1 kinetic and potential energies are largest on the Eastern Boundary and smallest on the Western Boundary. Internal tides on the Eastern boundary have a distinct spring-neap cycle suggesting local generation. On the Western Boundary, the lack of a spring-neap cycle and persistent onshore fluxes suggest the semidiurnal internal wave field is dominated by shoaling of remotely and episodically generated waves. Near-inertial mode-1 kinetic and potential energies have a seasonal cycle that is tied to the winter storm season, consistent with previous studies, and episodic peaks in summer and fall that are linked to hurricanes.  The western boundary acts as a sink for mode 1 near-inertial energy.  When Hurricane Katia passed over the western boundary in 2011, the response reached to 5000 m and the total water column energy increased by an order of magnitude.     For broader impacts, this was the first grant received by the 2 PIs and it enabled them to develop their scientific interests and gain experience in project management, in mentoring of students, and in disseminating results to and engaging with the research community.  We mentored a BIPOC undergraduate student for one summer and one academic year of research, and served as a reference for her graduate school application.  In the scientific community, we presented 12 times at conferences, workshops, or seminars, and so far published 3 scientific papers.  In addition, K. Martini reached a national audience with her contributions to the website Deep Sea News (http://www.deepseanews.com), a website that presents science for the general public through an editorial style of 'reverent irreverance.' Her 82 posts were shared ten-thousands of times, the website attracted yearly traffic of 1.5 million visitors, and she was quoted by national news media.
