<AbstractNarration>The Langlands program endeavors to link Galois representations to automorphic forms. Central to the Langlands program is the study of arithmetic moduli, which is to say parameter spaces for geometric objects defined over a local or global field. Arithmetic moduli include modular curves and Shimura varieties in the global setting, and the Lubin-Tate tower and spaces of Rapoport-Zink in the local setting. Such geometric objects are always structured in towers, such as the tower of modular curves of level a power of p. Taken as a whole, a tower of arithmetic moduli admits an action of a reductive group, and studying this action on the cohomology of the tower is the only way we know how to attach a Galois representation to an automorphic form. This project concerns arithmetic moduli at infinite level, e.g. the inverse limit along a tower of modular curves. A recent discovery of the PI is that, in the case of the Lubin-Tate tower, such limits exist as objects in Peter Scholze's new category of perfectoid spaces. There are many ways in which the inverse limit object is actually simpler than the constituent layers of the tower. The PI intends to generalize these discoveries to general arithmetic moduli. These results will be leveraged into new insights in the Langlands program. In particular this proposal represents the most promising hope yet for a proof of the local Langlands correspondence for GL(n) which is purely local in nature (i.e., which does not involve automorphic representations).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal includes a plan for the research-level participation of graduate and undergraduate students at Boston University, with appropriate projects for each. The PI intends to continue his involvement in programs which disseminate mathematics throughout a broad community. These programs include the PROMYS program, a number theory summer program for high school students located in Boston University, and the Arizona Winter School, an intensive mini-course for graduate students which takes place in Tucson. The PI also intends to present research at conferences, including the joint meetings of the AMS-MAA.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ I conceived of this project, titled "Arithmetic Moduli at Infinite Level", in 2012 as a new Assistant Professor at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Boston University.  At that time, a recent PhD named Peter Scholze had recently invented a class of fractal-like structures called perfectoid spaces, in order to solve a difficult problem in number theory known as the weight-monodromy conjecture.  I was very curious to see whether some examples of perfectoid spaces might have been hiding in plain sight, among geometric objects (the arithmetic moduli, called Shimuravarieties) that number theorists had been studying for many years.  I say "hiding" here, because in order to see the perfectoid structure of these  objects, you have to crank the "level" up to infinity, and in the pre-Scholzeanera, it didn't quite make sense to do that.  Looking forward, I wanted to draw a line between Scholze's theory and the so-called Langlands program, the sprawling decades-long project which is a sort of "grand unified theory" within number theory.  Shimura varieties are a powerful weapon in that program, so I wanted to know if we could use the infinite-level point of view to our advantage.    Between then and now, perfectoid spaces have found far-ranging applications, ranging from hyperbolic 3-manifolds to algebraic topology;  Scholze has been awarded a Fields Medal in honor of these achievements.  Within the Langlands program, our understanding of infinite-level Shimuravarieties has bounded forward by light-years.  I will highlight some of the main outcomes of this project:  - A paper with Scholze, "Moduli of p-divisible groups", which studies a class of these arithmetic moduli, and proves that they become perfectoid spaces at infinite level,  - A paper, "Semistable models for modular curves at arbitrary level", which answered an old question and completed work by the late Robert Coleman,  -An expository paper, "Reciprocity laws and Galois representations", which explains the Langlands program to a general mathematical audience.  - A paper, "The Kottwitz Conjecture for local Shimura varieties", with Tasho Kaletha and David Hansen, which proves a big chunk of a conjecture which fits beautifully into the local Langlands program,   - A book in progress, "Lectures on p-adic geometry", with Scholze, on the fundamentals of the subject,  - Two lecture series at the Arizona Winter School, in 2013 and 2017, where the topic was modular curves at infinite level and perfectoid spaces, respectively.  This meeting draws hundreds of graduate students.  - Support for graduate students at BU for summer research and travels to conferences.  Throughout, it has been my intent to inform as broad an audience as possible about what is going on in this subject.  Perfectoid spaces are quite technical, but I am firm in my conviction that sufficiently good communication can be effective for any willing audience, not just the experts.  With this philosophy in mind, I have addressed general mathematical audiences at Joint Meetings of the AMS/MAA (as part of its Current Events Bulletin), the Canadian Number Theory Association, the Journ&eacute;es Arithm&eacute;tiques, and at dozens of colloquia and seminars.
