<AbstractNarration>This program will study the mechanics and implications of black hole accretion in passively evolving spiral galaxies using a unique sample of disk galaxies hosting water megamasers in their nuclei.  Feeding of the black hole will be assessed by measuring the kinematics of the masers from scales of tens of parsecs down to tenths of parsecs.  Dr. Greene will compare the stellar and gaseous kinematics on 20 parsec scales from adaptive-optics plus integral-field spectroscopy, to the orientation of the megamaser disk on sub-parsec scales, to learn how the gas accretes onto the disk.  She will determine whether secular (long-term) evolution leads to tight correlations between black hole mass and galaxy properties, including bulge kinematics, galaxy mass, and dark halo mass.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students, outreach via public lectures, and teaching math to inmates through the Prison Teaching Initiative.</AbstractNarration>

Astronomers have come to realize that accretion onto supermassive black holes can pump significant energy back into the interstellar medium of the surrounging galaxy, thus significantly impacting galaxy evolution.   This grant has made significant progress in understanding the growth and fueling mechanisms of black hole growth, primarily by focusing on the demographics of the special subset of galaxies with megamaser disks. We have shown that low-mass galaxies have a very wide range of black hole mass at fixed galaxy property, at odds with results for more massive galaxies.

Broader Impacts  The role of black hole growth in galaxy evolution has broad implications for our understanding of galaxy evolution. Likewise, understanding fueling of black holes feeds directly into our understanding of accretion more generally. Under this grant, PI Greene has given a number of public talks and taught Princeton students about black holes and galaxy evolution. She has also played a growing leadership role in the Prison Teaching Initiative, which brings college-accredited math and science courses to students in four state prisons in NJ.
