<AbstractNarration>Twice annually, regional meetings on mathematical string theory are held in central North Carolina at Duke University. These meetings inexpensively fill a critical need, by regularly bringing together isolated research groups to collaborate and hear research talks, and also by training students and postdocs both by exposing them to a wide array of ideas as well as giving them a forum in which to themselves give talks, thereby substantially aiding both training and research efforts.  The location of these meetings allows for substantial impact, as Duke is one of three major universities within a forty-minute drive of one another, all of which have researchers working in related areas, and is centrally located with regards to a number of other universities and related researchers within driving distance.  Duke's existing facilities will be used to record lectures and post them on the web, allowing for even greater impact. Efforts are being made to involve more underrepresented minorities and genders, both as participants and as speakers.  Partial funding for these meetings in the form of participant support is awarded for the next three years.  In addition, funds may be used to provide travel support for speakers traveling from outside the region.  The support will enhance the quality of these meetings and their contribution to regional collaborations. It will especially contribute to the training of students and postdocs in the region who will be more readily able to attend. The availability of travel support for outside speakers will make it possible to attract outside visitors, including members of under-represented minorities.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant provides support for a set of regular regional meetings on mathematical string theory, an attempt to unify general relativity and quantum field theory, the two primary developments of twentieth-century physics.  There are several groups in the NC and VA area working on related topics in mathematical string theory, including groups at Duke University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC State University, Virginia Tech, James Madison University, and Virginia Commonwealth University, among others.  This grant has provided support for junior people to attend and speak at each of six regional meetings bringing these groups together, two meetings a year for the last three years.  These meetings inexpensively fill a critical need.  Some of the area universities are separated by several hours' driving time, and historically none have had the funding to hold regular technical seminars.  By bringing area researchers together for a day or two of technical seminars, not only does this enhance research efforts by helping everyone keep up with current developments in the field, but in addition it also provides a mechanism for area researchers to spend a day talking together, which can spark and further technical collaborations.  These meetings also provide opportunities for training for graduate students and postdocs, in several ways.  First, it gives the students and postdocs the opportunity to hear more research talks than they might otherwise, as none of the research groups at the separate universities individually have the funding for regular external speakers.  Second, it provides an opportunity for those same students and postdocs to give talks themselves, in a less stressful environment than they might encounter when giving research talks outside of the NC/VA area.
