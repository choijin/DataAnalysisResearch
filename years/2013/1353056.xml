<AbstractNarration>Jill Preston&lt;br/&gt;IOS-1353056&lt;br/&gt;Evolutionary Genetics of Vernalization Responsiveness in the Temperate Grass Subfamily Pooideae&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Most plant species integrate multiple environmental cues, such as day length and past winter chilling, to ready them to flower when local conditions are favorable. Not only does flowering time affect plant fitness, but also the yield of grains, fruits, and seeds available for human consumption. But how do plants in different climates know to vary their flowering times, and what happens as these local climates change over time? To address these questions, this project focuses on a geographically and ecologically diverse group of cereal crop and forage grasses with the aim of determining how flowering time has evolved at both the whole plant and genetic level under global cooling over the past 50 million years. By shedding light on the past, results of this study promise to allow better prediction of flowering time responses to current global change, and to isolate novel genes and genetic pathways for the potential manipulation of flowering time in crop grasses.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The "pooid" grasses evolved from a tropical ancestor around 48 million years ago and have subsequently colonized a wide range of habitats in both the northern and southern temperate zones as global temperatures decreased. One of the major barriers to living in the temperate region is freezing temperatures, which are particularly detrimental to reproductive structures. The crop pooids barley, wheat, and oats are able to avoid flowering in winter by rapidly becoming competent to flower after an extended period of cold tempreatures (vernalization). However, it is unknown whether the evolution of the vernalization response was key to the diversification of all temperate pooids, or if it evolved more recently in separate grasses. To determine the evolutionary origin(s) and genetic basis of the vernalization response, the PI will work with students, a postdoctoral researcher, and computer scientists in the Vermont Genetics Network to carry out flowering time experiments on 40 species of pooid grasses collected from different latitudes across the world. The flowering time response of each species to cold temperatures will be mapped onto an evolutionary tree and models will be used to estimate when and how many times flowering in response to cold evolved. As a complement to this, genomic data will be collected to pinpoint similarities and differences in vernalization responsive gene expression between species. By determining different levels of plant responses to chilling, data from this project will facilitate critical insights into the complex adaptations of plants to their environments. Furthermore, activities and outcomes of this study will be used to foster interdisciplinary and active learning activities for high school to graduate students, paving the way for the next generation of successful organismal and evolutionary biologists.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The timing of flowering has major consequences for plant fitness and crop yield, particularly in environments that experience seasonal extremes. In the primarily temperate grass subfamily Pooideae a key adaptation to temperature seasonality in several cereal species (e.g. wheat and barley) is the requirement of above-freezing cold (vernalization) for flowering. Vernalization responsive flowering ensures that plants do not flower prematurely during unusually warm winter days, and readies individuals to set flower quickly in short growing seasons of the spring or summer. The aims of this NSF-funded project were to determine whether vernalization responsive flowering is widespread in the 1200+ species of Pooideae, reconstruct how many times it evolved, assess how conserved the genetic pathway underlying this trait is, and discover novel genes underlying it. Results from this project demonstrated that vernalization responsiveness taxa are found in most of the Pooideae tribes, and ancestral trait reconstruction inferred a single origin of this flowering response at or near the base of the subfamily. Gene expression analyses supported a role for the gene <em>VERNALIZATION 1 </em>(<em>VRN1</em>) in the origin of Pooideae vernalization responsiveness, but the lack of cold responsiveness for other genes in the wheat/barley vernalization response pathway across Pooideae suggest that elements of this pathway have been tinkered with over evolutionary time. Comparison of global gene expression data across a representative sample of vernalization responsive Pooideae showed that cold responses, both in terms of flowering and winter hardiness, evolved gradually, first through the utilization of ancient stress tolerance genes; then through the deployment of grass-, Pooideae-, and finally tribe-specific stress tolerance genes. Two genes that were cold-responsive specifically across Pooideae were the 14-3-3 protein gene <em>GF14h</em> and <em>histone deacetylase 19</em>. CRISPR/Cas9-editing of the former led to delayed flowering after drought stress, suggesting its function in both the flowering pathway and as a general stress responder. Together, these data (1) suggest an early origin of vernalization responsiveness in Pooideae that preceded the global cooling event causing expansion of the Earth&rsquo;s contemporary temperate regions, (2) identified a novel gene potentially important in the origin of this and other flowering time responses that can be the target of agronomic improvement, and (3) support lineage-specific modifications to the pathway as clades moved into novel temperate niches. The award resulted in several peer-reviewed publications and genomic resources that can be used by the botanical community, was the basis of several lectures given to early-career biology students, and provided research training to two postdoctoral students, three graduate students, and several undergraduate researchers from a diversity of backgrounds.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/15/2019<br>      Modified by: Jill&nbsp;C&nbsp;Preston</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
