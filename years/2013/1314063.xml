<AbstractNarration>In this Award from the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability Fellows (SEES Fellows Program) Dr. Adam Pelzer from Northwestern University will investigate the feasibility of using lignin from cellulosic biomass as a drop-in biofuel.  The work will range from quantum chemical analysis of pretreatment methods to life cycle assessment of feedstocks.  This award has support from the Chemistry Division of the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The aim of studies like that proposed in this work is to develop methods to turn a chemically recalcitrant, but energy-rich, component of biomass, lignin, into a source of liquid fuel. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Pelzer will be working with collaborators Prof. Linda Broadbelt of the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering at Northwestern University and Dr. Randy Cortright, founder and Chief Technology Officer at Virent. Dr. Pelzer will also work with faculty at Northwestern University and faculty and students in the Chicago Community College system on a series of educational activities centered on sustainability issues.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported under the NSF Science, Engineering and Education for Sustainability Fellows (SEES Fellows) program, with the goal of helping to enable discoveries needed to inform actions that lead to environmental, energy and societal sustainability while creating the necessary workforce to address these challenges. With SEES Fellows support, this project will enable a promising early career researcher to establish themselves in an independent research career related to sustainability.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>A large proportion of the carbon-based fuels we use today (coal, petroleum and natural gas) are the result of chemical processes that required millions of years and immense temperatures and pressures. These fuels, while convenient to use and relatively cheap to develop, have significant long-term problems. Burning these fuels leads to the release of carbon in quantities that are much greater than can be absorbed by modern plants, leaving it to enter the atmosphere to act as a greenhouse gas.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A more sustainable alternative would be to produce hydrocarbon fuels of similar quality using only modern plant matter as a feedstock. This would allow our fuel consumption to fit within the natural &ldquo;carbon cycle&rdquo;, as the carbon emitted by burning these fuels could be absorbed by plants, which would in turn be used to make more fuel. In order for this process to work, however, a way must be found to quickly and cheaply reproduce the effects that led to the production of natural hydrocarbon compounds. The standard way to decrease the timescale and energy required for a chemical reaction is to find a catalyst that will yield the appropriate products from the given reactants. Chemists and chemical engineers have been attempting to do just this for biofuel production for many decades, and my work is an extension of this quest.</p> <p>Plant matter is composed of three types of structures: hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin (Figure 1). The first two are well ordered polymers of sugar molecules and the processes for converting these sugars into alcohols (which can be used as fuels) have existed for thousands of years. Lignin, however, is considerably more difficult to work with. It is a random polymer made up of three different molecules that are connected in many different ways (Figure 2). Currently, the lignin is simply separated from the cellulose and hemicellulose and burned in a biorefinery to produce heat and electricity while the cellulose and hemicellulose are used to produce fuels. This is incredibly wasteful, as lignin contains up to 40% of the available energy stored in plant matter and is a potentially &ldquo;green&rdquo; source of a number of valuable organic chemicals. If lignin could be used to produce fuels or chemicals, it would greatly increase the ability of biorefineries to compete with petroleum refineries.</p> <p>My work on this project has focused on understanding the exact chemistry of lignin breakdown so that its constituent parts can be turned into fuels and chemicals rather than burned. I have applied techniques of quantum mechanics and computer programming to create a mathematical model of how lignin breaks down. There are a range of possible chemical &ldquo;reaction mechanisms&rdquo; for this process, and my model allows us to determine which one best represents the actual mechanism. With this knowledge in hand, we can then attempt to maximize the formation of useful products from lignin, either by breaking it down in specific conditions (temperature, pH, pressure etc.) or by introducing another chemical into the reaction.</p> <p>My calculations have used quantum mechanics to determine the amount of energy required for given bonds to form or break, which allows us to make predictions about the rate at which reactions will take place. We can then compare these theoretical predictions to what is seen in experiments, and the theoretical model that most closely agrees with the experiments is deemed most likely to be how the reaction actually occurs (Figure 3). I have performed these analyses on two different types of linkages in lignin and found reaction mechanisms that closely match the experimental results. Once the rest of the relevant lignin linkages have been investigated, the results can be added to ours and a single comprehensive model can be constructed that will allow researchers to devise the optimal conditions for processing lignin into useable fuels or chemicals.</p> <p>In addition to my research into biomass processing chemistry, this grant also allowed me to learn the techniques of Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA). LCA studies take all aspects of a product&rsquo;s production, use and disposal into account when calculating important metrics such as energy consumed, water used, pollution produced etc. The use of these techniques has often been used to expose mistaken assumptions regarding the sustainability of a product and allowed for more thoughtful procedures and effective outcomes. I&rsquo;m very happy to have learned these skills and hope that they become more widely taught to students of environmental and industrial engineering.</p> <p>Finally, this grant supported an outreach project that provided summer research positions in areas related to sustainability to undergraduate students in the Chicago Community College system. I found the process of speaking to interested students, choosing the best matches, and working with them over the summer to be very rewarding and the successes that the graduates have achieved in their current research careers has been extremely gratifying.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/13/2017<br>      Modified by: Adam&nbsp;W&nbsp;Pelzer</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1314063/1314063_10272188_1513113651098_plant_matter--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1314063/1314063_10272188_1513113651098_plant_matter--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1314063/1314063_10272188_1513113651098_plant_matter--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Composition of plant matter</div> <div class="imageCredit">Adam Pelzer</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Adam&nbsp;W&nbsp;Pelzer</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1314063/1314063_10272188_1513113716965_linkages--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1314063/1314063_10272188_1513113716965_linkages--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1314063/1314063_10272188_1513113716965_linkages--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Linkage types between lignin monomers</div> <div class="imageCredit">Adam Pelzer</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Adam&nbsp;W&nbsp;Pelzer</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 2</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1314063/1314063_10272188_1513113785944_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1314063/1314063_10272188_1513113785944_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 3"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1314063/1314063_10272188_1513113785944_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 3"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A) Calculated anti-bonding orbital for lignin model compound.
