<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Elizabeth M. Nolan from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study the zinc-binding properties of several human metal-chelating proteins that are implicated in physiological processes that include inflammation, the innate immune response, cardiovascular disease, and carcinogenesis. Protein biochemistry, analytical biochemistry including thermodynamic measurements, and various spectroscopic techniques are employed to characterize the zinc binding sites and measure the affinity for zinc of these proteins. In education and outreach, a biochemistry partnership between the Nolan Laboratory and the Department of Chemistry at Framingham State University is established with the long-term goals of (i) improving undergraduate biochemistry research and mentoring at Framingham State University (FSU) and (ii) increasing the numbers of FSU biochemistry concentrators continuing on to graduate school in the chemical/biochemical sciences. To integrate research and education, FSU faculty and students learn protein purification techniques and conduct biochemistry research in the Nolan Laboratory, and develop a protein purification laboratory manual. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Zinc is a metal ion that is essential for many processes of life. The basic research developed with this award provides molecular-level insight into a family of human zinc-binding proteins and into the contributions of these proteins to zinc homeostasis in humans. The research and outreach activities provide training in the scientific method, research, and communication of science to a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students from MIT and elsewhere. MIT graduate students mentor undergraduates from FSU, which is an important component of graduate education and training. These activities serve the local community by enhancing biochemistry at a regional university and motivating FSU students to continue studies and pursue careers in the chemical sciences.</AbstractNarration>
