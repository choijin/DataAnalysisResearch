<AbstractNarration>PARTICIPATING ORGANIZATIONS: &lt;br/&gt;American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE)&lt;br/&gt;National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance (NCIIA)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PROJECT DESCRIPTION &lt;br/&gt;The American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) is hosting and providing logistical support for the delivery of the activities related to a TUES Central Resource Project Workshop. This project, "I-Corps for Learning (I-Corps-L): A Pilot Initiative to Propagate &amp; Scale Educational Innovations", includes: an introductory 3-day training session, five online sessions, and a closing 2-day training session. In concert with the proposed workshop, ASEE is identifying and securing suitable meeting space for the 40-50 expected meeting participants (ten teams of 3-4 persons, the 5-person teaching team, and up to 3 I-Corps-L consultants).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This pilot initiative is employing an agile, action-based curriculum to improve the teaching and success rates of students in key engineering and computer science courses. The project is helping to accelerate the process of bringing effective educational innovations to scale. Particular emphasis is placed on "gateway" courses that are typically taught in the first two years of STEM degree programs and form core pre-requisites to subsequent coursework. These gateway courses are typically taught as a foundation for STEM degree programs and include: calculus, physics, and introductory engineering and computer science offerings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ASEE team members are collaborating with the Instructional Team (led by Dr. Karl Smith) to provide textbooks to the workshop participants and develop the resources that are needed for the face-to-face workshops. The goal of the workshop is to leverage I-Corps expertise of traversing the chasm between research/development and commercial implementation of new products. Corollary to the I-Corps initiative, this project is designed to fill the gap between educational innovations of proven effectiveness in enhancing student learning and widespread use of such practices. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the potential for achieving the elusive goal of educational transformation through propagation and scale of educational innovations. Workshop participants leave the program with an expanded set of skills and knowledge that provide them with the tools necessary to evaluate and translate their research into applications that can benefit society. This effort has a strong potential for having a transformative impact on STEM education.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;BROADER SIGNIFICANCE &lt;br/&gt;The principal objective of the project is to foster an entrepreneurial mindset within the education community, so the community has the potential to impact the way education innovations are designed and implemented. The project is encouraging other educational enthusiasts to leverage the outcomes of this pilot to create a broad scale impact. The results of the project can be implemented at many institutions, having the potential to significantly improve the retention and graduation of STEM students nationwide.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ASEE is conducting an evaluation to assess individual sessions within the face-to-face meetings (e.g., topic appropriateness, quality of topic coverage, knowledge of presenters, engagement level), overall elements of the workshop (e.g., workshop design, planning and execution), and handling of meeting logistics (e.g., travel, hotel accommodations, meeting rooms, meals). In addition, the participants are answering formative questions throughout the effort to provide adequate time for informal interactions, ensure success in meeting workshop objectives, and properly accommodate all aspects associated with the virtual sessions. Ultimately, this pilot project is developing a model for conducting training workshops that result in widespread use of educational innovations that improve STEM learning.</AbstractNarration>

Nine teams of 3-4 people participated in this eight-week pilot project that immersed them in experimentation, customer discovery, and iterative design. Participants indicated that the initial "customer discovery" portion of the project, where they interviewed at least 100 potential customers about their product, was quite instructive. Each team included the project  Principal Investigator (PI), an Entrepreneurial Lead (EL) and a Mentor.        In I-Corps&trade; L participating teams go through a hypothesis-testing, scientific method of discovery to gather important insights and identify issues associated with their projects. Teams are forced "out of the classroom" to conduct interviews, study customer needs, collect feedback, and find partnership opportunities. In most instances participants leave the program with an expanded skill-set and tools to evaluate and translate their research into applicable methods for educational transformation.     Teams were forced to rethink their product, sometimes abandoning it altogether to create a new one in alignment with customer feedback.   "There is a gap between the type of thinking you bring to a project in order to commercialize it that you donÆt bring to it if youÆre a researcher," a participant noted. Responses to a post-project survey showed  participants ranking this as the most valuable part of the course, some even applying it to their teaching and other projects while the I-Corps&trade; L cohort was ongoing.     Participants also became familiar with the business model canvas (BMC), a tool for developing new business models. One of the core instructors of the program noted, "they acquired a new language and they talk about things like the value proposition, product-market fit, and alignment &ndash; the pieces that enable one to be successful."  Nearly nine out of ten participants felt the BMC had significant potential for designing learning innovations; about half of the participants indicated they found a viable commercial path for their innovation/product.  One of the key recommendations from the external evaluation was that, if NSF has a goal is to promote scalability and sustainability of funded projects, that expectation&mdash;as well as supports and incentives for integrating those values&mdash;must be built into the grant solicitation and review process.      One participant noted, "the opportunities to learn the Business Model Canvas, interact with the instructional team members, and discover our start up scenario have been incredibly worthwhile. All faculty who engage in research/funded activities should know about this." Overall, participants reported a very good experience.
