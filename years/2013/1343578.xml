<AbstractNarration>This research will explain and predict of the distribution of animal and plant species in the endangered yet megadiverse Brazilian Atlantic forest. The investigators will correlate biogeographic and environmental patterns across major clades in order to understand patterns in this biodiversity hotspot. The project will entail study of both climate and landscape, and their changes over the last 120,000 years. This information will enable understanding of how species have responded to repeated environmental shifts of the past. Data from Earth-orbiting satellites will be combined with meteorological data and paleoenvironmental information from the fossil pollen record and ancient precipitation data derived from the geochemistry of deposits found in caves. These data, combined with information on modern species ranges, genetic diversity, physiological tolerances, host-pathogen dynamics, and regional shifts in the composition of the biota will demonstrate how the biodiversity of the Atlantic forest evolved over time.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This study will enable the reconstruction of historical factors influencing current biodiversity and, given a range of climate change scenarios, permit the prediction of the future composition of biodiversity in the Atlantic forest or elsewhere. Forest areas of geological stability, physical connectivity, and higher genetic diversity will be identified so that forests or species under extinction threat can be conserved. In response to current concern about the value of ecosystem services and climate change, this study provides a model of how to predict biodiversity change. A travelling exhibit will reach out to commuters in SÃ£o Paulo and New York. Collaborations among research groups in Brazil and the US is central to the project?s student training plan. The project also strengthens a minority-serving campus, ensuring that North-American students underrepresented in science are exposed to trans-disciplinary, international work.</AbstractNarration>

Through the study of the local climate and landscape, and their changes over the last 120,000 years, the team was able to understand of how species have responded to repeated environmental shifts of the past. For that, data from Earth-orbiting satellites were combined with meteorological data and paleo-environmental information from the fossil pollen record, as well as ancient precipitation data derived from the geochemistry of deposits found in caves. These data, combined with information on modern species ranges, genetic diversity, physiological tolerances, host-pathogen dynamics, and regional changes in the composition of the biota, helped us demonstrate how the biodiversity of the Atlantic forest changed over time. For that, this multi-disciplinary group focused in the development of new analytical tools, models, data flows and statistics to 1) characterize former climates, 2) integrate remote-sensing data with on-the-ground biological observations, 3) compare suitable climatic conditions across species, 4) optimize the collection and analysis of genomic-scale data from local species, and 5) test hypotheses about biological responses to climate change. Because it enabled the reconstruction of historical and contemporary factors that influence current biodiversity, the team was able to predict changes in the future composition of biodiversity in the Atlantic forest - including changes in their genetic diversity - given a range of future climate change scenarios. Forest areas of geological stability, physical connectivity, and higher genetic diversity were identified, allowing the team to contribute to policymakers by discussing the conservation of the forest and its species under extinction threat. In response to the current concern about the value of ecosystem services and climate change, this study provided a model of how to predict biodiversity change.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>By December of 2020, the project had resulted in 207 scientific publications. Outcomes have been showcased in dozens of science communication articles in the mainstream media of Brazil and the US. Collectively, the team provided more than 200 scientific presentations at regional, national, and international meetings. Project findings, especially the new analytical tools developed by the team, were also shared with the scientific community through dedicated workshops led by project postdocs and Ph.D. students, in Brazil, the U.S., and Europe. Aiming to reach out to the broader public and K-12 students, the faculty and students developed podcasts and videos explaining various aspects and findings of the study, in English, Portuguese, and Spanish. A public exhibit hosted by the New York Botanical Garden shared pictures and project findings. By participating in meetings and official reports by the International Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, the Brazilian Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, The International Union for Conservation of Nature, The World Biodiversity Forum, as well as discussions about wildlife management and the process of endangered species listing in Brazil, the principal investigators directly shared project outcomes with policy makers.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The project counted with 113 team members - including faculty, postdoctoral scholars, graduate students and undergraduates. A total of 12 academic institutions were involved in the United States, Brazil, the United Kingdom, France, and Australia. These international collaborations were central to the project's scientific and training goals. In New York the study involved and supported the work of 22 graduate students (12 Msc, 10 Ph.D., 11 female students, 5 of minority status, 7 international), 7 postdocs, and 8 undergraduates (7 minority) based at the City College of CUNY. To date, it has resulted in 7 MSc theses and 4 Ph.D. dissertations. &nbsp;In Brazil, the study involved 29 graduate students, 15 postdocs, and 4 undergraduates from the State of Sao Paulo. Twenty students from New York and the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo participated in exchange training programs supported by the project, visiting and working with a host laboratory abroad: 10 CUNY students traveled to Brazil for joint field work, experimental data collection, and laboratory stays at Universidade de Sao Paulo and Universidade Estadual Paulista (1 undergraduate, 2 MSc, 6 Ph.Ds, 1 postdoc), while 10 Brazilian students traveled to City College and The New York Botanical Garden for 3- to 12-month stays devoted to joint data analysis and writing (6 PhD students, 4 postdocs). Beyond advancing biodiversity science and predictive modeling under climate change, this project strengthened a minority-serving campus in the United States, exposing underrepresented and underprivileged North-American students to trans-disciplinary, international work.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/23/2020<br>      Modified by: Ana&nbsp;C&nbsp;Carnaval</p>
