<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;Physical contacts between chromosomes, known as interchromosomal interactions, are observed in interphase nuclei of diverse species. In some cases, these interactions allow regulatory elements to act in trans, modulating the expression of genes encoded on a separate chromosome held in close proximity. The advent of high-throughput genome-wide analyses of chromosomal conformations has vastly accelerated the rate at which interchromosomal interactions can be cataloged; however, the functional characterization of their genetic consequences has lagged behind. This CAREER project helps to fill the "function gap" by developing a comprehensive understanding of how a gene expression enhancer will behave when it encounters potential gene regulatory promoters on separate but nearby chromosomes. The experiments center on the creation of transgenic Drosophila carrying various fluorescent reporters that act as readouts for the impacts of interchromosomal interactions on gene expression. These experiments will provide a better understanding of the parameters governing enhancer action in trans, providing information on how the spatial organization of the nucleus impacts enhancer-promoter specificity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;The education plan of this project is focused on expanding research opportunities and hands-on experience in genetics and molecular biology for undergraduate students. Specifically, the project will 1) develop a research-based lab module for an undergraduate genetics course, 2) offer an annual workshop for undergraduate students from a local community college, 3) partner with an existing program that introduces research opportunities to students from underrepresented groups, and 4) provide opportunities for independent research for undergraduates from diverse backgrounds.</AbstractNarration>
