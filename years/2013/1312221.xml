<AbstractNarration>This program will perform a detailed spectroscopic study of the 19th century Great Eruption of the famous eruptive massive star Eta Carinae, by targeting light echoes discovered 160 years after the outburst occurred. Eta Carinae is the prototype for a class of non-terminal eruptions that dominate mass loss in massive stars and have been linked to violent pre-supernova ejections that yield the most luminous supernovae in the universe. Our empirical information about its eruption has been limited to historical accounts of its visual brightness, since the astronomical spectrograph had not yet been invented when the eruption occurred. However, our recent discovery of light echoes from Eta Carinae provides a unique opportunity to get a second look with modern instruments, because light from the 19th century eruption bounced off nearby dust clouds in the surrounding star-forming region, reaching us now. By observing the multiple light echoes we have discovered, we will produce a detailed spectral time-sequence of the 20-yr long 19th century eruption of Eta Carinae, including brief brightening events, quiescent times before and between peaks, and long-duration bright phases. &lt;br/&gt;Understanding the 3D effects in Eta Carinae will help us model extragalactic events where we lack any spatially resolved information about geometry. We will directly test and refine theories for the eruption that involve non-terminal explosions and dense continuum-driven winds above the Eddington limit. This study is also quite timely: It will inform a rapidly-growing interest in eruptive transient sources fueled by current transient surveys and anticipation of LSST, it will provide important clues to the eruptions from very massive stars that precede the most luminous supernovae known (in advance of JWST's efforts to detect them at high redshift), and it will provide direct tests of some very recently proposed models for the eruption of Eta Carinae itself.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are several aspects to the broad scientific impact of this program. It will provide unique and timely information about a famous massive star and its historical event that is a benchmark for understanding transient phenomena in the universe, eruptions and explosions associated with non-terminal transient events, and their role in the lives and deaths of stars. Aided by professional graphics and animations generated with the help of the STScI public outreach department, we will also produce a series of YouTube videos of team members explaining key aspects of the project for a non-specialist audience. Concerning traditionally underrepresented groups in astronomy, through participation in the NSF-funded CAMPARE exchange program between Arizona and Cal-Poly Pomona, we will recruit minority undergraduates to be directly engaged in the research, and the Arizona graduate student intended to be funded by this grant is female.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  Eta Carinae is the most massive and most luminous star known in theMilky Way galaxy.  It suffered a tremendous eruption seen byEarth-based observers in the 1840s-1850s, which ejected more than 10times the mass of our Sun in a single burst.  Remarkably, the starsurvived this violent event, and it serves as a primary example ofunstable late stages of life of massive stars before they die as asupernova.  Although such eruptions may be a critical piece of theevolution of massive stars, the underlying physical cause of theseeruptions is not known. This historical event was witnessed after theinvention of the telescope, but before the invention of theastronomical spectrograph.  Since detailed analysis of spectroscopy isone of the most important tools for astronomers to decipher thephysics of stars, the absence of any spectra for this eruptive eventhas limited our ability to understand the physical parameters or tocompare it to possble analogs observed in modern times in othergalaxies. The goal of this study was to remedy this gap in our knowledge byobtaining a series of spectroscopic observations of Eta Carinae's 19thcentury eruption by using a novel trick -- light echoes.  Like soundechoes in a canyon, light echoes from a pulse of light bounce offdistant interstellar clouds and arrive at Earth after a substantialdelay due to light travel time.  We have found many such light echoesfrom Eta Carinae's eruption, allowing us to obtain detailedspectoscopy of this event's reflected light for the first time.  Usingtelescopes in Chile (Eta Carinae is deep in the southern sky) wesuccessfully obtained a long series of images and spectroscopy of thedecade long eruption after a 160 year delay.  We then compared theseecho spectra directly to other erutive stars in distant galaxies. There were a number of surprising results contained in these spectra,which have dramatically altered our fundamental understanding ofmassive star instability, evolution, and death.  Spectra from earlytimes in the eruption showed important differences in temperatures,density, and speed of the outflowing material as composed to earlierworking models of such events, ruling out or refining a number ofpreviously accepted ideas.  The most dramatic and surprising result,however, came from watching how the spectra evolved over time.  Someechoes, tracing times more than 5 years into the eruption, showedevidence for extremely fast expanding material moving at 10,000-20,000km per second.  These are speeds that, so far, have only been seen inviolent terminal events like a supernova.  The existence of this fastmaterial has completely unraveled our understanding of these eruptionsas wind-driven events, pointing instead to some sort of non-terminalexplosion that results from sudden energy deposition deep inside thestar.  Possibilitie involve sudden nuclear burning events or violentstellar mergers.  There had been previous hints of shock poweredevents rather than more steady wind-driven events, but it had beencontroversial.  The spectra of the 19th century eruption of EtaCarinae also allow us to make a number of direct comparisons tosimilar eruptive obejects in nearby galaxies, where othercomplementary data like infrared, UV, and X-ray observations can bemade to further constrain the physics of these events.  Analysis ofthe spectra of Eta Carinae's eruption and of extragalactic analogs isongoing, including ana anlysis of the spectra seen from otherdiurections, and with results so far published in several papers inNature and the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.
