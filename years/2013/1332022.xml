<AbstractNarration>The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is a promising technology for low-cost solar energy conversion in which a dye molecule adsorbed on a semiconductor absorbs light, injects a photoinjected electron into the semiconductor (becoming oxidized), and is reduced (regenerated) by dissolved iodide, giving the neutral dye and triiodide. The electron is collected from the semiconductor, travels through an external circuit, and is returned to a counterelectrode where it reduces triiodide to iodide, completing the circuit. The reduction of oxidized dyes by iodide requires a large overpotential (at least 0.5 V), constituting a significant energy loss in the DSSC. Alternative redox couples that can reduce oxidized dyes with much smaller overpotentials tend to remove electrons from the semiconductor at high rates, replacing one loss process with another. Surmounting this latter problem (recombination) requires increasing the speed of electron transport in the semiconductor, in order that the electron may be extracted before it is lost to recombination. This exploratory project will generate preliminary data to demonstrate the potential for new composite semiconductor nanostructures to solve this problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The design paradigm that governs this work is the paring of two semiconducting materials:&lt;br/&gt;an active layer on which dye molecules adsorb and inject electrons, and a transport layer that extracts charges from the active layer and rapidly transports them to the conducting substrate for collection. The active layer must have a high surface area to allow a large dye loading per geometric area for strong absorption of incident sunlight. Two instances of this paradigm will be produced in this work. One consists of titania nanoparticles coated over zinc oxide nanorods; the nanorods provide fast transport while the nanoparticles greatly increase the total surface area. The other is a conformal layer of titania over a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) aerogel. The aerogel is inherently a high-surface area structure, allowing a conformal coating of the active layer. This project focuses on preliminary data regarding blocking layers to retard recombination, analysis of fluorine dopant levels in FTO aerogel samples, and optoelectronic measurements of solar cell devices made with the novel composite semiconductor films.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This research will significantly advance the technology of low-cost solar energy conversion, for which there is an increasingly urgent need in the face of sharply increasing energy usage among a large population together with impending climate change and other environmental impacts from fossil fuel combustion. The project will provide education and training to involved graduate students including the writing of research articles and travel to domestic and international conferences for dissemination of the results. The PI actively engages K-12 students and teachers using the DSSC as a teaching tool for topics related to energy, the environment, chemistry and engineering.</AbstractNarration>

The supply of electrons to the redox couple normally comes from a counterelectrode on the opposite side of the cell, but the redox couple sometimes takes electrons instead from the semiconductor, resulting in a kind of short-circuiting called "recombination" and reducing the efficiency of the cell for the conversion of sunlight to electrical power. The hopping of electrons from particle to particle is a slow process for electron transport, and the longer electrons remain in the cell, the more likely they are to be lost to recombination.     INTELLECTUAL MERIT  We proposed ways to combine different semiconductor materials into hybrid films for use in DSSCs. One of these uses nanorods of zinc oxide (ZnO) coated with nanoparticles of TiO2. The TiO2 particles have high total surface area, allowing a large number of adsorbed dye molecules and therefore a large amount of light absorption. The ZnO nanorods have very fast electron transport and serve as "electron superhighways" to rapidly shuttle electrons from the TiO2 out of the solar cell, to outrun recombination. Our other approach was to take the conducting substrate, normally a flat film of a doped tin oxide, and fabricate it instead as a high-surface area, highly porous transparent conducting film coated throughout with a very thin layer of TiO2. This is a different way to allow the dye molecules to attach to a large surface area of TiO2, where they work best, while quickly removing the electrons they inject and removing them from the cell before recombination can occur.  In this 1-year "seed" project, we (1) wrapped the hybrid structures in blocking layers to further reduce recombination, (2) conducted advanced measurements to determine the speed of electron transport out of the cell and the rates of loss by recombination, (3) fabricated initial porous transparent conducting films and made solar cell devices out of them, (4) began work on perovskite solar cells, a new variant of the DSSC which may be well served by our hybrid structures, and (5) altered the materials in our ZnO/TiO2 hybrid films to produce the correct energetic alignment to funnel the electrons from the TiO2 into the ZnO nanorods.   BROADER IMPACTS  This work advanced concepts and techniques for improving the energy conversion efficiency of low-cost dye-sensitized solar cells. The grant supported two graduate students in completing their work and their doctoral dissertations, and the project provided a research experience for an undergraduate student.
