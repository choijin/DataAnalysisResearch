<AbstractNarration>The aim of this proposal is to explore a number of novel, emerging directions in the context of atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). The project will extend the recent collaborative work of the PIs on the theme of vortex dynamics in trapped condensates. There, we will explore both connections with experimental results obtained by a collaborating experimental group at Amherst College and ones with other areas of mathematics and physics. These include most notably the spectral theory of such nonlinear coherent states, structural phase transitions thereof, reductions to particle-based dynamical models with interesting nonlinear bifurcation phenomena, and computational tools to monitor the existence, stability and dynamics of vortex clusters. Also, a multi-component generalization of these themes will be considered in the recently established direction of spin-orbit coupled BECs. These contain a more complex operator structure within the nonlinear problem, with a linear part featuring both a dispersive (Laplacian) and a Dirac-like part and the interplay of these terms and their impact on nonlinear states such as dark or bright solitons and vortices will be studied. The results in this direction will be compared to ongoing experiments by a collaborating experimental group at Washington State University.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is expected to provide a new generation of both theoretical and computational tools for studying nonlinear coherent structures with a particular view towards the pristine atomic physics setup of Bose-Einstein condensates. Furthermore, the theoretical/mathematical tools developed here will bear broader impacts towards areas such as spectral theory and nonlinear ordinary and partial differential equations, among others. It is also envisioned that our findings will create connections with a number of areas  of Physics such as Fluid Dynamics, Nonlinear Optics and Statistical Mechanics (of Phase Transitions). On the other hand, the developed computational tools will explore the interface between numerical bifurcation theory, dynamical system and even Monte-Carlo/Molecular Dynamics techniques and their potential use for the physical system at hand.  Importantly, the research will be a genuine synergy in truly Applied Mathematics, involving not only the development of theoretical methods and computational techniques, but also their direct connection with physical experiments. Finally, the project will be critically focused on sustaining a dynamic and multi-disciplinary team with a strong and diverse core of graduate students and hence will be consistently geared towards having a significant set of broader impacts. The relevant research will be disseminated via high quality journal publications both in Mathematics and in Physics and will be presented at Nonlinear Science and Mathematical Physics conferences both in the US and abroad.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The recent experimental realization of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) ---leading to the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics--- has ignited an intense interest from the Mathematics and Physics communities.

The main theme of this grant was to  study newly emerging directions pertaining to the existence, stability,  bifurcations, dynamics and interactions of coherent structures (solitons,  vortices, and vortex rings) in BECs. The plan involved a coordination  of mathematical modeling, analytical and asymptotic methods, and  computational techniques synergistically interwoven with results from experiments.  Specifically, as part of this multi-disciplinary effort, the following project outcomes were achieved:  * We examined the nucleation of vortices in a dissipative variant of the nonlinear Schroedinger (NLS) equation that models the effects of finite temperature coupling with the thermal cloud  in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). We have seen (and mathematically explained) how vortices nucleate in the periphery of the cloud and are gradually driven inwards crystalizing in a lattice structure.  * We have studied the effects of anisotropic trapping on the statics and dynamics of vortex configurations in BECs. We have found a  wealth of periodic solutions for vortex pair configurations using  reduced models. The phase space of these reduced models has enabled us to separate regimes of ordered from those of chaotic dynamics.  * With our experimental collaborator, Brian Anderson from University of Arizona, we have developed a technique to systematically nucleate vortices in a BECs on demand. This technique is based on using focused laser beam to nucleate and trap vortex pairs by moving them at speeds larger than the speed of sound. This is what we call the ``chopsticks'' technique and we believe that it can form the basis for a significant array of studies with different numbers of vortices ``at will'' in the future.  * We have used the presence of a radial defect structure in order to stabilize a long-sought structure (in atomic BECs -- although it has been studied in nonlinear optics), namely a ring-dark-soliton. We have developed a systematic particle description of the ring dark soliton dynamics and oscillations.  * We have continued to develop reduced equations of motion for the  dynamics of 3D vortex rings (VRs). These reduced equations incorporate two main contributions: (a) the dynamics induced to each VR by the inhomogeneous background due to the trapping potential and (b) the  interactions between VRs.   * We have systematically characterized the bifurcation of vortex rings from planar (or ring-) dark-soliton soliton states, and explore their spectral and dynamical properties.
