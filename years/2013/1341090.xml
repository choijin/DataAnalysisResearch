<AbstractNarration>This CNIC proposal aims to support research between Dr. Nathan Ryan of Bucknell University and his collaborators, Dr. Ariel Pacetti of the Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina, Dr. Gonzalo Tornaria of the Universidad de la Republica in Uruguay, and Dr. Yves Martin of the Universidad de Chile, in Santiago, Chile, on the theoretical and computational study of modular forms of higher rank.  Modular forms are an important subject within number theory.  After Andrew Wiles proved Fermat?s Last Theorem in the nineties, much work of foundational and computational nature has led to a fairly complete understanding of the relationships between modular forms of rank one, elliptic curves, and their L-functions.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI and his collaborators would like to extend that understanding to modular forms of higher rank.  Each of the collaborators brings different expertise to the project and thus they will be able to tackle a number of different approaches and topics.  They will also attempt to disseminate and advance the study of modular forms through contacts between researchers in the area from North and South America and by bringing three graduate students from historically underrepresented groups from the United States to interact with their peers in Uruguay, while involved in computational and theoretical research projects related to modular forms of rank greater than one.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ There were two main components of this project.  The first was to bring three US graduate students in mathematics to Uruguay  for two actvities: (1) to do research in number theory with Uruguayan mathematicians and (2) to paritcipate in a round table discussion with Uruguayan undergraduate and Master's students about what it is like to study mathematics in the US.  The first activity was quite successful:  we came up with a plan of how to attack the problem and started carrying out some initial steps in that direction.  Additionally, it appears that these visits might also mark the beginning of longer-term collaborations.  The second one was also a success:  the discussion had 3 students in attendance and, considering that only 3 or 4 students graduate a year in mathematics, this is a pretty good result.  The students left convinced of the viability of them pursuing graduate study in the US.     The second main component was for the PI to form collaborations with Ariel Pacetti in Buenos Aires and Yves Martin in Santiago.  While the project that Pacetti and PI planned on working on did not pan out a new direction emerged, one that they plan on pursuing in the coming years.  Martin and the PI have a couple of well-formed questions that they will work on the next time they are together.   An unexpected collaboration also emerged.  A recent graduate student Nicol&aacute;s Sirolli of Pacetti who is currently a postdoc in Uruguay, supervised by a mutual collaborator Gonzalo Tornar&iacute;a, recently finished an important step to a multi-year ambitious project related to the massive computation of objects of number theoretic interest (this project is also joint work with Nils Skoruppa, a German mathematician).  The result of this project was recently submitted to one of the top conferences for algorithmic and computational number theory.  With this step completed, they plan on pursuing the main part of this project, to be picked up with the graduate students Malcolm Rupert, Watson Ladd and Jeffery Hein that the PI invited to Uruguay.
