<AbstractNarration>Investigation of hydrothermal heat and mass flux between the crust and the ocean between the Costa Rica Rift axis and Ocean Drilling Program Hole 504B is designed to aid in development of an integrated crust-hydrothermal-ocean circulation model. Heat flow will be measured along a 300 km long corridor as an integral component of a large multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional project called OSCAR (Oceanographic and Seismic Characterization of heat dissipation and alteration by hydrothermal fluids at an Axial Ridge). In combination with oceanographic plume mapping that will guide assessment of hydrothermal flux at the spreading axis, the new heat flow results will show how conductive flux varies as the plate ages, in particular where the transition from focused, high rate flow to diffuse, lower flux circulation occurs. This is a long-standing question in mid-ocean ridge studies. The influence of disrupted basement structure on local heatflow will be assessed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;US scientists will work closely with UK and German colleagues that lead the main project. Addition of the heat flow acquisition enables addressing a main theme of the InterRidge Third Decade plan- heat and chemical exchange between the crust and the deep ocean. A female graduate student whose main training is in analytical modeling will gain experience in seagoing data acquisition, exposure to international scientists, and insight into the advantages and limitations of having surface-only data to constrain a subsurface flow model.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The transport and exchange of mass, heat energy, and geochemical constituents between young lithosphere at mid-ocean ridges and the ocean is a process of fundamental importance in Earth system dynamics.  The principal objective of the proposed research was to investigate hydrothermal heat and mass flux between the oceanic crust and the overlying ocean and to aid in the development of an integrated crust-hydrothermal-ocean circulation model.  Our study area is in the Panama Basin bounded by the Costa Rica Rift axis and DSDP/ODP Hole 504B.  We obtained a new suite of conductive sub-seafloor heat flow data to better understand the nature of conductive and advective heat transfer in young sedimented crust. We combined these heat flow data with existing heat flow data to provide a better estimate of total hydrothermal heat loss from the crust in the study region.  These data have provided insight into links between crustal structure, hydrothermal circulation patterns, hydrothermal heat and mass transfer, deep ocean circulation, and hydration of the oceanic crust.  Our data from the Costa Rica Rift to seafloor ages of 6 Ma show that hydrothermal circulation in the oceanic crust is transferring approximately 75% of the crustal heat to the ocean.  Because low permeability sediment caps high permeability oceanic basement hydrothermal circulation is characterized by outcrop to outcrop flow. The mass flux associated with this advective transport is approximately 5 x 10-6 kgm-2s-1 and the Darcy flow rate ranges from approximately 1 to 2 x 103 m2yr-1 per unit length perpendicular to the heat flow profile. A significant portion of the 75% advective transport is due to the presence of high angle normal faults that facilitates focused discharge of high temperature hydrothermal fluids. Our data clearly shows the hydrogeologic transition of heat transport from an advective dominated to conductive dominated regime that occurs within the span of a few million years as sediment thickness increases. The observations and analysis of heat flow in the young crust of south flank of Costa Rica Rift shows the influence of low permeability sediments in influencing the geometry of fluid flow.  As the crust ages and sediment cover becomes more complete fluid flow transitions from small scale convection to larger scale with occasional high-angle normal fault focusing discharge.  Heat flow data collected across a sediment pond in the Ecuador fracture zone are also consistent with hydrothermal circulation.  Here approximately 50% of the mean basal heat flux is being removed by advection and the mean fluid flow rate is approximately 400 m2 yr-1.  The influence of hydrothermal circulation on the thermal structure of fracture zones have implications for earthquakes and rheology along oceanic transform faults.  This work is part of a large United Kingdom research program and together addressed fundamental and long-standing questions about hydrothermal circulation and links to oceanographic circulation, while promoting teaching, training, and learning.  Our project was unusually broad because of its multidisciplinary nature.  We involved undergraduate students and incorporated our results into undergraduate classes taught at Oregon State University to inform and educate students about ocean exploration.
