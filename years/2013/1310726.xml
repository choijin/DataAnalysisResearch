<AbstractNarration>This action funds Richard Galvez of Syracuse University to conduct a research project in MPS during the summer of 2013 at University of Auckland in Auckland, New Zealand.  The project title is "What Happened Immediately after Cosmic Inflation? A Novel Analysis of the Unknown Era of the Expansion of the Universe." The host scientist is Professor Richard Easther.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to modern experiments such as NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and the European Space Agency's Planck, the expansion history of the universe from the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) era until today is very well understood to remarkable precision. The expansion history before BBN however is still a mystery. If one assumes cosmic inflation to take place in the very early universe (around a fraction of a second after the Big Bang) can experimental results from Planck and WMAP constrain what happened during this time? And, if so, to what extent? This is the question this project is addressing.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce. Upon return to Syracuse University, the Fellow will use the research and experience gained during the EAPSI fellowship to mentor two undergraduate students on a research project with the goal of introducing these students to modern practices in academic research and various topics in theoretical physics and cosmology. The Fellow will also organize an EAPSI workshop for other graduate students across STEM fields about his experiences and encourage others from Syracuse University to apply. The Fellow is also giving seminars at universities in NZ to disseminate information gathered in his project thus far. In addition, the Fellow plans to present research findings at academic conferences in the 2013-2014 academic year as well as as a series of seminars planned in Nicaragua.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    For the first time in the history of science, precise experimental observations are encountering theoretical predictions from what may have occurred during the first 10^(&minus;36) seconds after the Big Bang. In particular, it is the theory of cosmic inflation that proposes a burst of exponential expansion during these early times which provides the best candidate theory for this era. The European Space Agency's Planck experiment supplies the scientific community with the highest resolution observations of the tell-tale signals of this era, the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation.   In parallel, the Large Hadron Collider at CERN (LHC) has probed energies of 14 TeV, or equivalently 10^(&minus;14) seconds after the Big Bang. This experiment has verified the Standard Model of particle physics, the fundamental theory of the universe up to energies of 10 TeV and finally discovered the much anticipated Higgs Boson particle. The theory of inflation and the standard model tell very precise stories, but unfortunately of two disjoint eras of the early universe. An understanding of the fundamental physics between these two eras, the so-called dark ages of cosmic evolution, is required to link together the experimental observations from both Planck and the LHC.  In one of the initial steps of this ambitious goal, it was the PI's Host (R. Easther) who began to investigate this mysterious era in our universe's unknown past. The PI joined R. Easther in New Zealand for EAPSI 2013 to investigate this era and further the pursuit of  the understanding of this growing field.  For this project R. Easther and the PI considered one possible deviation from the standard hypothesis of evolution and considered how observations of the Cosmic Microwave Background radiation would signal such a deviation. The results were unexpected-- through the analysis conducted in this project, R.

This work has already been cited five times since it's appearance in August 2013 on the electronic repository of scientific publications, arxiv.org. The unexpected effects on dark matter production are continuing to be studied by the PI and two undergraduate physics majors at Syracuse University, the PI's home institution.   As a necessary step in our analysis, a computational Bayesian system had to be developed. This computational resource continues to be useful past this original phase and has given the PI numerous opportunities to contribute to the understanding of the cosmic dark ages.  The PI currently has plans to participate in scientific conferences to present the results found during EAPSI 2013 and present to the community at-large the ability of the developed computational tool for future discovery and analysis of the cosmic dark ages.
