<AbstractNarration>ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;This project leverages available AUV Sentry and R/V Atlantis time to implement and test new methods for quantifying heat and fluid fluxes at deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Simultaneous AUV-mounted flow velocity and temperature gradient measurements will be obtained and corrections for vehicle motion will be used to compute flux in/out of a control volume that surrounds the known venting. At Main Endeavour Field on the Juan de Fuca Ridge, the control volume estimates will be compared to the 2000 FlowMow results to better delimit contributions of diffuse flow. At Ashes hydrothermal field on Axial Volcano, a series of surveys at 5 m height will help test the new method for measuring diffuse flow from an AUV. These near-bottom measurements will be validated and synthesized with direct measurements of diffuse and focused flow provided by camera systems deployed for a separate project. Simultaneous measurement of different scales (very near-bottom and control volumes of 100'm on each side) of heat flux and turbulence within the hydrothermal effluent is an expected outcome. The method developed will provide the oceanographic community with new capabilities for quantifying fluxes with AUVs at hydrothermal vents and possibly in other environments as well, including cold seeps and natural or artificial hydrocarbon leaks.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This proposal sought  to obtain highly accurate measurements of the overall hydrothermal heat and volume flux from hydrothermal vents off of the Pacific Northwest Coast using an automomous robotic systems.  Measurements were obtained at the ASHES and Main Endeavour (MEF) vent fields with the Sentry Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) and R/V Atlantis during a  27 day cruise to Axial and MEF in July 2014 and served as the night program for Atlantis (opposite the manned submersible Alvin).  For this research, we equipped the Sentry AUV with sensors to measure (1) water velocity and (2) temperature.  Combined, they allow us to estimate the heat flux (i.e., the rate of heat transfer per unit area) of the hydrothermal vent field and constrain our estimate of the energy fueling the vent field. Measurements of the overall heat and fluid flux of a hydrothermal system provide critical, first-order constraints on the energy available for biological communities, the thermal and chemical structure of ocean crust, and the influence of hydrothermal systems on ocean chemistry. Despite the importance of these measurements, very few well-constrained values exist. Our research sought to obtain accurate values for ASHES and MEF and develop a methodology for future flux surveys at other hydrothermal vents.  The obtaIned measurements reflect the highest-resolution water velocity and temperature measurements obtained at a hydrothermal vent site.  Analysis is ongoing.  Add-on research focused on using water velocity measurements to improve underwater robot navigation.  Results show that this method is an order of magnitude better than an unaided inertial navigation system.  Outcomes of this research include a conference abstract, 2 conference papers, as well as submitted and in-prep journal manuscripts.
