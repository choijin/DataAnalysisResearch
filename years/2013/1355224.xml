<AbstractNarration>Studying the nutritional physiology of animals is important because we can gain insight into how animals survive on different diets.  An emergent theme within the field of vertebrate nutritional physiology is the commonality of elevated biochemical activity of amylase, a carbohydrate-degrading digestive enzyme, in animals that consume plant material.   Preliminary data suggest that herbivores and omnivores express more amylase genes than do carnivores, and that convergently-evolved herbivores express different suites of amylases.  However, beyond consistent measurements of elevated amylase activities, the genetic underpinnings of this observation (i.e., the cause), or the functional consequences of investing in elevated amylase activities, remain elusive.  Therefore, the goal of this study is to investigate the molecular and biochemical underpinnings of elevated amylase activities in a family of fishes with great dietary diversity, and to understand consequences of this enzymatic investment.  This study will be important in our understanding of what an animal eats and why.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As part of a series of dietary studies using prickleback fish, the studies supported by this award will: 1) use traditional and high-throughput molecular  technologies to identify the number of amylase genes present in the genome, and being expressed at a given time (transcriptomics); 2) model the structure of, and characterize amylase biochemistry that may explain variation in amylase function, and 3) conduct feeding trials with pricklebacks to determine whether growth rate and fitness can be affected by differences in amylase machinery.  The studies supported by this award will answer fundamental questions about the mechanisms underlying patterns in enzymatic activity, as well as potential metabolic and fitness consequences.  This project will increase diversity in science by directly involving researchers from underrepresented groups and through an outreach program with a local high school with a 78% minority population.  The results of this project will be published in international scientific journals and presented at conferences.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>We investigated the genetic underpinnings of digestive specialization toward diet in animals, using prickleback fishes (marine intertidal fishes) as models. We focused on the genes for the digestive enzyme amylase because this enzyme is expressed at high levels in herbivores and omnivores, but not in carnivores. Because herbivores and omnivores eat more of the substrate for amylase (i.e., starch), they invest more in the enzyme to digest it. Within the prickleback fishes, herbivory has evolved twice, independently. One of those herbivores, <em>Cebidichthys violaceus</em>, digests algae with the aid of microbial symbionts in their hindguts, whereas the other herbivore, <em>Xiphister mucosus</em>, relies more on their own digestive processes to make a living on algae (German et al. 2015). We sequenced the genome of <em>C. violaceus</em>, and the transcriptomes of <em>C. violaceus</em> and <em>X. mucosus</em>, as well as for <em>X. atropurpureus</em> (omnivore), <em>Phytichthys chirus</em> (omnivore), and <em>Anoplarchus purpurescens</em> (carnivore). We initially used traditional methods (i.e., Sanger sequencing and cloning) to sequence the amylase genes and examine how many copies of these genes were in each of these fishes&rsquo; genomes, finding that <em>C. violaceus</em> had more amylase gene copies (three or more) than the other fishes (usually, one or two; German et al. 2016). Sequencing the <em>C. violaceus</em> genome and all of the transcriptomes confirmed that <em>C. violaceus</em> has three copies of the amylase gene (two of <em>amy2A</em> and one <em>amy2B</em>), whereas all other species only had one or two copies of <em>amy2A</em>. An analysis of the sequences shows that the <em>amy2B</em> gene is under strong positive selection, suggesting that the emergence of this gene has relevance to the elevated activity of amylase in the <em>C. violaceus</em> gut, and this fish&rsquo;s ability to digest algae.&nbsp; The main finding is that animals can achieve the elevated amylase activity necessary to digest algae through elevated gene copy number (e.g., <em>C. violaceus</em>), or by expressing fewer genes at higher levels (e.g., <em>X. mucosus</em> and <em>X. atropurpureus</em>), showing that there is more than one way to solve an evolutionary problem.

Selection analyses show strong positive selection on <em>bsal2</em> in those species that consume more algae, and these species have elevated lipase activities in their digestive tracts in comparison to carnivores.
