<AbstractNarration>How Development and Behavior Interact to Change Skull Form: Exploring and Sharing Evolutionary Insights from the Fossil Record of Cetaceans (Whales, Dolphins, and Porpoises)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;By &lt;br/&gt;Jonathan H. Geisler&lt;br/&gt;New York Institute of Technology&lt;br/&gt;NSF EAR-1349607&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extant cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) display an extraordinary diversity of skull shapes, yet there is wide anatomical gap between the skulls of cetaceans and those of other mammals. Fortunately the fossil record of cetaceans bridges much of this anatomical gap, making it one of the best documented, but least appreciated, examples of large-scale evolutionary change. In this project we will explore how the cetacean skull evolved and test whether its shape was influenced by changes in brain size, feeding behavior, or the advent of echolocation. To accomplish these aims we will apply a wide array of technology to more than 400 skulls of recent and fossil species, including a laser scanner to generate 3D digital computer models of skulls, X-ray computed tomography (CT scans) to probe inside fossil skulls, and sophisticated computer applications that can analyze the data we collect in the context of evolutionary relationships. We will also formally name four new species of 30 million year old fossil whales that document key stages in the cetacean evolution. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Our project will use several strategies to share and disseminate our discoveries. The new fossil species we name will be displayed at the College of Charleston Natural History Museum, and 3D printed models of their inner ears and brains (developed from CT scans) will be displayed at that museum as well as at the Georgia Southern Museum. In both places these objects and specimens will be integrated into exhibits that describe the remarkable history of whale and dolphin evolution. A wider audience will learn of our discoveries through an updated website on cetacean evolution. In all stages of our project, we will involve students in the act of scientific investigation, thus training future scientists. Specifically we will engage undergraduates at the College of Charleston and New York Institute of Technology as well as medical students at the latter institution. A Postdoctoral Scholar is part of the project team, and through this project, he/she will develop a diverse skill set that should serve as a catalyst for a successful career in science.</AbstractNarration>

Although the ancestor of cetaceans lived on land, they have thoroughly adapted to life in the water. One anatomical region displaying adaptations is the skull, and we studied its evolution by applying new technologies to largely unstudied collections of fossil whales, many of which are new to science. Most of the fossils date to the &ldquo;golden age&rdquo; of cetaceans, when the major groups alive today originated and diversified across the world&rsquo;s oceans. Through laser scanners and micro CT, we were able to create high fidelity, virtual models of skulls and penetrate the dense inner ear bones to image hidden structures</p> <p>Through this project we formally named and described four new species of fossil cetaceans. Two of these species provide important new information on the evolution of key adaptations seen in modern species. Mysticete whales, like the blue, fin, and bowhead whales, lack teeth and instead filter out small prey using baleen, a fingernail-like filter that lines the mouth. One of the species we described, <em>Coronodon havensteini</em>, suggests that mysticetes initially filter-fed using large and elaborate teeth, with baleen evolving later. By contrast odontocete whales, dolphins, and porpoises find their food using echolocation, a behavior that utilizes the same principles as sonar. Another species we described, <em>Echovenator sandersi</em>, indicates that echolocation evolved early and rapidly in odontocetes, shortly after they diverged from mysticete whales.</p> <p>We also made major discoveries by analyzing data collected from large samples of fossil and living species. We combined datasets of genetic and anatomical data to generate family trees that span across cetacean diversity, and our trees are the most detailed yet for odontocetes. We also explored the evolution of brain size, rostral shape, and the blowhole across the 50 million year history of cetaceans. Our work documents a rich fossil record, with numerous intermediates between whales that had the nostrils near the tip of the snout, like those of other mammals, and those with a blowhole on top of the head. Both the rostrum and the roof of the skull undergo rapid evolution during the early Oligocene (30-35 million years ago), resulting in skulls of drastically different shapes and sizes. Our analyses indicate that very long rostra evolved at least 4 times, whereas very short rostra evolved at least 10 times, underscoring the complexity of cetacean skull evolution.</p> <p>Throughout this project, we have trained a diverse group of students and young researchers, and provided unique opportunities for them to engage in the scientific process. Specifically, we have involved 5 undergraduates, 5 medical students, and 2 young scientists in our research. Importantly, we have enjoyed success recruiting and working with underrepresented groups. We also hired one postdoctoral researcher, and as a result, he received comprehensive training at NYIT and overseas on the collection and analysis of high-resolution surface scans of complex biological objects. &nbsp;</p> <p>An important goal of our project is to share our data and findings with the scientific community and the broader public. As a result, we have published our findings in 8 peer-reviewed papers, several of which were also communicated to the public through press releases and media coverage. Our large datasets for reconstructing the family tree of cetaceans are available online, as are 84 of the 263 high-resolution (i.e. 0.2 &ndash; 0.5 mm) laser scans of fossil and living whale skulls. The sharing of this data will greatly facilitate whale researchers in the US and elsewhere, given the high cost of international travel and the far-flung nature of fossil cetacean collections. The most important fossil whales we named and studied in this project are showcased in a permanent &ldquo;Evolution of Whales&rdquo; exhibit at the Mace Brown Museum of Natural History (College of Charleston, SC). Since opening, this exhibit has had thousands of visitors, including numerous K-9 school groups engaged by museum sponsored, educational outreach. This exhibit includes &gt; 15 specimens that tell the story of whale evolution; a story that rivals other &ldquo;textbook&rdquo; examples of evolution by documenting numerous intermediates in the fossil record, the prolonged history by which complex adaptations evolve, and a pattern anatomical convergence as species exploit similar habitats and food resources.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/02/2018<br>      Modified by: Jonathan&nbsp;H&nbsp;Geisler</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1349607/1349607_10295560_1533238776088_Echovenator_version1-300dpi--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1349607/1349607_10295560_1533238776088_Echovenator_version1-300dpi--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Echovenator sandersi"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1349607/1349607_10295560_1533238776088_Echovenator_version1-300dpi--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Echovenator sandersi"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Life restoration of Echovenator sandersi.
