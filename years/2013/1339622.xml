<AbstractNarration>This award supports the bi-annual teacher workshop of the Lowell Educational Astronomy Program (LEAP). LEAP is a science enrichment and outreach program for 5th-8th grade Navajo and Hopi children and their teachers. The program pairs astronomers with teachers for one year. The astronomer visits the classroom throughout the year, leading astronomy discussions and hands-on activities in collaboration with the teacher. The astronomer also holds star parties at the school and involves tribal educators in presenting traditional astronomical knowledge. The year-long partnership culminates in a field trip to Lowell Observatory in which the students visit the Observatory's Steele Visitor Center during the day and observe on two research telescopes at night.</AbstractNarration>

In addition, each teacher is invited to bring a colleague from their school. Thus, more teachers are reached than participate directly in the program and classroom visits.

We invited each teacher to bring with them a colleague from their school, and some did so. In all we had 14 teachers attend from 9 schools. (A 15th teacher signed up but did not show up). Four schools were Hopi Nation schools, 4 were Navajo schools, and one has a mixed population of Navajo and Hopi students.
