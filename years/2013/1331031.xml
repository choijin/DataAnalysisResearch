<AbstractNarration>This Faculty Scholar award will allow Dr. Yarimar Bonilla of Rutgers University to spend a semester in residence at Harvard University as a faculty fellow at the History Design Studio at the W.E.B. Dubois Institute of African and African American Research where she can also participate in the activities of the Institute for Quantitative Social Science and the Center for Geographic Analysis.  This training will allow Dr. Bonilla to develop skills in quantitative research, geospatial analysis, and data visualization in order to develop a new long-term research project with the following goals: (1) to develop a series of indicators of sovereignty that build on both quantitative and qualitative research that will allow us to conceptualize sovereignty in more complex and sophisticated ways; (2) to gather information on these indicators across different societies in order to create an alternative archive of sovereign relationships; (3) to experiment with new modes of data visualization that will better represent sovereignty as partial, fluctuating, and contested. These visualizations will serve as a counter to current cartographies that represent the world through the fixed boundaries of putatively sovereign nations. They will also serve as tools of inquiry about the nature of sovereignty, its patterns, its negotiations, and its shifts over time. The results of this project will have potential implications for public policy regarding international assistance, humanitarianism, and international aid by adding new dimensions to existing criteria for determining measures of political sovereignty, state capacity, and a re-evaluation of the goals of "good governance."</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award allowed the project investigator to develop new skills in data visualization, including GIS and experimetnal cartography. Data visualizations and infographics, which have become ubiquitous in both print media and digital platforms, are increasingly heralded as essential modes of communication for what is regarded as both the digital and the visual age. Anthropolgoists have not taken full advantage of this visual tools, yet they are well posed to bring greater attention to how to use visualizations to convey complex arguments about the social world, while remainign attentive to the reductive capacity of visual representation.   In order to gain firsthand experience with emerging forms of digital representation, the project investigator spent a semester at Harvard University as a visiting fellow in the History Design studio at the Hutchins Center. During this period the investigator participated in the "Multimedia History &amp; Literature" seminar at the Warren Center for American History and worked independently with the mapping specialists at the Center for Geographic Analysis developing a series of prototypes for a project entitled Visualizing Sovereignty.   The experience revealed the potential for incorporating data visualizations into the larger toolkit of cultural anthropology, and the principal investigator expects to deploy these techniques in the developmetn of an online digital atlas of the Caribbean.
