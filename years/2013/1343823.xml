<AbstractNarration>This award will support student travel to 22nd International Conference on Parallel Architecture and Compilation Techniques (PACT 2013).  The conference is being held in Edinburgh, Scotland in September 2013.  PACT is a leading conference on parallel architectures, compilers, languages, algorithms, and applications.  Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF.  Broader impacts include building the next generation of researchers in this research area, as well as providing international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce.</AbstractNarration>
