<AbstractNarration>Jackson State University will investigate the effects of the proper levels of scaffolding for cyber-enabled collaborative learning on academic performance and skill development of African American STEM students and identify social and cognitive factors that can contribute to their achievement gains through cyber-enabled collaborative learning.  The PIs will test the hypothesis that scaffolding cyber-enabled collaborative learning can promote shared construction of knowledge and regulation of learning processes for African American students and, thus, lead to improvement of their deeper understanding of important concepts and higher-order skill development.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will expand the current knowledge about cyber-enabled collaborative learning by conducting the research in a STEM context, particularly examining the effects of instructional guides in an authentic STEM education setting for African American students.  Prior research on collaborative learning was conducted mainly on K-12 students or liberal arts college students. The study could add new perspectives in instructional strategies for STEM faculty to increase student engagement and persistence and improve academic performance in STEM and non-STEM disciplines.</AbstractNarration>

The goal of cognitive scaffolding was to facilitate students’ cognitive processes for knowledge construction. The cognitive scaffolding is composed of question prompts or hints on concepts and problem-solving procedures specifically pertinent to the assigned collaborative learning tasks to guide students’ cognitive processes.

If these learning variables cannot be equally distributed among the control and intervention groups, the simple statistical comparison of students’ academic performance in these groups may lead to incorrect conclusions on the effect of the intervention.   When the Mutiple Linear Regression (MLR) model includes all impacting variables as input variables the same as these input variables for the SEMs, the MLR model may lead to similar results as these from the SEMs. However, if other important impacting factors, such as the initial attitude and initial participation, are not considered as input variables for the MLR model, the MLR model may or may not identify the effects of intervention on the examined learning outcomes with statistical significance.   Furthermore, the simple statistical analysis method only examines the learning gains without considering the import impacting variables as input variables. The simple statistical comparison of students’ learning gains may lead to incorrect conclusions on the effect of the intervention due to the limitations of the simple statistical analysis, even though the SEM or MLR analysis of the same dataset indicates the positive effects of the intervention on the examined learning outcomes.
