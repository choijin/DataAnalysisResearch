<AbstractNarration>This research addresses a persistent puzzle across the social sciences: What explains Americans' opposition to government? That is to say, why do Americans evince comparatively low support for redistributive programs, register decreasing trust in government, and offer electoral support to increasingly regressive tax schemes? The projects tests a novel causal explanation, grounded in behavioral economics and social psychology. The explanation proposes that, when evaluating government, citizens import the same consumer frameworks they rely on when making everyday consumer decisions. In other words, they treat government as just another consumer good. Such a framework is inherently ill-equipped to grapple with some of the benefits that government provides. Citizens conclude that government is providing them low "transaction utility" -- that they are getting a raw deal. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research expands on preliminary results to investigate the relationships among transaction utility as it is derived from government, attitudes toward government, and compliance with government rules and norms. Specially, the projects involves three experiments, one in the field and two over the Internet. The survey experiments evaluate the relationship between perceived costs and perceived benefits, and opposition to government. The field experiment tests the relationship between perceived costs and benefits and compliance with government rules and norms. The research relies on insights from behavioral economics, consumer psychology, political science and sociology to answer a question that has bedeviled scholars from across those disciplines. In so doing, the research will chart an interdisciplinary course to help public servants better communicate with citizens.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant was primarily used to fund original data collection for "The Consumer Citizen," a disseration accepted by the University of Chicago in 2016. In addition, the grant was used to fund travel and conference costs, so that the research could be presented to and analyzed by fellow scholars.  The dissertation proposes that, when making political decisions, everyday citizens rely on the habits, norms and strategies they otherwise rely upon when making consumer decisions. The lessons citizens have learned about what to buy, what not to buy, and how much they are willing to pay can shape their attitudes toward government, their policy positions, their level of political knowledge, and the amount in which they participate in politics.

More than 8,000 individuals enrolled in more than a dozen experiments, with each experiment testing a different aspect of the project's guiding theory. Among others, we have learned the following lessons from these experiments:  -Like consumers, citizens evalaute government's costs and benefits with internal mental calcultators. They tally up the costs that government has extracted from them, and they do their best to monetize the benefits that they have received.  -Like consumers, citizens prefer that govenrment services be "operationallty transparent." When government makes clear what services it is providing on their behalf, as many private firms strive to do, citizens' level of trust in government will markedly increase.  -Like consumers, citizens prefer that the services government provides to them be roughly alinged in value with the costs that government extracts from them. They are aggravated when government taxes them more than the value of the services they receive in return; yet they have no expectation of receiving a free lunch from government. Their views toward redistribution, and in some cases their electoral preferences, can be shaped by whether government costs and benefits are presented as alignable in value.  -Citizens' political preferences are especially responsive to objects familiar to them from the consumer world.
