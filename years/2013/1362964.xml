<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Hyunsoo Han of the University of Texas at San Antonio is developing new bifunctional reagents for the synthesis of complex organic compounds. These bifunctional reagents work without relying on functional group adjustments or on the use of protecting groups (two chief culprits of synthetic inefficiency), while maintaining high selectivity. Consequently, the prospective bifunctional reagents and accompanying synthetic strategies provide a versatile tool box for efficient asymmetric synthesis of many chemically and biologically important compounds, including natural products and pharmaceuticals. This occurs within the context of an emerging program for the training of young scientists in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Texas at San Antonio. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The development of methods for carrying out two fundamental organic reactions, asymmetric aldehyde allylation/crotylation and allylic substitution/Michael addition, without functional group manipulations and protection groups is a main focus of this project.  These targets include: (1) concise synthetic routes for bifunctional reagents; (2) extension of bifunctional reagents in the aldehyde allylation/crotylation reactions to a diverse array of aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes; (3) demonstration of the power and versatility of the synthetic strategies in the efficient asymmetric syntheses of 2-alkyl-1,3-diols/aminoalcohols as well as more complex and heretofore inaccessible ring systems. In contrast to more traditional B-, Si-, and/or Sn-based reagents, these bifunctional reagents operate through [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement under either acidic or oxidative conditions, and are totally "organic" (all C-based), making them environmentally benign and air-stable.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ 4-Hydroxy-2,3-unsaturated and 7-hydroxy-2,3,4,5-unsaturated carbonyl compounds are valuable synthetic targets, both as final products and as intermediates in the total synthesis of (bio)chemically relevant compounds, particularly polyketide natural products.  Traditionally, they have been accessed primarily by the (Mukaiyama) vinylogous aldol and bisvinylogous aldol reactions.  However, the (Mukaiyama) vinylogous and bisvinylogous aldol reactions intrinsically suffer from regioselectivity issue and unable to control the configuration of a double bond(s) in the product structures.  In a drastically different approach operating through 2-oxonia-Cope rearrangement mechanism, purely "organic" (all carbon-based) chiral reagents have been developed to circumvent all these drawbacks asscociated with the (Mukaiyama) aldol reactions:  1. The reagents 1, 1'E-2, and 1'Z-2 enabled the complete control of enantio- and diastereoselectivity in the vinylogous aldol reaction with a variety of aldehydes without the regioselectivity issue.  2. The reagents anti-5 and syn-5 enabled Z- and E-selective vinylogous aldol reactions, respectively.  Particularly, Z-selective vinylogous aldol is not possible by tradinal vinylogous aldol reactions.  3. The reagents 4,5-syn-2E-8, 4,5-syn-2Z-8, 4,5-anti-2E-8, and 4,5-anti-2Z-8 enabled the total at-will control of the C7-stereochemistry and the 2,4-dienoate configuration in the bisvinylogous aldol reactions with aldehydes.  The grant has been used to train and support three undergraduate students, two Ph.D. students, two post-docs, and one part-time lab technician.  Last, but not the least, since the developed reagents and accompanying synthetic strategies provide a versatile tool box for the efficient asymmetric synthesis of many chemically and biologically important compounds, the outcomes of the grant can eventually make a sifnificant impact on the well-being of human being.
