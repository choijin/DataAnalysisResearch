<AbstractNarration>The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at the Nevis Laboratories of Columbia University provides ten undergraduate students each summer the opportunity to participate in research on topics in experimental high energy physics and particle astrophysics. Two of the students will spend the summer conducting research at the European Organization for Nuclear Research in Switzerland. In addition to participating in research with an mentor, the REU students will gain knowledge of and practice technical communications, research collaboration and networking, and responsible conduct of research. By the end of the program, every student will have presented the results of the work in a final talk and a research paper.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This REU site will have a number of broader impacts with its focus on providing research opportunities to undergraduates to help prepare them for future science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers. The site has a strong plan to recruit undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in physics and from non-research institutions. The project is informed by an on-going evaluation.</AbstractNarration>

A series of roughly biweekly seminars and lab visits was used to introduce the students to current outstanding research questions in a wide variety of subfields of physics. Other components included training in scientific ethics, a discussion about graduate school, and a day trip to visit the experimental facilities at Brookhaven National Lab.  Over the life of the REU program at Nevis, about 80% of the REU participants have gone on to graduate school in STEM fields, providing strong support that the program is meeting its main goal of encouraging students to consider graduate training in STEM fields.
