<AbstractNarration>This project is directly responding to the need of the nation for more computer science (CS) graduates, and especially the need for more women and underrepresented minorities in CS. Towards these ends the Computer Science (CS) Department of the University of Houston's main campus (UH) is providing scholarships of up to $10,000 per year to academically meritorious, professionally talented and financially deserving computer science majors from diverse backgrounds and with diverse goals.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The goals of this project are to: attract talented high school and community college students to CS, build a diverse community of well-qualified scholars who are leaders, increase undergraduate participation in CS research, increase retention and graduation rates, and aggressively disseminate the implemented model and other exemplary models. One unique aspect of the project is a focus on preparing students for global challenges of the 21st century by enriching the academic preparation of the students with: (i) workshops on effective communication and ethics, (ii) presentations on leadership, creativity, adaptation and innovation, (iii) exposure to multiple cultures, and (iv) a course on entrepreneurship and intellectual property. Another unique aspect of this project is the use of gaming and animated story-telling as a community building and peer mentoring activity. In addition the project includes mentoring through peers and faculty, and outreach efforts, accomplished through workshops at high schools and community colleges. CS students are projected to be in demand for the next decade and this project seeks to graduate well-trained CS professionals who will become leaders in this field. Through formative and summative evaluation the investigators will seek to broaden the knowledge base regarding how the student activities addressing global challenges of the 21st century contribute to the goals of increasing retention and graduation rates, and the circumstances under which success occurs.</AbstractNarration>

Of the 38 graduates who responded to our surveys, 34 are employed in the computer field, two are self-employed in the computer field, and four are pursuing graduate studies in computer science (two of them concurrently with a job). One of the students who started graduate study in 2018 has finished his MS degree with a thesis in computer science at the University of Houston in 2019 and is now continuing for a Ph.D. in computer science with a cybersecurity focus. He has joined the NSF-supported CyberCorps program. His MS research led to a peer-reviewed paper on phishing website detection, a serious threat plaguing the Internet economy and society in the US.</p> <p>The education of all S-STEM students, whether they received the need-based scholarship or not, was enriched with academic and field activities including orientation/welcome to the program, mentoring, seminars, career fairs, Code RED hackathon, a new entrepreneurship course taught by a grant Co-PI, and field trips to computer companies/agencies including NASA and the HPE office/manufacturing facility in Houston. Other computer science students also benefitted from many of these activities.</p> <p>At least one of the S-STEM students received an award at the Code RED Hackathon. All the students were encouraged to do, whenever feasible, at least one summer internship in industry and one summer of research, e.g., in the NSF research experience for undergraduates (REU) programs. &nbsp;At least five S-STEM students participated in REU programs, four of them in the computer science department at the University of Houston. At least two of these students have co-authored four peer-reviewed papers in computer science conferences and workshops. One of them received the Honorable Mention award at the prestigious, nation-wide CRA 2019 competition. He is now working in Microsoft as a Cybersecurity Engineer.</p> <p>The S-STEM grant led to the creation of a new course Entrepreneurship course for S-STEM and CS students. This has become a regular course. The faculty investigators on the S-STEM grant have published over 15 peer-reviewed papers in leading journals and conferences and six workshop proceedings. The grant led to three educational research publications and several presentations in which motivations of and influences on S-STEM students were investigated. These three publications have received more than 40 citations according to Google Scholar. One of these papers received an Outstanding Paper Award from the American Educational Research Association?s Narrative Research Special Interest Group (paper in Teaching and Teacher Education Journal in 2018). Two video digital stories were also created and disseminated. A website was created for the project. &nbsp;</p> <p>The 51 students who were selected represented a &nbsp;diverse population of one mixed race, five African American, 12 White, and 25 Asian American students has benefitted from this grant (ten students did not report their race and ethnicity).
