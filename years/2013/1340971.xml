<AbstractNarration>Georgetown is upgrading high-end networking across the main and medical center campuses to support science faculty. These faculty routinely collaborate across the campuses, within and across disciplines, and with colleagues at other universities, at-large private research facilities, and National Labs as they research complex physics, genomics, functional magnetic resonance imaging, Internet search indexing, and other computationally-intensive topics.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;These network improvements enable end-to-end 10 Gbps connectivity among GU's science buildings, campus backbone, off-campus data center, Mid-Atlantic Crossroads (MAX) Gigapop, and Internet2. 1Gbps or 10Gbps connections are provided to select locations within the buildings.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The ability to share and analyze large datasets, and disseminate findings advances scientific and technological understanding. Improvements in GU's science facilities have led to increased applications and enrollments of undergraduate and graduate STEM students. This infrastructure is designed to further bolster STEM research and education at GU. Investments during the past 5 years have doubled the size of faculty in the Computer Science Department; built a new building for biology, chemistry, and physics; and enhanced other infrastructure to support research, including support of a computational core facility, creating an isolated security research network, and increased data storage capacity. This award is enabling over 300 Main Campus and Medical Center researchers to collaborate and broadly share their work on campus, connect equipment, enhance their ability to collaborate with researchers off campus, as well as benefit extensive basic sciences research on the contiguous medical campus.</AbstractNarration>

Researchers now have end-to-end 10Gbps connectivity among the science buildings, campus backbone and Internet2 (via CAAREN). "Before and after" tests have shown a range of 4 to 7 times increase over prior connectivity speeds. The enhanced network and increased speeds enable many researchers to connect directly to compute and storage resources with less "friction," as well as enabling them to use centrally-managed compute and storage resources. This provides GU scientists and IT support staff a higher quality and more affordable environment for research.The network upgrades made under this award make the creation of a Science DMZ feasible. GU received a NSF CC*IIE Award in 2014 (#1440743) to implement a Science DMZ. This is the logical next step for improving the infrastructure for researchers.   Science  researchersÆ ability to share and analyze large datasets, and  disseminate findings advances scientific and technological  understanding. Research enhanced by better networking includes:      Science researchersÆ ability to share and analyze large datasets, and disseminate findings advances scientific and technological understanding. Research enhanced by better networking includes:       Computer Science:  a) Large-scale Computer Forensics that supports law enforcement, intelligence, and organization investigations into violations of law or policy. b) Building community and capacity for large-scale, data-intensive research in Forced Migration Studies   Biology: Utilize large, complex network datasets, for example, dynamic networks of daily individual-level livestock movements across an entire country, spanning the course of many years, creating large computational models with them such as statistical network fitting using MCMC approaches for the purposes of studying infectious disease dynamics at individual and population scales.   Neuroscience: a) Accessing functional and structural brain imaging data created in GeorgetownÆs Center for Functional and Molecular Imaging (Medical Center) from multiple labs on the Main Campus, enabling collaboration on the analysis of large fMRI and EEG data sets. b) Brain Plasticity and Recovery. This unique interdisciplinary center harnesses GeorgetownÆs strengths in the sciences and humanities, including linguistics, foreign languages, psychology, and philosophy as well as computer science and biology to conduct innovative research on the mechanisms of learning, development, and neural plasticity in the human brain.  Biomedical Informatics: strives to enable better diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities through information technology via targeted analyses of patient molecular data. Work includes creating a new generation of data management and mining systems to support diverse needs from personalized clinical medicine, translational and population research involving molecular and genetic outcomes, many of which involve Big Data.         Broader Impacts: Faster networking infratructure enables more collaboration between and among researcher on and off campus. STEM education is enhanced as research is enhanced. Georgetown now sponsors a chapter of "Women Who Code" with over 125 active members, encouraging women and non-Computer Science majors to learn programming.
