<AbstractNarration>The proposed technology is a methodology to assess alternative infrastructure management strategies based on project cost, system performance and estimates of greenhouse emissions. The supporting methods include stochastic analysis, life cycle assessment and Monte Carlo simulation based approaches. The technology is designed to address the problems of reducing life cycle emissions of civil infrastructure systems, helping agencies provide a consistent level of service, while optimally using available resources for construction, maintenance and rehabilitation. This is particularly significant given the twin challenges of climate change, and ongoing shortfalls in state and federal budget appropriations for public works. Finally, the underlying theory and methods are mathematically sophisticated and data intensive, and not easy for decision-makers to implement without significant training. The proposed technology promises efficient implementation by providing an innovative product/service that is reliable and intuitive, and has a friendly and easy to use interface.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Civil infrastructure systems are critical to socioeconomic success. Services such as access to clean drinking water, efficient sewer and waste management, easy mobility and access to multiple modes of transportation provide the backbone for multiple supply chains, besides supporting a healthy standard of living. Challenges due to climate change, aging infrastructure, and the impact of the economic crisis on local and state budgets are hurting the efficient delivery of these services. By providing support to decision-makers the proposed technology is likely to have a significant impact on maintaining and managing infrastructure sustainably.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The I-Corps project went towards  supporting the starting of a company commercrializing previous research  completed by the PI.  Intellectual Merits:  The experience of starting Life  Cycle Solutions, LLC - a startup, that deals  with public data and provides  technology based solutions to empower  the public and decision-makers,  through greater transparency - while not  unique, is part of a social  entrepreneurial space that is growing. As a startup that is geared towards improving public infrastructure services, and is not  based off "product" (app, or experience, or  bio-device) sales, companies like Life Cycle Solutions  get limited attention from venture  capitalists, and therefore remains  relatively less examined. Hence, this  experience may contribute to a better understanding  of this space.  The outcomes in the area  of civil infrastructure  management are as follows:  1. The first major product released by the company, Life Cycle  Solutions is the website: http://www.iriexplorer.com - It is critical to  empowering decision-makers at the DOT level, academic researchers and  engineers in consulting firms to directly access long term pavement  performance data and visualize and run statitical comparisons on. This  can support prioritization of network maintenance to deliver smoother  pavements, which in turn can reduce the fuel consumption of trucks and  passenger vehicles.  2. Life Cycle Solutions has also engaged municipal clients, developing pipe infrastructure deterioration models,  to support maintenance scheduling decisions to improve infrastructure management and promote better usage  of public funds.    Broader Societal Impacts:   Outcomes from the services  provided by Life Cycle Solutions will help improve level of service, and reduce the environmental  impact of infrastructue systems and services.    The following may also be considered as impacts to society:  1. Economic gains due to starting Life Cycle Solutions, LLC: 2-4 jobs  have been created in the IT/Engineering sector in Houghton, MI.  2. The services provided by Life Cycle Solutions aim to improve the delivery of social infrastructure systems.        Last Modified: 04/15/2015       Submitted by: Amlan Mukherjee]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
