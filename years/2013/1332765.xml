<AbstractNarration>Long-term rock behavior is important for understanding the degradation and failure of rock slopes, underground excavations, dam and bridge foundations, national monuments, and other critical rock structures. Natural underground caverns are an ideal geologic analog for studying long-term rock behavior, because of the relatively constant climate and the preservation of rockfalls that accumulate on the floor of the cave over thousands of years.  In this study, the evolution of rock degradation and failure in the Kartchner caverns in southern Arizona will be investigated, using a unique combination of radiometric dating and state-of-the-art geomechanics techniques.  First of all, to date the evolution of rockfall that has occurred in the cave over the last 100,000 years, both U-TH and Carbon dating will be used.  Because Kartchner is a live cave, speleothems occur on many of the rockfall blocks, and small cores will be taken at the base of these speleothems for dating.  Secondly, a new generation ground-based LIDAR scanner will be used to obtain detailed three-dimensional point clouds of the cavern geometry and also of the rockfall fragments on the floor of the cave.  The detailed point clouds along with the radiometric data will be used to reconstruct the cave geometry over the past 100,000 years. Finally, three-dimensional modeling will be conducted using the Abaqus finite element program. A time-dependent damage model based on subcritical crack growth will be implemented in Abaqus to simulate cave collapse evolution. Seismic loading of the cave will also be considered, since southern Arizona is susceptible to small to medium levels of seismic hazard.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Kartchner caverns provides a unique opportunity to understand long-term rock behavior, and the results should be of great interest to rock mechanics scientists and engineers as well as karst and cave specialists.  The results of this research will be used to develop and validate long-term strength models or subcritical crack growth models to correctly predict long-term rock behavior.  Kartchner caverns is also an ideal platform to communicate geomechanics to the general public, with public access to 2.4 miles of passages and attracting over 150,000 visitors each year.  As part of this research, an interactive geomechanics display case will be established in the Kartchner visitor center, and cave tour guides will provide geomechanics information on their daily tours.  The results of this research will hopefully provide new findings in the areas of cave breakdown and sinkhole development.  The results of this research might reveal the timing of past seismic events in southern Arizona, and therefore will be of interest to seismologists and also geologists studying Quaternary faulting.</AbstractNarration>

Some key results are given below.  Samples of the Escabrosa Limestone that make up the caverns were obtained and laboratory testing was conducted to determine the time-dependent properties. The time-dependence of brittle rocks such as limestone occur through a process called subcritical crack growth.  The subcritical crack growth properties for Escabrosa limestone were determined in all three modes (tension, in-plane shear, out of plane shear). It is most common for only the mode I (tension) properties to be measured, and this is only the second time that the subcritical properties in all three modes were measured in a rock, even though the time-dependent shear properties are very important for phenomena such as earthquakes, landslides, and sinkholes.  A point cloud is a dense set of three dimensional coordinates that describe in detail the surface of an object, and point clouds are produced by Lidar scanners, drone photogrammetry, and other instruments.  A high-resolution point cloud of the three Kartchner caverns and the surface above the caverns were made using Lidar scanning (underground) and drone photogrammetry (surface).  The result is a 3D model containing the three caverns and the surface. This 3D model is imported into the 3D predictive numerical model to predict the time-dependent behavior of the caverns. This model can also be used to ?fly through? the cave and study its geology and speleothems.  Algorithms have also been developed to automatically extract important rock characteristics from the point cloud such as fracture spacing, block size, fracture orientation, and fracture aperture.   A 3D numerical predictive model of the Kartchner caverns was developed using the Abaqus finite element model and utilizing the lab and field properties that were measured.  This model can account for the complex geometry of the caverns from the point clouds, mechanical forces such as gravity, tectonic stresses and seismic activity, hydraulic forces due to the groundwater, and time-dependence due to subcritical crack growth.  A damage model was developed in Abaqus, which keeps track of the subcritical cracking that is occurring at different locations in the ground.  In the immediate roof and walls of the caverns, for example, the highest stresses occur, resulting in the highest amount of damage and the occurrence of rockfall. This model helps to understand how rock failure occurs over time, and how rock failure can be prevented.  Finally, laboratory and field studies were conducted to develop techniques for determining the relative age of rock failure events that occur in the caverns.  An advantage of studying an underground cavern is that it preserves large rock blocks that fall from the roof and walls, referred to as breakdown or rockfall. The surface of the cave continually changes over time due to weathering and microbial activity, and since newly formed surfaces from rockfall will have fresh surfaces with little weathering and biomass, they can be differentiated from older surfaces.  Testing was conducted to quantify these effects that include hyperspectral imaging, microscopy, and DNA extraction measurements of biomass buildup.  From these results, techniques have been developed to differentiate surfaces with different ages.  These results are complex because the changes occurring at a particular location depend on geology, water chemistry, and the surface location relative to dripping water sources.
