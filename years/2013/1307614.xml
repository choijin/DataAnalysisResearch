<AbstractNarration>This collaborative proposal develops a new method of integrated design of exposure and excitation of electromagnetic (EM) fields in the UHF and low microwave frequency range for next-generation magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at high magnetic fields (B&gt;3T). High magnetic fields improve the signal-to-noise ratio in MRI, and are accompanied by increased RF frequencies, which can lead to propagating modes inside the bore with a patient. For example, at 7T, the required RF frequency is in the 300MHz range, while a bore that fits a human is at least 60cm in diameter, making it above the cutoff frequency for at least one mode of the bore viewed as a waveguide, when loaded with the body. The travelling waves can potentially be advantageous in terms of a more comfortable environment for patients, larger field of view, imaging to-date MRI inaccessible areas, and enabling new spatial encoding schemes and a variety of mode sensitivity profiles. It is important, however, to be able to design the modes in the bore for better excitation field profile uniformity and control of power exposure to the body.  &lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The principal goal of the proposed research is development of design methodologies for RF field profiles and associated cavity wall surface impedances and excitation probes, enabled by extremely fast and accurate full-wave higher order computational EM simulations of large body-loaded cavities. Several of the designs will be fabricated, characterized, and transitioned to clinical and research collaborators at Harvard University for imaging research. The specific issues to be addressed are: (a) Understanding the fundamental principles and limitations of radio-frequency electromagnetic field profile design for next-generation travelling-wave, high-field MRI; (b) Developing an engineering approach for modification of surface impedances in body-loaded bore cavities, enabled by extremely fast and reliable simulation techniques; (c) Solving the problem of proper field profile excitation (probe) design integrated with loaded cavity; (d) Evaluation and control of specific absorption rates inside the phantom, animal, or human; and  (e) Implementing the designs for several clinical and research MRI machines operated by collaborators at Harvard University (these implementations are not supported by the proposed grant). The project will investigate periodic or quasi-periodic surface impedance structures in the form of printed resonant structures or three-dimensional dielectric-metal artificial surface impedances, and different types of excitations combining wire dipoles and loops, patch-antenna probes with coaxial feeds, and cavity backed slot exciters (multiple probes for different modes will be incorporated with switching circuits). Other (non-MRI) applications of the resulting research in loaded multi-mode cavities include areas from low-power wireless power delivery in closed spaces to high-power advanced smart microwave ovens. Broader impacts of the proposed work on basic science and engineering support the nation's science and technology advantage. The anticipated results will provide a new method of medical imaging with more comfort for patients, and an increased field of view, sensitivity, and functionality. Broader impacts on society are especially warranted by growing needs for such improved medical diagnostic tool. Because of the potential to change the way medical diagnostics using MRI is done in the longer term, the proposal may be considered transformative in its nature. Multi-disciplinary education at the undergraduate and graduate levels, spanning areas of high-frequency analog circuit design, EM simulations, bio-EM, and metrology, will make an impact on two top institutions in the state of Colorado, strengthening the existing core competency. The PIs at both institutions have been active in outreach, and  related to this proposed work  plan to add several new modules to the existing K-12 outreach, with hundreds of middle-school children on "Electric Field Trip" visits. A recruiting effort at all levels focusing on underrepresented groups will continue to enrich the educational environments. Collaborations related to medical applications with Harvard and Intermountain Neuroimaging Consortium, international collaboration with XLIM, University of Limoges, in France, and industry partnership (NXP) are evidenced by no-cost technical participation and insertion into clinical studies, student exchanges, and hardware donations.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The goal of this project is to redesign hardware for high magnetic field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is desired for improved imaging resolutions. For magnetic flux density values above the clinically approved 3T, the resonant frequency for hydrogen atoms is in the UHF range, and the human size bore with body loading becomes an over-moded waveguide with standing waves that create nulls and result in poor images. We have redesigned the hardware of the MRI bore to enable higher uniformity and increase signal, therefore enabling improved images. The project demonstrated functional designs for 7T (262MHz) and 10.5T (447 MHz) MRI human-size bore machines, and for 16.5T (698 MHz) small-animal research. Full-wave electromagnetic simulations using two different types of modeling validate the designs and correlate well with experimentally obtained images. Measurements were performed with uniform Siemens phantoms of human tissues, as well as NIST nonuniform standards and natural non-uniform phantoms, such as pineapple. In all cases, the hardware we developed improves field uniformity and signal-to-noise ratio of the images. &nbsp;The research demonstrates that at high magnetic fields and accompanying high Larmor frequencies, it is possible to redesign the MRI hardware in a way that improves the obtained images. This is done by designing new types of RF excitations, as well as by designs that modify the electromagnetic boundary conditions in the human-size MRI bore. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/29/2017<br>      Modified by: Zoya&nbsp;Popovic</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1307614/1307614_10249478_1509314145758_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1307614/1307614_10249478_1509314145758_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="16.5T MRI experimental setup"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1307614/1307614_10249478_1509314145758_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="16.5T MRI experimental setup"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Photograph and geometry of 16.5T animal research MRI experimental setup.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Univ. of Colorado Boulder</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Zoya&nbsp;Popovic</div> <div class="imageTitle">16.5T MRI experimental setup</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1307614/1307614_10249478_1509315033129_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1307614/1307614_10249478_1509315033129_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="16.5T MRI patch probe"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1307614/1307614_10249478_1509315033129_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="16.5T MRI patch probe"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Geometry and operation (current intensity) of the patch probe designed at 698MHz for the 16.5T MRI.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Patrick Bluem, Univ. of Colorado</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Zoya&nbsp;Popovic</div> <div class="imageTitle">16.5T MRI patch probe</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1307614/1307614_10249478_1509315140654_Fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1307614/1307614_10249478_1509315140654_Fig3--rgov-800width.jpg" title="7T MRI setup"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1307614/1307614_10249478_1509315140654_Fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="7T MRI setup"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The setup for 7T MRI experiments with two patch probes on two sides of the Siemens phantom.
