<AbstractNarration>The Network and Distributed System Security (NDSS) Symposium is held each February in San Diego, CA. It is a three day conference that brings together innovative and forward thinking members of the Internet community who design, develop, exploit, and deploy the technologies that define network and distributed system security.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This grant provides funding to assist US-based graduate and undergraduate students to attend this event. Participation in symposia like the NDSS are a critical part of these students' educational experiences by providing them the opportunity to interact with senior researchers and to be exposed to leading-edge work in the field. The support provided by this grant enable the participation of students who would otherwise be unable to attend the NDSS.</AbstractNarration>
