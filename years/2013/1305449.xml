They will determine whether well-ordered hexagonal arrays of nanodots can be formed by bombarding an elemental solid while concurrently depositing impurities, and develop a theory that explains why nearly regular hexagonal arrays of nanorods form during ion-assisted deposition of some binary materials. Methods that may reduce or prevent the formation of defects in the patterns produced by ion bombardment will be developed and evaluated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outreach to K-12 students and the education of undergraduate and graduate students are important aspects of the project.

It supports theoretical research and educational activities focused on advancing our understanding of the nanoscale patterns that emerge when a solid surface is bombarded with a broad ion beam. These nanoscale patterns have features on small length scales some million times smaller than the head of a pin. A plethora of patterns can be produced, including nanoscale mounds arranged in hexagonal arrays of remarkable and unforeseen regularity. The spontaneous emergence of these patterns is not just fascinating in its own right: ion bombardment has the potential to become a cost-effective method to rapidly fabricate large-area nanostructures. This project will yield insight into how these patterns form, and so will aid in the optimization of this tool. The sponsored research will therefore contribute to the burgeoning field of nanotechnology, which promises to transform fields as diverse as medicine, energy, and electronics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outreach to K-12 student and the education of undergraduate and graduate students are important aspects of the project.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ It is widely believed that the rapidly developing field of nanotechnology will lead to advances that will transform fields as diverse as medicine, energy, and electronics.  A crucial step in nanotechnology is the fabrication of very small structures.  In our research, we studied a method of making patterns on solid surfaces in which the pattern elements are at the nanoscale, i.e., they have sizes smaller than a thousandth of the width of a human hair.   In a typical experiment in our field, a broad ion beam is directed at an initially flat solid surface.  The incident ions, all of which travel with the same velocity before striking the solid, knock atoms off the surface.  Surprisingly, the surface often does not remain flat as it is eroded --- instead a nanoscale pattern emerges.  Patterns that have been observed experimentally include ripples and relatively regular arrangements of mounds (so-called "nanodots"). Understanding how patterns develop spontaneously without a design provided by humans is a key intellectual challenge that was addressed in our research.  Ion bombardment has the potential to become a cost-effective method to rapidly fabricate nanoscale patterns over broad areas. However, if the method is to become truly useful, a more complete understanding of it is needed so that it can be controlled and optimized.  The PI and co-PI developed a theory that explains the genesis of the disordered hexagonal arrays of nanodots that can result from normal-incidence ion bombardment of a binary compound. To facilitate experimental testing of the theory, we generalized it to oblique-incidence bombardment in the sponsored research. Using analytical methods and computer simulations, we demonstrated that a novel "dots-on-ripples" topography can emerge for nonzero angles of ion incidence.  The experimental observation of patterns of this kind would lend strong support to our theory.  The presence of numerous defects in the patterns that are typically produced is a second serious obstacle that must be surmounted before the full potential of ion-induced patterning can be realized.  In work supported by the grant, we proposed and studied three different practical methods to reduce the number of defects in these patterns or to eliminate them altogether.  First, our computer simulations showed that nearly defect-free ripples can emerge if the sample is rocked periodically while it is being bombarded.  Secondly, normally ripples are produced by bombarding a solid with a beam of noble gas ions.  Our simulations strongly suggested that if the ions are not noble gas ions, the ripples that develop can have a very high degree of order.  This was confirmed by our experimental collaborators in India.  Finally, we found that the density of defects in the hexagonal arrays of nanodots produced by ion bombardment of binary compounds can be dramatically reduced by utilizing tailor-made initial surfaces.  In another part of the sponsored research, we developed methods to gauge how ordered the patterns produced by ion bombardment are. In the future, our methods could be used to evaluate our three schemes to increase order and to find ways in which they could be improved.  The novel methods of characterizing order that we developed are also applicable to a wide range of other pattern-forming systems.
