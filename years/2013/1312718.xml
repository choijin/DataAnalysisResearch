<AbstractNarration>The technology developed through this project is a specific way of using speech recognition to "trigger" required and necessary action from a computing system, using only speech instead of push-to-talk buttons. Although speech recognition software is widely available, this technology has the potential to advance the industry. The project team has worked on this technology for over a decade. The proposed system will be used as a software tool-kit for software developers developing applications that fall into one of two categories: 1) the access to the system is restricted or; 2) access to the system is prohibited.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This software tool-kit has the potential to make an impact in helping directly or indirectly impaired users such as quadriplegics, surgeons, operators wearing HAZMAT suits, remotely operated vehicles, etc., where the same operation would be very difficult and/or very expensive to perform or not possible at all.</AbstractNarration>
