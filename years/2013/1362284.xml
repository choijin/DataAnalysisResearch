<AbstractNarration>This award supports fundamental research on processing-structure-property relationships of conductive inks for 3D printing of metals at or near room temperature. The basis for this work is the recent discovery and demonstration that liquid metals can be printed into free-standing structures that are stabilized mechanically by a surface oxide.   The research will focus on new conductive inks that can be dispensed at modest temperatures but solidify into solid, mechanically robust metallic structures after the structures are printed. The research team will study the formulation, dispensing, and solidification of these inks using a number of characterization techniques to elucidate the solidification process.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research results will provide the knowledge and understanding necessary to meet a critical need to develop metallic components for additive manufacturing (3D printing). Additive manufacturing enables users to directly design, prototype, and print objects on demand.  It is considered a transformative technology that is championed by President Obama to help keep America competitive in the manufacturing sector. Although metals are important materials for electronics, optics, and structural materials, current technologies to 3D print metals are expensive and rely on high temperatures.  The research will enable for the first time 3D printing of metals at or near room temperature. In addition to supporting a graduate student, the project will involve undergraduate researchers recruited from a diverse group of engineering students at North Carolina State (NC State). The research team will partner with the NC State Hunt Library and the NC State Laboratory for Additive Manufacturing and Logistics to contribute to a number of integrated outreach activities designed to expose a broader audience to the science and technology of 3D printing.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[Motivation: The ultimate goal of this project is to pattern solid metallic structures at or near room temperature.  The ability to take raw materials and process them into useful objects is the basis of manufacturing and thus important for our society. Metals are a particularly important class of materials, with applications as structural elements and as electrical and thermal conductors.  A variety of techniques exist to pattern metals, but most of them require large temperatures, specialized equipment, and / or wasteful subtractive techniques.  Summary:  In this work, we explored the use of gallium as a metal that can be patterned at room temperature in new ways.  Gallium, a liquid with a melting point of 30 C, has low toxicity, essentially zero vapor pressure, and low viscosity.  Importantly, it reacts with air to form a thin native oxide shell. This solid shell allows the metal to be patterned into non-spherical shapes because the oxide shell helps mechanically stabilize the metal.  In this project, we explored the ability to print this metal in three ways: in its pristine state, mixed with elastomer (to create stretchable conductors), and mixed with solid metal particles to create pastes.  These pastes are interesting because they can flow initially, but eventually the elements of the paste interdiffuse and form a new, solid intermetallic phase.  In other words, pastes can be patterned at room temperature and then solidify to maintain that shape.  We explored the ability to form these pastes, the ability to pattern these pastes, the rheological properties of the pastes, and the physical properties of the materials.  We found that imprinting the pastes to form microtextured surfaces was easier than trying to dispense them for printing due to the tendency of the particles to clog the nozzle.  By using particles suspended in silicone, we were able to overcome these issues, although the resulting conductors are stretchable and not rigid, which has its own benefits. Intellectual Merit:  We utilized a suite of characterization tools (rheology, x-ray diffraction, thermal gravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, microscopy) to study the fundamental properties of liquid metal, liquid metal pastes composed of copper particles mixed with gallium, and metal pastes consisting of liquid metal mixed with silicone.  In the case of the liquid metal studies, we found that the three most popular liquid metals (gallium, eutectic gallium indium, and galinstan) have similar rheological properties.  They all have low bulk viscosity (water-like), but form a thin (~3 nm) oxide shell that has an identical modulus and yield stress since, to a first approximation, the oxides on all three metals consist of gallium oxide.  This finding suggests all three metals should print identically.  In collaboration with AFRL, we studied the way the metals print by using a shear-based method and found that the gap between the nozzle and substrate, along with the wetting between the metal and substrate are the most important parameters.   We also added copper particles to gallium to form pastes. We found that reducing the particles promotes mixing and that the resulting paste has a shelf life of less than an hour. Although we were able to print the metal, the reproducibility was challenged by the tendency of the Cu particles to jam.  A variety of approaches were explored to suspend the particles.  Ultimately, to address this challenge, we also explored the use of particles suspended in elastomer to print stretchable conductors. Broader Impacts:  The major impact of this work is a new approach to pattern metals at room temperature based on new fundamental insights.  Metals have desirable properties for a wide-variety of applications, but patterning them in an additive manner is challenging to do.  The most popular approach to 3D print metal uses lasers to sinter particles of metal under vacuum, at elevated temperatures, using exceedingly expensive equipment.  The approach here, in contrast, is done at room temperature using common equipment that is orders of magnitude less expensive.  The ability to pattern metals at room temperature allows them to be combined readily with temperature sensitive materials, such as polymers, to create multi-functional 3D printed structures.  Examples include reinforcing structures, embedded sensors and electronics, and thermal dissipation components. This project has established a new collaboration between the groups of the PI and the co-PI, as well as external collaborations with Air Force Research Labs and with the Hsiao group at NC State. The project supported multiple graduate students, including a female PhD student and a Hispanic PhD student, and enabled outreach activities through participation in NC State NanoDays while having visitors interact with a joystick-enabled 3D printer of liquid metal built our lab.
