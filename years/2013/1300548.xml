<AbstractNarration>The comprehensive goal of this project is to achieve a conceptual understanding of the local invariants for noncommutative spaces and of the way the local and global properties interact and condition each other. Of primary interest is the concept of intrinsic curvature, which lies at the very core of the classical geometry but remained for a long time intangible in noncommutative geometry. One of the main thrusts of the present project is to build on the latest advances in this direction, which led to the uncovering of the nonunimodular character of the conformal geometry of the noncommutative torus. Other themes concern the continuation of the development of new techniques for computing Hopf algebra cyclic cohomology, and applying them to the determination of explicit expressions for the transverse characteristic classes of a large class of noncommutative spaces occurring in geometry and number theory;  the investigation of the invariants called higher indices for manifolds with boundary in order to elucidate their role in detecting geometric and topological properties of these spaces; the exploration of the potential arithmetic implications of the obtained results in connection with several open problems at the interface between noncommutative geometry and number theory.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In noncommutative geometry, the paradigm of space as a manifold formed of points labeled by numerical coordinates is replaced by one of a much more general nature, in which the coordinates are operator-valued and may no longer commute, as in quantum physics. This new foundational principle allows for a substantial enrichment of the class of objects that can be treated as geometric spaces and has already found spectacular applications in both mathematics and theoretical physics. While the most basic algebraic, topological, and analytical tools for the global treatment of such spaces have been already successfully developed, the local treatment, and even the meaning of locality in the absence of the deeply ingrained spatial conceptualization, is still very much under construction. Its truly conceptual understanding, which makes the primary object of this project, engenders new applications to several central fields of contemporary mathematics and is quite likely of considerable relevance for the latest developments in particle and high-energy physics.</AbstractNarration>

In most areas of mathematics a space consists of an organized collection of points labeled by numerical parameters. In noncommutative geometry a space is allowed to have operator-valued coordinates, as in quantum physics. Unlike the multiplication of numbers, the order in which operators are multiplied does matter. This distinctive feature of potential `noncommutativity? prevents the truly noncommutative spaces from affording points, lines, or any kind of visual configurations. Nevertheless, the basic algebraic-topological apparatus used in treatment of the usual spaces has been successfully upgraded to the noncommutative framework. Purely geometric aspects however, such as the `curvature? of a noncommutative space, remained elusive until very recently. A long term collaborative effort, in which the PI has been involved, succeeded a few years ago in computing the `modular? (or `conformal?) curvature of the noncommutative torus, which is a space modeled on the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. One of the main outcomes of the present project is showing that the modular curvature is independent of the way in which the natural `Heisenberg coordinates? are chosen.  The noncommutative torus is but an example of a `space of leaves?  parametrizing the solutions of a system of differential equations on a manifold. Another outcome of the project is the advancement of the appropriate theory of `characteristic classes? which allows to compute global invariants of the most general spaces of leaves.  Finally, the present project has generated both the problems and the means of solving them for the doctoral dissertations of three graduate students, who completed their Ph.D. work under the supervision of the PI.
