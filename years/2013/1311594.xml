<AbstractNarration>In the face of climate change, do short-term responses of societies undermine the long-term resilience of ecosystems and natural resources? To answer this question, this study assesses the impacts of cropping adaptation strategies on groundwater quality and soil health in a semi-arid agro-ecosystem in Northwest India. Farming communities in this region employ two cropping adaptation strategies for dealing with increasing monsoon variability attributable to climate change: (1) intensification in irrigation or (2) crop switching. While both of these responses are economically adaptive over the short term, they may lead to long-term degradation of groundwater quality and soil health. Preliminary data suggest that increasing use of groundwater may already be leading to falling groundwater tables, the intrusion of saltwater into aquifers, and the depletion of soil nutrients. The impacts of crop switching are less well known. This work will identify the relationship between the intensification of irrigation and crop switching on groundwater (quantity and quality) and soil health (soil organic carbon, soil nitrogen, and pH). These analyses will elucidate possible long-term impacts of adaptation strategies on ecosystem resources, and help identify whether these adaptation strategies are sustainable over time.&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;Though millions of communities have a strong and coupled relationship with climate and the environment, few studies have attempted to understand the feedback between human adaptation and the long-term functioning of ecosystems; this project will address this gap. Furthermore, the data collected for this project will provide 400 farmers with measures of their soil health and water quality, which will help identify deficiencies in their resource base and may allow them to tailor cropping decisions to improve yields. The results of this work will also be shared with state-level researchers and policy makers in Gujarat as well as the broader public via a short documentary film.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project examined how smallholder farmers in India are adapting to increased variability in monsoon rainfall, and what the environmental and longer-term impacts are of these adaptation strategies. Specifically by analyzing a three-year panel time series of 750 farmers, we found that farmers in northwest India are primarily adapting to a delayed monsoon onset in two ways. One is to plant the same crop type, but increase the amount of groundwater irrigation used to water these crops. The second is to switch to more drought-tolerant crops that require less irrigation to provide high yields. By analyzing yield and profit data, we found that increasing the amount of irrigation used is associated with higher profits compared to those who did not increase irrigation use. Furthermore, switching crop type was associated with higher profits for the poorest farmer who did not have secure access to irrigation. While these strategies seem to be beneficial in the short-term, anecdotal evidence suggests that increased irrigation use is leading to falling groundwater tables and decreased soil health. Thus, to quantify the environmental impacts of these adaptation strategies, we collected 300 soil samples from the farmers in our social survey. By combining theories, methods, and data from the social and natural sciences, our work shows that increased irrigation use is leading to lower quality soils (as measured by increased soil salinity). This suggests that while increasing irrigation may be a beneficial short-term strategy to adapt to rainfall variability, it may not be an adaptive strategy over medium to longer time scales as soil quality is becoming increasingly degraded. This work highlights the need to examine multiple outcomes of agricultural decision-making, as strategies that seemed optimal considering yield and profit were non-optimal considering environmental impacts and sustainability. Furthermore, our work also highlights the need to consider the longer-term implications of adaptation strategies, and not only the short-term benefits. Our work showed that what may appear to be the most adaptive strategy in the short-term may not be the most adaptive strategy over longer time scales.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/27/2015<br>      Modified by: Meha&nbsp;Jain</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
