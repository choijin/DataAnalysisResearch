<AbstractNarration>The Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms B Program supports Professor James K. McCusker of the Department of Chemistry at Michigan State University for the design and development of chemical systems geared toward determining whether there exists a cause-and-effect relationship between the physical and/or photophysical properties of molecules and their innate spin properties, and if so, to what extent that connection can be exploited in order to manipulate the chemical reactivity of molecular systems. Building on the successful development of a model that led to the first experimental demonstration of spin control of dipolar energy transfer, specific projects being pursued are (1) elaboration of this model to determine the limits of its applicability with regard to FÃ¶rster theory, (2) extension of this model to exchange energy transfer (i.e., Dexter), (3) the influence of zero-field spin polarization on photo-induced electron transfer processes in spin-coupled transition metal clusters, and (4) the synthesis and characterization of spin-coupled metal-semiquinone complexes molecules in which a combination of synthetic design and theory is being used to manipulate intramolecular spin polarization. In all of these projects, the research is being carried out through a confluence of organic and inorganic synthetic chemistries, steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopic measurements including (but not limited to) emission, ultrafast time-resolved absorption, and electron paramagnetic resonance, as well as theoretical efforts that include density functional theory calculations to explore the incorporation of spin and spin polarization into existing theories to describe electron and energy transfer dynamics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The concepts underpinning this research represent a new area of study concerning the light-induced properties of molecules: this project will provide important insights into an aspect of the electronic structure of an enormous class of compounds for which there is little experimental information presently available. Compounds possessing unique spin (angular momentum of electrons) and/or magnetic properties, particularly those whose properties can be manipulated synthetically in a predictable manner, hold promise as the basis for molecular-based electronic materials. The knowledge gained through this work can provide a foundation for the rational design of molecular systems for next-generation electronic and photo-electronic devices for information storage, energy conversion, and catalysis. The individuals involved in this work, which include men and women at both the undergraduate and graduate level, are receiving broad-based training in synthetic chemistry, state-of-the-art spectroscopic methodology, the study of the magnetic properties of molecular systems, as well as advanced theoretical methods.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    Electron spin is a fundamental property of Nature. The distinctive color of gold, for example, is generally regarded as having its origins in the same relativistic effects that Einstein used to help us understand the universe around us and likely constitutes a person?s first (unwitting) exposure to this phenomenon. The field of magnetism centers on the response of a material to an applied field or as the result of interactions within the material to produce permanent magnets in zero field. Indeed, the magnetic properties of materials derive mainly from the magnetic dipole created by the spin angular momentum of the electron, thus making magnetism another common source for widely held perceptions of electron spin and its consequences. In the physical sciences, the concept of electron spin is one that is broadly familiar regardless of one?s area of specialization. Nature's propensity to conserve spin (or, more generally, angular momentum) - which is a central idea driving the research supported by this NSF grant - is widely manifest in settings ranging from astrophysics, where the idea of coupled momenta can be used to infer the presence of satellites, to the very familiar image of a figure skater spinning faster and faster as he/she draws their arms into their body.  Finally, the emerging fields of spintronics and quantum computing seek to utilize spin as a means for retaining and/or transmitting large amounts of information. In all of these cases, an implicit connection between spin and its phenomenological effects lie at the heart of a range of physical properties manifest at both the microscopic and macroscopic level.     This notion, namely the effect of spin and spin polarization on the physical and chemical properties of molecules, constitutes the conceptual underpinning of our research effort.
