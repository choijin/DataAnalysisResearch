<AbstractNarration>This collaborative project will produce a survey of hundreds of disks around young stellar objects (YSOs) in regions of massive star formation (including Orion) using observations obtained at radio, millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths using the Very Large Array (VLA) and Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) telescopes.  The investigators will use these telescopes to construct maps of molecular emission to study how massive star environments affects star and planet formation with a focus on the regions within 50-200 astronomical units (AU) of the host star. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts training two graduate students using the relatively new ALMA observatory, producing an audio-visual fly-through of the Orion star-forming region to share with the public what they learn and working with high school students to produce other multimedia presentations.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    This program enabled the PI, his collaborators, and his students and postdoc, to carry out a systematic study of protostars, protoplanetary disks and their environment in clustered star-forming regions.  The main aims of this work were to understand the processes of planet and star formation.  The work focused on the Orion Nebula Cluster, which is an environment thought to be similar to the one where the solar system formed.  The team measured the distribution of circumstellar disk masses and sizes in the region, and used these to constrain basic theories of planet formation.  In particular, they found that most disks in this region have sizes similar to that of the protosolar nebula.  Given that the solar system likely formed in an Orion-like environment, this finding suggests that the environmental effects seen in Orion may have shaped the formation of our own solar system.  The disk properties in Orion can also be used an initial conditions for generic models of planet formation, which can be used to explain the known extrasolar planetary systems as well as our own solar system.  This award also enabled the training of two graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow.  The team disseminated their results to the scientific community with refereed publications and talks at conferences, and also communicated with the public using press releases and popular science articles.  Results from the work were also incorporated into undegraduate and graduate level courses taught at the University of Arizona.
