<AbstractNarration>Improved communication capabilities in airplanes are a continuing goal in the avionics field.  Plastic Optical Fibers (POF) have been used extensively in automobiles, and their characteristics in enduring harsh environments make them particularly attractive for use in avionics.  Improvements in this area could lead to more efficient systems in airplanes, with reduced energy costs given their light weight.  This project will examine ways to optimize the characteristics of POF for application in airplane systems, by collaborating with researchers at the University of Zaragoza in Spain, who are experts in computer modeling of these systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The findings from this project may lead to improved communication systems in airplanes, decreased energy costs and increased efficiency.  Further, the development of applications to avionics may provide insight for applications in other systems with similarly wide distribution, such as telecommunications networks.  In addition, collaborating with foreign researchers at the host institution will provide the graduate student with access to expertise not available at the home institution.  This type of experience provides US students with the capacity to participate in a globally competitive workforce.</AbstractNarration>

All along, our entire work based on the support by this grant has enabled us to continue attracting the interest of a leading avionics company who constantly provides us with state-of-the-art experimental components and so we are now ready to construct our intended avionics testbed.
