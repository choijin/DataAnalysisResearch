<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project seeks to develop a novel, intelligent device for automation of gait training in the neurological patient population undergoing physical therapy and rehabilitation.  The objective of this project is the creation of a physically simple robotic system, which uses a sophisticated control system to intelligently cooperate with the physical therapist administering gait training, to partially automate the process.  The development of this system may lead to the creation of a new paradigm in gait training and physical therapy.  This device will have the potential to greatly enhance the abilities of physical therapists to administer intensive gait retraining, and this in turn may lead to improved mobility in hundreds of thousands of patients every year.  The existing technological solutions to automation of gait training are overly complex and costly, with very low market penetration, and as a result few patients benefit from them.  During this project, the feasibility of creating an inexpensive device which will cooperate with the physical therapists in gait training will be demonstrated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project stems from the possibility of enhancing both the economics and the outcomes of gait training.  Current gait rehabilitation methods rely on manual labor.  Therapy is often administered by 2 or 3 PTs at the same time, which is very costly.  Our proposed product will make it more cost-effective to treat patients with a variety of neurological disorders, including some 350,000 stroke patients who could benefit from gait therapy every year.  We estimate the size of the addressable market for the proposed product to be about $36 million, but this device may also lead do the development of simple robotic consumer products in the future.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ AndrosRobotics LLC was awarded $225,000 under Phase I STTR program, and $15,000 under Phase IB, for the period from January 2014 to July 2015.  The funds were used to develop a feasibility prototype of the R-LAD, the Robotic Leg Advancement Device.  The R-LAD product is an accessory, which the target customers (hospitals, clinics, skilled nursing facilities and others) will purchase and mount onto their medical walkers and body weight support (BWS) frames.  Such equipment is commonly used for administering physical therapy and rehabilitation to stroke patients and others, in order to improve their ability to walk.  There are almost 800,000 cases of stroke every year in the U.S., and almost half of stroke victims could potentially benefit from intensive gait retraining therapy, but such therapy is difficult to administer.  Medical walkers, BWS frames and other equipment commonly used addresses the safety of the patient (prevents falls) but this equipment does not address the manual labor required to stabilize the patient's torso and to drive the impaired lower limb.  For this reason the intensity of gait retraining which most stroke patients receive is limited.  We believe that our future product, the R-LAD, is an optimal solution for this problem.  The R-LAD is a unique concept because it makes free walking over-ground (as opposed to over-treadmill) possible, but unlike with the use of exoskeletons, our device rests on a wheeled frame, so that the patient does not carry the mass of the device, and the frame is there to prevent falls.  Thanks to the funds from the NSF SBIR/STTR program, AndrosRobotics LLC was able to connect with industrial partners, to bring this product to market by 2017.
