<AbstractNarration>This project seeks to make important theoretical and methodological contributions to several critical areas of nonparametric statistical inference for high dimensional data. Specifically, this project concentrates on (i) developing empirical likelihood methods for high dimensional data that, among other applications, allows for simultaneous testing of a large number of hypotheses with user-specified confidence levels even with a moderate sample size; (ii) developing bootstrap methodology for high dimensional data for post-variable selection inference; (iii) developing limit theory for studying  first- and higher- order asymptotic properties of statistical methods in high dimensions; and (iv) investigating theoretical properties of the proposed and existing resampling methods in high dimensions.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In recent years, high dimensional data appear routinely in many areas of sciences (e.g., Molecular Genetics, Finance, Climate studies, brain mapping, etc.) and in an ever increasing number of everyday activities (e.g., social networking, internet browsing, etc.). This presents unique challenges for information extraction, as traditional statistical methods do not perform well in such "needle in a haystack" situations  - where the relevant information is confounded by the presence of a huge number of irrelevant variables. The proposed research seeks to address this need directly by developing novel statistical methods for high dimensional data without stringent assumptions on the data structure.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With the advancement of technology, data with highly complex structures are being recorded in many different areas of sceintific and business applications.  Traditional approaches often fall short of providing accurate answers in such scenarios. This project focused on developing new statistical methodology for complex high dimensional data. Resampling methods based uncertainty quantification  tools have been developed and their higher order approximation properties have been established.  A novel set of tools for variable selection and structure discovery of nonlinear functions have been discovered. Specifically, a statistical algorithm called the GRID is developed in this context that gives a visual description (see the Image) of the structural composition of a nonlinear function of a real valued function of a vary large number of variables.  The figure shows how the GRID algorithm identifies the form of a function of 10 potential covariates some of which are irrelavant, some are linear (denoted by circles) and some are nonlinear (denoted by triangles), with any possible interactions among them. The ith row indicates interaction of covariate x_i with the others. Thus,  covariates 8,9, 10 are irrelevant, covariate 1 is linear (with no interactions), covariates 4,5,6 are linear and have a joint interaction term,  covariates 2 and 7 are nonlinear, with covariate 2 interacting with both 3 and 7. Thus, the form of the function is  f(x_1, ... x_10) = A x_1 + B x_4 x_5 x_6 + g(x_2) x_3 + h(x_2, x_7)  where A, B are constants and g(.) and h(.,.) are some  nonlinear functions of 1- and 2-variables.  This reduces the task of estimating a function 10 dimensional function to a much lower dimansional problem. The algorithm easily scales up to high dimensionality in the order of hundreds of covariates.     The project provided partial support for  Ph.D. dissertation research of 5 students over the duration of the grant. Results from the project have been presented in national and international conferences by the PI and the graduate students.
