<AbstractNarration>Emory University doctoral candidate Sujit Shrestha, under the guidance of Dr. David Nugent, will conduct ethnographic research on the social impacts of rapid urbanization in contexts of economic liberalization. Around the world, populations of urban poor have been increasingly concentrated in squatter settlements. The researcher will explore this transformation in Kathmandu, an appropriate context for investigating such socioeconomic changes because it represents a site where economic liberalization practices have been pursued following a period of political instability. The researcher asks how individuals living in squatter communities, given their vast ethnic and social diversity, cooperate politically in a context that is otherwise characterized by a highly ethnicized national political environment. This project details the political processes through which groups of marginalized urban squatters struggle to assert various claims such as landownership and demands for secured housing. The researcher will employ participant observation, interviews, archival research, and discourse analysis to collect ethnographic data from squatter groups, governmental agencies, as well as other key actors. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research project has the potential to make significant theoretical contributions to our understanding of rapid urbanization, an important theoretical field given the growth in proportion of the world's population that is living in cities. The researcher will also investigate how broader processes such as economic liberalization and urbanization acquire counterintuitive meanings for specific marginalized groups and how the groups involved then contest the contradictions thus effected. The project will advance scientific understandings of governance, socioeconomic change, and urban citizenship. The analysis of the connections between competing modes of citizenship, local politics, and urbanization in the developing world will be of particular interest to scholars, policymakers, as well as others engaged in the field of development. The project also contributes to the training of a graduate student.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research project spanned the time period between the rise of the Maoist party in mainstream Nepali politics (circa 2012) to its relative demise in the national political scenario (circa 2013-2015). The Maoist party was particularly popular amongst sukumbasi groups (people living on public/ private lands without formal tenure) who had been disenfranchised and marginalized by preceding political administrations. Maoist vows to cater to marginalized with an emphasis on revolutionary land-reform resonated well with sukumbasi groupsÆ struggles for land titles. In 2012, the Maoist partyÆs government, however, razed a prominent sukumbasi settlement in Kathmandu, raising questions about their support for groups of urban poor sukumbasi.  The Maoists, however, were successful in radicalizing extant sukumbasi organizations and brought demands for land titles to the center of sukumbasi agendas. The revisionary renditions of Maoist revolutionary politics in the institutionalization process of Maoist rule, however, meant that sukumbasi groups were left out in the cold and their demands for land-titles now seemed exceedingly radical and confrontational to governmental and nongovernmental organizations as well as the international community. Despite the growing incongruence between Maoist provisions for urban poor groups and sukumbasi agendas, the popularity of the Maoist party amongst sukumbasi groups continued to rise. The Maoists formed the first party-affiliated sukumbasi fraternal organization, leading to the fragmentation of the existing national level sukumbasi organizations. Furthermore, as other political parties emulated the MaoistsÆ move, there was a proliferation of party-affiliated sukumbasi groups that made is almost impossible for sukumbasi agendas to be concretely defined.  Sukumbasi interests were thus scattered amongst the resulting sukumbasi organizations whose agendas were being increasingly dictated from central party political apparatus rather than from the realities on the ground. These groups remain mostly scattered, coming together under special circumstances such as when a particular settlement is under imminent threat. Their affiliation with Maoists, however, meant that sukumbasi groups were discredited by governmental and nongovernmental organizations for being too politicized and for harboring Maoist era radical ideologies demanding land titles. During this period, governmental and nongovernmental agencies that had been working with sukumbasi groups earlier actively distanced themselves from such sukumbasi agendas.  With the shift in national politics from Maoist-driven class agendas to ethnicity-based identity agendas, sukumbasi groups found themselves excluded from national level political discourse. Sukumbasi populations were further fragmented into smaller identity-based ethnic groups while others took up membership in party-affiliated sukumbasi organizations. Party-affiliations meant that each sukumbasi group had reasons to be cautious about othersÆ agendas that were suspected of being dictated for part-interests rather than sukumbasi interests. Sukumbasi groups thus found it increasingly difficult to work together with one another.          In this context, larger frameworks such as æRight to HousingÆ that are being advocated by international organizations such as the U.N. have come to dominate governmental approaches to sukumbasi issues. Rather than catering to sukumbasi demands for land titles, governmental agencies have started to promote alternative services such as housing provisions and loan schemes to support the financial costs of alternative housing arrangements. Sukumbasi groups, however, have become even more suspicious about a syndicate between governmental and nongovernmental organizations create to push sukumbasi groups out of the city while also coercing into financial debts. These new housing provisions, such as the first governmental-built low-income housing unit in Kathmandu, make no ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
