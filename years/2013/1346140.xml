<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project entitled ?High Efficiency Robocasting for Ceramic Product Application? is intended to improve a unique additive manufacturing process called robocasting for the large-scale production of next-generation ceramic catalyst supports useful to automotive and clean-energy-generation industries.  In particular, large advanced ceramic catalyst supports could be an enabling technology for the efficient conversion of natural gas into clean fuels.  Currently, robocasting can be used to fabricate advanced catalyst supports with intricate geometries however; the technology has been limited to relatively small components because of problems associated with cracking after fabrication.  This project will combine advanced ceramic processing methods with microwave-assisted drying and sintering technology to competitively manufacture industrial-sized ceramic catalyst supports with improved performance.  Research will be completed to reduce limitations due to cracking, reduce energy consumption, and improve automation with the result being a new market for an advanced technology that will be cost competitive throughout the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project has implications for:&lt;br/&gt;1) the scientific understanding of optimized catalyst supports for clean-energy applications to help meet demands for tighter environmental controls on automotive and plant emissions;&lt;br/&gt;2) the utilization of microwave technology for energy savings and reduced greenhouse gas emissions in industrial manufacturing;&lt;br/&gt;3) the creation of manufacturing and STEM-related jobs on US soil; and&lt;br/&gt;4) the advancement of additive manufacturing technology to keep the US a step ahead of foreign competition.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Robocasting is one of the very few additive manufacturing techniques that have been demonstrated to be useful for fabricating ceramic materials into structures which have not been commercially viable with traditional manufacturing techniques.  Lattice structures for ceramic filters and catalyst supports with enhanced performance are particular examples.  There are several advantages of these lattice structures over the reticulated-foam ceramics currently used in these applications.  However, the commercial market for Robocasting has been largely limited to products with dimensions less than 2 inches because of problems related to cracking.   Robocasting is a very rapid additive manufacturing technique and scalable.  Therefore, if the size limitations for robocasting-produced parts can be reduced then the market growth for robocasting-produced parts will be very large.  Simply, the goal of this project is to make additive manufacturing even more commercially viable for ceramics by:  A) overcoming the technical challenges for robocasting to produce unique large ceramic parts;  B) designing an entire manufacturing line to be commercially competitive with traditional manufacturing processes and production from low-wage countries and;  C) create strategic partnerships and distribution channels to establish new markets for large economic and societal benefit.   In pursuit of achieving these goals we studied various material formulations and fabrication conditions to help to reduce cracking in our ceramic bodies.  In particular, studies related to the development of materials and binder formulations more resistant to cracking were successful as well as the improvement of processing conditions more suitable to robocasting and sintering large parts.   The materials and processing conditions that were determined to be successful in initial studies were further explored for utility to produce lattice structures 100mm in diameter with beads as large as 4mm.  The original Phase-1 objective was to develop alumina and Zr-toughened alumina bodies.  However, the work also resulted in the development of large zirconia and mullite lattice products.  Some examples are shown below.  This Phase I work hints to the conclusion that a commercial viability for large unique ceramic structures created via 3-D printing is feasible.  The 3-D structures being considered can not be easily made with traditional manufacturing techniques but have significant advantages over traditionally manufactured geometries.  If the 3-D printed structures could be manufactured economically, the societal impact could be tremendous ranging from local job creation to reduction in CO2 emissions.  That is the aim of the technology development proposed in Phase II.           Last Modified: 04/07/2015       Submitted by: Joseph Cesarano]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
