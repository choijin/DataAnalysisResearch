<AbstractNarration>The Research Network Upgrade Project at CWRU improves the campus cyberinfrastructure in three coordinated areas to address increasing demand by research faculty for bandwidth to the national research network. New network edge equipment increases bandwidth to the national research network via the regional network, OARnet, to 100 Gbps. New network access electronics extends 10 Gbps bandwidth to four areas of campus with data-intensive research in engineering and physics. A new Science DMZ with data transfer nodes reduces the friction of large-scale scientific and research data transfers across the national network.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The enhanced network capabilities facilitate the research endeavors of diverse groups at the university including the Case Center for Imaging Research; Pharmacology and the Cleveland Center for Membrane and Structural Biology; as well as Astrophysics, Cosmology, and Particle Physics. This complements past work that provided bandwidth enhancements at selected locations in the access layer serving the health sciences campus.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The application of these advanced technological capabilities brings broader impacts within and beyond the immediate subject areas. The development of real-time MRI techniques is envisioned to lead to real-time imaging for surgical procedures with image information delivered to the surgeon from a remote data center. Advances in structural biology and hybrid methods facilitates molecular characterization of challenging biological systems including membrane proteins, receptors, and engineered viral vectors. The development of new radiation detection and detector media purification techniques impacts future medical imaging, nuclear non-proliferation, and industrial processes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF CC-NIE award 1340938 has provided funding to make significant improvements to the campus network at Case Western Reserve University in support of a broad set of research areas.  The network improvements fall into three general areas.  First, the bandwidth of the university's connection to Internet2 was increased nearly a hundred fold to 100 gigabits per second.  This provides researchers with the ability to effectively utilize remote resources as if they were located on campus and reduces the need for researches to maintain local copies of those resources and to, instead, access the remote resources on a "just in time" basis.  Second, a Science DMZ was deployed to further improve network performance, especially involving transfer of massive datasets like genomic data, by allowing such transfers to avoid passing through the traditional firewalls that provide security for the campus and its data centers.  The additional increase in perceived network performance further helps researchers to avoid maintaining redundant local copies of massive datasets in favor of accessing them as needed via the network.  Finally, ten-fold network performance upgrades were carried out in research intensive buildings that serve the School of Engineering and the School of Medicine.  These upgrades are focused on upgrading network performance at the building level but can also be used to provide individual 10-gigabit network connections to research labs if needed.  In addition, an upgrade was carried out to the network hub that serves the entire engineering quad, which improves performance in all buildings in the quad.  Order of magnitude increases in actual research data transfer rates are generally being observed. Repeated transfers with a specific research-intensive university have increased from a measured 450 Mbps to a measured 5000 Mbps as a result of the project funded by the CC-NIE award. This performance appears to be typical as other research network utilization is monitored throughout the campus.  Initial impact has been greatest in connection with the Center for Membrane and Structural Biology, with transfers of electron microscope images being facilitated, and with the Department of Genetics and Genomic Sciences, where transfers of massive genetic and genomic datasets are being carried out at a ten-fold increase in speed.  The university's Great Lakes Energy Institute is expected to benefit greatly in the near future as it begins to import large data files from power generating plants throughout the United States.
