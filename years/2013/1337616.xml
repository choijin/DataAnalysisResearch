<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to provide the measurements and analysis of thermal conductivity of various material systems for a useful direction and a new dimension in understanding material systems to be used for potential applications in photovoltaic and thermoelectric systems. Students at all levels (both undergraduate and graduate) will have access to this facility as the facilities in the Clean Room. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit is to make available this instrument for across the campus and other legitimate research and training purposes to all institutions in the neighborhood. Although primary thrust goes to the undergraduate program, the faculty members are highly diversified to conduct advanced research to enhance multidisciplinary Master's program in Materiel Engineering. Thus, the graduate students are involved in the high quality research activities under the guidance of the faculty members. A specific objective is to expand the numbers of students, particularly undergraduate students, participating in research, and increase the numbers of minority students continuing their education towards the Ph.D. degree.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are to advance research in micro- and nano-fabrication, enhance educational opportunities and provide hands-on training to both undergraduate and graduate students, and contribute to the research and educational goals of the University. A very important result of the acquisition of the instrument will impact the advancing careers of traditionally underrepresented minorities that comprise the overwhelming majority of the students at Alabama Agricultural and Mechanical University.</AbstractNarration>
