<AbstractNarration>This project investigates a fundamentally new robotic manipulation approach for minimally-invasive surgical procedures.  The approach combines flexible, actively actuated continuum segments with small, rigid-link joints -- retaining the safety advantages of flexible continuum manipulators while achieving the performance advantages of traditional rigid manipulators.  The combination of performance and inherent safety is an essential element in the emerging area of co-robotic surgical applications.  The overall approach is referred to as interleaved continuum-rigid manipulation.  While interleaved continuum-rigid manipulation offers an attractive, intuitive approach, its apparent simplicity belies the obstacles which must be overcome prior to successful realization.  This project will address these obstacles though a coordinated effort in design, modeling, and control.  The design effort will seek to address the significant technical challenges of the interleaved manipulation approach including rigid-link joint actuation challenges and rigid-link joint to flexible segment drive-train coupling.  The modeling investigation will establish a toolset from which the underlying behaviors of the interleaved manipulation approach can be understood.  The controls investigation will seek to develop control strategies appropriate for the hybrid flexible-rigid system envisioned.  Evaluation will include performance and safety-metric evaluation as well as bench top clinical evaluation, focusing on the execution of simulated clinical tasks.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the results of the research will lead to improvements in manipulation capability for use in highly technical and safety critical minimally-invasive co-robotic surgical procedures.  Specifically, interleaved continuum-rigid manipulation will enable levels of performance required for cooperative manipulation tasks in emerging co-robotic surgical techniques while maintaining safety.  New classes of interventional techniques for neurological, cardiac, and other high risk procedures will be possible, resulting in improved outcomes and reduced morbidity.  In addition, the extension to larger scale manipulators could have significant impact in other co-robotic application areas including search and rescue robotics, light-manufacturing, and home and healthcare assistive robotics.  To facilitate wide dissemination of the project results, major findings will be published in both conference and peer-reviewed journals.  Additionally, detailed results, including design and analysis data, will be made available online.  Finally, the project will have a strong training focus by providing an integrated research and educational environment for graduate and undergraduate student researchers - including those in underrepresented groups through established University fellowship programs.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The primary outcome of the funded research has been the demonstration and validation of a fundamentally new manipulation approach for minimally-invasive surgical procedures, known as interleaved continuum-rigid manipulation.  The approach combines flexible, actively actuated continuum segments, similar to standard compliant devices such as catheters, with small, rigid-link joints - retaining the safety advantages of flexible continuum manipulators while achieving the performance advantages of traditional rigid manipulators.  The combination of performance and inherent safety is an essential element in the emerging area of co-robotic surgical applications.  The results of the funded research have led to improvements in manipulation capability for use in highly technical and safety critical minimally-invasive co-robotic surgical procedures.  Specifically, interleaved continuum-rigid manipulation enables levels of performance required for cooperative manipulation tasks in emerging co-robotic surgical techniques while maintaining safety.  If adopted by device manufactures, the new manipulation approach will enable a new class of interventional techniques for neurological, cardiac, and other high-risk procedures, resulting in improved outcomes and reduced morbidity.  In addition, the approach is extensible to larger scale manipulators in other co-robotic application areas including search and rescue robotics, light-manufacturing, and home and healthcare assistive robotics.    The primary project outcome resulted from a combination of milestones and outcomes that occurred over the project's lifespan.  The most significant of these include the following:  (1) Development of a number of device and system prototypes of the interleaved manipulation approach including a one-degree-of-freedom testbed from which essential feedback control and modeling concepts, required for successful implementation, were investigated, and a four-degree-of-freedom demonstration prototype system used for concept evaluation and validation, including demonstration of performance and dexterity improvements as compared to traditional flexible segment only devices, such as robotic catheters.  (2) Development of feedback control approaches that can compensate for the unpredictable and varying characteristics of flexible medical devices.  In typical compliant medical devices, such as catheters, the ability to precisely position the device relative to the anatomy, as might be required in an interventional procedure, is severely limited due to the compliance and internal friction of the device.  Leveraging the precise motion of the interleaved manipulator's small, rigid-link joints, the control approaches developed were shown to compensate and virtually eliminate positioning errors.  (3) Demonstration of a telerobotic application of the interleaved manipulation approach. While the interleaved approach has many possible applications, its use in medical robotics is the most promising.  As such, its incorporation into a tele-robotic system is essential, as the majority of medical robotic systems are either tele-robotic or semi-autonomous.  The modeling and experimental validation demonstrated that tele-robotic applications are possible through proper design optimization and control.  In addition to the technical outcomes listed below, the project's outcomes include the training of a number of graduate students who acquired skills in robotics and medical device development.  Additionally, an important element of the student's professional development included significant collaboration opportunities with clinical collaborators that provided the students experience with clinical need-finding, an essential skill for medical device and medical robotics engineers.  In addition to training opportunities, the funded research resulted in numerous publications and presentations produced to help disseminate the research results to the private sector and a wider audience more generally.
