<AbstractNarration>Renewable and biodegradable materials are a key element to a sustainable planet.  Ecovative Design, LLC (Ecovative) has created new compostable mycelium-based (fungus) bioplastic/biocomposite materials.  The material is grown at room temperature in the dark (thus requiring little energy for processing) and heated/dried to drive off water and inactivate the fungus. These new biodegradable and renewable materials are being sold commercially as replacements for expanded polystyrene and polyethylene foams that are petroleum-based and difficult to recycle or reuse.   These fungus-based biopolymers have the potential to be used in additional markets such as transportation and recreation that currently use petroleum-based plastics. To meet that potential, however, the structure/property/processing relationships need to be understood.  This award supports fundamental research to provide needed knowledge on how to optimize and tailor the properties of these new materials.  The impact of this project, which is a collaboration between Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Union College, and Ecovative, will be to expand the range of applications where highly renewable, compostable, and inexpensive materials can replace petroleum-derived products.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Ecovative's bioplastic / biocomposite materials are created from a mixture of agricultural waste, feedstock, nutrients, and fungal inoculant. The resulting biopolymer/biocomposites consist of a self-assembled filamentous mass of hyphae (the filament cellular building block of mycelium fungi) grown around and securely anchoring the agriwaste. Thus, the biopolymer/biocomposite properties are strongly dependent on the agriwaste morphology, the hyphae alignment, density of the biocomposites, and degree of colonization.  As in all materials development, structure/property/processing relationships are key to optimizing physical performance. To tailor the structure, we will explore processing techniques (electrospinning of model growth substrate, aligned cellulose fiber substrate, growth of hyphae under pressure, and freeze drying) that can potentially control hyphae alignment and hyphae strength as well as biopolymer density. We will use imaging techniques and image analysis to characterize the morphologies that develop. A range of mechanical properties will be measured from the scale of individual hyphae and progressing up through the bulk. The results will be compared to continuum level composite models as a starting point to evaluate the applicability of current models.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Renewable and Compostable Fungus Based Plastics &ndash; Developing the Structure / Property / Processing Relationships to Facilitate Commercialization     Renewable and biodegradable materials are a key element to a sustainable planet.  Ecovative Design, LLC (Ecovative) has created new compostable mycelium-based (fungus) bioplastic/biocomposite materials.  The material is grown at room temperature in the dark (thus requiring little energy for processing) and heated/dried to drive off water and inactivate the fungus. These new biodegradable and renewable materials are being sold commercially as replacements for expanded polystyrene and polyethylene foams.  Polystyrene and polyethylene foams are based on petroleum and are difficult to recycle or reuse.   These fungus-based biopolymers have the potential to penetrate additional markets &ndash; for example transportation and recreation &ndash; that currently use petroleum based plastics. To meet that potential, however, the structure/property/processing relationships need to be understood.  This award supported fundamental research to optimize and tailor the properties of these new materials.  The fungal biocomposites are made from agriwaste reinforcing filler (in this case corn stover) surrounded by a fungal matrix with individual hyphae networks (mycelium) growing to bind the agriwaste together and provide overall strength.  The overall process is summarized as: A suspension of fungal inoculum is mixed with agricultural waste of controlled size.  The fungal suspension is prepared in a slurry of millet grain. The slurry is added to a mixture of sterilized substrate (agricultural waste), water, and nutrition, and grown in a clean room. After the incubation period, the material is homogenized (ground up) which destroys the hyphae morphology.   After homogenization, more nutrition is added, and it is packed into 6x6x1" tiles.  The hyphae network continues to grow, and then the composites are dried.  There were several key findings that will help in the design of improved biocomposites:  The mechanical properties are governed (in both tension and compression) initially by the properties of the fungus.  Thus, one key to controlling properties is controlling the mycelium/hyphae structure. The most important time to alter the nutrition during growth is after the final packing of the parts (after homogenization).  This allows the hyphae branching to be controlled, and the greater the branching, the more robust the composite. The composites are highly heterogeneous, and growth methods that improve the homogeneity of the hyphal density will improve the overall composite properties. The size of the agriwaste particles does not significantly impact properties.  As for all composites, it is likely that aspect ratio would be a better mechanism for improving properties. An improved method for testing these materials in tension was developed that will other researchers to properly test the properties of their biocomposites.   In addition, a multiscale model was developed that bridges length scales from that of individual fungal hyphae up to full scale composites that can be used to predict behavior of future composites and design improved structures.  With particles ranging in size from hundreds of microns to mm, and mycelium fiber diameters on the order of 1micron and inter-fiber pores on the order of tens of microns, a clear scale separation exists between the micro and meso levels. However, the matrix may exhibit density fluctuations on scales intermediate between the micro and meso scales. We adopted a two-scale numerical homogenization approached that uses a model developed for the mycelium (hyphae network) for the matrix, and includes a significant distribution of density in that matrix structure.  This homogenized matrix behavior is then incorporated into a composite structure that mimics the structure and size distribution of the agriwaste.  The model has one calibration component, namely the damage parameters. The damage parameters are calibrated by comparing the composite model predicted stress-strain response with the experimental response. Further, the model was validated by predicting the experimental stress-strain response for multiple compression cycles.
