<AbstractNarration>This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating basic studies of ion energy distribution control in low temperature plasmas to fill a gap in the ability of the semiconductor industry to meet future needs in the manufacturing of silicon integrated circuits with higher circuit density. The translated method for ion energy distribution control in plasma processing has the unique feature of single, selectable energy ion bombardment, that, combined with a self-limiting charge neutralization step, provides exemplary performance advantages in patterning insulating and conducting layers in silicon integrated circuit fabrication, including higher selectivities in etching one material relative to another, and in dimension control leading to improved yields, when compared to the leading competing technology of radio frequency bias in this market space. In addition, the simplicity and efficiency of power delivery, compared to the competing tailored waveform bias gives it an additional advantage. The project accomplishes this goal by using pulsed DC bias to an electrode and the substrate stage to obtain energetic ion bombardment, then electron flux to neutralize charge, resulting in a mono-energetic ion flux with no charge-up issues on insulating materials. The project will produce a prototype that will consist of a substrate stage and a boundary electrode that can be immersed in a pulsed plasma. Positive DC voltage on the boundary electrode during the afterglow produces energetic ion bombardment, while positive DC spikes to the substrate stage temporarily bringing the surface to near plasma potential, allowing electron flow to neutralize positive surface charge. The project will deliver a proof-of-concept, the specifications for this hardware, and a path to scale-up.  The partnership engages Tokyo Electron America and GlobalFoundaries to provide guidance in the semiconductor plasma etching market space and other aspects, including supplying test samples that would increase credibility in the market space, and potential future investments that could accelerate the translation of this technology along a path that may result in a competitive commercial reality. The potential economic impact is expected to be hundreds of millions in tool sales in the next decade, which will contribute to the U.S. competitiveness in the plasma etching equipment market space. The societal impact, long term, will be a continuation of Moore?s Law, which predicts the steady improvement in the performance of integrated circuits. This will lead in turn to the continued improvement in computers and portable electronic devices, as well as innovations leading to new consumer electronics products, medical equipment, and other yet to be conceived of advanced products.</AbstractNarration>
