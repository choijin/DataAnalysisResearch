<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit:  'DNA codes for mRNA codes for Protein' is the well-established model of gene expression in cells.  Recent evidence, however, suggests that the regulation of gene expression in our cells has many additional nuances that were not anticipated by this simple model.  The amount of mRNA in the cytoplasm is known to be a product of both the rate of production of the mRNA (transcription) as well as the degradation rate of the mRNA.  The underlying hypothesis for this research project is that there is a way for the status of the cytoplasmic mRNA to be communicated back to the nucleus and influence the rate of transcription.  In other words, if the rate of degradation of a specific mRNA in the cytoplasm is increased, a signal can be sent back to the nucleus to increase the rate of synthesis (transcription), thus maintaining a steady-state level of the mRNA in the cytoplasm.  Preliminary evidence has been obtained to suggest that this may well be the case and the goal of this research project is to formally test this hypothesis in proof of concept studies.  The ability of an mRNA to send signals back to the nucleus to regulate its own synthesis is a novel idea that has fundamental bearing on how genetic information in cells is expressed.  Thus a full understanding of this process has important implications in a variety of biological disciplines.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The research project brings together an interdisciplinary team that will result in the cross-training of both graduate students and postdoctoral level researchers.  Such interdisciplinary training will provide an important skillset to these trainees for future career success.  The project will strive to recruit underrepresented populations into the research endeavors to enhance scientific diversity.  Data from the project will be incorporated into an advanced undergraduate/graduate course to give a broad set of students exposure to cutting-edge research.  Outreach activities including posting on internet sites and meeting with high school students at science fairs, will raise public scientific literacy.  Finally, the data, technology and models that are developed will be deposited in easily accessible databases and disseminated widely to promote the interdisciplinary incorporation of the potentially transformative ideas of the project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit:  The outcomes of this project impacted four areas of molecular biology:     1.  The level of RNA in a cell made from DNA is a factor of both the rate of synthesis (transcription) in the nucleus and the rate of turnover (RNA decay) in the cytoplasm.  In this project, we obtained evidence that there is actually crosstalk between these two processes in mammalian cells.  This appears to be a fundamental aspect of gene expression regulation and may ultimately lead to the development of new paradigms for how gene expression is regulated to maintain balance or homeostasis in the levels of individual RNAs in the cell.  2.  Work on this project contributed to the discovery of an RNA regulon in the mRNAs encoding proteins that are part of the Signal Recognition Particle - a complex involved in protein secretion in the cell.  This RNA regulon consists of five mRNAs that are co-regulated at the level of their relative RNA stability.  DNA operons - genes that are arranged on DNA such that they can be co-regulated by transcription - have been known for decades in bacteria.  However genes are not arranged this way on human DNA.   Thus our discovery helps to understand how genes that are located on different parts of the genome can be co-regulated.  3.  This project helped to optimize an RNA pulse-labeling technique using 4-thio uridine that is used to determine RNA turnover rates in cells. All indications are that this pulse label approach may become the 'gold standard' in the field for determining RNA stability, and we believe that our work under this project will help ensure that the technique is effectively applied.  4.  Co-PI Bin Tian and colleagues established a unique bioinformatic pipeline through the use of 3' READS to analyze data generated from 4-thio uridine labeling experiments.  This pipeline could potentially improve informatic analysis of global RNA stability data to effectively take into account mRNA isoforms that are derived from alternative RNA splicing and polyadenylation - and thus provide additional clarity to data interpretation in this area.     Broader Impacts:  1.  This project trained two postdoctoral fellows. one research associate and two undergraduates in RNA molecular biology and bioinformatic analysis of global data sets.    2.  The data/approaches developed in this project will be integrated into a graduate advanced research methods course that is taught each Fall by Co-PI Carol Wilusz.     3.  One undergraduate trainee has expressed interest in joining the Peace Corps for a year and working in South America.  The training and time management skills that she learned in this project will undoubtedly help in this endeavor.
