<AbstractNarration>The planned research develops and applies tools of the field of microlocal analysis. Roughly speaking, this field keeps track of the position and frequency, or momentum, of waves (or more generally, functions) simultaneously. The planned applications are to wave propagation and other related phenomena, as well as inverse problems for determining a function from integrals along curves (X-ray transform) and related problems for determining the structure of a material from boundary measurements. Although the proposal concerns their mathematical theory, these problems are closely connected to the physical world. Wave propagation is ubiquitous in nature, with electromagnetic waves, such as light, being one of the most prevalent examples; the theory of general relativity being another important physical example. Scattering theory of quantum particles (such as protons and electrons) is another subject governed by microlocal analysis: these aspects enter both into the description of quantum waves at large distances, and into semiclassical phenomena, i.e. when Planck's constant can be regarded as small, which happens often in chemistry. The inverse problems under study are also of broad significance: an application of the theory developed here is the determination of an unknown variable sound speed in an object via the measurement of travel times of waves, which for instance is relevant to imaging to interior of Earth using the travel times of earthquake waves.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Some of the proposed projects describe the long-time or far field behavior of waves on curved space-times. Physically these arise in general relativity, including electromagnetic waves on a curved background. However, there are also examples of purely mathematical origin, such as asymptotically complex hyperbolic (ACH) space and asymptotically Anti de Sitter spaces (AdS); the latter does have a different connection with physics via string theory. The microlocal approach to analysis on these spaces has made breakthroughs possible in the author's work on linear problems asymptotically (real) hyperbolic (AH) spaces as well as Kerr-de Sitter space. The projects here aim to extend these tools to the ACH, AdS-type spaces, improve the understanding of Lorentzian scattering spaces (which include asymptotically Minkowski spaces), as well as to quasilinear PDE. Other projects concern the behavior of waves at edges, concretely the diffraction of the Rayleigh (surface) waves of elasticity and a refined, second-microlocal, description of diffraction of scalar or electromagnetic waves. Yet another main area is inverse problems, where the author, together with Uhlmann, has introduced new tools for spatially localized inversion of the geodesic X-ray transform. The projects aim to extend this to tensors, and to investigate boundary rigidity, i.e. recovering a Riemannian metric from its boundary distance function.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project was to use phase space, or microlocal, techniques to analyze various problems. In physical problems, these microlocal techniques keep track of position and momentum at the same time, to the extent that it is allowed by Heisenberg?s uncertainty principle.  A typical application is to describe wave-type equations, including the asymptotic behavior far away. Wave-type equations describe, for instance, the propagation of electromagnetic (light), elastic and gravitational waves. The results of the project describe how waves decay.  In many cases one is interested in propagation phenomena for non-linear equations; these are equations in which the response to a perturbation is not proportional to the perturbation. For instance, Einstein?s equations describing the development of a space-time are non-linear. In this project the linear techniques were extended to this non-linear setting and were used to show, for instance, the stability of black holes (so called Kerr-de Sitter black holes) in a space-time with a positive cosmological constant (which is currently understood to be the case for our universe).   Another application is to inverse problems. In earth sciences a common way to obtain information about the interior of Earth is via seismic (elastic) waves which travel through this interior. A relatively simple quantity one can measure is the travel time of waves generated by earthquakes to far away locations on the surface of the Earth; the `inverse problem? is to find out the propagation speed of waves in the interior (and thus infer what the materials and physical conditions are). In this project a mathematically precise analysis of a slightly simplified (but in other ways, such as geometrically, extended) problem was given which is called `boundary rigidity?, which in this context roughly says that the travel times indeed determine, even when only localized information is given, the structure inside (at least locally, if only local information is given) under suitable conditions, and indeed they do so in such a way that potentially one can implement the result numerically.  An important part of this project was to provide research experience to PhD students, as well as to communicate the results in a manner that is accessible to a broader mathematical audience.
