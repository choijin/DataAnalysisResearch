<AbstractNarration>This project involves the deployment of novel mass spectrometric instrumentation for measuring intermediate-volatility organic compounds (IVOCs) and semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs) during the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) scheduled for the summer of 2013. IVOCs and SVOCs may be important species in the formation and evolution of secondary organic aerosol--a major research focus of SOAS--but are poorly constrained, and not routinely measured in real time by commonly available techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Deployment of the instrument to the SOAS ground field site will close a gap in the measurement of the inventory of organic species, and aid in overall carbon accounting.  These measurements may be helpful for meeting several of the SOAS science objectives, including understanding the fluxes and oxidation of biogenic carbon, and the influences of anthropogenic emissions on biogenic aerosol.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support measurements made by a graduate student, who will gain valuable experience in carrying out atmospheric chemistry fieldwork, working with researchers from a number of different institutions, including government and industry scientists.</AbstractNarration>
