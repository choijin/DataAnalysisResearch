<AbstractNarration>The atmospheres of Venus and Earth formed in early solar system conditions that were fairly similar, but ended up very different. Venus's massive carbon dioxide dominated atmosphere presents substantial observational challenges due to its expansive vertical extent and distinct regimes of thermal, chemical, and dynamical conditions. This project is an observational study of the Venus middle mesosphere (at 70-100 km altitude) and lower thermosphere (100-120 km), regions characterized by complex chlorine, oxygen, sulfur, and hydrogen photochemistry, as well as a dynamical transition from retrograde flow (opposite to the planet?s rotation) at lower altitudes to dayside-to-nightside circulation above. The Principal Investigator and collaborators will use ground-based and airborne telescopes, including the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT), the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA), and the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) to measure the spatial and temporal distribution of temperatures, winds, and molecular species. The goals are to constrain (1) the temporal and spatial variability in chemistry and circulation, (2) the photochemistry of the mesosphere, and (3) the physics underlying the circulation and compositional gradients. The broader impact of the project derives from its contribution to understanding Earth-like planets, which are now thought to be common around stars other than the Sun; Venus provides the best opportunity to understand how an Earth-like planet can evolve to an environment very unlike that of Earth.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes of this award include fundamental advancements in understanding of both atmospheric dynamics (winds; large-scale atmospheric circulation) and atmospheric chemistry of the planet Venus. These advancements in understanding of the Venus atmosphere specifically also advance our broader understanding of all planetary atmospheres, including that of Earth and those of exoplanets.  Prior to this project, large-scale circulation patterns in both the day- and night-side lower thermosphere of Venus had been independently studied, and found to be distinctly different.  However, winds in the dusk-dawn (twilight) transition region between the day and night circulations had never been measured, fundamentally because neither of the two methods used (respectively) to observe winds on day and night sides are well-suited for observation of the narrow, half-illuminated transition area.  This project made the first measurements of winds across the day-night terminator, based upon painstaking analysis of observations obtained during a rare (twice per century) transit of Venus across the face of the sun.  Cross-terminator winds were discovered to be supersonic - something which had previously been thought to be impossible, so impossible that theoretical models of Venus atmospheric dynamics had previously been constrained to force all wind speeds to be subsonic.  As a consequence of this project outcome, the theoretical models have been revised.  Regarding atmospheric chemistry, this project made the first detection/measurement of chlorine monoxide (ClO) in the Venus atmosphere, and more broadly showed (contrary to previous understanding) that the Venus upper mesosphere contains large amounts of highly reactive chlorine compounds (such as Cl, as well as ClO).   These are the same highly reactive chlorine compounds well known for their destruction of ozone in Earth's atmosphere.  Finding them in large abundance demonstrates that chlorine must also destroy ozone in the atmosphere of Venus.  Further, and more profoundly, discovery of chlorine monoxide on Venus provides the first observational proof for a decades-old theoretical explanation (Yung and DeMore, 1982) for the absence of molecular oxygen in the Venus atmosphere.
