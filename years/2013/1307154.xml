<AbstractNarration>The ultimate goal of this research is to create a low-resource, comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatographic microsystem prototype comprised entirely of Si-micromachined components that uses an extant, proof-of-concept, 2-stage microfabricated thermal modulator.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography is arguably the most effective method known for separating and detecting the components of extremely complex mixtures of S/VOCs. &lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The successful project will extend the state-of-the-art in small, inexpensive, turn-key instrumentation for identifying/quantifying organic compounds in complex mixtures. This is a natural extension of previous collaborative work involving students/faculty from mechanical/electrical engineering, chemistry, applied physics, and environmental health sciences, which will promote interdisciplinary mentoring/learning in microsystem integration, separation science, and public health.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
