<AbstractNarration>Risk communication is an important part of many cyber security mechanisms.  Android's current risk communication mechanism is based on security warnings and has been demonstrated to be ineffective because users become habituated to ignore such warnings and tend to consent to all prompts.  This multi-disciplinary research project aims at developing holistic solutions to usable risk communication and control for the Android platform.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates an approach that presents risk information at multiple granularities, including a high-level numerical risk summary, an intermediate-level summary of risk for different dimensions, and detailed risk information.  The high-level risk summary is computed by information integration techniques, using information discovered from multiple sources, e.g., user reviews and app source code.  This summary enables proactive risk communication (e.g., when the user searches for apps) so that users can take this information into the decision process.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project also introduces a multi-mode approach that, in addition to communicating risks, also controls risks in the sense of discouraging risky applications and ensuring that users truly understand the risks.  The project develops mechanisms that aggregate, communicate, and control risks incurred by apps at runtime, and ways to personalize risk integration, communicate, and control techniques to accommodate differences among users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is expected to advance the state of the art in principles and techniques to risk communication and control, and has the potential to impact the Android app ecosystem by collaboration with Google researchers.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

Android is the dominant operating system for mobile devices, accounting for 88% marketshare as of 2018. Android's current risk communication mechanism is based on security warnings and has been demonstrated to be ineffective because users become habituated to ignore such warnings and tend to consent to all prompts. This multi-disciplinary project investigated risk communication in mobile devices through innovative human interaction mechanisms, guided and validated through rigorous and principled user studies.   The project developed a holistic risk communication approach, which communicates risks at several levels, including a high-level numerical risk summary, an intermediate-level summary of risk for different dimensions, and detailed permission risk information.  The high-level risk summary is computed by information integration techniques, using information discovered from multiple sources, e.g., permissions, user reviews and app source code.  Results from user studies demonstrate that, a summary risk index was indeed incorporated into users' decisions when selecting among similar apps, particularly if the information was conveyed in the form of the degree of safety instead of the degree of risk.

At an intermediate level, this project identified three dimensions of privacy, namely personal privacy, monetary loss, and device stability. Experimental results demonstrated that an intermediate-level risk display conveying these dimensions was effective, especially with horizontal bar-graphs, and that personalized design of this display based on users' risk concerns is potentially useful.  At the lowest level, the project investigated the structure of permissions and found that newer formats were rated as better than older ones by users but did not yield better comprehension of what the permissions entailed.  The project has allowed Doctoral, Master's, and Undergraduate students to work on cybersecurity and privacy research in an interdisciplinary setting. The students included six females, one of whom is minority.  Two female Psychology students have become assistant professors at universities and made cybersecurity and privacy an important component of their research programs, because of research on this project.
