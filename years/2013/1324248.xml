<AbstractNarration>This project explores the effectiveness of legal, institutional, and political mechanisms for realizing human rights in natural resources that invoke sustainability concerns. To date, scholarly approaches to human rights and natural resources have remained largely separate, despite the social and behavioral dimensions of sustainability and the resource dimensions of human rights claims. This project integrates these perspectives in order to enrich human rights scholarship and sustainability research, illuminating the dynamics and complexity of human-nature interactions. Using archival research, comparative-historical analysis, interviews, and quantitative analysis, this project analyzes the mechanisms, actors, and pathways by which human rights and sustainability goals might be fulfilled. Three megacities were chosen as the sites for analysis because of the extreme governance challenges they face due to the confluence of rapid urbanization, illegal housing, migration, poverty, inequality, and water scarcity.  All of these factors fundamentally affect public health, social equity, and the environment. Research objectives include documenting and evaluating the role of legal and non-legal mechanisms in realizing human rights and sustainability norms for water and sanitation; evaluating the role of state and non-state actors in implementing social rights; and identifying and comparatively analyzing configurations of mechanisms and pathways across research sites and sectors to see when and how they operate more or less effectively. An important outcome will be the identification of practical strategies for making social rights real in places where it is difficult to do so. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The policy significance of  rights to natural resources gives the project substantial broader impacts.  Findings will be made available to respondents as well as to international development agencies  via a web portal and in-country presentations. The project will also expand international research networks, foster curricular development at home and abroad, and expose U.S. students to cross-national research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This research analyzed the impact of law on water and sanitation governance in three rapidly urbanizing sites: S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil; Delhi, India; and Johannesburg, South Africa. In particular, it explored the effect of legal interventions on public administration, human deprivation, and the resolution of conflicts among water-related human rights, and between human rights and ecological constraints. The goal was to understand why norms &ndash; such as basic human rights or environmental protection &ndash; are, or are not, effectively realized in practice.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our data included nearly 1000 legal cases across research sites, as well as approximately one hundred interviews with lawyers, judges, activists, and academics. An important contribution of this project was the collection of formerly fragmented data sources such as these into one location. The database of court cases and related documents, as well as GIS-based mapping of water resources, household access to water and sanitation, and location of court cases, is a unique and valuable resource for rights scholars and advocates. In addition, interviews with judges and other experts, analyzed in publications, illuminate <em>how well</em> courts are able to adjudicate economic and social rights.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our data point to several areas where collaborative, interdisciplinary research could fill critical gaps in human rights and environmental sustainability fields. In particular, interviews with judges and lawyers revealed that despite the recognition of close linkages between law and sustainability in water cases, legal actors and sustainability scholars do not have sufficient opportunities to interact, share information, or collaborate. Beyond expert testimony (for which sustainability scholars are only occasionally recruited), there has been very limited exchange of ideas between these two communities. Moreover, most interactions are limited to natural scientists and engineers, with hardly any engagement with social scientists.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Meanwhile, public administrators pointed to practical difficulties that arise in complying with court orders and legal mandates. Translating law-on-the-books to implementation can be difficult and contradictory, and mechanisms of coordination and information sharing are needed. A deeper dialog among different stakeholders is thus desirable in order to identify gaps in knowledge and practice, as well as to co-create new tools to expand the capacity of all concerned: legal actors, urban sustainability researchers, public administrators, and representatives of community and non-governmental organizations that bridge the space between science, policy, and practice.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We have disseminated these and other findings through publications and presentations in the U.S. and abroad, including at high-level global meetings such as UN Habitat III in Quito, Ecuador. Between the two investigators, we have published eight peer-reviewed chapters or articles and two blog posts, and have given 24 presentations (seven at ASU, five at U.S. conferences, and twelve abroad). We continue to write peer reviewed articles and will begin work shortly on a book manuscript on urban water governance and the realization of social rights from a cross-national perspective. We were also able to leverage our NSF project to secure additional funding: an ASU Institute for Social Science Research seed grant, a Fulbright-Nehru research and teaching award (India), and a Fulbright Specialist Award project (Brazil).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our analyses also inform our courses, and have fostered curricular development at home and abroad, including two &ldquo;Human Rights and Sustainability in Brazil&rdquo; study abroad courses, a &ldquo;Sustainable Development in Action&rdquo; course with colleagues from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), a short one-credit course at IIT on &ldquo;Sustainability Transitions,&rdquo; and seminars at various academic and policy institutes in India. This grant also provided numerous opportunities for graduate and undergraduate research assistants in the USA, Brazil, and South Africa to learn qualitative and quantitative data collection techniques, and legal and policy analysis. In all, we employed or engaged five graduate and eight undergraduate researchers.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Also as a result of this project, the co-PIs were able to develop and deepen their involvement in international research networks. Toward the end of our grant period, we convened an international, inter-disciplinary workshop, &ldquo;Law and Urban Water Governance: Cross-Country Dialogues on Human Rights and Sustainability Challenges,&rdquo; at Arizona State University. The workshop was conceived as a forum for sharing the results of our NSF research and discussing future projects - publications, grant proposals, and other initiatives - to inform and improve current policies and practices. Bringing together interlocutors from Brazil, India, South Africa, and elsewhere, the workshop provided a unique collaborative space in which heretofore disparate groups &ndash; scholars, professionals, advocates and activists &ndash; could work together to define both key questions and a research agenda to grapple with the challenges of urban water governance. We were able to identify knowledge gaps, explore new areas of research (such as integration of water with food and energy security issues), and identify possible sources of funding for these projects and proposed research. We have also begun new collaborations with related organizations and institutions on projects of relevance to our research on water and human rights.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/30/2017<br>      Modified by: Ladawn&nbsp;Haglund</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1324248/1324248_10272976_1512004438210_NGOsanitationprovision--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1324248/1324248_10272976_1512004438210_NGOsanitationprovision--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Sanitation project, Delhi"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1324248/1324248_10272976_1512004438210_NGOsanitationprovision--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Sanitation project, Delhi"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The investigators visiting a sanitation project - Delhi</div> <div class="imageCredit">LaDawn Haglund</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ladawn&nbsp;Haglund</div> <div class="imageTitle">Sanitation project, Delhi</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1324248/1324248_10272976_1512004791169_AcidMineWaste-Joburg--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1324248/1324248_10272976_1512004791169_AcidMineWaste-Joburg--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Acid Mine Waste, Johannesburg"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1324248/1324248_10272976_1512004791169_AcidMineWaste-Joburg--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Acid Mine Waste, Johannesburg"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Acid mine waste water outside Johannesburg</div> <div class="imageCredit">LaDawn Haglund</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ladawn&nbsp;Haglund</div> <div class="imageTitle">Acid Mine Waste, Johannesburg</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1324248/1324248_10272976_1512004156237_Guarapiranga-SPBrazil--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1324248/1324248_10272976_1512004156237_Guarapiranga-SPBrazil--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Guarapiranga Reservoir, S&atilde;o Paulo"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1324248/1324248_10272976_1512004156237_Guarapiranga-SPBrazil--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Guarapiranga Reservoir, S&atilde;o Paulo"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Guarapiranga Reservoir, São Paulo, Brazil</div> <div class="imageCredit">LaDawn Haglund</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Ladawn&nbsp;Haglund</div> <div class="imageTitle">Guarapiranga Reservoir, São Paulo</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
