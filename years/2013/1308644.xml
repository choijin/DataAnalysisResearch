<AbstractNarration>Prof. Wei David Wei at the University of Florida is being supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry in developing methods and strategies for a direct and quantitative evaluation of the magnitude of surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-enhanced electromagnetic (EM) fields at the single-nanoparticle level. These methods are to allow the mapping of the lateral spatial distribution of "hot spots" on the surfaces of anisotropic nanostructures and, furthermore, to permit a thorough investigation into the local extinction profiles, polarization dependences, and ultra-fast excited state dynamics of individual hot spots at the nanometer scale. A detailed analysis of the precise correlation between local nanostructure geometry and the attributes of the resulting localized SPR is being made in order to significantly advance the understanding of the nature and origin of nano-localized hot spots. The long-range objective is to greatly facilitate the development of new classes of plasmonic nanomaterials with properties optimized for applications in the biomedical and solar energy fields, including single-molecule sensing and solar photocatalysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Discoveries from the proposed project are targeted at the development of new plasmonic nanomaterials and technologies that promote public health and clean energy, both vital to the nation's future. The broader educational impact of this program is to be the instruction and inspiration of the next generation of scientists in biomedical sensing and solar energy production. Prof. Wei and his group are specifically focusing on broadening the participation of groups underrepresented in the sciences. In conjunction with student mentorship and curriculum development, Prof. Wei is active in ongoing outreach activities to educate high school students, teachers, and the general public on plasmonic nanomaterials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The scientific goal of the project was to achieve a quantitative characterization of the localized surface optical properties on single nanostructures and attain a deeper understanding of the nature and origin of nano-localized optical fields ("hot spots").  Our specific objectives for the three-year period were: 1) to quantitatively determine the magnitude of SPR-enhanced EM fields on single plasmonic nanostructures; and 2) to map the lateral spatial distribution of "hot spots" on the surfaces of anisotropic nanostructures and highly structured nanoassemblies and to simultaneously quantify the SPR-enhanced EM fields of each individual "hot spot." The proposed research built a detailed analysis of the precise correlation between local nanostructure geometry and the attributes of the resulting localized SPR, significantly advancing the understanding of the nature and origin of nano-localized "hot spots." The obtained knowledge in this project will greatly facilitate the development of new classes of plasmonic nanomaterials with properties optimized for applications in solar photocatalysis.  The project has included two postdoctoral research associates, five chemistry graduate students, eight undergraduate students, and six high school students. To date, there have been nine peer-reviewed journal articles (Chemical Reviews, Nature Materials, Chemical Science, Ultramicroscopy, Journal of Physical Chemistry, Advanced Energy Materials, JACS, Nanoscale), four submitted manuscripts, one invited review that will be submitted in the next three months (Accounts of Chemical Research), two patent applications (PCT/US17/34271, PCT/US17/027927), and seventeen invited talks at national and international meetings based on the work.
