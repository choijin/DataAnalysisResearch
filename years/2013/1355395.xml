<AbstractNarration>To improve our understanding of the state of computing education and to grow the field, the Partnership for Advancing Computing Education (PACE) proposes to organize an interdisciplinary planning workshop on computing education research. PACE, a coalition of the ACM, the Association of Information Systems, IEEE-Computer Society, Computer Science Teachers Association, the Computing Research Association, and the National Center for Women &amp; IT, is dedicated to improving the preparation of the computing workforce.  Through discussion among leading computing and education researchers, we propose to achieve the following goals:&lt;br/&gt;(i) to develop a shared understanding of the state of computing education research across subdisciplines&lt;br/&gt;of computing, identifying gaps and overlaps;&lt;br/&gt;(ii) to identify present strengths and future opportunities for research on computing education;&lt;br/&gt;(iii) to assess the viability of building mechanisms for improved infrastructure, such as a research coordination network, and&lt;br/&gt;(iv) to encourage knowledge sharing across the fragmented domains of study.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    To deliver excellence in computing education commensurate with societyÃ†s need for a skilled and multidisciplinary computing workforce, educators need to identify, adopt, and adapt&mdash;and often discover&mdash;pedagogical best practices.

These issues and concerns are also common in allied computing-intensive disciplines and in many aspects of education generally include:          Broaden participation by women, minorities, and students who are first in their families to attend college, and related cultural issues;     Understand how learning occurs and how learning can be measured;     Understand when interventions are desirable, which interventions work in particular   situations, and how and when it is best to deliver them;     Improve pedagogy in general and improve ways of recruiting, motivating, and retaining students and scholars to sudy CER in particular;    Use assessment in all its forms to learn better ways to enhance learning; and,     Harness innovation in support of better learning outcomes.
