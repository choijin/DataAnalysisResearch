<AbstractNarration>Ethnicity and race have been pivotal in analyses of linguistic variation in the United States. A strong ethnic identity and non-alignment with the majority "white" group has been commonly taken to account for the presence of distinct features, as well as the absence of regional dialect features, in the speech of minority groups. This dissertation research aims to further our understanding of the social and linguistic factors that determine an ethnic group's choice of variables by investigating how the speech of white ethnics (Polish Americans) who grew up in a majority minority setting (New York City) reflects their complex identities.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With the goal of unpacking speakers' complex identities, such as "Polish", "white" and "New Yorker", this research analyzes the co-occurrence of potential substrate effects from Polish and regional features of New York City English in the speech of individual speakers. On the linguistic level, this research investigates whether the presence of one substrate effect entails the presence of another, and whether the presence of one substrate effect can block the adoption of a regional feature. On the social level, through a self-reported Polish orientation survey, this research explores whether a strong Polish cultural orientation and frequent use of Polish are good predictors of the occurrence and rates of substrate effects. Social and linguistic data will be collected through sociolinguistic interviews with first and second generation bilingual Polish Americans. Additional data will come from reading tasks, a Polish cultural orientation survey, and ethnographic observations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will be of interest to educators and parents of bilingual children whose foreign accents may cause them stigmatization in schools, the workforce, and the legal system due to negative language attitudes. A deeper understanding of how a speaker's first language (L1) can influence the second language (L2) could help educators and caregivers to distinguish ethnic features from learning disabilities. Funding this award will enhance the training of a promising graduate student.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Residents of a given dialect region typically acquire local speech features. In some cases, however, two speakers who grew up in the same neighborhood may not sound alike. This multiplicity of local norms has featured prominently in sociolinguistic research, which has shown that linguistic variation has the potential to signal self-portrayal (expression of social identities), linguistic history (exposure to more than one language or dialect), and accommodation to different social networks. In the case of ethnic groups, linguistic differences can manifest in one of two ways. First, ethno-racial minorities may display distinct <em>ethnolinguistic features</em> that often lead to the perception of an &ldquo;accent&rdquo;, as in the case of African American English (e.g., Rickford 1985, Wolfram 2007) or Latino English (e.g., Fought 1999). Second, members of minority groups may not adopt regional speech features that characterize local dialects. Existing evidence for ethnolinguistic differences has come entirely from studies that have selectively focused on the linguistic correlates of one aspect of identity at a time (e.g.,&nbsp; ethnic, place, or gender identity). This approach has assumed that linguistic variation can only be associated with binary identifications, despite the fact that minority groups develop complex, multivalent<em> </em>identities (Mendoza-Denton 2002) that intersect ethnicity, place, and gender. Moreover, American-based sociolinguistics has focused on the speech of major, non-white racial groups, such as African Americans (e.g., Coggshall &amp; Becker 2010, Preston 2003), Asians (e.g., Hall-Lew 2009, Wong 2015), and Latinos (e.g., Fought 1999, Gordon 2000), with white speakers often portrayed as lacking ethnicity (Bucholtz 2001).</p> <p>This project fills theoretical and empirical gaps in existing research by investigating effects of ethnicity on the speech of white ethnics in New York City. On the social level, we investigate the identities expressed by two generations of Polish New Yorkers through community-based ethnography and a Polish-involvement survey. On the linguistic level, we employ acoustic and statistical methods to analyze the realization of select linguistic variables by Polish New Yorkers and a control group of non-Polish white New Yorkers. The linguistic analysis is focused on speakers&rsquo; production of three regional features of New York City English: tongue raising in the vowel of <em>caught </em>(reportedly receding from the dialect; Becker 2010), tongue raising in the vowel in <em>ban/bang</em> (a new sound change; Newman 2014), and substitution of <em>th</em>-sounds, as in [d]is for <em>this</em> and [t]in for <em>thin </em>(a Polish ethnic marker when produced with Polish-influenced voicing; Newlin-?ukowicz 2014).
