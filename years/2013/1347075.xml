<AbstractNarration>Cybersecurity is paramount to protecting national interests in domains that include but extend well beyond defense and finance. However, current state-of-the-art cyber-defenses have severely limited predictive and attribution capabilities. Detecting and understanding cyber attacks is not sufficient--we can liken that to "studying symptoms instead of a disease."&lt;br/&gt;           &lt;br/&gt;This research carries out a synergistic approach to integrating cyber data forensics with human-centric social network analysis under a common framework. The three major activities of this project are as follows: (a) comprehensive models of cyber-attack characteristics are developed using feature extraction techniques on diverse data sources, (b) adversarial groups are classified according to their feature similarities, and (c) group classification is enhanced using analytic techniques from social network science.&lt;br/&gt;           &lt;br/&gt;To accomplish these activities: (1) different models for constructing joint representations of computer and social networks are investigated within a multi-mode graph framework; (2) data reduction and feature extraction techniques are developed for associating large datasets with this unified graph model; (3) an existing system is leveraged to discover invisible and missing links between adversarial networks of individuals; and (4) social network models and tools, as well as case studies, are applied to infer adversarial group typology.&lt;br/&gt;           &lt;br/&gt;This research is expected to benefit computer science, cyber security, and social sciences by improving detection methods for cyber attacks. Applying time-series analysis in creative ways to multi-mode networks should contribute to the field of artificial intelligence. This joint work should apply also in fields such as health care, marketing, or forecasting technology adoption trends.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Cybersecurity is paramount to protecting our national interests in domains that extend well beyond defense and finance. However, current state-of-the-art cyber-defenses have severely limited predictive and attribution capabilities. The majority is reactive in nature and relies on evidence produced by post-event electronic trace analysis. As a result, cyber-attacks can at best be detected while they occur and, in most cases, are discovered well after the attack has terminated. However, detecting and understanding attacks is not sufficient. To understand why a cyber-attack has occurred, and most importantly, when it will occur and by whom it may be perpetrated, we need to understand what the identities, values, incentives, and communication modes of the involved individuals are.</p> <p>This project developed systematic methods for establishing fundamental links between cyber-threats and the adversarial groups that launch them. More specifically, different models for constructing joint representations of computer and social networks under a multi-mode graph framework were investigated. The first step was to improve our understanding on the nature of cyber adversaries. Systematic methods for categorizing cyber attackers to different types based on their skill level and motivation were investigated. Compared to early hacker typologies, our study targeted the recent rise of new groups of contemporary hackers, motivated by ideologically and socially-driven online activism. The so called hacktivists are motivated by ideology, such as politics, religion, or jingoism to pursue dubious goals. Due to their broad appeal, they often employ novel methods for gathering resources such as online crowdsourcing movements. To categorize cyber attackers, we proposed a weighted arc circumplex model, which consist of a circle with axes to define boundaries between groups.</p> <p>We used multi-mode graphs to model the interactions of two well-known malware-based cyber espionage use-cases, the &ldquo;GhostNet&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Putter Panda&rdquo;. &nbsp;We applied community-detection methods to discover cohesive subgroups, cliques, and blocks within the multi-mode networks. These refer to densely connected vertex subsets that relate actors of different kinds by spanning more than one network modes. &nbsp;To discover communities, we applied a spectral decomposition method on the matrix representing the multi-mode graph. Specifically, we used the eigenspectrum of the so-called <em>modularity matrix</em>, adjusted to account for multi-mode networks, in order to partition vertices into modules (communities). The community composition reveals the relationship between different actors, events, and resources. Indeed, targeted users are grouped with the attacks launched against them and the attack origins. Similarly, the attackers are linked to the users they most frequently attacked and the attack type that they employed.</p> <p>The investigation of models for constructing joint representations of computer and social networks within a multi-mode graph framework, is naturally approached by means of blockmodels for multiple networks. We formulated a simple and innovative means of discovering and fitting generalized blockmodels for <em>multiple</em> relations. We made use of existing capabilities of the open-source network analysis software, Pajek. In particular, by constructing an appropriate augmented adjacency matrix and carefully crafted constraints and penalties, Pajek&rsquo;s criterion function can be simultaneously minimized over multiple relations. We described this technique in detail using a hypothetical multiple network, and then reinforce its value through reanalysis of a classic multiple network study in the social networks literature.</p> <p>Finally, we investigated a data synthesis approach, whereby synthetic cyber actor models connecting social and cyber networks with known ground truth are produced. To maximize the realism of the synthetic model, the network of cyber actors may be inherited from real networks. We have embedded ground-truth using algebraic patterns for each individual cyber actor group (e.g., social and cyber) and cross-cutting patterns between groups. To leverage from the latest state-of-the-art algebraic network analysis, we computed the algebraic closure of each set of patterns. The algebraic closure allows multiple patterns to be combined using arbitrarily complex interactions within the network. Networks are then joined using sets of interactions from the algebraic closure of the cross-cutting patterns. Lastly, to mimic the realistic conditions of false leads and noisy data, noise and false patterns are embedded into the final network.</p> <p>Moreover, we extended the above synthetic cyber actor models to include network dynamics. Linear state space models are the status quo for traditional system dynamics. Replacing the state vector with a state matrix naturally,&nbsp; produces network dynamics. In this new model, the traditional system matrix corresponds to one of the matrices in the algebraic closure. Effectively, the network dynamics are a stochastic, nonlinear extension to classic state space models. Connections between modes (e.g., cyber-social interactions) are updated based on the cross-cutting patterns and a selected pattern from the algebraic closure. In this way, the dynamical cyber actor model recreates static synthetic cyber actor models, but across time.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/20/2016<br>      Modified by: Loukas&nbsp;Lazos</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1347075/1347075_10267793_1448956150977_Fig1b---rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1347075/1347075_10267793_1448956150977_Fig1b---rgov-800width.jpg" title="A weighted arc circumplex of hacker types"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1347075/1347075_10267793_1448956150977_Fig1b---rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="A weighted arc circumplex of hacker types"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Thick arc segments indicate primary motivations; thin arc segments indicate secondary, tertiary, or quaternary motivations; regular text indicates hacker groups; parenthesized text indicates motivations</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ryan Seebruck</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Loukas&nbsp;Lazos</div> <div class="imageTitle">A weighted arc circumplex of hacker types</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1347075/1347075_10267793_1448932594591_Fig1a---rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1347075/1347075_10267793_1448932594591_Fig1a---rgov-800width.jpg" title="A circular order circumplex of hacker types."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2015/1347075/1347075_10267793_1448932594591_Fig1a---rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="A circular order circumplex of hacker types."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Nodes depict hacker types; nodes placed nearer to the circle edges are more sophisticated; regular text indicated hacker groups; parenthesized text indicates motivations.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ryan Seebruck</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Loukas&nbsp;Lazos</div> <div class="imageTitle">A circular order circumplex of hacker types.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1347075/1347075_10267793_1477010273120_Fig2a---rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1347075/1347075_10267793_1477010273120_Fig2a---rgov-800width.jpg" title="A circular order circumplex of hacker case studies."><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1347075/1347075_10267793_1477010273120_Fig2a---rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="A circular order circumplex of hacker case studies."></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A circular order circumplex of hacker case studies.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ryan Seebruck</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Loukas&nbsp;Lazos</div> <div class="imageTitle">A circular order circumplex of hacker case studies.</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1347075/1347075_10267793_1477010339550_Fig2b---rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1347075/1347075_10267793_1477010339550_Fig2b---rgov-800width.jpg" title="A weighted arc circumplex of hacker case studies"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1347075/1347075_10267793_1477010339550_Fig2b---rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="A weighted arc circumplex of hacker case studies"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A weighted arc circumplex of hacker case studies.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Ryan Seebruck</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Loukas&nbsp;Lazos</div> <div class="imageTitle">A weighted arc circumplex of hacker case studies</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
