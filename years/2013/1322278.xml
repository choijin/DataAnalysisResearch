<AbstractNarration>This project investigates how activity-trace information can be used to enhance social transparency in online peer-production communities, in order to support learning and knowledge sharing. Specifically, we examine whether capturing and broadcasting the actions that individuals take on electronic artifacts can support process learning about how to do a task. We conduct a series of design experiments to explore how peer access to various types of activity-trace data affects knowledge sharing.  Our goal is to identify how transparent environments can be designed to capture knowledge as a side effect of peer production activity. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Social technology is radically changing the nature of work. Organizations now recognize the value of social technology for increasing access to a broad range of participants but struggle with how to incorporate this technology into work environments. This project examines how "social transparency" -- visibility of others' actions on shared artifacts -- can be used to improve coordination and knowledge sharing in virtual organizations. Results will inform the design of online work environments that support professional skill development alongside collaborative peer-production activities. The project will also inform educational technology design and policy, by analyzing, predicting and explaining learning in an online community. To enhance the project's broader impact, the research team will foster dialogue with the technical community entrusted with designing online peer-production environments, to ensure that these systems support effective learning and knowledge exchange.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Online product communities are becoming a primary engine of economic value creation for all manner of digital artifacts.  These communities cut across organizational, expertise, cultural, and other boundaries, and function at a scale that is not commonly studied in computer-supported cooperative work.  In this project we generated empirical results, design principles, and tool prototypes that will greatly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of these communities.  Our specific objectives for this project were to (1) complete a multi-method study of the way social information and detailed activity traces impact key decisions in a transparent development environment, (2) conduct studies of how activity traces and identity visibility impact how work is done in online environments, and (3) develop and begin deployment of the Scientific Software Network Map.   We have several important results from our multi-method study of the use of social information and activity traces in a transparent development environment.  We found that for decisions about use and contribution, developers made inferences about (1) project dynamics, (2) personal utility, and (3) community evaluation.  While these three types of inferences were present in both types of decisions, the factors the developers looked at and the attributes they were inferring differed.  In our study of the acceptance of code contributions in GitHub, we found that activity traces reflective both of social and technical factors were powerful and significant predictors whether a given request would be accepted.  The number of comments on a contribution was a very powerful predictor that the request would be rejected, unless there was a prior social connection between the requester and the community, in which case the number of comments had little effect.  The work shows the substantial promise of activity traces to unravel the complex social and technical workings of socio-technical ecosystems.      Our work in transparent development environments is a major advance in understanding how workers in such information-rich environments make sense of the information available and use it to make key decisions.  In our experiments on transparent work environment design, we found that the format and content of work histories can predispose evaluators to accept work from a stranger in a microtask market, but that negative histories increase willingness to improve others work. We also discovered that activity histories can influence perceived perceived credibility of an advice giver online. Across three studies we found that visible web history increased advice taking, even when the advice was bad and the history was unrelated to the task. This effect was driven by an increase in advisor credibility, suggesting activity histories can inadvertently make people seem more credible and result in potentially negative consequences. In our studies on feedback and identity transparency of a feedback source, we found that participants reacted more positively to feedback from an anonymous source than from a peer or an authority. Our findings provide important design implications for platforms to support online collaboration and more fruitful feedback exchange.  Finally the SciSoft Map is an information resource that will be of use to those in science and engineering, providing much needed insight into the use of software products.  Our interviews have indicated interest in data of this kind, especially to help scientists building infrastructural technology to make their case for contribution. The SciSoft Map has demonstrated the usefulness of collecting data on usage of scientific software in other disciplines of science and engineering. For example, groups like the Scientific Python community can instrument their software to help demonstrate impact. SciSoft allows these communities to go beyond simply counting uses, to show what software each package is most often used with. We are working with scientific software projects to visualize complementarities and impact. The technical environments in which online work is conducted have a major impact on the quality and quantity of work. One of the distinguishing and least understood characteristics of these environments is how working in "public," i.e., exposing the details of one?s work activities, impacts the incentives, quality, and quantity of work. Transparency enables collaboration in an unprecedented scale, as millions of workers participate in millions of projects without traditional management oversight and minimal use of formal coordination mechanisms like plans and schedules. Through our detailed understanding of what signals are used and what attributes influence behavior, we have enabled the design of a new set of visualization tools that make the right information easily visible. This work opens new areas of possibility for using huge collections of online social and activity data and helps us understand the social impact of visualizing activity information.
