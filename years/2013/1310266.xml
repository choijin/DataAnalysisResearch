<AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research focuses on the three main themes in soft matter physics: Properties of colloidal gels formed with depletion attraction will be investigated. The information will help explain the origin of delayed collapse, a major impediment to the use of such gels to stabilize commercial products. In a biophysics effort, the control of cell stiffness by cell volume will be explored. If preliminary results prove to be true, this would be a transformational change in our understanding of cell properties. Finally, new microfluidic devices will be developed to use spray drying to produce nanoparticles that are much smaller in size than can be produced by any other means. This will enable the study of the unique properties of such small particles; in particular, the kinetic delay in crystallization due to their very small size. The work will be highly leveraged through interactions with industry, which provides intellectual challenges, employment for students and post docs and leverages NSF support. In addition, important technological advances will be used to establish start-up companies, which create new, high-quality technical jobs. The major educational component of this research will be training of graduate students and post docs. In addition, a highly successful outreach program, based on a Science and Cooking course, will be put online, reaching literally hundreds of thousands of participants, teaching them soft matter science through cooking.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;This research focuses on a general class of materials that are "soft," or easily deformable. Examples include many foods and personal care products, made of gels, surfactants or suspensions of small particles in a fluid, and even the cells that make up all living organisms. The research will explore important properties of these materials. For example, a major limitation of many food and personal care products is the long-term instability of the materials; the fundament origin of this will be explored and industrial production of the materials will be enhanced. A new control parameter for cells will be developed that will offer new insight into their behavior, particularly when they malfunction, such as occurs in many diseases. New devices will be created to produce particles that are much smaller than can be produced by any other means, and that will enhance the bioavailability of many newly developed drugs. The work will be highly leveraged through interactions with industry, providing an important outlet for technical advances, while offering employment opportunities to the students and post docs whose training is supported by this research. In addition, this research will lead to the formation of start-up companies which create new, high-quality jobs. For example, previous NSF funding has led to formation of 4 start-up companies which have created more than 120 new jobs, enhancing our nation's economy. As outreach to bring science to the general public, a science course, based on cooking, will be offered online by the PI through Harvard, with several hundred thousand participants expected.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ New behavior for colloids was discovered.  A different type of melting was observed, that was predicted nearly 80 years ago, but had never been observed.  A new method to measure the enzymatic activity in cells was developed that provides an important probe that can distinguish cells in different states, including diseased states.  A different method to create very small nanoparticles was created which provides a very simple method to create very small particles of almost any material.  Moreover, these nanoparticle were formed so rapidly that the material was unable form crystals, even in cases where there is a very high propensity to do so.  This provides a simple means of making amorphous, or glassy particles.  Even something as commonly crystalline as table salt can be made into a glassy nanoparticle.  A new method was developed to perform sequencing analysis with single-cell resolution on many thousands of cells.  This provides new insight into the nature of heterogeneity of cells, which can be very important in many different types of disease.  This has become a very widely copied and used technique and is currently the basis of many different startup companies.  The research supported by the group helped train a new generation of students and postdoctoral fellows, including 19 PhD students and 36 postdoctoral fellows.  All of them found full-time jobs in technical careers after leaving the group.  The research was also instrumental in the founding of 6 new startup companies, which currently provide 65 new high-tech jobs.  This contributes directly to the economy of our nation.  It also ensures that more new jobs are created than people trained, ensuring a balance between the training and the potential new jobs for the trainees.
