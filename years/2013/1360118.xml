<AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of anthropologist, Yolanda Moses at UC Riverside, Ph.D. student Holly O Okonkwo will conduct an ethnographic study of participants in Spellman Colleg'?s robotics program.  This study will help identify the ways in which Spelman College, a historically black women's liberal arts college designated as an NSF Model Institution, has successfully used federal science education policy to position itself as a national science producer. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will help increase our understanding of "how" to foster inherently inclusive environments for STEM learning utilizing the strengths of the local institution and its historical mission and thus should contribute to NSF's mission of increasing the participation on students from underrepresented backgrounds in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This theoretically and methodologically innovative research project pushes the boundaries of the debates concerning increasing diversity within the academy, and race and gender studies in science through an in-depth ethnographic case study of a local site and an academic community that has largely remained absent in the literature (African American women in science, HBCUs, WomenÃ†s and small Liberal Arts Colleges).
