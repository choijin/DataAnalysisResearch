<AbstractNarration>This project continues a 30-year study of long-lived seabirds, focusing on the causes and consequences of aging. On the Galapagos Islands, Nazca boobies live into their mid-20s, much longer than similarly-sized mammals do, and the reasons for this extended lifespan and the birds' performance in old age are of special interest.  Thousands of parent-offspring relationships are known through the project's long history of placing permanent numbered leg bands on nestlings whose parents are also identified by leg bands. Over the next five years, the investigators will use these family relationships to estimate the genetic basis of aging. By combining the complete reproductive life histories of thousands of animals with social pedigrees spanning 5 generations and complete genetic pedigrees, the research team will quantify the roles of reproductive history and genotype in senescent decline. They will continue research on the effects of early life experiences on adult behavior, including the only known analog of the human "cycle of violence," connecting abuse when young to perpetration of abuse later, in a natural population.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results from this project provide the only demographic data available to the governments of Ecuador and Peru, both signatories to the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels; they are instrumental in the design of policy on seabird biology in both countries. The research team has played a pivotal role in collecting the ecological data needed for conserving endangered and threatened albatross species, including Galapagos booby species. The current project will continue to deliver these data. Plans are presented for outreach to local high schools that directly addresses state education standards on understanding how the environment, and the interaction of alleles, influences the expression of genetic traits.  Workshops will be conducted in two high schools and timed to coincide with related classroom material.  The lead investigator will train approximately 12 Wake Forest University undergraduates to conduct these workshops, bringing the undergraduates to the K-12 classroom environment and career possibilities there.  Over 500 high school students benefit annually from these small-group workshops.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project is a long-term study of the evolution of major demographic features of a long-lived wild seabird.  We aim to understand how the environment of the study population influences the evolution of survival and reproduction.  Work during this award period capitalized on the previous 37 years of foundational research on the study population of seabirds in the Galapagos Islands, which has produced a leg-banded population of more than 5,000 known-age adult Nazca boobies.  This complete age structure ranges from ages 3-28 years, and we have a detailed compilation of the life history of each of these individuals, from hatching until death.   With this resource, we answered several questions.  Attaching two types of electronic loggers to breeding birds, we found that they travel widely over the eastern Pacific on challenging foraging trips (Fig. 1), and that young and elderly birds have poor body condition and return from foraging with less food than middle-aged birds.  Elderly birds have a further disadvantage in flying slower.  The age effects on food gathering illuminate parallel patterns in breeding success, in which middle-aged adults perform markedly better than other age classes (Fig. 2).  Middle-aged boobies also have stronger maximum bite forces than younger and older birds do.  As a whole, these results paint a picture of age-related changes in breeding performance that are based in part on physiological changes with age, and in particular with senescent decline in old age.  While senescent decline is humans is well-studied, comprehensive approaches such as ours in wild organisms are rare.  In a related approach, we found that the food base of our population and a number of other large predators in Galapagos changed from a lucrative sardine-based economy to a more challenging one based on flying fish in 1997.  This regime shift cut breeding success in half across the age spectrum (Fig. 3) and has caused a negative population growth rate.  Paradoxically, annual survival increased after the regime shift, probably due to lower annual reproductive costs when breeding failure rate is high (Fig. 4).   Our work has shown that climate change is expected to amplify the negative effect of this regime change for our study population and other marine predators in the eastern tropical Pacific.
