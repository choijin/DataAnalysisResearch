<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to develop "optical wings" that allow the controlled transport of objects through space and liquids using radiation pressure.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit combines optical and aerodynamic design principles to achieve rotationally stable flight.  The transformative idea is that by controlling shape and optical properties, efficient and stable optical wings can be made into practical devices for use in air, water, and outer space.  The proposed research holds the potential to find all-optical means of navigating large solar sails for future space travel, with the promise of lighter weight sail-crafts compared to those requiring mechanical controls.  Smaller earth-bound optical wings may be used to transport tissues in a buoyant liquid environment, or to scuttle micro-machines across a horizontal surface in air.  As the Wright brothers discovered, mastering rotational stability is the paramount concern for controlling flight.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts are (1) advanced warning times for solar storms, (2) low-cost high-speed space missions, (3) microscopic transport techniques for use in biological and materials science, (4) opto-mechanical sensors for use in bio-medicine or chemical detection.  Students, ranging from the graduate to the high school level, will participate in this research and thereby develop practical hands-on experiences in the laboratory as well as computer, technical writing, and scientific presentation skills.  These efforts provide a path and a vision for younger students to strive for high goals in an encouraging environment, as well as opportunities for advanced students to develop experimental and analytical multidisciplinary skills in optics, micro-fabrication, and aerodynamics.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Radiation pressure may be applied to a refractive, reflective, diffractive, or absorptive body to affect translational or rotational motion.  Theoretical and experimental investigations of radiation pressure force and torque were made on a various bodies, including:   Refractive optical wing oscillators with one reflective surface  Optical wings (long cambered rods such as a cylindrical lens) were expected to exhibit significant radiation pressure force and torque, and a stable dynamic response when one side of the surface of the refractive body was coated with a reflective layer.  Our analysis predicted that rotational instability occurs at a 0&deg; attitude for a small refractive index contrast between the wing and the host material.   Rocking motion of a mirrored optical wing on a flat surface  We determined the intensity-dependent rocking frequency about the natural equilibrium orientation at 0&deg; for an illuminated semi-cylindrical refractive rod (optical wing) on a flat, nonslip surface in air.  The system was found to exhibit a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation above a critical irradiance.  Nutation and Precession of an Illuminated Spinning Hemisphere  The three dimensional response of a spinning axisymmetric refractive hemisphere that is uniformly exposed to radiation was theoretically investigated.  In some cases the motion was found to be similar to that of a spinning top in a gravitational field.  Optical Wing in Water  As expected, both the mirrored and non-mirrored wings in water could be made to rotate and translate upon exposure to a laser beam.  The mirrored semi-cylinder experiment provided confirmation of our theoretical understanding based on our ray-optics model  Glass hemisphere in Heavy Liquid  Other types of experiment were conducted in liquid to explore radiation pressure, such as an unmirrored glass hemisphere in heavy liquid -- a nearly saturated solution of sodium tungstate which has a density close to that of glass.  Magnetic Levitation of a Glass hemisphere in Air  To overcome the shortcomings of radiation pressure forces in a liquid environment, we explored the possibility of using magnetic levitation to support a glass hemisphere.  We succeeded in levitating a 1mm glass hemisphere upon a thin sheet of pyrolytic graphite.  Optical Wing in Air on a Flat Surface  To verify our theoretical predictions for the rocking dynamics of a mirrored semi-cylinder on flat surface, we transferred the wings to a flat surface (e.g., Teflon-coated fused silica) and allowed them to air-dry. Stiction forces prohibited the desired rocking motion.  Optical Wing Embedded in a Microscopic Torsion Oscillator  To eliminate the complications of viscosity and light induced flow in a fluid, and to remove the stiction barrier, we designed an experiment to measure radiation pressure torque on an optical wing that makes use of a microscopic torsion oscillator.  The resulting excitation frequency agreed well with theoretical predictions.  Optical Gradient Assist Maneuver  This study was motivated by the frequently used "gravitational assist maneuver" for spacecraft.  The principle idea is that a close flyby of a planet may be used to increase or decrease the kinetic energy of the spacecraft, thereby decreasing the fuel (and hence, mass and cost) needs of the mission.  Radiation Pressure on a Diffraction Grating  Perhaps the most important technological concern of radiation pressure is the force and torque on satellites owing to solar illumination.  The advent of advanced diffraction gratings (e.g., metamaterials) motivated us to question whether diffractive materials might provide a significant radiation pressure force for future solar sailing missions.  Our experiments confirmed our theoretical expectations.           Last Modified: 12/19/2017       Submitted by: Grover A Swartzlander]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
