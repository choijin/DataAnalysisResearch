<AbstractNarration>This project will use three biodiversity manipulations at the Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve to test whether plant diversity (including genotypes within species, species with different functions, and species from different evolutionary lineages) can be detected remotely at multiple spatial scales.  The study will measure biodiversity from the sky and space by remotely sensing the reflected light spectra of plants and investigate the consequences of biodiversity for ecosystem and global processes. Project scientists from four institutions will investigate linkages between plant biodiversity, soil microbe diversity and ecosystem function. These efforts will serve in the development of airborne and satellite platforms that can routinely monitor biodiversity and provide critical experimental evidence for the concept of surrogacy, i.e., that one metric of biodiversity can be used to provide information about others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will transform methods for detecting changes in biodiversity worldwide and will provide numerous training opportunities in science, technology and math (STEM) for young scientists. Results will be integrated into the Cedar Creek Schoolyard Ecology program and a NASA-funded STEM Education Center to train Native American reservation teachers. Citizen scientists will be engaged through the MN Phenology Network. Data and research outcomes will be archived in publically accessible data repositories.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We found significant relationships between optical diversity (aka spectral diversity) and all measures of biodiversity, including species richness and evenness, functional diversity, and phylogenetic diversity.  These relationships were robust in that they held up across many methods and metrics (both of optical diversity and biodiversity).  However, these relationships were very scale-dependent in that they varied with sampling grain size (e.g. pixel size), spectral scale (e.g. number and width of spectral bands), and season.  To our knowledge, such scale-dependence, while occasionally mentioned in the literature, had never before been demonstrated in such detail. We also found that this scale dependence varied across prairie sites (Nebraska, Minnesota and Alberta), suggesting complex relationships between optical and biodiversity, in part due to variations in experimental design and landscape history (e.g. disturbance) across sites.  A further interesting finding was that biodiversity (assessed remotely) was positively related to vegetation productivity (also assessed remotely), supporting a history of literature showing that diversity begets productivity (or vice versa), and demonstrating the utility of remote sensing for relating diversity to ecosystem function.  Our results also generally supported the oft-noted concept of surrogacy (that one metric of biodiversity reflects and can substitute for another), but extended this to new areas of inquiry.  For example, optical diversity (a physical measurement) scales with many measures of biodiversity (biological measurements), and there was some limited evidence that above-ground and below-ground diversity were also related, but in different ways for different sites.  In addition to developing a robust sampling methodology demonstrating strong links between optical diversity (a.k.a. spectral diversity from remote sensing) and biodiversity, this effort collectively trained several students and postdocs, led to several outreach activities (e.g. talks and a museum display), and many publications (see below).  These outcomes provide a foundation for an improved global biodiversity monitoring system involving remote sensing.
