<AbstractNarration>The objective of this program is to investigate the effect of rotation angle on the thermal conductivity of twisted bilayer graphene. The experimental and theoretical evidence is clear that the electronic states of the individual layers in twisted bilayer graphene are decoupled. The effect of the twist angle on the phonon dispersion is still an open question, and the effect of twist angle on the in-plane thermal transport has yet to be studied. These questions are intimately related since the heat is carried by the phonons.  If the phonon coupling in twisted graphene layers were suppressed, then the multi-layer twisted graphene films would have enhanced thermal conductivity of single 2D layers acting in parallel, thus allowing for transfer of extraordinary large heat fluxes. &lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit of this program is in creating fundamental knowledge determining the relation of twist angle to the thermal conductivity of bilayer graphene. The possibility of maintaining 2D properties of graphene in bulk materials through the use of misoriented stacking is a transformational concept giving us the best of both worlds ? the enhanced performance of 2D combined with the capacity of 3D.&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact the project includes new applications of graphene for thermal management. It has the potential to increase the US technological competitiveness. It will increase the participation of women and underrepresented minorities and contribute to undergraduate and graduate STEM education at UC Riverside, which is the minority serving institution with the largest Hispanic student population among all UC campuses. &lt;br/&gt;This project is jointly funded by the Electronics, Photonics, and Magnetic Devices Program (EPMD) in the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS) and by the Electronic and Photonic Materials Program (EPM) in the Division of Materials Research (DMR).</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The effect of interlayer misorientation in bilayer graphene has a large effect on the electronic structure. It decouples the low-energy states responsible for electronic transport such that the two layers act as two independent layers even though they are separated by a few angstroms. Before this project, the effect of misorientation on the thermal transport was not known. We performed a systematic experimental and theoretical investigation of the effect of misorientation angle on the low-frequency vibrational modes of twisted bilayer graphene. The rotation angle between the graphene layers is determined using a combination of transmission electron microscopy and selected area electron diffraction. For the first time, the ZO&rsquo; phonon mode and new G-point frequencies are observed far from the resonant angle of 12o. Furthermore, contrary to previous belief, the twist-angle dependence of the new modes is not a monotonic function of twist angle or supercell size, and this non-monotonic behavior is consistent with the zone-folded modes determined from the numerical calculations. Molecular dynamics calculations have shown that the in-plane thermal conductivity is not a strong function of the misorientation angle. The experimental studied demonstrated that the thermal conductivity of misoriented bilayer graphene is smaller than that of single layer and AB stacked bilayer graphene. The project has also resulted in knowledge of thermal conductivity of graphene with defects. A combined experimental and computational investigation has shown that at high defect densities, the thermal conductivity reveals a saturation-type behavior at a relatively high value of &sim;400 W/mK. The thermal conductivity dependence on the defect density was explained using the Boltzmann transport equation and molecular dynamics simulations. In addition, thermal conductivity of reduced graphene oxide films, characterized by high defect concentrations and disorder, was investigated as a function of the annealing temperature. High anisotropy of the thermal conductivity was explained theoretically. The obtained experimental and computational results are important for understanding phonon &ndash; point defect scattering in two-dimensional systems and for practical applications of graphene in thermal management. This project provided educational opportunities for several PhD students. One Ph.D. student was trained in the synthesis of large area high quality graphene using chemical vapor deposition and characterization of the graphene by a variety of techniques. This student will be defending his Ph.D. thesis in Chemical and Environmental Engineering, and joining Intel as Process Engineer in January 2017. Two more students participated in this project to learn synthesizing graphene for applications as sensors for their Ph.D. thesis. Three PhD students were trained in density functional theory, molecular dynamics, and continuum model calculations of phonon modes and thermal conductivity. One student completed his Ph.D. and, because of his PhD work, obtained a Postdoctoral Research Fellow position at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory, Aberdeen, MD. Three PhD students were trained in Raman optothermal measurement technique. One student completed his PhD in Materials Science and Engineering and accepted employment with Raytheon, San Diego, CA.
