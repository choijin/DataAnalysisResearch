<AbstractNarration>As in other high nutrient, low chlorophyll (HNLC) regions, primary production in the Southern Ocean is likely limited by iron availability. These HNLC conditions are rarely observed in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean in contrast to the Pacific sector, indicating that productivity in the Atlantic sector may be the result of a greater input of iron, the source of which remains unidentified. In this study, researchers from Oregon State University will use model simulations to quantitatively examine iron sources and the processes leading to the chlorophyll-a blooms observed in the South Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, particularly in the region contiguous to the Patagonian shelf and near the South Georgia Island. Results from this study will advance our understanding of how natural iron fertilization affects primary productivity in potentially the strongest carbon sink area of the Southern Ocean.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: This research will contribute to the climate and marine ecosystem community research, particularly with respect to how iron inputs may control carbon dioxide fluxes in the Southern Ocean. In addition, educational impacts from this study include training for undergraduate and post-doctoral researchers, and integration of findings into undergraduate curriculum.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>While the Southern Ocean is a high nutrient low-chlorophyll (HNLC) region, primary productivity ? as measured by surface chlorophyll concentration ? in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean is on average twice as large as in the Pacific sector (Figure 1). This difference is almost entirely attributed to the exceptional chlorophyll blooms on the Patagonia Shelf (PS) and adjacent deep ocean, indicating strong iron fertilization in these regions. Ocean fertilization in the PS region (Figure 2) is enhanced by dust deposition; coastal erosion; sediment entrainment; river, glacial and groundwater discharges; and highly energetic shelf/deep-ocean interactions. The fundamental questions are then: <em>What is the relative importance of these sources and what are their impact on the seasonality of the blooms?</em> Natural iron fertilization is important because it concerns our understanding of the biogeochemical equilibrium of the Southern Ocean and its potential response to climate change<em>. </em></p> <p>A state-of-the-art coupled circulation/biogeochemical model was developed and reproduces the seasonal succession and spatial patterns of the planktonic bloom of this region of the Southern Ocean (Figure 3) when driven by climatological forcing. Furthermore, our model realistically simulates the seasonal and spatial variability in planktonic species compositions observed during several campaigns and the observations from SeaWIFS using the PHYSAT algorithm (d?Ovidio et al., PNAS, 2010). Experiments varying dust deposition (solubility and amount of mineral dust), sediment fluxes and river loads indicate that dust deposition plays a major role in the seasonal development of the surface PS blooms between 38<sup>o</sup> and 48<sup>o</sup>S and, in particular, is the primary driver of the late spring/summer surface blooms (Figure 4) when stratification is the strongest. Our findings while in conflict with the earlier arguments of Blain et al. (Nature, 2007) and Meskhidze et al. (GBC, 2007), who posited that dust fluxes are unimportant, are in agreement with those of Johnson et al. (Atmos. Chem. Phys, 2011). Transport of excess iron from La Plata River region as well as from the northern shelf groundwater and Patos/Mirim Lagoon are a major source of iron to the surface water in the Argentine basin. Together with mesoscale eddies, these sources lead to high chlorophyll in the PS adjacent Atlantic deep ocean. Dust deposition in that region further enhances the surface chlorophyll concentration seen in the satellite observations in the Malvinas/Brazil Confluence frontal region. The southern PS surface bloom is mainly driven by iron transported from the Pacific side through the Magellan strait and around Cape Horn. Passive tracer diagnostics suggest that the dynamical processes triggered by the Burdwood Bank could have a significant impact on local ecosystems of the southern PS. Furthermore, preliminary results with a model including coccolithophores indicate that transport of iron from this region might be important for the formation of coccolithophore bloom along the shelfbreak in the late summer, as seen in the particulate inorganic carbon estimated from satellite observations.&nbsp; Due to the highly dynamical nature of the PS region and the offshore deep ocean and the determined importance of various iron sources from south to north, interannual variability of the importance of the various iron sources need to be further addressed to understand the impact of iron on the productivity of the PS, especially in an era of changing atmospheric forcing in the Southern Ocean such as wind intensification.&nbsp;</p> <p>While in agreement with our finding, Johnson et al. (2011) argued that the contribution of iron dust depends on the prescribed phytoplankton Fe:C ratio and the labile iron in the dust. Simulations with constant and variable Fe:C (Sunda and Hunstman, Mar. Chem., 1995) (Figure 5) support this hypothesis, especially in frontal regions such as the shelfbreak and edges of the Brazil/Malvinas Confluence where other iron sources become more important.&nbsp; A variable Fe:C ratio should be implemented in all the global biogeochemical model when addressing the impact of climate change, which is not the case right now.</p> <p>Transport of macronutrients onto the southern shelf is due to intrusions of ACC waters at the Drake Passage and of Malvinas Current waters all along the shelfbreak (Palma et al., J. Geophys. Res., 2008; Combes and Matano, J. Geophys. Res, 2014). These waters are characterized by very high nitrate and phosphate contents but relatively low silicate. River discharges south of La Plata do not deliver a large amount of macronutrients to the shelf. Diatom blooms as observed in the spring and into summer rely on silicate and are also the largest consumers of iron. We found that silicate dissolution is an important factor controlling the intensity and duration of the diatom bloom, as well as biomass accumulation of grazers on the shelf where fisheries is prevailing. Little information is, however, available about silicate cycle on the PS shelf. This warrants further investigation as it impacts the drawdown of iron from dust deposition and ultimately its export to the sediment and offshore waters.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/25/2019<br>      Modified by: Yvette&nbsp;H&nbsp;Spitz</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1357530/1357530_10292069_1562958006279_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1357530/1357530_10292069_1562958006279_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Surface Chl distribution in the Southern Ocean from SeaWiFS observations"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1357530/1357530_10292069_1562958006279_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Surface Chl distribution in the Southern Ocean from SeaWiFS observations"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Figure 1.
