<AbstractNarration>The structure and evolution of the Eastern North America margin are the focus of this GeoPRISMS community seismic experiment. The data obtained will form a fundamental framework to address several aspects of the Program's Rift Initiation and Evolution initiative: how tectonic, magmatic, erosional and depositional processes interact; the role of mantle dynamics in ongoing deformation along this passive margin; the impact of ancient regional structure on long-term evolution that shapes present-day distribution of geologic activity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A year-long ocean bottom seismometer array (OBSIP- 30 instruments) will extend onshore station coverage (EarthScope Transportable Array, ~30 sites relevant) across Cape Hatteras. Additional transects of densely-spaced seismometers will record seismic waves that travel across the coastline, documenting more detailed structure from the continental slope through the coastal plain. Multi-channel seismic reflection data will be openly available upon completion of a training workshop that will conduct basic processing. Similarly, seismic refraction data will be distributed for a second training workshop. Data for investigations using natural seismic events will also be openly available via the IRIS Data Management Center. Station spacing and array aperture target crust and upper mantle imaging.  The experiment design builds on existing data to address current scientific questions, emphasizing both deeper structure, which will illuminate driving forces for ongoing evolution, and modernizing shallow structural constraints, to better document surface response records and their relationship to the history of glacial, sea level, depositional, and magmatic loading.</AbstractNarration>
