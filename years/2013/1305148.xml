<AbstractNarration>Computing power consumption is the most difficult and pervasive challenge towards improving the performance of computing systems. This project seeks the acquisition of a new class of cluster computing systems based on low-power System-on-a-Chip (SoC) processor nodes. Compared to traditional servers, this new class of servers promises large improvements in throughput per Watt.  Using the acquired infrastructure, the project explores the ramifications of this new class of servers on the performance, energy consumption and thermal characteristics of application workloads. The results from different types of parallel workloads are analyzed to understand the interactions between application characteristics and system architecture and the impact of these interactions on performance and power consumption. The project also investigates the impact of this new class of servers on the effectiveness of power and thermal management techniques. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed infrastructure enables the pursuit of new research directions in energy-efficiency of computing systems. The results of this project will be disseminated in premier research venues, enabling the computing community to better understand the impact of emerging low-power SoC-based systems on the energy efficiency of computing clusters.  The broader impacts of this project include outreach to local high school students in Providence, RI, and research experiences for undergraduate students at Brown University.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project, we worked on two goals: (1) develop a new class of energy-efficient computing clusters based on System-On-a-Chip (SoC) servers; and (2) devise power management methods that leverage the available degrees of freedom in a computing cluster (e.g., layout, firmware settings, power and sleep states, and scheduling) to improve the energy efficiency and thermal characteristics of emerging computing clusters as exemplified by the developed cluster.  Towards Goal (1), we developed a novel SoC-based cluster organization that exploits faster network connectivity and general-purpose graphics unit acceleration to improve the performance and energy efficiency of computing clusters. We also developed a new set of benchmark applications that can utilize the capabilities of the newly developed SoC-based cluster and demonstrate its benefits.  Towards Goal (2), we developed new techniques that  improve the layout of computing clusters to reduce cooling and energy consumption;  improve the energy efficiency of clusters by identifying the best firmware settings for servers as a function of application characteristics; enable clusters to control and cap their power consumption in a precise way to prevent emergencies while taking into account performance considerations; and enable servers to save power consumption by going to sleep states in an intelligent way that does not hurt the latency and response time of applications.     The outcomes from this project include eight peer-reviewed publications, two open-source software packages, and two theses. The acquired equipment improved the infrastructure at Brown University and facilitated additional projects by other researchers.  The project provided practical training for two PhD students and four undergraduate students, which led to two cap stone projects, an undergraduate Honors thesis and a PhD thesis. The results of this project have been also used to initiate tech transfer to a major IT corporation.             Last Modified: 12/16/2017       Submitted by: Sherief Reda]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
