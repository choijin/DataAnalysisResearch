<AbstractNarration>Technical Description: This project uses interface-specific vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy to study molecular vibrations and their orientations at the active interface in organic field-effect transistors. An underlying mission of this work is to spectroscopically monitor the evolution of the interface in operational devices to gain insight into the relationships between interfacial molecular structure and function. The activities establish the role of casting solvents and interfacial dipoles at the dielectric interface in enhancing the electrical performance of thin film transistors.  The project also explores the use of zirconium phosphonate self-assembled nanodielectrics on the interfacial organic structure.  In addition, the research team uses multiplexed sum frequency spectroscopy to measure the temporal evolution of molecular structures and carrier accumulation in the dielectric and organic semiconductor layers during thermal annealing. The in-situ-nature of these experiments provides a new perspective on the materials response from inside the functioning device, with the potential to describe not only what changes, but also what the timescales of structural change are and how these properties relate back to the macroscopic electrical response.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Non-Technical Description: Transistors are one of the basic building blocks of every digital device, from cell phones to grocery store check-out scanners.  During operation, electricity moves along an interface and the arrangement of atoms or molecules in this region determines how efficiently the charges can flow.  This project uses specialized optical measurements to determine how the molecules in these devices are ordered at the microscopic level, and how they respond to the chemistry of the underlying surfaces and to thermal processing treatments. The project is interdisciplinary, producing next-generation scientists who are skilled in materials processing, and electrical and optical characterization techniques. In addition, the research team organizes and directs a three-day-long rural outreach event each summer as a part of the University on the Prairie program where they use hands-on demonstrations to make connections between the materials properties observed by the junior high school aged participants and the real-world technologies with which they are familiar.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The performance of organic field-effect transistors is directly controlled by packing and ordering of molecules at a single interface located inside the device between layers of semiconducting and insulating materials.  The overriding objective of this project was to use an interface-specific technique called vibrational sum frequency generation (VSFG) to measure molecular structure at this interface from within functioning organic transistors. A challenge that arises in optical measurements of layered materials is the interference of signals that are generated from all of the interfaces.  A general theoretical approach was developed to model VSFG data from layered electronic materials, enabling one to isolate the signals from each individual interface.  To confirm the validity of this model, samples were prepared with thickness gradients ranging from zero to hundreds of nanometers of material to give two identical interfacial signals but with variable interference.  The results showed excellent agreement between the measured and simulated VSFG spectra and confirmed that the first layer of semiconducting molecules formed a "reclined layer" that subsequently led to high performance transistor behavior.  The intellectual merit of this outcome is that the model now enables many in this field to properly account for signal interferences using this measurement technique.  Ultimately the knowledge that can now be obtained from these measurements can be properly interpreted to direct the rational design of next generation materials and interfaces.  This methodology was also applied to fullerene ("bucky balls") and several other small molecules thin films that are relevant to organic electronics.  When electrical charges arrive at a semiconductor interface in a transistor, the charges can be spread out over multiple molecules at once.  The extent of this delocalization determines, in part, how efficiently the transistor can conduct electricity.  In order to determine the extent of charge spreading, VSFG was applied to active transistors with varying amounts of charge accumulated at their interfaces  Interference modeling described above was used to isolate the signals from the buried electronic interface.  Quantum calculations were performed to predict the vibrational frequency shifts associated with various fractional charges, forming a calibration curve that was used to map the measured interfacial vibrations onto a fractional charge coordinate.  For the material studied, it was found that each electron was spread over seven molecules at the interface.  This is knowledge that could not be obtained by other methods and will be used to answer the question of whether charge localization or morphological effects dominate the performance of organic transistors.  This methodology was also applied to fullerene ("bucky ball") films and several other small molecules that are relevant to organic electronics.  The combination of modeling and measurements confirm the validity and power of this approach and it has now been adopted by others in the field.  Developing better performing organic materials will have broader impacts to society by enabling light-weight, efficient electronics that consume less energy and in other cases convert solar or thermal power into usable electricity.  In addition to the scientific outcomes of the research project, the PI and his research team participated in two significant outreach efforts. The first was the University of Minnesota "Energy and U" show that involves hour-long performances of exciting demonstrations of energy conversion for over 11,000 grade-school kids each year.  The second was a three day long rural outreach event each summer as a part of the "University on the Prairie" program.  During this annual event, the PI and nearly his entire research group traveled to rural Minnesota to carry out intensive hands-on science experiments with 60 participants in grades 7-12 from rural, geographically isolated portions of the state. The themes of these events reflected topics of societal importance, such as the chemistry of fuels, energy, and climate change. These outreach activities instill excitement for science in the community and make connections between the material properties and the real-world technologies, such as plastic containers and cell phones.
