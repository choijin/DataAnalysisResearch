<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor William Jones of the University of Rochester is examining new reactions that can be used to make organic compounds of interest in biology and the pharmaceutical industry. To accomplish this, fundamental reactions of transition metal catalysts are being examined that can be used to form heterocycles from readily available, inexpensive starting materials.  Professor Jones is also examining new catalysts that can break open heterocycles and allow their structures to be altered.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this work include outreach to high school students to attract interest to careers in STEM related fields, as well as the development of new processes for routes to intermediates of pharmaceutical importance.  The combination of a detailed physical-organometallic background combined with an understanding of how to apply modern computational methods to these problems produces extremely well trained scientists for the US chemical industry. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One specific goal of this project is to examine fundamental aspects of cyclometallation via the "Concerted Metallation-Deprotonation" pathway that is now popular in organic synthetic methodology to produce heterocycles.  These cyclometallation studies are revealing fundamental aspects of how these molecules effect the chemical transformations, and are providing insight into the control of the selectivity that is critical to formation of the desired product.  A second goal is to develop uses for the now commonly observed transition metal based carbon-sulfur bond cleavage sulfur-containing molecules.  One application involves anchoring a reversible carbon-sulfur activation catalyst to a solid support that allows this material to act as a "sulfur sponge," thereby permitting the cleanup of hydrocarbon fuels prior to combustion.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project is to advance our understanding of the basic chemistry of how transition metal compounds can assist in the formation of carbon-sulfur (C-S) and carbon-nitrogen (C-N) bonds.  These types of bonds are commonly found in heterocycles, cyclic molecules in which the ring contains an atom other than carbon.  Heterocycles form an important class of biologically relevant molecules, and are found in many systems critical to life.  They are also found in petroleum and coal-derived intermediates, and the heteroatoms are often removed before using the hydrocarbons as fuels.  Therefore, developing methodology to make and break carbon-sulfur and carbon-nitrogen bonds is critical to making pharmaceuticals and processing petroleum products.  In this study, we have expanded new applications for the cleavage and formation of C-S and C-N bonds in thiophenes and heterocyclic nitrogen containing compounds with transition metal fragments.  In particular, we have examined fundamental aspects of cyclometallation via the "Concerted Metallation-Deprotonation" pathway that is now popular in organic synthetic methodology to produce heterocycles (see equation).  Advances in our understanding of this basic chemistry for the directed, selective cleavage of C-H bonds and formation of new C-C and C-N bonds using transition metals will permit the development of new synthetic applications to produce nitrogen-containing heterocycles.  In addition, the critical role of the carboxylate base in these reactions was be established.  A second accomplishment has been to examine transition metal based C-S bond cleavage in sulfur-containing compounds. We have discovered that a palladium phosphine compound can cleave the C-S bonds of a wide variety of sulfur hetero-cycles and thioesters (see Scheme).
