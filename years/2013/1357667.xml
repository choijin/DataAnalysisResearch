<AbstractNarration>The Panama Canal is one of the most important engineering structures in the world.  The Panama Canal Authority (ACP) is currently investing five billion dollars to expand and modernize the Canal in order to accommodate rising trade volumes.  This expansion project focuses on sustainability and has necessitated significant scientific research to measure the environmental impact of both the expansion efforts and the new technologies being deployed in the Canal Zone.  This International Research Experience for Students (IRES) award will leverage an existing relationship between Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) and ACP to involve undergraduate students in these historic research efforts.  Five students and one local high school teacher will be selected as participants each year, using a recruitment process that will ensure the inclusion of a high proportion of under-represented individuals.  Diverse pre-departure activities will both prepare the students for their research and serve as a platform by which the larger community can become involved.  Programmatic assessment by an experienced evaluator will lead to the continuous improvement of the research program, as well as wide-spread dissemination of the results.  Finally, the STEM Education Center at WPI will aid the high school teachers in developing a lesson plans based on their activities that will be widely disseminated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The expansion project will incorporate cutting-edge technological systems in order to improve sustainability and reduce environmental impact with additional locks complementing those originally constructed in 1914.  Significant scientific research is being carried out to develop and evaluate these technologies as well as to quantify the ecological effects of the construction activities.  The IRES students will investigate topics such as water quality at Gat√∫n Lake; unconventional energy generation methods; optimizing the efficiency of pumping networks; and modeling the long-range transport behavior of pollutants under complex meteorological conditions. The objective of these research efforts is to provide a holistic understanding of the interactions between the Panama Canal, the expansion project, and the local environment, ensuring both economic growth and maintenance of ecological health.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The opening of the expanded Panama Canal in June 2016 began a new chapter in worldwide commerce. With the construction of a new set of locks, the dredging of access channels, and the raising of the operational level of Gat&uacute;n lake, the Canal can now accommodate ships carrying three times as much cargo as the previous generation of &lsquo;Panamax&rsquo; ships. Effects are being felt globally, as ports on the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts, in China, and in Europe are spending billions of dollars to upgrade their facilities to accommodate this post-Panamax of vessels. Compared to the original construction effort on the Canal, which ended in 1914, this expansion program has been carried out with a much greater emphasis on reducing environmental impact, minimizing resource consumption and the destruction of wildlife habitats, ensuring asset durability, safeguarding life, safety, and historical artifacts uncovered at archaeological sites, and ensuring limited social impact on populations living in the Gat&uacute;n watershed. It is no exaggeration to say that the Panama Canal is the single most important civil engineering system on the face of the earth.</p> <p>&nbsp;Since 2015 undergraduate students from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI), in coordination with the Panama Canal Authority (ACP), have been researching the technical, environmental, and social impacts of the Panama Canal expansion. This work satisfied the WPI requirement that all students complete a capstone design experience. Projects have included the investigating the implementation of new technologies meant to lessen the environmental impact of the expanded Canal; studying on the effects of the expansion on local populations; synergizing multiple sources of information (cartographic maps, dredging surveys, control area data, etc.) in order to predict measures needed to ensure the continuous operation of the Canal; and probing the effects of the expansion project on the inter-relationships between food, energy, and water in Panama.</p> <p>&nbsp;Student researchers began their projects with an 8-week intensive preparation course at WPI, followed by 15 weeks on site with the Canal Authority. They were able to take advantage of professional development activities including attending conferences, an orientation class in the Old City of Panama, programming through the departments at the Canal Authority with whom they worked, and through events such as Project Presentation Day at WPI, when all classes are cancelled that students can present the research of their capstone design projects. Assessment by a third-party evaluator revealed both the success of the program and areas that needed to be addressed, leading to a continuous improvement of the program experience.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/13/2017<br>      Modified by: Aaron&nbsp;Sakulich</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1357667/1357667_10329177_1507903786738_MQP-PanamaCanal1-2015-500x300--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1357667/1357667_10329177_1507903786738_MQP-PanamaCanal1-2015-500x300--rgov-800width.jpg" title="WPI Student aboard ACP Tugboat"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1357667/1357667_10329177_1507903786738_MQP-PanamaCanal1-2015-500x300--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="WPI Student aboard ACP Tugboat"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Adrienne Weishaar, a WPI student, discusses her project with a Canal Authority supervisor aboard a tugboat.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Panama Canal Authority</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Aaron&nbsp;Sakulich</div> <div class="imageTitle">WPI Student aboard ACP Tugboat</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1357667/1357667_10329177_1507903844028_MQP-PanamaCanal6-2015-500x300--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1357667/1357667_10329177_1507903844028_MQP-PanamaCanal6-2015-500x300--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Inspection Tour"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1357667/1357667_10329177_1507903844028_MQP-PanamaCanal6-2015-500x300--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Inspection Tour"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">WPI students carry out a survey of Canal Authority wastewater systems in Panama</div> <div class="imageCredit">Panama Canal Authority</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Aaron&nbsp;Sakulich</div> <div class="imageTitle">Inspection Tour</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1357667/1357667_10329177_1507903910651_20160914_141303--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1357667/1357667_10329177_1507903910651_20160914_141303--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Data Collection"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1357667/1357667_10329177_1507903910651_20160914_141303--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Data Collection"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Lilliana Almonte, a WPI student, collects data in Lake Gatun.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Panama Canal Authority</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Aaron&nbsp;Sakulich</div> <div class="imageTitle">Data Collection</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1357667/1357667_10329177_1507904002283_2017-07-21-EO-0164--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1357667/1357667_10329177_1507904002283_2017-07-21-EO-0164--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Bridge Inspection"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1357667/1357667_10329177_1507904002283_2017-07-21-EO-0164--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Bridge Inspection"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">WPI Student Brandon King carries out an on-site inspection of building materials for the Puente Atlantico</div> <div class="imageCredit">Brandon King</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Aaron&nbsp;Sakulich</div> <div class="imageTitle">Bridge Inspection</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1357667/1357667_10329177_1507904139640_IMG_6005--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1357667/1357667_10329177_1507904139640_IMG_6005--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Site Inspection"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1357667/1357667_10329177_1507904139640_IMG_6005--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Site Inspection"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The 2017 cohort of WPI students carries out a site tour with personnel from the Panama Canal Authority</div> <div class="imageCredit">Samantha Eaton</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Aaron&nbsp;Sakulich</div> <div class="imageTitle">Site Inspection</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
