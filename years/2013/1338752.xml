<AbstractNarration>This project's workshops are engaging key stakeholders from academia and industry in the development and finalization of the Computer Engineering (CE) and Software Engineering (SE) curricula guidelines. The resulting guidelines, referred to as CE2013 and SE2013, are expected to be used by academic institutions to evaluate and evolve their computing curricula. There are two workshops: A SE-focused, and a CE-focused workshop. In each workshop attendees are reviewing the current curricula guidelines and discussing how the guidelines should be evolved to meet current and future computing workforce needs. Both workshops engage the respective communities in discussions on how best to integrate recent developments and advances into curricula that best prepare students for modern computing careers. The workshops involve, along with other stakeholders, key members of related computing accreditation bodies and members of the group developing the software engineering body of knowledge. The SE workshop is co-located with the Conference on Software Engineering Education &amp; Training (CSEE&amp;T), expected in the Fall 2013, in San Francisco. The CE meeting is anticipated to take place in conjunction with the Frontiers in Education (FIE) conference, which will be held in October 2013, Oklahoma City.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Robert France was a member of both the ACM and IEEE Curriculum Committees. The CE group asked Robert France to refine their proposals for the FIE meeting in Madrid in Fall 2014.  The updated body of knowledge included 14 areas, with a number of new and updated topics.   The committees developed drafts of the revised Knowledge Areas and  Knowledge Units (analogous to sections A.6 and A.7 in the CE2004 report).    While Dr. France was unable to travel to Madrid he used the funds from the Curricula award to send Dr. Eric Durant to the meeting to present and represent their interests.     There was an additional CE curriculum meeting in Milwaukee from 8/2/14 to 8/4/14.    Dr. France used the funds to send Drs. Reeves and Lam to attend this meeting to further refine the committeeÃ†s draft.     Dr. France hosted a participant training workshop that was held in June 2014 in Fort Collins, CO.   During this time, Dr. France served in the follow roles.     2011-2013 : Chair of Curricula Committee, IEEE Computer Society Educational Activities Board (EAB).     2010-2013 : Member of CS2013 Committee (IEEE/ACM 2013 Computer Science Curriculum Recommendation Committee).     2009-2013 : Member of IEEE Computer Society Educational Activities Board Curricula Committee.
