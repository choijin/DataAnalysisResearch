<AbstractNarration>This EAGER award will investigate coupled processes in an active nanoporous membrane resulting from cyclic mechanical deformation.  Electrostatic and hydrodynamic interactions in the hyperboloidal nanopore due to variable pore geometry in the presence of ahydrodynamic pressure gradient will be studied to explore ion rejection and increased water flux through the membrane due to mechanical oscillations.  Specific quesitons to be addressed include: What is/are the (i) limiting geometrical, electrostatic and hydrodynamic conditions for ion rejection and water flux; (ii) fabrication constraints in manufacturing a hyperboloidal nanopore and (iii) relationship between water flux, ion rejection, amplitude and the duty cycle of the applied signal. The proposed research will for the first time investigate the applicability of elastic deformation of nanopores for an engineering function and mimic the functionality of cell membrane proteins. The proposed concept, if successful, will lead to a new class of membranes that can be programmed to separate various ions and species through controlled operation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful this research work will make significant contributions to the fields of active materials, membrane mechanics and provide fundamental understanding of active processes in nanopores. The fundamental understanding of ion transport processes through an active nanopore will lead to innovative applications in chemical separations and biomedical applications. The scientific knowledge gained from this work will be disseminated through presentations in Materials Research Society meetings and the scientific data will be made available to the general public through the PI's lab webpage. The research effort of this award will be further enhanced by engaging undergraduate students in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department at The Ohio State University on developing design rules for a desalination system. Further, relevancy of this research program to desalination, the ongoing social trend towards environmental sustainability will motivate undergraduate students to take up advanced engineering courses and certainly attract them to pursue graduate program in engineering.</AbstractNarration>
