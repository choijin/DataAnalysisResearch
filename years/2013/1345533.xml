<AbstractNarration>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to support the development of a web-based, mobile-friendly search engine that optimally matches educational content and lesson plans available on the Internet with a student's needs and unique learning goals. The project will provide the optimal resources given the profiles, academic history and other variables collected from the intended users of those resources. The project seeks to answer the following questions: 1) How to successfully characterize and define attributes of educational content and lesson plans found on the internet; 2) How to successfully characterize and define attributes of students; and 3) How to optimally match educational content and lesson plans to the students and teachers that seek to use it. A model for characterizing lesson plans, educational content and student profiles will be conducted with the support of teachers and partners. Research results will support the development of a search engine that provides links to individual educational resources and lessons plans, optimized to the individual needs of the users.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader/commercial impact of the project will potentially have a large impact on society. It will save teachers from wasting valuable time on finding resources and will enable them to find more effective teaching and learning tools and materials to use in their classrooms that fit the individual needs of their pupils. Students will be able to directly access materials and technologies that have been created to address their specific needs, enabling and empowering them to improve their educational performance. Underserved populations will particularly benefit, as they will be able to find content that fits their need at no cost. Schools will be able to use their limited financial resources more efficiently by focusing professional development hours on more practical tasks and will be able to acquire better technologies and educational content that is free of charge on the Internet. In summary, the project will help uncover the potential of the Internet as an efficient support system for schools, teachers and parents. Finally, the project has potential for significant commercial value. Revenue will originate from optimally matching the large number of firms selling educational content and technology with the schools and teachers that need them.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Impact and intellectual merit  A personalized search engine application will have a tremendous positive impact on society. It will save teachers from wasting valuable time on finding resources and will enable them to find more effective teaching and learning tools to use in their classrooms. Schools will be able to use their limited financial resources more efficiently by focusing professional development hours on more practical tasks and will acquire better technologies and educational content that is free of charge on the Internet. Moreover, it will help students to access materials and technologies that have been created to address their specific needs, enabling and empowering them to improve their educational performance.  The successful development of the personalized search engine will help unlock the potential of the Internet as an efficient support system for teachers and schools, resulting in multiple benefits, including but not limited to: increased public literacy; improved national learning outcomes; a globally competitive workforce and vast economic benefits. Research Questions  Research questions strived to produce evidence and critical information to lay the foundation for the development of a personalized search engine. Research sought to answer the following questions: 1) How to successfully characterize and define attributes of educational content and lesson plans found on the internet; 2) How to successfully characterize and define attributes of students and teachers; 3) How to optimally match educational content and lesson plans to the teachers and students that seek to use it; and 4) How to create a user interface that successfully engages teachers and students when seeking educational content online.  Phase I Results   The software design methodology has been validated by the Phase I research activities conducted. Research performed concluded that there are currently enough freely available educational resources to create a useful system. The software developed was able to find, analyze and process all or most of the educational resources found online in a frequent and affordable fashion.  Most importantly, the research conducted was able to successfully characterize educational content found online and create a proprietary system to classify student profiles.  The research also provided evidence that machine learning algorithms can learn, model and match educational resources with specific pedagogical attributes and student profiles.  The efforts to optimize the engineering components of the Phase I have paid off and is ready for large scale implementation of a beta system for experienced users.  Feasibility Results  The feasibility of our proposal lies in four aspects. 1) Does the internet have enough freely available educational resources to justify this application and, if so, 2) Would we be capable of obtaining such information. 3) Can educational resources and leaners be characterized? If so, 4) Can a computer learn how to automatically recognize such attributes?  Those aspects were addressed in our Phase I research project and the results are the following:  1. Are there enough freely available educational resources to make the system useful? Yes, the system implemented in Phase I was able to find and index over two million educational resources freely available on the Internet  2. Would the system be able to find, analyze and process all or most of the educational resources available on the internet, in a timely, frequent and affordable fashion? Yes, in Phase I research a data adquisition stage was implemented using search APIs and a machine learning classifier was able to discover urls that addressed websites hosting educational resources, those websites were deep crawled.  3. Can the system deliver the intended user experience? Yes, in the Phase I research project, the crawled and fetched educational resources were indexed into an inverted index. The results were ranked by a combination of the ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
