<AbstractNarration>The proposed project concerns several problems in geometric and quantum topology in dimensions 3 and 4. Based on his recent work, the PI proposes an approach to the A-B slice problem, a formulation of the topological 4-dimensional surgery conjecture for non-abelian free groups. In recent years algebraic invariants have been found for key examples of decompositions of the 4-ball, and the goal is to combine them to formulate an obstruction to surgery in the context of the A-B slice problem. The project also includes a number of problems in quantum topology; some of them are motivated by the PI's recent work with Cooper on categorification of the Jones-Wenzl projectors. Specific problems concern algebraic structures underlying categorified spin networks and the colored Jones polynomial, and an approach to categorification of 3-manifold invariants using ideas related to localization. The PI's ongoing collaboration with physicist Fendley is aimed at identifying higher categorical structures in the context of quantum statistical mechanics.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Topology is the study of shapes that locally look like the Euclidean space. Topological study of shapes in dimensions 3 and 4 is particularly important due to connections with physics, and it became apparent in the 1980s that the geometric classification in these "low" dimensions is a substantially more difficult problem than that in dimensions greater than four. At the same time, a wide array of tools and insights from other areas of mathematics and theoretical physics is available for solving topological problems in three and four dimensions. A part of this project will use such algebraic tools to address the classification of large-scale 4-dimensional shapes. The relevant algebraic invariants (in particular, the Milnor group) precisely encode the topological information about the motion of strings in 3-space. Another part of this project will explore interdisciplinary connections between Topology and Statistical Mechanics, with expected applications in both fields.</AbstractNarration>
