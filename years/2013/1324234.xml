<AbstractNarration>Dr. Daniel Goldstein (Rutgers University) will study how and why Latino migrants use the U.S. legal system to prosecute workplace disputes. Focusing on several study communities in central New Jersey, the research considers the ways in which migrants who claim to have suffered from mistreatment or injury in the workplace become active users of the law and the U.S. justice system. The project asks how Latino migrants seek the help of lawyers and non-profit legal advocacy groups; educate themselves about the law and appeal to its protections; enter the court system and argue their cases; and articulate rights claims. The project also studies the role that legal-aid organizations play in facilitating migrants' understandings of and access to the legal system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research uses an ethnographic research methodology, employing a research team that includes trained local research assistants. Through participant-observation followed by semi-structured individual and focus group interviewing, the team will study the vulnerabilities and behaviors of migrants who have suffered workplace abuses. Additionally, through volunteer work in a local migrant legal-aid organization, the research team will study how these organizations facilitate migrants encounters with the legal system.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is very timely and important given the current fluidity in the U.S. around immigration issues, with Latino migrants potentially emerging into a new era of visibility, advocacy, and action in this country. The research will shed new light on the realities facing migrants in the U.S. with a special focus on workplace problems, and the legal remedies migrants pursue in response. By training and deploying a team of community-based researchers, this project will build capacity in local migrant communities, preparing people for future educational opportunities and employment in social science research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This research project in Cultural Anthropology examined the use of the legal system by undocumented immigrants in the United States. Under U.S. law, all workers, regardless of immigration status, are entitled to certain rights and protections. These include the right to be paid an appropriate wage for their labor, and to receive medical care in case of an accident incurred on the job. However, due to their undocumented status, many workers are denied these basic rights, or are fearful of claiming them, and as a result are abused or taken advantage of by employers. This research project studied the ways in which these workers are vulnerable to abuse in the workplace, and the kinds of legal disputes that arise as a result. In particular, the research focused on legal cases involving work accidents and wage theft - two of the most common forms of abuse that workers suffer in this country. Using ethnographic research methods - including interviews with affected workers, their parents, and the legal professionals and advocates with whom they come into contact - the project explored the ways in which immigrants come to learn about their rights as workers in the United States, and how they go about using the legal system in order to demand their rights when they are violated. The research findings showed that immigrants do indeed use the legal system to resolve disputes in the workplace, and that legal professionals are key in educating workers about their rights and making sure that the law is followed. Perhaps most importantly, the research demonstrated that undocumented workers face similar patterns of workplace abuse to those faced by citizens, suggesting that these workers have more in common than they might realize.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 11/04/2015<br>      Modified by: Daniel&nbsp;M&nbsp;Goldstein</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
