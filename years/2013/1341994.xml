<AbstractNarration>This grant will fund student participation at the "Future of Software Engineering" (FuSE) symposium in Seattle in July 2013.  All other costs associated with student attendance will be covered by other sponsors.    The goal of the symposium is to bring together top software engineering researchers and students to discuss a broad range of software engineering research topics, to consider future visions for the future of software engineering, and to inspire graduate and undergraduate students to work on the identified challenges.  Participants will include senior researchers from both academia and industry, as well as up to one hundred students. The  broader impacts are educational and will help build the next generation of researchers in Software Engineering.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This grant supported the travel of 27 students, including women and minorities, to FuSE 2013: the 2013 Future of Software Engineering symposium. More information on the symposium is available here: http://fuse2013.cs.washington.edu/   The symposium was a complete success with over 120 participants in total. The students whose attendance was made possible by the NSF were especially grateful for the opportunity to attend and meet with senior faculty and researchers.   The students let the organizers know that they found the talks and panel inspiring, and sparked lots of discussion about the interesting problems of the future, and what we should focus our research on. The students got an in-depth view of what the premier researchers believe is the future of software engineering research, and were able to discuss how their own research fits into that vision, improving their ability to motivate their work. Further, the meeting served as a fruitful networking opportunity for some of the brightest young minds working on software engineering today.   Intellectual Merit: The grant enabled young researchers to better understand the state-of-the-art of software engineering research, and the key problems the research community needs to solve to advance the state-of-the-art and to improve the societal impact of software.   Broader Impact: In addition to increasing the impact of software engineering research by enabling students to discuss and focus their research in the context of the vision of the leading software engineering experts, this grant helped increase the diversity of the software engineering research community. The networking connections made as part of FuSE 2013, and enabled by this grant, will continue to guide and improve the careers of the young researchers.   All the FuSE talks and its panel discussion were recorded and have been made available publicly at http://fuse2013.cs.washington.edu/.
