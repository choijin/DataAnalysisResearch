<AbstractNarration>The ``Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems workshop" is to be held at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill on March 21-24 2013. It will highlight recent developments in ergodic theory and dynamical systems. The conference focuses on the important theme of smooth dynamical systems. The main talk, given by the colloquium speaker will address the question of genericity of the``ergodic" assumption among classes of continuous dynamical systems. Several of the topics covered are central in extremely active areas of current research in this field.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This mathematics conference will provide support for participants, especially women, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and junior faculty. Young researchers are given ample opportunities to speak, to talk and to participate in the conference activities. At the same time this conference serves as a platform to recruit graduate students from developing countries like Africa to graduates program at US-based academic institutions. The conference aims at improving the participation of women (the colloquium speaker is a woman) and, more generally, of members of under-represented groups. Collaborations between participants are encouraged, and it is anticipated that the resulting research papers will be published in a proceedings volume.</AbstractNarration>

The workshop brought together young and senior researchers in a productive setting on recent breakthroughs in these research areas. Altogether we had thirty four participants .  The main bulk of the NSF fund was used to support the participation of young researchers . Out of the thirty four participants we had twenty two young researchers ( phD students, Post Doc and Assistant Professors)   Some of the notable outcomes are the following.  We had seven female speakers, including the keynote/colloquium speaker, out of nineteen speakers.  Several collaborations produced papers which have been duly refereed and should appear in the Proceedings of the 2013-2014 ergodic theory workshops. These papers will disseminate the results discussed at the workshop Speakers and participants cover geographically several countries reinforcing the global nature and the impact of the workshop. These countries inlcude, the USA, Fance, Israel, Senegal, Italy, Urugay,  Poland, Ukraine and Russia.  As part of our efforts to use the workshop as a platform to recruit talented young african researchers to the US, among the participants we had one PhD student originally from Senegal working at the ICTP in Italy.
