<AbstractNarration>This grant provides funding for the manufacture of hybrid hydrogels, wherein physical and cross-linked networks are incorporated into a single multi-component polymer. Hydrogels are three-dimensional networks composed of chemically and/or physically-crosslinked hydrophilic polymers that have applications in diverse technologies such as drug or agrochemical delivery, food and personal care products, optics, fluidics, wound healing and tissue engineering.  Chemical hydrogels formed from covalent bonds have permanent shapes, but they generally exhibit poor mechanical strength and toughness, while physical hydrogels exhibit good toughness, but lack the creep resistance of covalent gels. The research includes the synthesis of hybrid hydrogels and the characterization of the microstructure, swelling behavior, flow and viscoelastic properties and mechanical properties of neutral and charged materials. The objectives are to develop strong, tough hydrogels, understand the mechanism of toughening in hybrid hydrogels and the development of manufacturing methods for producing shaped gel objects by solvent or melt injection, melt shaping and electrospinning of nanofibers.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will lead to improvements in the mechanical properties and manufacturing methods for producing hydrogel products. The development of an understanding of the mechanism by which strong, tough materials that are mostly water (i.e., hydrogels) are achieved will lead to the design of improved soft materials for existing applications and expand the application of hydrogels into technologies for which they are currently unsuitable, because of poor stiffness, strength and/or fracture toughness.  In addition to the expansion of commercial applications of hydrogels, the substitution of hydrogels for many existing material applications should also have positive environmental implications, in that most hydrogels are environmentally benign. The nano-structured morphology expected for hybrid hydrogels may also lead to smart applications of these materials, such as shape memory and/or self-healing behavior.</AbstractNarration>

The AA component is water soluble and the FA component is water insoluble and immiscible with the predominantly poly(AA) chains.  As a result, the FA moieties phase separate into ~6 nm hydrophobic nanodomains . that produce a physically crosslinked network. Thus, when swollen with water, the material becomes a hydrogel. These hydrogels exhibit high modulus (103 - 106 Pa) and extremely high fracture toughness (103 - 104 J/m3, which is comparable or exceeds that of cartilage. The origin of the toughness is the reversible supramolecular crosslinks formed by hydrophobic interactions of the  fluroalkyl chains of the copolymer.  In addition to characterizing the copolymer structure that is responsible for the excellent hydrogel properties of these hydrogels, some specific applications were investigated:  The nanophase-separated hydrophilic/hydrophobic random copolymer hydrogels partially or completely inhibited ice formation to temperatures as low as -70&deg;C.  The ability to prevent water from freezing was due to the ~10 nm spacing of the phase separated hydrophobic nanodomains, which provided a microstructure similar to that of anti-freeze proteins. The distance between the nanodomains controlled how much the gel suppressed ice formation and the distance between nanodomains was controlled by the composition of the copolymer.  The ability of these hydrogels, which contain 50 - 80 wt% water, to suppress/inhibit ice formation may have biomedical applications, especially with regard to cell encapsulation and storage where freeze-thaw cycles may occur, as well as other applications where ice prevention is desirable, e.g., de-icing surfaces and preventing crops from freezing.  Hybrid hydrogels prepared  by covalently crosslinking copolymers of N,N-dimethylacrylamide (DMA), 2-(N-ethylperfluoro-octanesulfonamido) ethyl methacrylate (FOSM), hydroxyethyl acrylate and 2-cinnamoyloxyethyl acrylate and containing ~60-70% water exhibited shape memory behavior.
