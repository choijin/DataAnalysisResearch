<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for a three-day conference on Combinatorics, Graph Theory and Computing, to be held during May 23-25, 2013, at the Middle Tennessee State University. The conference will feature invited talks as well as contributed talks on a wide range of topics from graph theory and combinatorics. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference is the twenty-sixth in the series ``Cumberland Conference on Combinatorics, Graph Theory and Computing", which was begun with the intention of meeting a regional need. The conferences bring together internationally known researchers, university and college professors from throughout the southeastern region, some industrial mathematicians and computer scientists, graduate students in these fields, and some undergraduate students. Particular efforts are made to include faculty and students from smaller institutions throughout the region.</AbstractNarration>
