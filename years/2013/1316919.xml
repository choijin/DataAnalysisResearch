<AbstractNarration>This action funds Clarence Collins of University of Miami to conduct a research project in Geosciences during the summer of 2013 at the University of Tokyo in Kashiwa-shi, Japan.  The project title is "Study of Extreme Waves in the Pacific." The host scientist is Dr. Takuji Waseda.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The generation mechanism of extreme waves has been elusive up until recent studies began shedding some light on these mysterious phenomena. Research efforts have attempted to tackle the problem from different angles, examples of which include laboratory measurements, spectral wave modeling, and phase resolved numerical simulations. However, there remains a significant lack in field observations, especially with information describing the directional wave spectrum. This project provide thorough analysis of high quality field data in order to address this gap in current extreme wave science and to advance the understanding of extreme wave generation in hitherto unexpected ways.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, a webpage will be developed with a detailed introduction to extreme waves which will be updated with findings over the course of the EAPSI project. This page will be aimed at a general audience, but also include advanced information which could become a resource for interested students. Extreme waves cause damage to vessels and pose a danger to the people on these ships, and a better understanding of the extreme waves may be applied to save lives and prevent financial loss.</AbstractNarration>

The objective was of this project was to study the dataset to learn more about extreme waves and waves generated by tropical cylones. The obvious question is the following: are there more or less extreme waves during tropical cyclones. Our study has found that the answer is a definitive yes. We found for times that the wave field was dominated by waves generated by tropical cyclone winds that the likehood of observing an extreme wave was significantly higher. This finding shows that the already dangerous conditions in tropical cyclones due to the high winds and waves are made even more treacherous due to these unxpected waves. Future work will look at the structure of these waves to better understand how they are generated. It is hoped that findings will be used to improve seafarering safety.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/01/2013<br>      Modified by: Clarence&nbsp;O&nbsp;Collins</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2013/1316919/1316919_10245934_1385932638205_The_Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2013/1316919/1316919_10245934_1385932638205_The_Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa--rgov-800width.jpg" title="The Great Wave of Kanagawa"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2013/1316919/1316919_10245934_1385932638205_The_Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="The Great Wave of Kanagawa"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">An extreme wave depicted by Japanese artist Hokusai.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Hokusai</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Clarence&nbsp;O&nbsp;Collins</div> <div class="imageTitle">The Great Wave of Kanagawa</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
