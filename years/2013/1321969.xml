<AbstractNarration>This project will quantify the temporal and spatial variation of the global reconnection rates for a large range of solar wind conditions. The reconnection rate will be calculated by using the change in the magnetic flux that crosses the open-to-closed field line boundary. The calculation will make use of satellite images to determine the polar cap boundary and its changes while SuperDARN observations and the AMIE technique will be used to calculate polar cap convection. The AMIE technique uses ground magnetic observations. The calculations will give the reconnection rates for both magnetopause and magnetotail reconnection. They will be carried out for a wide range of magnetospheric activity including steady magnetospheric convection events, substorms and CME and CIR storms. They will create in SuperMAG a repository of the observations and code that will allow calculations of reconnection potentials for any solar wind and magnetospheric conditions. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The work will support a graduate student and the team at APL will continue to be active in STEM education at all levels.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Quantifying the temporal and spatial variation of the global reconnection rates during the entire range of solar wind conditions is a fundamental step toward establishing a relationship between the general circulation in the magnetosphere and solar wind input.  All the elements necessary to calculate a proxy of global reconnection rates exist in the form of disparate data sets and repositories. Introducing the ability to access all the pertinent data sets into one single repository and implementing an algorithm that properly combines them, has produced a new research resource that enables a broad range of statistical analyses, establishes a basis for mode-data comparison, and creates opportunities for testing current theories of circulation in the magnetosphere.  The inclusion of convection measurements to the SuperMAG data repository, the added ability to calculate global reconnection potentials for any solar wind-magnetosphere coupling condition, and the availability of these enhancements to the entire community benefits a broad spectrum of research projects. For instance, the Geospace Environment Modeling program expressly identifies the use of observations to constrain and feed models as one of its principal objectives going forward. The tools developed from this research are also available to all current (more than four hundred) and future users of SuperMAG.  The software architecture to calculate global reconnection using UV images and ionospheric convection is in place. We have decided to defer the release of a stand-alone interface for public use until we are certain that the proper flagging of mis-interpretations in the polar cap boundary by the algorithm is fully reliable. Currently the determination of polar cap boundary "goodness" is done visually frame by frame.
