<AbstractNarration>Online community question-and-answer systems such as Yahoo! Answers provide a venue where people can pose questions, provide answers and browse and comment on both. Such sites are now a central part of online interaction on a wide range of sites, including specialized sites for software development, tax preparation, and product support. In this projects, the PIs will experimentally answer a set of causal questions drawn from diverse research literatures about how to improve the performance of Q&amp;A systems, specifically what leads people to provide good quality answers (and questions), how to route questions so they are answered by the best possible member, how referrals and profiles affect questions and answers, and to what extent different kinds of incentives affect behavior on the site.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research is important because online question and answer systems have become an important source of information and advice for individuals and businesses, an important and economical way for businesses to help their customers support each other, as well as an important source of content for web search engines. By understanding these systems, building models of usage and testing designs to support their improved operation, the project will help systems designers understand approaches that can promote beneficial social experiences for users and that can inform the construction of valuable community-contributed repositories of knowledge. Additional benefits include the release of data sets for other researchers and the training of student researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project started with an effort to experimentally understand how different design features in community question-and-answer sites influence the success of those sites in attracting users.  The project started by building and deploying a small community Q&amp;A site (named GopherAnswers), specifically designed as a resource for University of Minnesota students, staff, and faculty.  In the process we developed significant Q&amp;A infrastructure and carried our substantial experiments on the ways in which advertising, incenting participation, and integrating with other content affected the success of these sites.  In the end, we concluded that integration with other user activities was a major determiner of site use, and we decided to shut down this site (as if could not withstand competition from Reddit) and shift our research to more integrated spaces.  A second round of research carried out experiments on MOOCs (massive open online courses), demonstrating that it is possible to identify and reuse valuable Q&amp;A content across course offering sessions.   This successful demonstration was published and promoted to MOOC operators; the design of those Q&amp;A forums is now different, supporting the potential for this type of reuse.  A third and fourth round of research focused directly on users and their interactions.  A set of studies explored the ways in which user action and inaction can be jointly interpreted to better provide a personalized experience for site users.  These studies included application of diverse machine learning algorithms across a variety of user goals to allow optimization for user self-reported preference, short-term user engagement (selecting items), long-term user engagement (return to site), and other goals.  Additionally, we carried out a set of studies on site users in their role as volunteer content creators, with two key findings:  (a) that initial experiences on the site are highly predictive of later contribution and user retention; in particular, users who experience a more diverse set of interaction on the site are more likely to remain active compared with those who experience a similar quantity, but with less variety; and (b) that "expert newcomers" who join a site with experience from another venue can be valuable, but that content expertise tends to trump prior leadership expertise in predicting a future useful contributor.    All of the work done as part of this project involved substantial training of students.  Five doctoral students were primarily involved in this project, four of them have completed their PhD, with three now in industry research jobs and one teaching at a University.  The fifth is completing his PhD over the next year.  Several undergraduate and masters students were also involved in the project, a few with NSF support but many more as part of their degree studies.
