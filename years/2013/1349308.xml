<AbstractNarration>An award is made to West Virginia University to support the only large living collection of a group of fungi (Glomeromycota) that form a mutually beneficial symbiosis with more than 80% of all plant species. This collection, called INVAM, has grown to almost 1300 strains from 49 countries and most habitats worldwide. These fungi are unique because they partnered with plants when they emerged onto land 400 million years ago and have coevolved exclusively with them. The collection provides valuable fungal strains to understand the basic biology and ecology of such a long-term relationship and the many ways in which this relationship can benefit different types of plants.  With this knowledge, fungal strains can be obtained and exploited to manage or promote these benefits and to improve or restore communities, especially those damaged by disturbance or environmental pollutants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to the preservation and maintenance of these fungal stocks, INVAM is tasked with making them available to the general public, researchers, teachers, and students, and offering services and information to these client groups that will promote scientific advancement, educational experiences, practical application and commercialization. A website at http://invam.wvu.edu provides extensive information on available stocks, taxonomy of the fungi, and methods for their culture and use.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>INVAM has housed and maintained more than 1000 strains of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, which form a mutual beneficial symbiosis with a majority of plants in all habitats worldwide. Holdings comprise 4-fold the species diversity and almost 30-fold the number of stocks relative to three other culture collections in the world. Taxonomic diversity is extensive given the difficulties in culturing these fungi, representing 40% of known species and encompassing diverse habitats on all continents except Antarctica. The culture of any strain requires expertise, facilities, and daily maintenance over a minimum of one year, thus making the collection valuable to research and industrial applications because very few have the time, expertise, and essential resources. Stocks include high-value strains of known symbiotic effectiveness and adaptation to a wide range of habitats. A large proportion of stocks have been maintained for 15-26 years, with less than 10% loss over that time period. Users of collection stocks included teachers and students at all educational levels, researchers, and industry clients, with an international scope involving where a little less than 50% of users are from outside the U.S. Usage has averaged 312 stocks to 48 users annually over the past five years. INVAM&rsquo;s service role includes providing comprehensive information on collection protocols and policies, methodology, and taxonomy to whomever finds it valuable. The public has access to stock availability that is updated daily on the collection&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://invam.wvu.edu">http://invam.wvu.edu</a>. The collection also has merit in possessing the largest number of reference species and vouchers for comparative studies and for genetic analyses. Collaborations with academic institutions and industry worldwide have furthered understanding of the biology and ecology of the fungi and their symbiosis and has provided germplasm essential to the development of inoculants for a wide range of applications in the public sector and for industry. Stocks in the collection have been used in startup ventures by companies in five countries. Some oversight of industry is provided by testing inoculants for quality and effectiveness. Large-scale restoration and revegetation projects have relied on INVAM for living materials and also in a consulting role. An average of 5-6 visitors annually received training and hands-on experience with diverse fungal stocks. INVAM routinely assisted students in classroom experiments, science fairs, honors projects, and other activities. While the primary purpose of the collection is to provide support and resources for educators, researchers, students, and industry, collection staff also has utilized those same resources to conduct research, often with collaborators, advancing basic knowledge and understanding of the evolution, the biology, the ecology, and the biogeographic patterns of the fungal symbionts. This information has been communicated in publications, talks, and public forums. Collaborations with industry has facilitated quality control standards and procedures as well as new applications benefiting improved plant health and sustainability.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 08/29/2018<br>      Modified by: Joseph&nbsp;B&nbsp;Morton</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
