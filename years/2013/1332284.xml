<AbstractNarration>The project at Fisk University, a Historically Black University, builds on lessons learned from a planning grant. The overall goal of the project is to enhance undergraduate student interest, retention, learning success, and pursuit of post-graduation training or careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) areas. Three main strategies were selected to overcome barriers to student success: innovation in developmental and early mathematics courses to achieve accelerated acquisition of STEM pre-requisite skills; introduction of Supplementary Instruction in all Gatekeeper STEM courses to achieve deeper learning and student retention; and introduction of course-embedded research in two required courses in each Natural Science discipline, and in one mathematics and computer science course, to enhance STEM interest, critical thinking and concept mastery. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will collect data concerning the suitability of evidence-based practices successful in research-based universities for implementation in small liberal arts colleges focused on increasing minority student access to STEM careers. Additionally, accelerated mathematics confidence and a deeper understanding of fundamental concepts for application in novel settings will facilitate academic success of students at Fisk University as STEM majors and in seeking STEM careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the potential for becoming a model for STEM education at small liberal arts institutions. The project is likely to have an impact on STEM education, student learning, and faculty practice.</AbstractNarration>
