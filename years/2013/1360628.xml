<AbstractNarration>This award provides support for the ninth meeting in the February Fourier Talks (FFT) series. The 2014 FFT will be held at the University of Maryland, College Park. The FFT is a high-level forum for harmonic analysts to bring their work to scientists from industry and government agencies. In addition, it allows experts in applied and pure harmonic analysis to become familiar with the latest problems in need of mathematical formulation and solution. Finally, it introduces young mathematicians and scientists to applied and pure harmonic analysis. More information, including a list of speakers and abstracts, registration information, and an archive of past conferences, can be found at the conference webpage: www.fft2014.org. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The February Fourier Talks directly encourage dialogue and collaboration between mathematicians and scientists working in industry and government. The structure of the conference consists of three main lectures, 30 minute invited talks, and a poster session that showcases the work of students (both undergraduate and graduate) as well as postdocs.  The conference encourages and financially supports participation by students, recent Ph.D. recipients, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics.</AbstractNarration>
