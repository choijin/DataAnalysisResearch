<AbstractNarration>In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Francisco Zaera of the University of California, Riverside is investigating the molecular processes by which hydrocarbons are converted from one compound to another on the surface of a metal, also termed catalysis.  The catalysis of hydrocarbon conversion reactions is central to many industrial processes, including oil refining, fine chemical synthesis, and food processing.  One of the major challenges in catalysis is to achieve high selectivity for one product over all other potential products, which would avoid wasting feedstocks and would minimize the production of polluting byproducts.  It has been shown that, in some catalysis on metal surfaces, selectivity may be controlled through variations in the atomic level structure of the surface, and this control offers new avenues for the design of highly desirable industrial processes.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In this project, Professor Zaera focuses on testing specific examples where hydrocarbon conversion may be controlled by using metal nanoparticles with specific shapes.  Three complementary experimental approaches are being used: a high-flux molecular beam to obtain accurate kinetic parameters for model metal samples with different structures under controlled environments, an operando arrangement for the in-situ characterization of corresponding adsorbed species by infrared (IR) spectroscopy, and a reactor for the kinetic and IR characterization of more realistic catalysts made out of metal nanoparticles with specific shapes dispersed on high-surface-area supports.  This project involves the training of graduate students, with an emphasis in recruiting students from groups underrepresented in science research fields by taking advantage of the several international outreach activities.  The broader impacts of this project also include the potential development of cleaner catalytic processes for energy and other applications.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The general hypothesis underpinning this project has been that there may be some sensitivity in the catalytic conversion of hydrocarbons with transition metals to the structure of their surfaces and that a better understanding of this dependence may be extracted from carefully conceived surface-science experiments.  Several interconnected mechanistic aspects of the reaction mechanisms of hydrocarbon hydrogenation and isomerization reactions were characterized in order to address this issue, including: (1) The transition from UHV environments to catalytic conditions; (2) The behavior of the strongly bonded carbonaceous deposits that form on the surface during catalysis as a function of reaction conditions, especially in the UHV-to-atmosphere transition; and (3) The trends in activity, selectivity, and coverages of surface species as a function of crystallographic orientation.  The main goal this terminal year has been to finalize our work on the mechanism of olefins on transition metals.  We focused on two still unresolved issues: (1) the role of the carbonaceous deposits that form on the surface and are present during reactions, and (2) the kinetics of hydrogen adsorption and activation under hydrogenation catalytic conditions.  The experiments have been carried out using ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) instrumentation, with a so-called high-pressure cell and a collimated molecular effusive beam, to better emulate the conditions of catalysis.  Much progress has been made in this work.  The catalytic hydrogenation of ethylene promoted by a Pt(111) single crystal was studied by using a ultrahigh- vacuum surface-science instrument equipped with a so-called high-pressure cell, and independent work was performed with a high0flux molecular beam to probe a previously untested intermediate pressure regime.  Isotope labelling was also used extensively.  The effect of carbonaceous deposits on the performance of Pt(111)?surfaces as catalysts for the hydrogenation of ethylene was tested by decoupling their?preparation under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV)?from the catalytic runs, which were carried out in an enclosed "high pressure" cell. Reaction rates were?seen to vary by up to approximately 40% depending on the type of molecules?preadsorbed at room temperature, with the maximum activity seen with a propylidyne?layer, the result of propylene adsorption.  These changes are reversible, and the surface regains the activity expected when starting with the clean substrate after one or two catalytic runs to full conversion, but more significant changes are seen if the adsorbed layers are dehydrogenated at higher temperatures, with the turnover frequencies for ethylene hydrogenation being reduced by more than an order of magnitude upon annealing at temperatures between 500 and 650 K.  Regarding hydrogen adsorption, a sharp increase in the rate of hydrogen isotope scrambling was identified during the hydrogenation of olefins with H2 + D2 mixtures on Pt(111) catalysts, which spectroscopic data suggest is due to a sudden increase in atomic hydrogen surface mobility because of a decrease in the size of the islands of the adsorbed hydrocarbons.   A new "reverse?" Eley&ndash;Rideal step between gas-phase ethylene and two deuterium atoms adsorbed on adjacent sites of the platinum surface was also identified.A total of 10 new scientific publications derived from this work during the last year of the project.  Our work fits nicely within the effort by the surface-science and catalysis communities to try to understand the microscopic details of heterogeneous catalysis. Our mechanistic and kinetic work is developing a picture of the factors that control the relative rates of different reactions, since these determine the selectivity of a given process.  This is expected in turn to help in the improvement of existing processes as well as in the designing of new ones.  In a more general sense, the development of ways to characterize mechanistic details of surface reactions can be extended to other areas, including the semiconductor industry, to tribological problems, and to solid interfaces of biological interest.  We have also collaborated recently with other faculty at the UC Riverside to develop new synthetic routes for catalysts that can be extended to other nanodevices.  We have trained a number of students and postdocs in the last few years.  They have then gone to take prominent academic or industrial positions.  We have also exposed undergraduate students to research projects; this has provided incentive for them to decide on continuing on to obtain doctorate degrees and to get involved in research work of their own.  We are currently hosting a summer minority undergraduate student under our REU program.       Last Modified: 08/01/2017       Submitted by: Francisco Zaera]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
