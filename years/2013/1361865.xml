<AbstractNarration>In this award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Robert W. Field of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his graduate student and undergraduate student colleagues are investigating the ways in which electrons and nuclei interact in Rydberg molecules. The ultimate goal of the work by Professor Field and his group is to develop a better understanding of the physics of molecules in which the outermost electron is barely bound to the ion-core.  The team explores how energy is transferred between the weakly bound electron and the nuclei in the ion core of these interesting quantum-mechanical systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A series of core-nonpenetrating Rydberg molecules (BaF, CaF, NO and NO2) will be produced with low energy using a buffer gas cooled molecular beam source coupled with STIRAP (Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage) and/or ASTRO (Adiabatically Focused Stark-mixed Rydberg Orbitals) excitation.  Intra-Rydberg transitions will be probed using Chirped Pulse mm wave Spectroscopy.  Experimental results will be compared to state-of-the-art theoretical methods.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Background: Based on everyday experience, we know that it is difficult to transfer kinetic energy from a ping-pong ball to a bowling ball. Similarly, electrons are light, molecular-ions are heavy: are there any efficient mechanisms for transferring energy and angular momentum between an electron (- charge) to an atomic or molecular cation (+ charge)?  Rydberg states are a highly energized electron weakly attached by Coulomb attraction to a cation.  The electron orbits around the ion like a planet orbits around the sun.  As for the planets, the period of the electron orbit is constant and depends, in a predictable way, on the electron's radial and angular momentum.  If the angular momentum is small, once each orbit the electron penetrates at extremely high kinetic energy inside the ion and interacts strongly and in a complicated manner with the ion. However, if the angular momentum is large, the electron does not penetrate inside the ion and the interaction is weak.  Via these weak interactions, the Rydberg electron acts as a secret spy providing a richly detailed report on the properties of the ion.  Our project has focused on the information-rich "core-nonpenetrating" Rydberg states.  A fundamental obstacle to our systematic study of nonpenetrating Rydberg states is the necessity to avoid being blinded by the molecule-destroying effects of the hard electron-ion collisions  in the "core-penetrating" Rydberg states.  To systematically explore the core-nonpenetrating Rydberg states, we must devise ways to "jump over the zone of death" in the core-penetrating states. We have explored and rejected the use of laser-plus-microwave STIRAP (Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage) and demonstrated the effectiveness of a three-laser sequential excitation scheme to high-orbital angular momentum Rydberg states     Intellectual Merit: The fundamental questions that we addressed in this project are: (i) how nonspherical (multipole moments) and easily distorted (polarizability) is a molecular cation?
