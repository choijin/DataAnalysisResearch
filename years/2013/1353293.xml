<AbstractNarration>Testing Technologies in the Behavioral Sciences&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Under the supervision of John Carson, Ph.D. student Katerina Mishuris will document the  science behind and technologies developed for mental health and intelligence testing. With a focus on gifted children, and gender differences, the co-PI will contribute to the history of the behavioral sciences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The identification and nurturing of gifted children, is important to contemporary democracies, where intellectual and artistic capital is essential to the advancement of national prosperity. This study promises to help behavioral scientists, who are exploring questions of talent, to better comprehend conflicting theories of child giftedness and the methods for its investigation, and hence allow them to become more sensitive and alert researchers and diagnosticians.</AbstractNarration>
