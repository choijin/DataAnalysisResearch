<AbstractNarration>This research project will develop high-resolution, multi-century reconstructions of major flooding in the Mississippi River Basin based on analyses of tree rings and to use these reconstructions to help determine the true natural variability of large magnitude flooding prior to the modern period of direct flood measurements.  These reconstructions will provide a long-term context for analyses of extreme flood events that have occurred in the modern period and allow the examination of the role played in destructive flooding by regional and large-scale climate variability and other natural and human-related factors. Results of the research project will greatly increase basic understanding of long-term flood variability in the region and help develop and refine techniques useful for the study of flood history in large-river systems in North America and elsewhere. Beyond meeting specific research objectives, the project will provide education and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and will provide for improved teaching of undergraduate students and others based on project findings that demonstrate the relevance of atmospheric science as well as the importance of societal resilience to natural hazards.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Destructive flooding long has long plagued many communities along major rivers, including the Mississippi River and its principal tributaries.  For more than a century, scientists and engineers have attempted to determine the frequency and magnitude of flooding in this river system.  Scientists also have sought to understand not only the links between flooding and natural climate variability but also how potential climate change and direct human modification of the hydrology of the river may affect future flood patterns.  This project will address several methodological and theoretical issues. The principal methodological questions concern whether it is possible to quantitatively reconstruct and model extreme flooding prior to the instrumental period and to determine how well the observational record represents the envelope of natural variability.  Answers to both of these questions are necessary to determine broader questions concerning the link between extreme flooding and climate variability, including the questions of whether and how changes in climate and other natural and human systems may affect flood behavior and the risk to those who reside in river basin.   This project will answer these questions using both tree-ring records of flooding and hydrological models to estimate the occurrence, magnitude, and discharge of major pre-instrumental floods.  This approach has rarely been used in the past, and it should provide the necessary long-term context for extreme events observed in the modern period and reveal relevant links to climate forcing that will help answer questions regarding the potential impact of climate and other changes on this river system.  This approach holds great promise for being applied in other river basins and for use to address other natural-hazard questions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Many communities and economic sectors along the Mississippi and its principal tributaries have long been affected by flooding. The first reports of destructive flooding on the Mississippi began with the founding of New Orleans in 1718 and catastrophic floods such as those in 1785 and 1844 severely affected many early settlements in the region.  The profound environmental and social consequences of major 20th century floods such as those in 1927 and 1937 are well documented and more recent floods such as those in 1993, 2008 and 2011 have spurred recent research to try and understand the underlying causes of major flooding including the effects of climate and human changes to the river (such as levees and dredging).  Determining how often major floods naturally occur on the Mississippi is an important issue not only because of concerns such as loss of life, damage to private and public infrastructure (such as roads and bridges), but also in terms of placing extreme climate events experienced in the modern period (that is the 20th century), into a long-term context. Prior to the mid-to-late 19th century, instrumental records of flooding on the Mississippi are limited, particularly in the western tributaries. This lack of long detailed records of flooding hampers attempts to determine the potential range of how severe floods have been in the past and how often they have occurred.  Tree-ring records have long been used estimate streamflow before gage measurements began, but nearly all of these tree-ring records are derived from trees that do not grow in the floodplain. It is known that some tree species growing in the floodplain can record high flow/flood conditions in their growth rings. However, until now, these records have only been investigated to a very limited extent, and almost no records of this type have been developed in the Mississippi Basin where many communities and ecosystems are highly vulnerable to large-magnitude flood events.  The primary goal of this research project is to attempt to answer three important questions about Mississippi River floods; 1) can tree-ring records be used to accurately determine when and where major floods have occurred over the past several centuries, 2) were floods over the past several centuries larger and more frequent than those we have measured in the 20th century, and 3) how are multi-year (decade-scale) changes in flood timing and size linked to specific patterns of large-scale atmospheric and ocean circulation patterns?

This work demonstrates the utility of flood-ring records to contribute to understanding both the history of flooding and the role of climate variability in the region. These findings also support other studies, which suggest that this technique is potentially widely applicable on other large rivers in North America and other areas.  This improved understanding of the nature and causes of flood hazards in the region represents an important societal benefit by providing new and enhanced knowledge concerning both how large potential future flood events not measured in the gage record might be, and how climate variability and human modification of the river (levees, dredging) have affected past events and may exacerbate those in the future.  Given the environmental and socioeconomic importance as well as the highly managed nature of the study region, the potential benefit of the project is relatively large compared to its scope.  In addition to research benefits, the project provided educational, research, and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students (including several women) at two institutions as well as professional development for the PIs.
