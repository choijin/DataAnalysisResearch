<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Polymer networks composed of thermally reversible crosslinks have become popular in mendable, recyclable, and smart materials.  These materials have the ability to respond to stimuli such as light exposure or temperature change with a change in material properties, impacting fields from metamaterials and biomaterials to microdevices, additive manufacturing and photolithography. Here, a class of thermoreversible polymer networks will be developed based on Diels-Alder networks; however, by using those networks in combination with one of two other thiol-vinyl click reactions, a new class of materials offering fundamental and practical advantages will be explored. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Understanding of thermoreversible networks will be translated into several approaches for achieving the potential of these polymers to be used as smart, self-healing materials.  In particular, controlled elimination of thermoreversiblity (i.e., through a Michael addition reaction) either of a uniform fraction of the crosslinks or with spatiotemporal control of the reversible crosslinks should create novel materials, approaches and understanding that enables the complex fabrication and physicochemical patterning of polymer networks and subsequent devices in 3D.  Specifically, (i) new polymeric materials will be created that combine thermoreversible networks with conventional irreversible networks, including the ability to eliminate the thermoreversibility in a spatiotemporally controlled manner,   (ii) the network structure will be systematically varied and the relationship between reversible bond structures and rheological, mechanical, and healing behavior will be assessed,   (iii) direct-write and layer-by-layer approaches for additive manufacturing approaches to 3D devices will be developed, and   (iv) dual-stage shape-memory polymers will be created with two distinct thermal transitions associated with the glass transition and the crosslink reversibility.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thermosetting plastic materials, as a multibillion dollar industry, are ubiquitous in high technology applications that range broadly from dental materials to additive manufacturing to photovoltaic coatings to advanced optical materials and many others.  These polymers are highly functional, specialty materials whose performance is largely dependent on the underlying molecular structure, which is comprised traditionally of irreversible molecular bonds. While this structure gives rise to many of the desired attributes of these materials, that same structure limits their behavior and prevents them from being self-healing, recyclable, or able to change their permanent shapes.  Here, through the development of special molecular approaches to these materials that renders the structure reversible at appropriate times and conditions, thermosetting polymers will be formed that combine the optimal features of traditional thermosets with those of smart, responsive materials.  This approach will be used to develop improved materials and approaches for use in the fabrication of complex 3D parts by additive manufacturing, novel optical applications, and use as reformable, recyclable, and healable thermosetting polymers.  Beyond the technological advances, this approach simultaneously has significant broader impacts associated with the training of a future workforce in an interdisciplinary combination of polymer chemistry, materials science, and optics.  The graduate and undergraduate students involved in this project will also participate in the launching of a new Materials Science and Engineering PhD degree at the University of Colorado that will lead to the training of highly qualified researchers for the materials science and engineering workforce.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Polymers are described as long molecules, which when entangled like loose strings, form a solid mass known as a plastic.  These tangles can be undone by the addition of heat or solvent, but if they are tied together the polymer strings become an intractable ?crosslinked? network, impervious to attempts to undo the knotted mass.  For many polymer applications these knots are desirable.  In 1844, Charles Goodyear was awarded a patent for vulcanization of rubber, wherein he chemically fused or crosslinked the long polymeric compounds together.  The result was a material with superior toughness and durability.  Crosslinking, however, has some drawbacks.  Once a network is formed, it becomes impossible to reprocess.  It can be cut, ground or burned, but it cannot be molded or recycled.   Recently polymer chemists have been exploring ways in which this crosslinking is reversed or exchanged, as if the knots in the network were being untied and then retied by addition of an external energy input or stimulus.  This is done by replacing the permanent crosslinks with dynamic covalent chemical (DCC) bonds.  There is a suite of chemical reactions that result, not in irreversible conjugations, but in linkages that break and reform on demand.   This project, ?Combining Reversible and Permanent Crosslinks in Thermosets for High Technology Applications? took advantage of these DCC reactions to combine the advantageous properties of linear and network polymers.  More than that, however, the employment of multiple independent means to turn that dynamic chemistry on and off has permitted the development of materials with unprecedented adaptability and capabilities.   Several material platforms were explored here.  The Diels Alder reaction is a DCC wherein more bonds are formed at lower temperatures.  So, heating a material causes it to undergo ?reverse gelation,? a process resembling melting as the material becomes a liquid.  Here, networks were designed that combined both irreversibly crosslinked polyurethane material and reversible, Diels Alder crosslinked components.  This allowed the material to be exogenously healed by heating while maintaining its original shape (see Figure 1).   The thiol/thioester exchange was another DCC that showed remarkable flexibility for the development of adaptable networks.  Unlike the Diels Alder networks, in which a fraction of the bonds are intact and a fraction are broken, the bonds in a thiol/thioester exchange reaction break and reform essentially simultaneously.  This means that the materials don?t undergo reverse gelation.  Nevertheless, under an applied stress, these materials will behave in a fluid manner, exchanging bonds to accommodate those external forces, ultimately resulting in a moldable network.  For this reaction to take place, a base catalyst is necessary.  Figure 2, for example, shows a material that has been cut into fine pieces and subsequently healed and molded.  Because the thiol/thioester exchange reaction is base catalyzed, fluid-like plasticity within thioester networks is turned on by employment of photo-activated bases.  Alternatively, photo-activated acids can arrest the exchange reaction by consuming the basic catalyst.  In this way, these materials were engineered with both an ?on switch? and an ?off switch? controlled by the exposure to appropriate wavelengths of light.  Figure 3 depicts the transfer of a photomasked image of a buffalo to a texture-imprinted material.  Where the material is exposed to the light the texture (nanoscopic ridges) are either transferred or not transferred depending on whether the exchange reaction is turned on or off by light exposure.  With regards to intellectual merit of this project, the combination of both reversible and irreversible chemistries employed here has significantly expanded the understanding, implementation and potential for covalent adaptable networks.  The employment of photo-active catalysts and photoactive inhibitors, in the context of the thioester-containing networks, allows for remarkable temporal control of the thiol/thioester exchange reaction and represents the creation of a material for which the phase of the material can be switched in a bistable manner by light exposure.  With regards to broader impacts, these complementary chemical on and off switches suggest exciting opportunities in the development of recyclable materials as well as for additive manufacturing technologies. Generally, the approach to polymer networks taken in this project lays a foundation on which recyclable, reprocessable and reusable thermosetting polymer networks can be developed. A start-up company has been formed to take advantage of this technology.  Further, this project has allowed a number of graduate and undergraduate students to develop both in research conduct and laboratory skills. Students have engaged in research as part of a team and learned to collaborate with others to achieve their goals. Both graduate and undergraduate students have participated in poster or oral presentations to hone their scientific communication skills. The PI of this project has also launched a Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) doctoral program at the University of Colorado that will continue to impact a multitude of students each year, allowing students to engage in cutting-edge materials science research.
