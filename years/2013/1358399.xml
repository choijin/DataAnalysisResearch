<AbstractNarration>The main goal of this 3-year SHINE project is to apply the tomographic analysis to heliospheric data from available remote-sensing observations of interplanetary scintillation (IPS), archival white-light observations from SMEI (Solar Mass Ejection Imager), and extend this technique to the HI-2 (Heliospheric Imager-2) instruments onboard the STEREO spacecraft.  This research effort will allow the project team to discover the differences between their own robust measurements of the kinematic propagation of these parameters near the Earth and the physical processes governing the propagation of features from near the solar surface using three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models.  The project contributes to broader societal activities, such as advancing the participation of women in science and improving the scientific literacy of the general public.  The project team will present the results of this research project at national scientific meetings and will publish them in peer-reviewed scientific journals.  The research and EPO agenda of this SHINE project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research agenda of this SHINE project consists of four main tasks, namely: (i) compare the University of California in San Diego (UCSD) tomographic modeling with MHD modeling to learn the physical differences between these two very different types of remote sensing analyses; (ii) pursue inter-comparison of 3D MHD modeling techniques that all use the same boundary conditions in order to learn the best physical parameters needed to propagate time-dependent structures; (iii) perform analysis of these interplanetary structures in order to determine and provide the lacking magnetic field inputs required for the tomographic kinematic model propagation; and, (iv) perform new analyses using iterative 3D MHD codes that refine remote sensing observations from solar heliospheric observations and IPS measurements.  The outcome of this research project is expected to yield new improved boundary inputs, based on multiple data sets (that incorporate both remote-sensing observations and in-situ measurements), for various 3D MHD models, and especially for Space Weather models, and an analysis that displays the global properties of heliospheric structures.  The project would provide new physical insight on "the solar cycle dependence of CMEs, including their propagation through and their interaction with the background solar wind, including the linking of interplanetary and near-Sun phenomena," as stated in the goals of the NSF's SHINE program.</AbstractNarration>

These are 1) the University of Alabama, Huntsville (UAH) MS-FLUKSS model; 2) the Naval Research Laboratory group H3D-MHD model; and 3) Dusan Odstrcil (Collaborator on this effort) and the ENLIL 3-D MHD model. The boundary use for ENLIL modeling in real time has continued and been updated throughout this period, and has been distributed for analyses at George Mason University and at the Korean Space Weather Center (KSWC). Over the duration of this project there has been significant progress on all four items stated in the original proposal summary, as described in the journal articles (16) and presentations (&gt;100) associated with the contract. At the end of this effort we have produced an IPS-iterated 3-D MHD framework (Figure 2) that allows tests of the physical relationships between heliospheric data and iterated 3-D MHD modeling fits; the ultimate goal of this proposed effort.</p> <p>The intellectual merit of these activities includes provision of boundary inputs based on multiple data sets (that incorporate both remote-sensing observations and <em>in-situ </em>measurements) for various 3-D MHD models, but especially for Space-Weather modeling, and an analysis that displays the global properties of heliospheric structures. The finer resolutions available from the SMEI data set are now also being utilized to measure both global- and small-scale solar wind features such as the density enhancements associated with the X-ray jetting response, shock density enhancements, and the structure of solar filaments. These reconstructed results, which can be extracted at any height, bear the imprint of complex, and often not entirely understood, physical processes occurring from the Sun's surface outwards; these therefore can be efficiently used as input for numerical models of the heliosphere and to further our understanding of the fundamental physical processes of the space environment from the Sun to Earth.</p> <p>Our work has broad impact on the field of solar-terrestrial physics as a whole. Our studies make visible this difficult-to-depict region between the Sun and Earth (Figures 3-6 examples). The time-dependent boundaries of this sort are available at a daily cadence, but are interpolated at 6-hour or finer intervals for use in the MHD models. The onset of the sample CME shown in the Figure 6 boundary is observed in both models, but is considerably different at the time shown. In general densities are somewhat lower in the kinematic model at the inner boundary and velocities somewhat higher. These lower boundaries and the fits at 1 AU indicate the acceleration present in MHD modelling, that is unlike the kinematic modelling, as slow CME structures move outward into the inner heliosphere. The images we produce are easily described to those not in the field and as such they provide a valuable tool for world-wide research and education. In addition, Solar MHD models generally use photospheric magnetic-field observations and approximate plasma parameters (velocity, density, and temperature) as conditions for a boundary at the base of the heliosphere, and then extrapolate these outward. The boundary data extracted from IPS, SMEI and HI observations provide direct determinations of the heliospheric structures globally at greater distances from the Sun, and this makes it possible to create an accurate predictive tool for the Earth plasma and magnetic-field environment by iteratively judging these parameters as they get closer to Earth.</p> <p><strong>References:</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;Jackson, B.V., Odstrcil, D., Yu, H.-S., Hick, P.P., Buffington, A., Mejia-Ambriz, J.C., Kim, J., Hong, S., Kim, Y., Han, J., and Tokumaru, M., 2015a, &lsquo;The UCSD IPS Solar Wind Boundary and its use in the ENLIL 3D-MHD Prediction Model&rsquo;, <em>Space Weather</em>, <strong>13</strong>, 104-115, doi: 10.1002/ 2014SW001130.</p> <p>Yu, H.-S., Jackson, B.
