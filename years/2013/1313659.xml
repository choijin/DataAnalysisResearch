<AbstractNarration>This CNH project is about livelihood transitions that poor rural communities in developing countries are making in order to cope with deteriorating environmental conditions, shifting social trends, and broader changes in governance.  While the transformation of livelihood activities has the potential to improve human well-being, food security, and ecological sustainability, it can also have the opposite effect and increase the vulnerability of the human population and the ecosystems that support them.  In the drylands of Africa, about 100 million pastoralists rely heavily or solely on livestock production for their subsistence. Modernization has brought drastic political and social changes, as well as unprecedented population growth, land degradation and more frequent droughts that decimate herds. Today, many pastoralists are adopting crop agriculture alongside their struggling livestock-based livelihood system as an avenue for much-needed diversification. Such a transformation entails profound changes in the ecological functioning of landscapes, the level of risk exposure faced by households and whole communities, and the authorities and rules governing land use and land rights. Given the complexity and novelty of these changes, assessing the conditions under which social and ecological vulnerability is likely to be alleviated or exacerbated is a profound challenge, but is urgently needed as traditional subsistence-level societies worldwide face similarly uncertain futures.  This research will assess how the transition to agro-pastoralism in two Maasai communities in Kenya is affecting three components of social-ecological vulnerability: the ecosystem's sensitivity to drought and shifting grazing pressure; the degree of risk exposure that households take on as they make the transition; and the coping capacity afforded by the suite of new rules and practices adopted by the communities.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach adopted in this research is based on advances in complex systems theory, which can be applied to ecosystems, human interactions, and governance systems alike.  This approach is also highly advantageous because it enables the use of information about easily-measured, small-scale interactions to understand and predict broader trends such as tipping points and thresholds, which emerge at the level of the whole social-ecological system.   By developing theoretically grounded methods to evaluate multiple dimensions of vulnerability, this research will build transformative links between theory and real-world empirical assessments.  It will directly enhance the ability of scientists to understand and solve other complex sustainability problems emerging around the world.  Through ongoing participation and dialogue, research procedures and findings will be shared with local community members as tools for empowerment and sustainability planning. Cooperative ties with key colleagues in regional academic, development, and conservation communities will ensure that the research tools developed will enhance the approaches and impact of other sustainability initiatives and research programs. The project's mentored PhD student and postdoc will gain a unique learning experience of the value of science-society collaborations for high-impact research outcomes.  This project is supported by the NSF Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH) Program.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Poverty, food insecurity, and environmental degradation are critical threats to the well-being and future sustainability of hundreds of millions of people in the drylands of Africa.&nbsp; Studying how these interconnected conditions arose, how they form self-reinforcing cycles, and how societies cope and adapt, provides critical information for identifying effective, sustainable strategies for these regions.&nbsp; More broadly, this knowledge helps us understand these crises wherever they arise globally &ndash; from inner cities, to depressed rural farming communities, to booming emerging nations.&nbsp; This project focused on a case study that serves as a microcosm for these grand challenges &ndash;a small livestock-herding community in the drylands of Kenya.&nbsp;</p> <p>Livestock-based societies in Africa fundamentally depend on dryland savanna vegetation.&nbsp; Because rainfall is scarce and highly variable, people rely on the key adaptation of mobility &ndash; moving their herds seasonally over vast areas &ndash; to access fodder and to avoid depleting local vegetation.&nbsp; The animals in turn provide the mainstay of herding peoples' diets through milk and meat. Yet profound socio-economic and political changes in African drylands over the last century have resulted in land loss and restricted mobility. Pastoralists&rsquo; land has been appropriated for agriculture and wildlife parks; mobile herding societies have been politically marginalized as backward; and the ecological and social benefits of mobility were largely unappreciated until the 1990s. Today, however, we recognize that livestock-tending is one of the only sustainable production systems for drylands. Yet without mobility it becomes unsustainable: land is degraded, droughts decimate herds, and families lose their most important source of wealth and food security.</p> <p>We studied ecological and human dynamics as residents endeavored to cope, adapt, and transform their livelihoods in response to environmental, social, economic and political pressures that have eroded their capacity to sustain their customary lifeways. Our work led to 7 key outcomes, with regional and global implications for sustainable development.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>1. We constructed a simulation model to understand how limited mobility and variable rainfall affect grass availability.&nbsp; Our study revealed that with restricted mobility, multi-season periods of low rainfall can shift the entire landscape into a low-productivity state for a decade or more, even with subsequent high-rainfall years.&nbsp; Thus, short-term crisis-oriented interventions like giving people animals after drought losses are unlikely to restore livelihood security if vegetation takes many years to recover.</p> <p>2. Using ecological and social science methods, we identified vegetation changes over the last 35 years, and a complex cascade of factors driving them.&nbsp; Due to mobility loss, cattle deaths during droughts, and changes in economics, people adapted by keeping more sheep and goats.&nbsp; This intensified local livestock pressure and, along with drought frequency and increasing elephant populations, created changes in pressures on vegetation.&nbsp; The study showed how land and conservation policies can concentrate landscape pressures and constrain herding livelihoods.</p> <p>3. Over about 3 decades, several residents adopted camel-herding to cope with drought and rangeland degradation.&nbsp; Today, a few successful camel-owners have gained considerable livelihood security, but financial and cultural factors pose barriers to more widespread adoption.&nbsp; Our study revealed that, although successful camel adoption provides household-level benefits, it may increase wealth inequality in the community and weaken social cohesion and cooperation.</p> <p>4. In 2011, a charity encouraged community members to begin irrigated crop farming as livelihood adaptation strategy.&nbsp; We studied the experiences and characteristics of farmers to see whether this strategy would increase food security for some, or alternatively actually increase vulnerability for farmers or others.&nbsp; By 2015, all farmers had quit, illustrating that well-intentioned development strategies can backfire if promoted without also providing communities with knowledge and access to key resources necessary for successful adaptation.</p> <p>5.&nbsp; Several wildlife conservation organizations, which seek to balance conservation and livelihood betterment, have pursued partnerships with the community.&nbsp; Our analysis of social institutions and political dynamics found that organizations provided useful assistance to the community to secure their land title.&nbsp; But they also influenced natural resource governance and priorities in ways that may benefit wildlife, but decreased community autonomy and rangeland access. These findings challenge the "win-win" narratives that such organizations often espouse.</p> <p>6. &nbsp;Unlike many communal land tenure systems that have collapsed with economic and social changes, this community has maintained its land as a common pool resource.&nbsp; We studied four smaller, within-community examples of resource privatization, to learn how potential conflicts and inequalities were navigated and negotiated, providing valuable lessons about their imperfect yet resilient governance of the commons.</p> <p>7. This multifaceted case study relied on interdisciplinary analysis and cooperation to arrive at insights regarding the complex pathways and interactions which mediate environmental degradation, poverty, and food insecurity. Local technicians, a PhD student and a postdoctoral scholar have gained invaluable experience in the process and importance of such research, and are poised to pursue careers that further strengthen global efforts for sustainable development.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/17/2017<br>      Modified by: Elizabeth&nbsp;G&nbsp;King</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div
