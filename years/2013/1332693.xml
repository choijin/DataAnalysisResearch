<AbstractNarration>The National Academies will plan and organize a cross-disciplinary public workshop to explore perspectives on the training that students from diverse fields need in order to extract value from Big Data. The workshop will identify key skills that are needed to prepare students for analyzing Big Data. It will consider the needs of industry, academia, and government and build on the experience gained from emerging courses and curricula for this topic. Invited participants to the workshop will include experts in statistics, machine learning, databases, large-scale computing systems, streaming computing, user domains, health and biological informatics, and industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many traditional methods for data analysis do not work, or do not work well, with the massive amounts of data emerging in numerous endeavors. In order to reliably extract insight from Big Data, students need to learn new skills, and many of those skills cut across multiple disciplines and, thus, are not necessarily accessible through standard courses and curricula. During the academic year 2012-2013, a number of courses were introduced at various universities to impart the needed understanding. The planned workshop will enable educators to share insights gained from these courses and make adjustments. A summary report of the workshop will make these insights available more broadly.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Project Outcomes Report for the General Public   For Award #1332693  "WORKSHOP ON TRAINING STUDENTS TO EXTRACT VALUE FROM BIG DATA"  Period of Performance:  08/15/2013 - 07/31/2015   The subject grant supported a workshop by the National Research Council to address the following charge:  "An ad hoc committee will plan and conduct a public workshop on the subject of training undergraduate and graduate students to extract value from big data. The committee will develop the agenda, select and invite speakers and discussants, and moderate the discussions. The presentations and discussions at the workshop will be designed to enable participants to share experience and perspectives on the following topics:  What current knowledge and skills are needed by big data users in industry, government, and academia?  What will students need to know to be successful using big data in the future (5-10 years out)?  How could curriculum and training evolve to better prepare students for big data at the undergraduate and graduate levels?  What options exist for providing the necessary interdisciplinary training within typical academic structures?  What computational and data resources do colleges and universities need in order to provide useful training? What are some options for assembling that infrastructure?"  The workshop was hosted on April 11-12, 2014 at the Keck Center of the National Academies in Washington, D.C.  It brought together diverse speakers and participants from academia, industry, and government to discuss topics such as:  the need for training; principles of working with big data; courses, curricula, and interdisciplinary programs; shared resources; and open discussions on takeaway lessons and other topics.  The National Academies produced the report Training Students to Extract Value from Big Data: Summary of a Workshop [National Academies Press, Washington, D.C., 2014], which was released to the public on October 10, 2014.  The workshop was successful in bringing together members of the mathematical, statistical, and computational communities to discuss key characteristics of training for big data and to help bridge divides.  The report has been widely referenced and highly downloaded (over 8,000 downloads in the year since its release).
