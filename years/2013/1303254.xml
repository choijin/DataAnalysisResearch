<AbstractNarration>Three Southeastern Number Theory Meetings are planned for the year 2013-2014. The first conference is scheduled to be held at Davidson College (Davidson, NC) on September 21-22, 2013. A second conference is planned for December 7-8, 2013 at Clemson University (Clemson, SC). A third conference will be held at the University of South Carolina (Columbia, SC) in Spring 2014, currently scheduled for April 12-13, 2014. Further information for these meetings will be linked to the conference pages http://www.math.sc.edu/~boylan/seminars/pantshome.html and http://www.math.clemson.edu/~kevja/SERMON/. The primary goal of these meetings is to provide the number theory community in the Southeast the opportunity to hear about recent research in number theory, pure and applied. The meetings attract prominent number theorists outside the region. They also provide regional mathematicians, particularly graduate students and junior faculty, with an opportunity to speak about their research.The frequency and regularity of the meetings promotes collaboration and strengthens working relationships between participants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Southeastern Number Theory Meetings consist of two main conference series. Initiated in 2006, the Palmetto Number Theory Series is a series of number theory meetings managed jointly by Clemson University and the University of South Carolina. The SouthEast Regional Meeting On Numbers is a larger regional meeting that has been in effect since 1988. These meetings inspire collaboration and broaden the scope of existing research interests within the general subject of number theory. Meeting participants include mathematicians of all levels: undergraduates, graduate students, post-docs, junior and senior faculty. The meetings have, in particular, provided an invaluable opportunity to students and young researchers in this region working in number theory, strengthening their knowledge of this research area and allowing them to disseminate their work while at the same time obtaining constructive criticism from other participants. These participants come from Ph.D. granting institutions, institutions whose highest degree awarded is a master's degree, and from institutions granting only baccalaureate degrees. The organizers will also continue to attract a demographically diverse participant base, including women and other underrepresented groups.</AbstractNarration>
