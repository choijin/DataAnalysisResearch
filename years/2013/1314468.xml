<AbstractNarration>The critical role of spectrum as a catalyst for economic growth was highlighted in the 2010 National Broadband Plan (NBP).  A challenge for the NBP is realizing optimal spectrum sharing in the presence of interference caused by rogue transmissions from any source, but particularly secondary users who share the spectrum.  This complex problem straddles wireless technology, industrial economics, international standards, and regulatory policy.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This interdisciplinary, multi-university collaborative project studies the many dimensions of the problem from algorithms to law enforcement.  The investigators study (1) ex-ante spectrum rule enforcement mechanisms (i.e., preventive) such as spectrum access control via policy reasoners, (2) ex-post spectrum rule enforcement schemes (i.e., punitive) with policy conformance monitoring that employ cryptographic commitments, (3) ex-post enforcement schemes that can uniquely identify rogue transmitters, and (4) the economic viability of spectrum sharing with different enforcement schemes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project provides a broad range of education and industry outreach activities in order to rapidly insert research advances into curriculum and university-industry partnerships.  Specifically, the investigators will present short courses and tutorials at the annual Virginia Tech Wireless Symposium and Summer School, and widely disseminate findings through NSF Industry &amp; University Collaborative Research Centers (I/UCRC) at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF award has allowed for the creation and analysis of a comprehensive data set on auctions of U.S. spectrum related to mobile services undertaken by Federal Communications Commission (FCC) between 1997 and 2017. The data were collected, cleaned and made public (when not proprietary) at https://sites.duke.edu/connollyspectrumlab/.  These data were both collected and analyzed by participants in the Spectrum Lab at Duke University, which was initially created using this NSF award.  Since the lab?s creation in 2014, over 28 students, primarily undergraduate students, have participated in over seven research topics related to spectrum auctions and policy.  Several of these research papers have been presented at both academic and policy conferences, and will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed academic journals.  In our empirical work, we have captured changing values of different types of spectrum over time, the impact of preferential treatments in auction, and have quantified the extreme use of such preferential treatments in auctions related to mobile services. In particular, we discovered that almost half of all such licenses from 1997 to 2016 were won by bidders using preferential treatments and that licenses won using preferential treatments amount to over a quarter of the total value of licenses related to mobile services. We have also analyzed the first two-sided auction ever undertaken by the FCC to document both valuation and potential differences in outcomes due to the difference in auction design in the Incentive auction.   With my Co-PI, we have also completed a working paper of a theoretical model of spectrum sharing. This can be used in the future in conjunction with our other empirical findings to simulate potential outcomes under shared spectrum environments.
