<AbstractNarration>What are the radial profiles, shapes, extents and orientations of the dark matter halos that surround galaxies? This fundamental question is particularly difficult to address in the outskirts of galaxies where there are few visible tracers. Perhaps the most promising approach is to use stellar debris from the destruction of satellite galaxies, and the most promising place to try this approach is the Milky Way - the one galaxy in the Universe where a halo's 3-dimensional structure (rather than a 2-dimensional projection) can be directly probed.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support a combined observational and theoretical approach to providing a new and powerful perspective on accreted halo substructures, and, in particular, poorly-studied stellar clouds. The observational program focuses on obtaining radial velocities for stars in known stellar clouds, and making connections between debris structures - from the Solar vicinity to the outer Galaxy, and from one side of the Galaxy to another. Such connections will yield the first comprehensive maps of these stellar debris structures on Galactic scales. Interpreting these maps with a systematic suite of simulations will fill in our missing knowledge of the Galaxy's accretion history and matter distribution.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will support the training of one minority student in their transition from undergraduate to graduate school through participation in Columbia's "Bridge to the PhD" program. It will also enable the PIs to actively engage students, amateur astronomers and the general public in building an understanding of the history of our home galaxy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goals of this project are to measure the mass distribution of the Milky Way's dark matter halo using the stellar debris arising from the destruction of satellite galaxies by the gravitational tidal forces of our home galaxy.  In many cases, the stellar debris stripped from these satellites forms long, coherent, arcing streams of stars, and such streams are useful tools for reconstructing the accretion history of the Milky Way, which grows by the agglomeration of smaller structures over time.  However, unlike previous research efforts, this project is placing emphasis on stellar debris that is of another morphological character --- stellar clouds, which are thought to arise from the destruction of satellite galaxies that were disrupted along rather more eccentric orbits than those that form streams. The work funded by this proposal combined observational and theoretical approaches to provide new perspectives on these poorly-studied debris structures, by (1) verifying and characterizing previously identified, candidate cloud-like structures around our Galaxy, (2) theoretically exploring the differences between debris of this morphology and the more familiar debris streams from satellite disruption, and (3) using the combined data and theory to reassess the gravitational potential of the Milky Way.   Most of the theoretical efforts in this project were led by the Columbia University collaborators.  The emphasis of the UVa group's contributions to this project have been primarily on the observational and data analysis side.   As part of this effort we collected spectra on K and M giant stars with UVa's Fan Mountain Observatory 1-m telescope to contribute to previous databases on K anmd M giant stars that have have been a foundation for the various observational studies on halo substructures in this longstanding collaboration.  A large part of this work came as part of the PhD thesis of UVa graduate student Guillermo Damke.  Several chapters of his recently completed PhD thesis focused on developing new methods for analyzing M giant spectra collected on various 4-m class telescopes for this project over the past decade or so, and then placing them into a global context.  In particular, a method was developed to solve simultaneously solve for the chemical enrichment level, intrinisic luminosity and distance of an M giant star using combined spectroscopic and photometric data.  Using this and other analytical tools, we continued to work on analysis of stars in the most prominent Milky Way debris substructure, the Sagittarius star stream.  Through detailed analysis, we were able to identify some extremely distant M giant members of the Sagittarius stream and these rare stars have allowed us to grow the known angular extent of the Sagittarius stream beyond what had been done in earlier studies.  These particuilar stars present new constraints on Milky Way mass models that drive the shape of streams like Sagittarius.  These same techniques for analyzing the M giant spectra are also being applied to other structures identified by their M giant populations, like the A13 and Triangulum-Andromeda (TriAnd) Clouds, which were originally thought to be debris from the destruction of satellites.  Our analyses found evidence consistent with these various substructures being associated with each other, but also --- surprisingly -- potentially being extensions of the Galactic disk.  If so, this result suggests that the stellar halo has contributions not only from satellite accretion, but also from stars apparently kicked-out from the disk.    In particular, results generated form this project suggest that the relatively distant TriAnd Clouds may have originated in the Galactic disk; if so, this potentially represents the discovery of disk stars at the largest distance from the Galactic center ever observed in our Galaxy.  If borne out, the existence of these stars has interesting implications for Galactic and dark matter halo structure.  However, this surprising result needs further vetting, especially given that it conflicts with studies carried out previously by the UVa research group that found differences in the detailed chemical abundances of these structures from those of stars in the outer disk.  We have also verified the reality of the previously identified "A13 star cloud", and found evidence suggesting that it may have some physical connection to other low latitude structures seen in the outer disk (like the TriAnd structures and the Monoceros ring) -- and thus, by extension, potentially a connection to the Galactic disk.  This grant has directly and indirectly supported the development of scientific skills and expertise for students at the undergraduate, post-baccalaureate and graduate level.  Both an undergraduate Senior Thesis and a PhD dissertation depended partly on work associated with this grant.  Members of the UVa research group were actively involved in outreach to school-age children in remote, rural parts of Virginia through the "Dark Skies, Bright Kids" program out of UVa.  The Principal Investigator continues to participate in public outreach through public lectures as well as through tours of the night time sky.
