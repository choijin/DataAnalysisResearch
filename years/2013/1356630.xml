<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to use the information provided by the one-time, 2011 release of radio isotopes, and in particular, cesium (137Cs, ~30-year half-life and 134Cs, ~2-year half-life) and strontium (90Sr, 29-year half-life) from the Dai-ichi Fukushima nuclear power plants in northern Japan to better understand the pathways, mixing and transport of water in the North Pacific Ocean. The PIs will analyze surface &amp; profile samples from the 2013 zonal CLIVAR 30°N transect for strontium; and obtain and analyze upper water column cesium (Cs) and strontium (Sr) profiles along the 2015 meridional CLIVAR line at 150°W. These observations, along with ocean cesium and iodine data collected over the last two and a half years, will be combined with satellite, drifter and float observations, an ocean model analysis and atmospheric modeling results to illuminate the details of the horizontal spread and vertical mixing that will have taken place over the 4 year period since the release of the isotopes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:  The Cs and Sr observations and analysis, particularly when combined with other observed properties and numerical models, will provide a unique window from which to view water mass formation and the temporal scale of transformation within the North Pacific. This investigation seeks to better understand the fate of Fukushima radioisotopes released and deposited in the North Pacific -- how far and how deeply they range 2 to 4 years after being introduced. Although levels of this radioactivity in the ocean are not considered dangerous, the questions of where it is, and exactly how much there is, remain topics of particular interest to those who live on North Pacific shores and fish in its waters. At the same time it is asked what this unique tracer can say about ocean advection and diffusion processes. The PIs intend to use the results from the observations to improve their own model simulation and to validate disparate community modeling efforts forecasting radioisotope contamination of waters off the US west coast. Conclusions drawn concerning the variability in the mixing and spreading of Fukushima isotopes will be relevant to those seeking to understand the role of physical processes on biological production, nutrient cycling and CO2 uptake as this truly unique set of decadal-scale tracers will reveal the rates and patterns of basin-scale upper-ocean mixing and advective processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: To maximize the scientific benefit of the proposed samples through multi-tracer analysis, as well as to develop stronger ties with other labs working with Fukushima derived isotopes, and support the education of a young researcher, a graduate student from P. Masque's University of Barcelona lab will be invited to spend two semesters at WHOI to measure 90Sr activities in the North Pacific hydrographic samples. During the 1st summer of the project, a WHOI summer student fellow (3rd year undergraduate) will be invited to participate in the observational component of the project through analyses of hydrography, float profiles or altimetry. To further international collaboration with Japanese colleagues and assist in the development of new methods for reducing detection limits M. Aoyama will be invited to visit the WHOI isotope lab from Tokyo. In addition, a public website will be created on which results will be posted. All members of the group intend to engage in outreach at various levels through their continued work with the following programs: mentoring of local middle and high school students using cruise observations for science fair projects, classroom visits and public outreach presentations, interviews and talks.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>In the spring of 2011, a massive offshore earthquake in the northwestern Pacific triggered a tidal wave that devastated northern Japan. This natural disaster caused instabilities at the Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plants (FDNPP) that resulted in a release of radioactivity. Some of this radiation went up into the atmosphere, but eventually settled out mainly into the ocean and particularly into the northwestern Pacific. Discharge of radioactively contaminated coolant waters directly into the ocean also occurred. The goal our project was twofold. First, we looked to understand the spread of the contamination, but second, we looked to use the tracer signal provided by the contamination as a means of improving our understanding of North Pacific circulation processes.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>To meet the first goal, we used existing observations of both the radionuclides (e.g. Figure 1) and the velocity fields (e.g. Figure 2), and developed a novel technique for making the best possible use of drifter (near surface instruments that drift with ocean currents) data (Figure 3). For the second goal, we obtained new observations of radionuclides in the eastern North Pacific (Figures 4-5) and employed the output from a high-resolution numerical model in the western basin (Figure 6). See an outline of our project at <a href="https://web.whoi.edu/tracers/">https://web.whoi.edu/tracers/</a>.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>We have made use of four radioisotopes: <sup>134</sup>Cs, <sup>137</sup>Cs, <sup>90</sup>Sr and <sup>129</sup>I.&nbsp; Each differs in how long it survives. We have focused mainly on cesium (<sup>134</sup>Cs with ~2-year half-life and <sup>137</sup>Cs with ~30-year half-life). Half-life is the time it takes for the radioactivity to fall to half its original value. Because of its short half-life <sup>134</sup>Cs did not exist in the ocean prior to the FDNPP accident, therefore it can be used as a tracer that uniquely tags water coming from the region of the FDNPP. The longer half-life for <sup>137</sup>Cs means that there is a leftover background from the mid-twentieth century nuclear weapons testing, but values greater than this background can be attributed to FDNPP.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In 2013 we found surface&nbsp;<sup>134</sup>Cs values at 30?N of 3?5 Bq m<sup>-3</sup> (a Bq is a disintegration per second and m<sup>-3</sup> is a volume) between 160?E and 160?W, and slightly lower concentrations closer to Japan (Figure 1). The easternmost edge of the <sup>134</sup>Cs observed at 174.3?W in 2012 had progressed eastward across the basin to 160.6?W by 2013. This rate of progression suggested an eastward propagation speed of ~15? of longitude a year (~5 cm/s) during the 2 years since the accidental release. Consistent with the observation location to the south of the expected main axis of the plume, the calculated eastward spread was slightly slower than the estimates we derived from near-surface drifters (Figure 2) as well as the speed predicted by others using numerical models. At 30?N, we found a subsurface cesium maximum and penetration to 500 m west of 180?. Both these signals shoaled toward to the east. We concluded that near Japan the deep&nbsp;penetration was likely the result of local wintertime convective mixing, but with these observations alone we could not determine the process that had brought the signal to 500 m depth in the mid-basin. We later determined using a high-resolution numerical model (Figure 6) that this signal most likely had been mixed into dense water near the FDNPP, had flowed along the path of the Kuroshio Extension Current (at ~36-39?N) out to 155?W -165?W before crossing to the south of the current to where it was observed at 30?N. These numerical experiments suggested that the timing of the accident in the spring was important to determining where the signal eventually ended up.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Some 400 cesium samples were obtained in the spring 2015 along 152?W&nbsp;from 3?N to the coast of Alaska and across the Alaska Gyre (Figure 4). We found a clear Fukushima signal from the surface down to 400 m, with a core signal (<sup>134</sup>Cs ~10 Bq m<sup>-3</sup>) between 30&minus;220 m between 41?-43?N where waters that had mixed down in the Northwest Pacific outcropped in the east (Figure 5). The cesium signal had transited the basin along subsurface density surfaces before coming to the surface again at the northern end and to the east of the 152?W line. This &lt;4-year time-scale for these waters coming to the surface has important implications for North Pacific carbon system as CO<sub>2 </sub>taken<sub> </sub>up from the atmosphere in the west will not be stored for long in the ocean before it once again seas the atmosphere in the east. Comparing the observations (as is often done) to an ensemble of numerical simulations showed general consistency with a similar central location and predicted depth of penetration. The spread in the model cesium distribution was broader in the latitudinal extent, particularly to the south and is thought to be the result of average of the numerical data over several years of current simulation.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 05/29/2019<br>      Modified by: Alison&nbsp;M&nbsp;Macdonald</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1356630/1356630_10294086_1559180693149_Figure_4_Macdonald_etal_2019--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1356630/1356630_10294086_1559180693149_Figure_4_Macdonald_etal_2019--rgov-800width.jpg" title="2015 152W Section of 134 Cs in Northeast Pacific Ocean"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1356630/1356630_10294086_1559180693149_Figure_4_Macdonald_etal_2019--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="2015 152W Section of 134 Cs in Northeast Pacific Ocean"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Observed 2015 134Cs along 152W in latitude-pressure space.
