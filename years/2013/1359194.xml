<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) located in Palisades, NY.  This program has a Global Databases theme that focuses the intern experience on unsolved scientific problems in the ocean and earth sciences within the sub-disciplines of Geology, Petrology, Physical Oceanography, Marine Biology, Geochemistry, and Geophysics. Support includes stipends, housing, and travel to attend the program for a total of 14 students each summer for two years. Students will be recuited nationally. LDEO has over 120 PhD-level geoscientists (~80 in ocean and/or earth science). Each student will be mentored by one of these scientists who will serve as research advisor. The 10-week program takes the students from initially posing a scientific question, to collecting data or producing models to answer that question, to asking new questions of their own. It includes a lecture series on leading scientific research and workshops in professional ethics, scientific writing, and career opportunities. Students will present their research results at a final student symposium and will be encouraged to publish or present their research at professional conferences following the program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Our REU sites grant supported a total of 30 REU students, fourteen each during the summers of 2015 and 2016 and two during the summer of 2017.   Of the 30 students, 27% were members of under-represented groups and half came from small schools with limited research opportunities.  The students all participated in cutting edge research projects with societal relevance.   A large group of students studied the global climate system and climate change, using different tools: modeling, organic geochemistry, marine microfossils, fossil pollen and isotopic geochemistry.   Other students studied volcanoes and their effects on climate.  Volcanoes are also important because the ash from large eruptions can ground or divert airplanes.   Some students studied how large lava flows from volcanic eruptions might be diverted away from inhabited areas.  A large group of students studied environmental pollution and its affect on biological productivity.  There was a particular focus on the Arabian Sea, where an emerging marine organism that thrives in polluted water has adversely impacted local fisheries.  Other groups of students studied environmental pollution in local rivers, in particular the pollution from lead: a human poison even at low levels.  Another student studied how pollution has affected the food chain in rivers.  Some students studied earthquakes and their effects on the course of rivers and on overall levels of seismic activity.   One student studied the history of the Earth?s magnetic field.  This history is important as the magnetic field of the Earth protects us from cosmic rays and other space-borne hazards.   One student studied a possible impact site and helped to determine that it was probably a volcanic feature.   This is important because the hazard from extraterrestrial impacts is still disputed.  One student studied sea level rise along the east coast of the United States.  The rate of sea-level rise from global warming is still poorly known.  Another student studied the dynamics of the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica.   The rate at which ice shelves are changing is another poorly known variable in the rate of sea level rise from global warming.  Some students studied past droughts in the mid-East and the water sources during those droughts.  Political instability in the mid-East is exacerbated by disputes over water resources and these results will be important for future planning during prolonged droughts, especially as droughts are predicted to increase in intensity and length as global warming becomes more intense.
