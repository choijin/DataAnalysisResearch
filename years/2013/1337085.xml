<AbstractNarration>This grant provides travel support for selected students attending the annual Symposium on Combinatorial Search (SoCS).  Student participation in SoCS encourages young investigators in their research in combinatorial search.  This symposium carries on a tradition of bringing together researchers and students around issues of pattern-database heuristics, inconsistent heuristics, real-time search, path-finding for physical robots and computer-game agents, parallel search, and search using external memory.  These search techniques have a significant place in broader AI application in areas such as robotics, computer games, planning, and bioinformatics.  In addition, SoCS 13 includes a special focus on graph search engineering.</AbstractNarration>
