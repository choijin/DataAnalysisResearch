<AbstractNarration>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;The goal of this 3-year NSF/REU Site is to train 10 REU Fellows each summer using 10-week long interdisciplinary research projects in water sciences. These research projects are directed by experts representing a diverse group of academic disciplines including engineering, geosciences, biology, crop and soil environmental sciences, and industrial design at Virginia Tech. The REU Fellows will have opportunities for professional development and interdisciplinary cohort experiences through weekly seminars, field trips, multiple oral presentations, weekly reflection papers, and an end-of-program research paper. Examples of seminar topics include professional ethics, why research and how to do research, panel discussion with graduate students, and use of emerging technologies like nanotechnology in water research. In addition, they will have opportunities for social interactions that will enhance personal and professional bonding among themselves and with the faculty and graduate student mentors. The Site organizers have already graduated 56 REU Fellows in prior two cycles during 2007-09 and 2011-13 and all components of the program have been thoroughly assessed by experts in academic assessment.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:&lt;br/&gt;The Site organizers have been successful in recruiting about 60% of REU Fellows from various underrepresented groups including women in prior two cycles. This practice will be continued in this cycle with additional focus on recruitment from groups representing various ethnic minorities and from institutions with limited research opportunities. Funds are allocated for students' stipend, housing, travel, and meals for enabling their participation. Students from various science and engineering disciplines will work collaboratively over a 10-week period to learn about the interdisciplinary nature of water research. An external expert who has been leading the assessment work in prior two cycles will continue to assess the effectiveness of the REU program. The Site will further expand the pool of future researchers in water sciences who will contribute in addressing water related national and international challenges. Results of survey of our graduates from prior two cycles indicate that 68% of respondents plan to obtain a graduate degree (24% PhD and 44% Master?s) and 80% respondents will pursue a research career in engineering and science in the future. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding support provided by the EEC division of the National Science Foundation is sincerely acknowledged.</AbstractNarration>

This project represents the third cycle of this REU site (2014-18) and included a no-cost extension of about 10 months. The key outcomes of the project are:</p> <p>1. Twenty-nice REU scholars (22 females and 7 males) from various science and engineering disciplines conducted 10-week research projects during summer under the mentorship of Virginia Tech faculty and graduate students. Six scholars (~21%) represented under-represented ethnic minorities. The research projects represented various interdisciplinary aspects of water science and engineering. The faculty mentorship team represents various disciplines at Virginia Tech including civil &amp; environmental engineering, geosciences, biology, environmental science, engineering education, and forest hydrology.</p> <p>2. REU scholars participated in various professional development activities inclduing seminars, field trips, oral and poster presentations. Prof. Marc Edwards' seminar on research ethics and Flint, Michigan water issues is a highlight of our professional development activities.</p> <p>3. All REU scholars wrote a research paper and presented research posters at an undergraduate research sysmposium that's organized at VT during the last week of July which is also the last week of the program.&nbsp;</p> <p>4. An external expert assessed the effectiveness of the program every summer. The goals of the site were met satisfactorily. Two quotes from assessment reports are:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p><em>&ldquo;The opportunities to improve professional communication skills rank high&rdquo; (quote from assessment expert's report). </em>During the focus group, one REU scholar mentioned:<em>&ldquo;</em><em>I think it was very helpful to have presentations of different lengths of the program because it allowed us all to improve. The feedback was helpful.</em><em>&rdquo; </em></p> <p>5. An alumni survey was conducted in May 2016 and 28 responses (out of a possible of 56) were received. The participants included REU scholars of this project and its precedessor sites. About 86% of the respondents indicated that they planned to obtain a graduate degree, either Masters or PhD. Also, 81% of the respondents felt that our REU site had either highly influenced or influenced their academic/career plans.</p> <p>6. A few lessons learned include: (i) Potential research projects and the work REU scholars will engage in should clearly be defined in the program announcement, (ii) Mentors should communicate with the selected scholars before the start of the program to understand their strengths and interests, to setup their project goals and objectives, and to get them prepared for their research work. This can speed-up the research process since from our experience we learned that setting up a project takes 2-4 weeks after the REU program starts,and (iii) Structured schedule of the professional development activities at the beginning of the program are essential for a good cohort experience and a successful REU program.</p> <p>7.
