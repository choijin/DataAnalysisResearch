<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small-Business ERC Collaborative Opportunity transitioning agile broadband&lt;br/&gt;transmitter for integrated access networks to market will address the challenge of achieving high&lt;br/&gt;bandwidth (100+ Gb/s), low power, low cost wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) optical&lt;br/&gt;communications links of distances up to 2 km for applications such as data centers and&lt;br/&gt;aggregation networks. These links are necessary for next generation data center and&lt;br/&gt;supercomputing applications that are a focus of the CIAN ERC?s research.&lt;br/&gt;Specifically, this project will improve the lasers in these systems, which drive much of&lt;br/&gt;the cost, performance, and power requirements for the links, to meet current commercial&lt;br/&gt;specifications. The tunable VCSELs offer a 10X reduction in power and cost over conventional&lt;br/&gt;solutions and enable high bandwidth links within data centers that not economically feasible with&lt;br/&gt;current technologies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is a drastic reduction in the cost&lt;br/&gt;and energy requirements of optical links inside of data centers and supercomputers. Companies&lt;br/&gt;such as Google, Microsoft and other large data-centric companies have been clamoring for this&lt;br/&gt;type of product in the last year to maintain the rate of growth in their data center facilities.&lt;br/&gt;Present WDM laser array solutions using DFB lasers require 10X the power and 10X the cost of&lt;br/&gt;a VCSEL-based approach and are not economically feasible. Present 850-nm VCSEL-based&lt;br/&gt;links, on the other hand, cannot be made into a WDM source without power-hungry TEC coolers&lt;br/&gt;due to their lack of precise, gridded, wavelength control, limiting the overall link speed. Using a&lt;br/&gt;1550 nm tunable VCSEL solves both the problem of gridded wavelength control and allows the&lt;br/&gt;use of low cost single mode fiber and the developed infrastructure for 1550 nm WDM optical&lt;br/&gt;links. The realization of tunable VCSELs in WDM systems will result in a 10X reduction in&lt;br/&gt;both cost and energy requirements in high-speed optical links for data centers, enabling the&lt;br/&gt;further scaling of computational power for next generation data center and supercomputer&lt;br/&gt;applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Besides the technological impact, this collaboration program will offer CIAN students&lt;br/&gt;insight and experience with the real world commercial product development process. The&lt;br/&gt;students will be testing and giving feedback into the product development process, enhancing&lt;br/&gt;their educational experience. The enhanced capabilities of the VCSELs will enable new&lt;br/&gt;applications and enhance CIAN in it?s mission of supporting transparency wherever possible&lt;br/&gt;with flexible wavelength conversion and optical switches, and supporting dynamically&lt;br/&gt;reconfigurable heterogeneous traffic in the network.</AbstractNarration>

Present 850-nm VCSEL-based links, on the other hand, cannot be made into a WDM source due to their lack of precise, gridded, wavelength control and cannot go distances over a few hundred meters due to their wavelength dispersion.  Using a single mode 1550 nm tunable VCSEL solves both the problem of gridded wavelength control while allowing for link lengths of up to 20 km.  The realization of tunable VCSELs in WDM systems will result in a significant reduction in both cost and energy requirements in high-speed optical links for access networks and data centers, enabling the further scaling of computational power for next generation data center and cloud applications.     In this SECO program, Bandwidth10 accomplished major technical milestones towards the final goal of realization of a compact 1550 nm tunable-VCSEL.  VCSELs with a 25 nm tuning range were realized as well as VCSELs with 3.5 mW output power.  Directly-modulated VCSELs were realized at 10 Gbps and 1 mW output power at 50&ordm; C.  The VCSELÆs thermal, optical, and electrical properties were modeled and optimized for this performance.  Further improvements to reach the final commercialization goals are in progress.
