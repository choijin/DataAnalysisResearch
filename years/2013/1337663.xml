<AbstractNarration>Black holes are perhaps the most exotic and enigmatic objects in the universe.  Predicted by Einstein's theory of General Relativity and widely accepted as products of certain examples of massive single-star and binary-star evolution, the most dramatic cases are the "supermassive" black holes found in the centers of essentially all galaxies.  Here, accretion has amassed as much matter as exists in 20 billion stars into extraordinarily tiny volumes.  Our Galaxy hosts a comparatively modest example, with some 4 million solar masses packed inside a region no larger than Uranus' orbit around the Sun.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Until now, the tiny sizes of black holes coupled with their vast distances have permitted us to view only the gravitational effects of black holes on surrounding stars and gas.  However, Dr. S. Doeleman (Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory) and collaborators are employing the Very Large Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) technique pioneered by radio astronomers to combine signals from several telescopes scattered around the Earth with the goal of imaging the radio emission from just outside a black hole's point of no return - the so-called Schwarzschild radius where the last light emitted by matter flowing into the hole can escape and reach an outside observer.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;To effectively combine the signals from widely separated telescopes, each signal must be time-stamped with an extremely precise local reference signal.  This proposal seeks funds to acquire ultra-stable frequency references for global VLBI observations at mm-wavelengths aimed at obtaining unprecedented views of the immediate environs of the supermassive black hole at the center of our Milky Way, and possibly also of the much more massive hole that lurks at the center of the nearby giant galaxy M87.   Fortunately, such time standards have been developed using hydrogen maser oscillators for applications in geodesy and navigation, and therefore are reasonably affordable and extremely reliable.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Funding for the acquisition of time standards for the global VLBI network is being provided by NSF's Division of Astronomical Sciences through its participation in the Major Research Instrumentation program.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ If you want to take a picture of a black hole, you have to build a telescope as big as the Earth.  That's because black holes are the smallest objects predicted to exist in Einstein's theory of gravity: single points of infinite density that form when matter is crushed by a catastrophic gravitational collapse.  Surrounding these objects is a boundary callled the event horizon, where gravity is so strong that light cannot escape its pull.  Paradoxically, even though light cannot escape from the black hole, the gas outside that is pulled inwards heats up to billions of degrees as it crushes inwards, so the supermassive black holes thought to lurk in the centers of most galaxies can shine with the power of millions of suns.  The Event Horizon Telescope is a project, supported by this grant, to take a picture off the shadow cast by the black hole against the backdrop of super hot gas that surrounds it.  We do this by linking together radio dishes around the world in a network that creates a virtual Earth-sized telescope.  Since the bigger the telescope, the higher the magnifying power, when we span the Earth we should just be able to image the closes supermassive black hole: the one at the heart of our own Milky Way galaxy.  If successful, we could test Einstein's theories right where they might break down - at the boundary of a black hole.  The link between widely separated telescopes can be forged by putting extremely accurate atomic clocks at each radio dish.  That allows the data collected when one dish stares at the black hole to be compared and combined with data collected at a dish 1000's of miles away.  This is similar to thinking about a mirror 1000 miles across bouncing light to a common focus.  We used funds from the NSF to purchase two atomic clocks and we worked with collaborators in Mexico and Arizona to install these sensitive time-pieces at remote, high altitude radio dishes.  When the dishes observed the Millky Way black hole at the same moment, we successfully recorded data that was combined and used to measure the size of the black hole.  We used time keeping at the atomic level to create a telescope that spanned a continent to measure a black hole that weighs 4 million times what our Sun does - and it's 25,000 light years away.  We are using these measurements to investigate how the black hole at the center of our galaxy can generate so much energy, look for deviations from Einstein's theories, and search for activity that might be due to matter spiraling in to the event horizon.  This work requires the efforts of a large team, and we are privileged to collaborate with Mexican scientists and students as well as colleagues in Arizona.  We are adding more dishes to our network so that we can move beyond just measuring the size of the black hole to making a real image of it.
