<AbstractNarration>Grounded in the context and practice of an effort to reform the teaching and learning of college mathematics, this WIDER research project applies an ecosystems approach to conduct three interrelated studies that investigate the development, growth, and sustainability of an established mathematics education community whose members are proponents of inquiry-based learning (IBL Math).  The research project identifies, clarifies, and iteratively examines the elements of a professional community that supports and sustains reform in higher education and investigates the relative impacts of top-down and bottom-up approaches to the diffusion of innovation.  The research site is defined as a professional community of mathematicians who are dedicated to the reform of the teaching and learning of college mathematics based on the Socratic methods of R.L. Moore, a renowned topologist and teacher of mathematics. The historical study examines the evolution of the community, focusing the sources of the challenges it faces and promise for the future.  A network analysis study investigates the linkages between people, university programs, and a private foundation that champions inquiry-based learning in college mathematics.  An uptake study examines the use of inquiry-based learning among past participants in workshops, focusing on the long-term impact on individuals of the workshops and other forms of community support.  The mixed-methods set of studies investigates two research questions: What human, structural, and intellectual elements emerge as important to the past development, current growth, and future sustainability of the IBL Math reform movement when it is viewed as a dynamic ecosystem of interlinked people and university programs?  What useful lessons are offered to other communities engaged in STEM education reform?</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    This research project examined a nationwide community of college mathematics instructors who use inquiry-based learning (IBL) in their classrooms, an approach to active learning that is increasingly popular among mathematics educators. Research on IBL records beneficial student outcomes and reduced gender gaps. Therefore it is desirable to support instructors in adopting and developing expertise in IBL teaching and similar approaches.  We sought to understand the workings of the IBL ecosystem: what ideas and structures engage people, how does the community evolve over time, what enhances or harms engagement with the community? Such knowledge will help to support instructors in similar communities of practice around STEM instruction. We explored these issues in three related studies.  The Historical Study examined the evolution and culture of the IBL Math reform community. We analyzed documents and oral history interviews, and drew on literature about message framing, social movements, and the life cycle of communities of practice. Of keen interest is how members of the movement understand their historical connection to the legacy of the late mathematician R. L. Moore. A desire to grow the movement also necessitated modernizing its messages. A strong initial connection to Moore and his now-troubling racist and sexist views led to intense disputes over the movement's framing, or branding. This at first inhibited its growth, but eventually led to an understanding of IBL that embraces a broader range of methods and people.   The Network Study used social network analysis (SNA) to identify key individuals in the IBL ecosystem and consider how supportive ties form. This study uses interviews and surveys to consider the community as a web of linked individuals, programs and relationships.  We find that IBL workshops and the annual IBL conference are two key structures that support both beginning and experienced IBLers. Sharing materials, both formally and informally, is also key to instructors' development. Network leadership maps identified by SNA analysis of questionnaire data and interview data compare well, suggesting that, at least in an unbounded network of this size, the effort to gather social network data may not improve upon simpler methods. Of the ten individuals with the highest betweenness centrality --a measure of bridging in the IBL network--seven now lead IBL workshops and develop new workshop leaders, and the person of highest centrality is that project's PI. SNA also identifies two university IBL Centers as influential in the network, likely due to training graduate students and postdocs in IBL.    The Uptake Study probed IBL use among workshop participants from 2006 to 2010, using interviews and surveys to examine the impact on individuals of programs and community support.   We find that IBL is "sticky":  nearly half of these workshop participants still use IBL 8-12 years later. We recognize four types of implementation trajectories: eager adopters and de-adopters are easily recognized in retrospect, but selective adoption and delayed adoption are patterns not previously noted in the literature. Personal, institutional, and community factors help and hinder IBL implementation: the broader community of practice supports implementers long after the workshop.  The project has intellectual merit in using a wide-ranging set of theoretical frameworks, bodies of literature, and data sources to explore the IBL community's growth and evolution. The study bridges the span between individual and collective behaviors by considering instructors' choices to use (or not) active learning within the broader context of their discipline and social community. It thus provides both practical and scholarly knowledge about factors that shape and strengthen multi-institution, discipline-based change initiatives.   The project had broader impact through communicating sensitive results directly to the IBL community in numerous forms. We believe  this has helped to move the community forward in addressing inclusivity. Deploying a wide array of communication tactics has increased our repertoire of strategies in ways useful to future projects.
