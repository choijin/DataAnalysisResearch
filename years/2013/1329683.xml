<AbstractNarration>Objective: How much a person should be allowed to interact with a controlled machine?  If that machine is safety critical, and if the computer that oversees its operation is essential to its operation and safety, the answer may be that the person should not be allowed to interfere with its operation at all or very little. Moreover, whether the person is a novice or an expert matters.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: This research algorithmically resolves the tension between the need for safety and the need for performance, something a person may be much more adept at improving than a machine. Using a combination of techniques from numerical methods, systems theory, machine learning, human-machine interfaces, optimal control, and formal verification, this research will develop a computable notion of trust that allows the embedded system to assess the safety of the instruction a person is providing.  The interface for interacting with a machine matters as well; designing motions for safety-critical systems using a keyboard may be unintuitive and lead to unsafe commands because of its limitations, while other interfaces may be more intuitive but threaten the stability of a system because the person does not understand the needs of the system.  Hence, the person needs to develop trust with the machine over a period of time, and the last part of the research will include evaluating a person's performance by verifying the safety of the instructions the person provides.  As the person becomes better at safe operation, she will be given more authority to control the machine while never putting the system in danger.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:  The activities will include outreach, development of public-domain software, experimental coursework including two massive online courses, and technology transfer to rehabilitation. Outreach will include exhibits at the Museum of Science and Industry and working with an inner-city high school. The algorithms to be developed will have immediate impact on projects with the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago, including assistive devices, stroke assessment, and neuromuscular hand control. Providing a foundation for a science of trust has the potential to transform rehabilitation research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focuses on how complex autonomous robots can interact with human operators in a manner that is both safe and effective. This question is getting increasingly relevant as robots are no longer confined to cages on the manufacturing floors. Instead they are increasingly affecting many different aspects of our daily lives.   In human interactions, trust plays a crucial role and it is well-documented that if team mates trust each other, the performance can be improved significantly. Similarly, a lack of trust can severely deteriorate the performance through psychologies effects effects such as belief polarization. This project modeled trust based interactions between robots and humans that are both physiologically consistent and allows the robots to become more effective.  Technically, this development involved machine learning of the complex dynamics, novel control techniques for analyzing the trust based systems, and the deployment of the developed tools and techniques on a large-scale group of mobile robots.  The broader impacts of the project can primarily be found in the many applications where robots are to interact effectively with humans. These include precision agriculture, search-and-rescue robotics, domestic and service robots, and even medical and surgical robotics. Additionally, by combining psycologically based phenomena with traditional engineering tools, connections are made across disciplines in a novel manner with implications beyond robotics.
