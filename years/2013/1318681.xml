<AbstractNarration>This award funds the research activities of Professor Simone Giombi at Princeton University.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One of the key developments in string theory has been the discovery of surprising dualities relating quantum gravitational theories to gauge theories. Professor Giombi's research program is aimed at a broad and thorough study of various aspects of the gauge/gravity duality. This work will deepen our fundamental understanding of the physics underlying the relation between gauge and gravitational theories, and exploit the gauge/gravity duality in order to develop a powerful toolbox for answering non-perturbative questions about strongly coupled gauge theory or the nature of quantum gravity. This project consists of three key areas. The first one is devoted to a deep study of the gravitational theories involving massless higher spin fields and their role in the gauge/gravity duality;  the second is to better understand the quantization of string theory in Anti de Sitter (AdS) backgrounds, and the third involves the study of certain supersymmetric subsectors of non-abelian gauge theories where exact results are possible by the method of localization.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is also expected to have a number of broader impacts. While working on specific research problems, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows will receive extensive mentoring and training which will positively contribute to their formation as future independent scientists. The PI intends to develop special classes for graduate students and advanced undergraduates about recent trends in theoretical physics research, and to lecture at schools for students and young researchers held at international institutes. The PI also plans to become active in various outreach programs, such as giving public lectures and communicating recent research advances to non-technical journals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Over the past years, research in theoretical physics has uncovered a surprising and far-reaching correspondence, known as "gauge/gravity" duality, between theories of gravity on a certain curved space-time and ordinary quantum field theories, similar to those that describe the elementary particles and their fundamental interactions in the Standard Model of particle physics.  The exploration of the gauge/gravity correspondence and its implications has been one of the main underlying themes of this research program. In particular, substantial effort was devoted to the study of certain exotic theories of gravity that involve massless particles of arbitrarily high spin (a quantum mechanical property of elementary particles which is a type of "intrinsic" angular momentum).  These "higher-spin gravity" theories appear to be related, via the gauge/gravity duality, to more familiar field theoretical models that are relevant in condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics. The research carried out in this program explored and tested this correspondence in several ways. In particular, one of the main results was to compute certain quantum mechanical effects in the higher-spin gravity theories, and to clarify their interpretation from the point of view of the gauge/gravity duality.  A related but independent theme in this program was the study of general properties of quantum field theories, such as for instance their behavior under changing the energy scale of the system. It turns out that a certain quantity (roughly a measure of the number of degrees of freedom) always decreases when going from high energies to low energies, and this yields useful constraints on the behavior of the system.
