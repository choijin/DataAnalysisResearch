<AbstractNarration>This is an observational project devoted to measuring stellar and disk properties for a hundred young multiple star systems using high-resolution spectroscopy and imaging techniques at infrared wavelengths, mainly using Keck Observatory. She will use the data to determine effective temperatures, radial velocities, rotation rates and surface gravities of stars, as well as accretion rates and magnetic fields associated with surrounding disk material.  The data will be used to test models of binary formation and angular momentum distribution of planetary systems and circumstellar disks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts include training a postdoctoral researcher, and updating a website with a database on visual binary stars for the community. The PI also plans to continue giving astronomy presentations to local senior centers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  This NSF award provided the resources for 4 years of exploration of the nature of young binary stars.  This work is important because most stars are located in binary systems.  Thus they dominate the stellar census and it is therefore important to understand their characteristics.  Furthermore, multi-star systems likely have a strong impact on planet formation.  By studying the circumstellar disk properties in binary systems it is possible to develop a better understanding of the various processes limiting planet formation in these common environments.   An important product of this research is the young binary database that the team has developed in order to make the reduced and analyzed data and outcomes of the research easily available to the scientific community.  Work on this database has also been a valuable leaving experience for some of the student researchers.   Possibly the most significant aspect to this science program is the large number of student researchers who has been involved and have made not only important contributions to the science, but also have grown immensely as young scientists.  Many of these participants are from groups which have been historically underrepresented in the physical sciences.  Thus in a small but significant way this work has created a stronger and more diverse astronomical community.  All of these students have continued on to graduate programs or to professional employment in technical fields.       Last Modified: 05/01/2018       Submitted by: Lisa A Prato]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
