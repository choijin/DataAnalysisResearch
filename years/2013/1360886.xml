<AbstractNarration>With this award, the Chemical Catalysis Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Tomislav Pintauer from Duquesne University to develop new methods to produce pharmaceuticals and other useful chemicals in an environmentally sound fashion. The new methods use catalysts formed from copper instead of the more commonly-used ones that contain mercury or other toxic metals. Their work is helping to expand the range of conditions where these copper catalysts can be used so that environmentally benign agents that do not generate free radicals, such as Vitamin C, can be used. Their new method is appealing because very low concentrations of metal are required, further reducing the environmental footprint while still providing society with useful chemicals such as drugs. The work is having a broader impact through the development of new courses at Duquesne University on green catalysis and other topics. The research team is further broadening the impact of their work by including and mentoring under-represented minority and economically disadvantaged high school students from the Pittsburgh area in their research program.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research is focused on developing highly active copper catalysts for atom transfer radical addition (ATRA) reactions involving monohalogenated substrates, as well as cyclization (ATRC) reactions leading to the formation of synthetically useful lactones. Both of these methods have shown great potential for mediating C-C bond formation utilizing a variety of alkyl halides and alkenes. Currently, there is no known catalyst with an acceptable level of activity for both of these transformations, so the work is filling an important void. The main focus of the project is specifically tailored ligand design, with special emphasis on structural and mechanistic understanding of the carbon-halogen bond activation catalyzed by copper complexes.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ OVERVIEW In the past two decades, free radical reactions have become increasingly important and very attractive tool in organic synthesis, due to their powerful, selective, specific, and mild reaction abilities.  In particular, transition metal catalyzed atom transfer addition (ATRA) and cyclization (ATRC) have shown a great potential in mediating C-C bond forming reactions utilizing a variety of alkyl halides and alkenes.  Both methods are appealing from the environmental point of view because efficient catalysis can be achieved using ppm levels of the metal.  As such, they are also "greener" alternatives to widely used toxic organotin or organomercury reagents.    INTELLECTUAL MERIT  Transition metal mediated ATRA and ATRC reactions that utilize ppm concentrations of the catalyst are currently limited only to highly activated poly(halogenated) substrates. Monohalogenated substrates are very useful for ATRA and ATRC reactions because the halide functionality in the resulting addition product can be selectively protected, reduced, eliminated, displaced, or converted to a Grignard reagent.  With this award, we further expanded the synthetic utility of copper catalyzed ATRA and ATRC in the presence of UV-light or environmentally benign reducing agents such as ascorbic acid (Vitamin C).  More specifically, we developed several copper complexes for (a) activation of monohalogenated substrates and (b) ATRC reactions leading to the formation of g-lactones (important intermediates in natural product synthesis).  Our strategy focused on specifically tailored ligand design, which enabled efficient and "green" catalysis using ppm levels of the metal.  The findings from this award are expected to substantially impact the field of organic chemistry of free radicals, including the synthesis of natural products, pharmaceutical drugs and other complex organic molecules and polymeric materials.  BROADER IMPACTS  During the past four years, 17 students (5 graduate, 11 undergraduate and 1 project SEED student) have benefited from the training received in the PI laboratories under the auspices of this award.  Several trainees were members of underrepresented groups in the STEM fields and two students received NSF graduate/postdoctoral fellowships to further advance their education.  Research associated with this award bridges organic, inorganic and organometallic chemistry and its "green" concepts are very important in industry and academia.
