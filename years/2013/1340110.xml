<AbstractNarration>Building on insights developed during Phase I of the Cal Poly Science Noyce Program, this Phase II Project is producing twenty new STEM teachers (to add to the thirty-three produced in Phase I) while tracking and analyzing the progress of the first cohort of Noyce Scholars. Cooperating school districts include: Santa Maria-Bonita School District, Santa Maria Joint Union High School District, and Lucia Mar School District.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Phase II Noyce Scholars are benefiting a) from a required research experience through the STEM Teacher and Researcher (STAR) Program during their pre-service years that can be incorporated into and enrich their credential coursework and clinical field experience, and b) from interactions with and mentoring from Phase I Noyce alumni during their training and early years of teaching in high need schools via face-to-face meetings and online interactions. Noyce alumni are benefiting from annual summer professional development workshops designed to support implementation of scientific and engineering practices experienced through prior research into their classroom teaching through modeling, project-based learning, and other proven strategies. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: In addition to the benefits to area and other high needs schools due to the teachers produced by this project, the evaluation of the project is helping to provide evidence to support the adoption by others of the STEM teacher education and professional development practices found to be effective by this program. Longitudinal studies of the Phase I Noyce STAR alumni is providing valuable insights into the effects of undergraduate research experiences, mentoring, and professional development on the career trajectories, teaching approaches, and effectiveness of these teacher-researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>All US K-12 students should be guaranteed the opportunity to learn science in an engaging, inquiry-based, culturally-inclusive environment. It is especially important to provide these learning opportunities for children in high-need school districts which make up large percentage of US districts (about 70% of districts in California) and which are populated by people of backgrounds that are traditionally underrepresented in science. The Cal Poly Robert Noyce Phase II Program (Noyce Phase II) has sought to address this urgent need by recruiting and training highly-qualified STEM teachers and by supporting teachers in these essential districts. Noyce Phase II awarded 1 or 2 year-long scholarships to 16 highly qualified students recruited from the STEM majors at California Polytechnic State University.

These educators enter the classroom well prepared to implement Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and with a high level of cultural awareness.</p> <p>One of the goals of Noyce Phase II is that the science teachers we recruit and train see themselves as scientists. Teachers with a scientist mindset are more engaged in their teaching and tend to provide richer experiences for their students by readily incorporating inquiry-based activities and citizen science in their classrooms. Allowing future teachers to participate in scientific research is the best way to achieve this goal. 14 of 16 Noyce Phase II scholars participated in research through the STEM Teacher and Research (STAR) program that matches pre-service or early-career teachers with researchers at national laboratories. As STAR Fellows, our participants did research at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, NOAA Earth Systems Research Laboratories, and other important institutions. In addition to research, the participants participated in workshops with other STAR fellows to connect their research experience with classroom teaching, and they presented their research at annual STAR Symposiums.

We held annual Noyce Summer Retreats from 2013-2019 that were attended by about 20 teachers each year who were alumni from the Cal Poly Noyce or STAR (or both). During the retreats the teachers collaborated to develop NGSS-aligned, culturally-responsive lessons. The teachers used the lessons during the following school year and reported back to the group. However, the lessons were only one product of the retreat. Another important outcome was the chance for the participants to connect to share experiences, insights and resources.

The faculty who oversee the Noyce Phase II program are honored to be associated with this group of dedicated, passionate professional educators. While many factors have contributed to the successful teaching careers of Cal Poly Noyce alumni, our data show that Noyce experiences are perceived as having been valuable to their preparation for teaching in high-needs environments.
