<AbstractNarration>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase 1 project addresses the failure of osseointegration, the lack of bonding between an orthopedic device and bone. Failure of the implant does occur with an unacceptably high rate (8-20%). The main driver for revision surgery is aseptic loosening of the implant, which occurs at a nanoscale. This can be very detrimental to the patient since the revised implants have higher complication rates. The research objective is to develop an orthopedic implant coating that mimics both the scaffolding and mineral structure of healing woven bone. Coated nanosprings, a synthetic collagen nanobiomaterial, mimics the scaffolding component of bone. This proposal is directed at developing a mineral layer on the nanosprings to make synthetic woven bone. Nanosprings can be grown on orthopedic devices. Metal alloy coated nanosprings are well tolerated by the body and increase the bone deposition rate, but the procedure is expensive. The mineral used for the proposed coating is inexpensive but lacks the scaffolding effects needed for bone integration. Combining these two synthetic biomaterials would provide the necessary economical scaffolding to facilitate osseointegration.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact/commercial potential of this project to the osteoconductive biomaterial market is vast. The orthopedic market is a multi-billion dollar industry, which will increase as the baby boomer population ages. This technology can be employed in both animal and human devices, such as dental implants, prosthetics, and joint replacements. The potential commercialization options are partnering with an existing orthopedic device manufacturer for this add-on coating, or direct sales to the animal market, and then to the human market as the FDA allows. The coated nanosprings have the ability to greatly increase the rate and hardness of bone deposition. It is hypothesized that this increase around implants can have a significant clinical impact to improve the quality of patient?s lives as well as an economical benefit. This new technology can provide employment for scientists in both biologic and other hard science fields.  The nanosprings are an ideal foundation for osteoconductive research. This synthetic collagen allows different coating material to be studied at a nanoscale level. Thus, providing both materials and biologic insight to the osseointegration process.</AbstractNarration>

MJ3Æs implant coating mitigates these complications by combining the biocompatibility and bone stimulation advantages of hydroxyapatite with the enhanced mechanical stability, durability and bonding properties of the nanosprings.  One key outcome of this research project established the optimum method to permanently attach the hydroxyapatite to the nanosprings to form a durable, 3-dimensional, porous coating material that stimulates bone formation.  The method of bonding was found to be repeatable, inexpensive, and can be sterilized using conventional methods.  Another important key outcome determined the optimum surface characteristics of the nanospring-HA coating that produced the highest level of bone deposition and decreased bone loss.  MJ3Æs nanospring-HA mineral coating could have a significant impact on veterinary and human orthopedics as well as dentistry by producing implants with higher success rates and a longer functional life. More importantly is the positive financial impact of decreasing the need for revision surgery, which adds billions per year to global healthcare costs.
