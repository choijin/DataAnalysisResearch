<AbstractNarration>The Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) program in the Division of Chemistry supports this project which provides support for the attendance and oral presentations of Assistant and Associate Professors from US Universities at the 8th International Symposium on Supramolecular and Macrocyclic Chemistry (ISMSC-8) to be held in Arlington, Virginia, July 7-11, 2013.  The conference features a mixture of oral presentations, short talks and poster talks, and poster sessions covering a wide scientific area of interest to the supramolecular chemistry community.  The intellectual merits of the proposal are inherent in the presentations of the participants which are grouped into theme sessions in the areas of complexity, assemblies, molecular machines and mechanical effects, functional crystals, polymers and materials, supramolecular chemistry of biology, surfaces and interfaces, and supramolecular catalysis.  The theme session promises to stimulate discussions on the current challenges and barriers in the topic areas.  Finally, a special issue of the journal "Supramolecular Chemistry" will be published based on research from the conference participants.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The significance and broader impact of the conference are manifold.  The participants in ISMSC-8 are diverse with respect to country of origin, gender, academic level, and area of expertise.  The interactions between scientists of diverse background catalyze new (inter)national collaborations which expose student co-workers to different cultures and scientific viewpoints.  For the US based Assistant and Associate Professors for whom funding is requested, this is an opportunity to present their research to leading experts in the field.  Interactions between senior and junior faculty members lead to the establishment of informal mentor-mentee relationships that impact the future development of research in supramolecular and macrocyclic chemistry.</AbstractNarration>
