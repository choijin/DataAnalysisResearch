<AbstractNarration>This award supports a strong team of researchers from Cornell University to work on the CMS experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.  Contributions to the program include technical developments in Silicon Pixel Detectors and advanced track triggering; operations support in pixel tracking and event triggering during the upcoming run of the LHC at collision energies of up to 14 TeV and a high luminosities; and a broad and coherent program of data analysis on important discovery channels with significant focus on Supersymmetry.   The Cornell group's efforts in broader impacts go significantly beyond the norm, with education and outreach to community colleges, rural middle schools, summer research camps for students and programs for participants underrepresented in science.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Particle physics studies fundamental particles and the forces that act between them. These studies tell us about the contents of our universe and the laws that govern what happens, and allow us to understand not only the current state of the universe, but its early formation and expansion. The nature of matter and anti-matter, character of neutrinos, and the familiar properties of protons, neutrons, and electrons, all fall within the domain of particle physics. More exotic quanta that transmit forces, such as photons, gluons, and some very heavy particles ("vector bosons") come under its gaze, as does the Higgs boson, discovered in 2012 after 50 years of searching.   In the work supported by NSF-1307256 explored possibilities for exotic kinds of matter including very heavy vector bosons and supersymmetric partners of normal matter.  These kinds of matter are predicted by theoretical work that extends established theory in new directions, and the existence or non-existence of such particles is the empirical test of such theories. Neither kind of matter was found within the finite reach of this work, excluding some ranges of theoretical parameters, but leaving open the possibility that the particles may still exist but are just heavier than can be produced with the currently available beam energies.    NSF-1307256 also supported a new precision measurement of the top quark mass, which exploited new analytical techniques from computer science ("machine learning") to reach a result that is more precise and less dependent on assumptions than previous results.  The top quark mass is of particular interest to particle physics because its large value suggests its coupling to the Higgs particle may be maximal.   Finally, this same award has supported a detailed search of the high-energy collider data for any sign of dark matter. Dark matter is known from astrophysical observation to exist, but its production in a particle physics experiment, which would help to elucidate the nature of this strange material, has still not been observed.  This kind of search, which yields a "null result" is like the policeman questioning suspects: most of them will be innocent, but with each interview provides information that narrows the range of possibilities and sharpens the search for the culprit.   In addition to the scientific results, NSF-1307256 has supported 6 graduate students and 4 postdoctoral scholars, in addition to about 15 undergraduates who participated in the research.  The rigor of the scientific and technical training they have undergone lays a foundation for each of them in their future careers. Whether they continue in physics or transition to other paths, the skills they acquired and honed with this NSF support will enable them to make strong contributions to society.
