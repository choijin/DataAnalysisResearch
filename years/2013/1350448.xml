<AbstractNarration>Successfully reproducing organisms have evolved mechanisms for optimal adaptation to their prevailing environment, and some organisms preferentially exhibit behaviors, such as stockpiling food, that allow them to survive extended food shortages. For example, hamsters prefer to increase food hoarding rather than food intake in response to famine.  Animals with these adaptations are likely to have an evolutionary advantage, especially in environments where food is scarce. In rodents, neural circuits in the brain that control feeding behavior develop during the last half of gestation, making maternal nutrition crucial during late pregnancy. In fact, maternal energy availability during pregnancy directly influences the development of offspring neural and hormonal machinery. However, we know very little about the mechanisms responsible for these developmental changes, especially in food hoarding animals.  This work will contribute to the broad understanding about the effects of maternal nutrition on neural and hormonal mechanisms that regulate feeding, providing insight into feeding strategies adopted by offspring in response to variations in predicted postnatal environment. The educational activities integrate research and teaching efforts, develop a new major program in Neuroscience and provide a resource website for information about the PI's research and teaching.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project addresses fundamental questions essential for understanding how gestational nutrient availability affects offspring ingestive behavior. Ingestive behavior consists of two phases: 1) the appetitive phase, consisting of foraging and food hoarding, and 2) the consummatory phase consisting of actual food ingestion. The consummatory phase (food intake) is well studied in rats and mice. The appetitive phase, however, has received comparatively little attention, even though those behaviors are common to most animals including humans. Unlike rats and mice, hamsters use appetitive behaviors extensively in their ingestive behavioral repertoire, and they use information about internal and external sources (i.e. both body fat and food hoards) of metabolic fuels to maintain energy balance. In addition, hamsters prefer to increase food hoarding rather than food intake during energetic challenges to maintain homeostasis. Preliminary data from this model indicate that male hamsters exposed to gestational nutrient restriction have increased food intake and reduced food hoarding, along with increases in plasma insulin, abdominal fat and hypothalamic neuropeptide Y, while females appear to be largely unaffected. These unique sexually differentiated findings, along with the lack of previous attention to gestational programming of appetitive ingestive behaviors increase the likelihood that the proposed experiments will make significant contributions to the field of behavioral neuroendocrinology. The broader impacts of this project include enhanced undergraduate student mentoring in research, development of a new laboratory course that integrates peer review and publication components, resources for a new Neuroscience major with an integrated K-12 outreach and development of a website describing the curricular innovations and neuroscience research at both general and detailed levels</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This award focused on determining the neuroendocrine mechanisms responsible for the long-term adaptations exhibited by offspring exposed to gestational food restriction. In particular, it supported the development and analysis of a novel model of gestational programming in Syrian hamsters. The project was designed to determine how food availability during pregnancy would affect offspring food intake and metabolism in adulthood. The Syrian hamster model was a unique animal model of gestational programming because this species uses food hoarding behavior to counterbalance potential shortages food availability, unlike other rodent species (i.e. rats and mice). The major goal of this project was to determine if food availability during gestational development affects how food-hoarding-animals (i.e. hamsters) manage their energy budgets behaviorally and physiologically in adulthood. The model, which mildly food restricts pregnant hamsters during the second half of gestation produces low birth weight offspring that exhibit a ?thrifty phenotype? in a sex-dependent manner, similar to what has been reported in other rodent models of gestational programming. These findings provide further support to the notion that nutrient availability during gestation has lifetime consequences for offspring behavior, metabolism and physiology. &nbsp;</p> <p>In addition to the focus on the neuroendocrine mechanisms responsible for gestational programming in hamsters, this award also provided the resources for enhanced research opportunities for undergraduate students, the development of a neuroscience major, updated pedagogical strategies and new course development. As a result of the award, the PI has trained over 30 undergraduate researchers, with one third of them belonging to underrepresented groups in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). This is an interesting group demographic given that the overall percentage of STEM URM students at the PI?s institution is less than 10%. &nbsp;While conducting research with the PI, these students presented their research at a variety of professional conferences, which included the Society for Neuroscience, Experimental Biology, Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology and National Conference for Undergraduate Research. &nbsp;These students are currently pursuing careers in research, medicine and STEM education. The award also facilitated the development of a new major in Neuroscience at Susquehanna University. Since the launch of this curriculum, more than 130 students have majored in Neuroscience during their time as undergraduate students at Susquehanna University. &nbsp;Finally, the resources from this award facilitated the development of a new course in the PI?s field of Neuroendocrinology with a laboratory component that relies on research as the primary pedagogy. This allowed students to be educated about the process of science in the context of the field of Neuroendocrinology, and many students decided to continue to collaborate with the PI on related research projects at the conclusion of the course.</p> <p>In addition to work at her own institution, the PI worked to incorporate broadening participation initiatives into her primary professional society, the Society for Behavioral Neuroendocrinology (SBN), with the goal of fostering diversity and inclusivity. These initiatives aimed to make the society more welcoming to recruit and retain underrepresented groups in the field of Neuroendocrinology. Some of the initiatives included adding a meeting orientation session with introductions to the society officers, coordinating affinity networking meetings for graduate students, postdocs and junior faculty, starting a speed networking lunch session at the annual meeting and having a professional development workshop for trainees during an evening dinner at the annual meeting. The PI was responsible for design, implementation, and assessment of these activities. The broadening participation efforts of this professional society continue to evolve, with SBN creating their first standing Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee this past year.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/04/2020<br>      Modified by: Erin&nbsp;M&nbsp;Rhinehart</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1350448/1350448_10332762_1601853776078_Slide4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1350448/1350448_10332762_1601853776078_Slide4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Life History View of the Regulation of Reproduction"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1350448/1350448_10332762_1601853776078_Slide4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Life History View of the Regulation of Reproduction"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Peripheral hormonal factors and molecular nutrient sensors interact with key central reproductive elements, including Kiss1 and GnRH neurons to synchronize reproduction to the prevailing energy conditions.
