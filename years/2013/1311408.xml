<AbstractNarration>The diverse freshwater fish fauna of Middle America (the region that includes (Mexico, Central America, and the Greater Antilles) has been tied to a myriad of notable biogeographic patterns; however, many of these patterns have not been rigorously examined. In cases where biogeographic patterns cannot be tied to geological events (e.g. the movement of tectonic plates) researchers often fall back on the untested hypothesis of marine dispersal. However, these freshwater species may not be crossing marine habitats or surviving in them for any length of time. This study will test marine dispersal hypotheses (by examining salt tolerance in these species) and raise a novel hypothesis for long distance dispersal in Middle America, namely river dispersal (a hypothesis that freshwaters and their fauna are periodically interconnected by periods of flooding). This study will take a new and integrative approach to unravel the biogeographic history of Neotropical lowland freshwater fishes with similar distributions in Middle America. Methods and data from physiology and geology will be used to vigorously test and distinguish between competing hypotheses. The river dispersal hypothesis could offer a new alternative explanation for the distribution of these fishes via dispersal through lowland rivers, and the results of this work could be used to explain and test the distributions of tropical freshwater species around the world.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Undergraduate and underrepresented minority training is a major aspect of this work. Students will be involved in all aspects of this project from fieldwork, to publication, to presentation of these analyses at national and international meetings. The work will largely be conducted at the Louisiana State University Museum of Natural Science (LSUMNS), a research museum with numerous outreach activities through the university and local community. This study also has a large international component and participating scientists and students in these countries will be active participants in the research. In addition, all specimens and field data from their work will be deposited in the LSUMNS and will be readily available to researchers globally.</AbstractNarration>

The diverse cichlid fishes constitute a substantial portion of this biodiversity, with species ranging from the Amazon of South America north to Mexico.  Predominantly from Mexico and Central America, the heroine cichlids have been a complex group for understanding evolution and biogeography.  There are many species throughout this region, several of which occur in difficult to reach and poorly studied areas.  This project allowed us to work on 13 expeditions to Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama.  Several discoveries were made as part of this project &ndash; new species, new ideas on evolution of Neotropical fishes, and a better understanding of how these fishes came to live throughout Central America and Mexico.  Numerous presentations on the research of this project have also been given at conferences in both the United States and Latin America.  The support from scientists, students, and government officials throughout Mexico and Central America are at the core of making these collaborative projects possible.   Over twelve students from the United States and Central America were mentored as part of this project.  Some were coauthors and presentations and publications, and some also assisted in fieldwork expeditions to Central America.  Additionally, the experience working on projects and fieldwork associated with this grant played a critical role in the success of one of the PhD students (Caleb McMahan) landing a museum job as Collections Manager of Fishes at The Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago.  There he continues studies of the freshwater fishes of Mexico and Central America.
