<AbstractNarration>The Gigabit Community Fund project catalyzes the development of applications (apps) that leverage ultra-high speed broadband networks in service to education and workforce development needs.  The project integrates institutional partnerships, an incentivizing fund to support app development, and a repository of open source tools, code, and documentation to develop learning laboratories for the next generation Internet. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Extending the work of the US Ignite Application Challenge project, the Gigabit Community Fund continues the progression from ideation to build to pilot. The project adopts Mozilla's model of Hive Learning Networks in which collaborative teams in each of the partner cities, Chattanooga and Kansas City, link developers with local anchor institutions to create user-centric apps. The Gigabit Community Fund advances understanding in three critical domains: 1) the development process of the gigabit apps themselves, including specifics of code and strategy; 2) designing compelling STEM applications that increase learning and engagement; and 3) optimizing features of a national ecosystem for gigabit innovation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Gigabit Community Fund project demonstrates the potential for and capacity of ultra-high speed broadband networks to make significant contributions to public sector needs.  The pilot apps generated through the project seeds demand for and investment in technology infrastructure while serving an immediate national imperative to increase access and engagement in STEM learning, particularly by traditionally underserved and underrepresented communities. Through the creation of dynamic learning laboratories, the Gigabit Community Fund project informs the national conversations on infrastructure, app development, and STEM.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[In cities across the United States, ultra-fast Internet is now available in homes, businesses and classrooms. With connection speeds 100 times or more faster than the US average, these gigabit networks are changing how people in these cities communicate, work and learn. A partnership of Mozilla, the National Science Foundation, and US Ignite, the Mozilla Gigabit Community Fund in Chattanooga and Kansas City supported the development of applications and associated curricula that showed the impact of these next-generation networks on learning. Through the Gigabit Community Fund, Mozilla teams on the ground in Chattanooga and Kansas City activated city networks of technologists, classroom teachers, informal educators, and other stakeholders - networks called "Hives" - to explore applications of high-speed, low-latency networks in classrooms, libraries, and other learning spaces.  The community building work of Hive together with the financial support provided through Gigabit Community Fund grants incentivized and enabled multi-organizational collaboration to deploy and test gigabit applications. Across cities, coordinated efforts between Hive communities and Mozilla staff members in Kansas City and Chattanooga showed the potential of the Hive model to contribute to and strengthen a national gigabit innovation ecosystem. Over the course of the project, the Mozilla Gigabit Community Fund:     Fostered innovation by supporting the development of 17 gigabit-enabled projects in Kansas City and Chattanooga that bridge what is currently possible in the gig space with what the future of this technology could look like.     Built community working with 35+ community organizations in KC and CHA to turn prototype projects into pilots, scaling successful programs and galvanizing support for and interest in gigabit technology at the institutional level.     Created awareness and demand for high-speed networks by showing educators, students, and the general public the promise of this new frontier through hosting 100+ community workshops, showcases and events.     Grew a user-base for next-generation networks by funding new educational technology and by empowering community members as beta-testers and co-designers of these new tools.
