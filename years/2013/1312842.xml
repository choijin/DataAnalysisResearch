<AbstractNarration>This work carries out a physics program focused on testing whether the newly discovered Higgs boson shows any deviations from Standard Model expectations as well as searching for new particles, particularly those predicted by supersymmetric theories.  To that end, the Notre Dame group will continue to maintain and operate the CMS electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, the CMS trigger, while expanding its efforts in upgrades of the CMS detector. This work is aimed at contributing to our understanding of the mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking and the identity of dark matter. Although the proposed research activities already have a broad impact through their potential to transform our understanding of the fundamental laws of physics, the broader impacts of this proposal are further enhanced through a variety of educational and outreach activities that continue to build on Notre Dame's strength in those areas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of particle physics is to understand nature at its most fundamental level.  In our experiments, we study the basic constituents of matter &ndash; the particles &ndash; as well as the forces that govern their behavior.  All of the experimental results over the past few decades are well described by our "Standard Model" of particle physics, including the recent discovery at CERN of the Higgs Boson.  But we know that the Standard Model is incomplete, and that there must be new particles and perhaps new forces not yet discovered.  Intellectual Merit:  This grant supported the research of the University of Notre Dame group working at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory, Geneva, Switzerland.  Notre Dame is a member of the CMS collaboration, one of two large multi-purpose experiments studying particle collisions at the world?s highest energies.  The group supported during this period included five faculty; three research faculty; two postdoctoral researchers; 17 graduate students, 8 of whom earned their doctorate; and a large number of undergraduate physics majors.  During this period, the Notre Dame group has made a number of significant contributions to CMS, including physics analysis, software development, computing, detector operations, and research and development for future CMS upgrades.  Faculty and students played a key role in the Higgs discovery, specifically in the analysis of the Higgs boson decaying to two photons.  Since then there has been a great deal of effort to determine if this particle?s properties are consistent with the predictions of the Standard Model, and our group has been heavily involved in this work, in three domains. The first is the continued precision study of the Higgs boson to two photons. The second is the measurement of the Higgs decays to fermions. This includes decays to two tau leptons, and a determination of the Higgs coupling to top quarks via the measurement of the associated production of Higgs bosons with top quark pairs. The third is the search for exotic or unexpected decays of the Higgs Boson. Our group has led the search for lepton flavor violating decays to taus plus an electron or muon. Additionally, our group has expanded its efforts into searches for new physics in the production of top quark pairs with electroweak bosons within the context of effective field theories. Our efforts in searching for supersymmetric particles in final states involving photons and missing transverse energy have become much more sensitive with the large data set at 13 TeV. Our group has a leadership role in CMS software and computing. We have led the effort to provide a detailed, accurate simulation of the CMS detector.  Emphasis has been on simulating the effects of event pileup that will occur at the higher beam luminosities planned for future LHC running.  The Notre Dame group has worked with the university?s Center for Research Computing (CRC) to develop and maintain a Tier 3 computer cluster on campus that is one of the largest in the CMS experiment.  This cluster provides our group?s computing needs and excess capacity is used by the broader CMS community. Through partnerships with the CRC and computer science faculty, our group has developed an innovative suite of software to enable opportunistic use of spare CRC processors, leveraging up to ten times more processing than is typically available in our dedicated Tier 3 resources.  To optimize the detector for future running at higher energies and higher intensities, CMS has begun work on a two-phase upgrade program.  The Phase I upgrade is well underway and the Notre Dame group has important responsibilities and management roles for key parts of this project.  We are making significant contributions to the Phase 2 upgrade of CMS for operations at High Luminosity (the HL-LHC).  We are leading electronics development for central calorimetry, photosensor development for Endcap Hadron Calorimetry and the Barrel Timing Layer (BTL), and are contributing to the optical design of the BTL and to the design and construction of the track trigger upgrade.  Broader Impacts:  During this past grant period, Notre Dame faculty have served as co-PIs of the national QuarkNet program that has brought particle physics to thousands of high school teachers and students over the past 19 years.  There are currently more than 50 QuarkNet centers across the United States and Puerto Rico.  We also serve as mentors for our own active local QuarkNet center.  Notre Dame faculty helped to lead the effort to make a subset of LHC data available to the public, and now analysis of that data is one of the activities offered to QuarkNet teachers and students.  The group has worked with the LHC experiments to extend the reach of particle physics "masterclasses" to locations in Latin America, Africa and Asia.
