<AbstractNarration>Animals begin their life by undergoing a remarkable process of self-organization: Starting from a tiny, single-celled egg, they develop into an incredibly complex organism.  Moreover, they do so without centralized control.  No master builder directs each cell to its correct position in the final body plan. How exactly living cells are able to collaborate to create precisely constructed tissues and organs is the central question of developmental biology.  This project will study a particular example of such self-organization in the fish eye.  It will use a combination of approaches, including observations of eye organization, perturbation of this organization by laser pulses, and computer simulations.  These techniques will provide a deeper understanding of the fish eye system.  This fundamental knowledge about biological self-organization has potential applications ranging from new disease treatments to the design of synthetic self-organizing systems inspired by the mechanisms at work in the eye.  As a collaboration between a physicist and a biologist, the project will create opportunities for interdisciplinary education at many levels.  The investigators will place a special emphasis on involving students from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds in research early in their undergraduate careers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will combine biological experiments with mathematical modeling to study the emergence of the striking crystalline arrangement of cone photoreceptor cells in the zebrafish retina.  The guiding hypothesis is that the formation of this ordered lattice depends on anisotropic mechanical stresses imposed on the retinal epithelium by the annular ligament, a rigid ring of tissue that surrounds the retinal margin.  Prior work has shown that a mathematical model of the interaction between mechanical forces and planar cell polarity can reproduce many of the observed features of the regular arrangement of cones, and, in particular, the model correctly predicted the presence of strongly anisotropic interactions between cells in perturbed retina.  The current project will test the guiding hypothesis directly.  The investigators will use new transgenic strains generated on a pigment mutant background to perform the first imaging and laser microsurgery of retinas in living, adult fish.  This will provide a fine-grained quantitative characterization of the degree of mosaic order in space and time.  Then, the investigators will observe how this order is affected by ablation of the annular ligament and the photoreceptor cells, using microsurgery to measure stress anisotropy in the retina.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ All animals (including humans) are made up of many different types of cells&mdash;for example, liver cells are different from lung cells, neither of which are the same as the cells making up your eye.  As it develops from an egg into an adult, any animal?s overriding challenge is to ensure that the right number of the right kinds of cells end up in the right places.  This project sought to deepen our understanding of how biological development can reliably and reproducibly accomplish this task by studying an example where cells of different kinds are arranged in an unusually precise and intricate manner:  The retinas of most fish contain four different kinds of cone photoreceptors specialized to detect four different colors of light.  These photoreceptors are organized into a highly regular, repeating pattern.  This project used a variety of techniques, ranging from computational models to laser microsurgery, to shed light on how this pattern is established.     Among the specific discoveries made during the grant period were:     1) The cone photoreceptor pattern begins to appear considerably earlier during development than previously thought, and a kind of cells called M&uuml;ller glia play an important role in its initial establishment.  This conclusion is significant because, although glia are widespread in the nervous system (of which the retina is a part), until recently they were thought to play an essentially passive role in neural development and function.  Our finding contributes to a growing body of evidence that they instead take a much more active role.     2) In particular, the mechanical forces required to push and pull the photoreceptors into their final positions are exerted in considerable part by the glia rather than by the photoreceptors themselves, and the glia are entirely responsible for the presence of anisotropic mechanical stresses in the mature retina.     3) The distribution of defects&mdash;that is, essentially, errors&mdash;in the cone pattern is consistent with a model in which the cone cells are initially highly mobile and try multiple different spatial arrangements before settling on the correct one, but not with an alternative model in which the spatial positions of the cells are frozen early one, before they have definitively decided which color they will take.     As a collaboration between a physicist and a biologist, the project also provided interdisciplinary research training opportunities for students from a wide range of intellectual and personal backgrounds.  In total, four graduate students, five undergraduates, and one high school student worked on the project.  These included one graduate student and four undergraduates from backgrounds historically underrepresented in the sciences; two of these four were recruited early in their college careers through the senior investigators? involvement in the University of Michigan?s M-STEM Academies program, for which this grant provided partial support.
