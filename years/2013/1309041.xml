<AbstractNarration>The objective of this proposal is to increase the resolving power and the image acquisition speed, of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy by about an order of magnitude (to 5-10nm). Resolution in conventional photoactivatable-localization microscopy is limited by the localization precision, which, in turn is proportional to 1/sqrt(N), where N is the number of collected photons. In the proposed approach, we can achieve localization precision that is proportional to 1/N. This is achieved by: (1) reduction in the effective size of the point-spread function (PSF) as a result of a novel grating system, (2) increase in the number of detected photons due to interference with a high intensity reference wave and (3) utilization of phase information in addition to the intensity of the signals using a novel optical correlator for optical filtering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The intellectual merit arises from the potential acquisition of fluorescence images with macro-molecular (sub-5nm) resolution enabled by a relatively simple addition to conventional confocal microscopes. The transformative nature of the proposed technique is a result of the higher resolution and faster imaging, which will elucidate the fundamental interactions between proteins and sub-cellular nanostructures with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. Such mechanistic understanding will prove to be essential for future advancements in biology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impacts of this project include (1) training of the scientific workforce via an innovative, inter-disciplinary course, (2) recruitment of under-represented students via a hands-on demonstration module to be utilized at 3 large outreach events, and (3) widespread dissemination via commercialization of the subject technology.</AbstractNarration>
