<AbstractNarration>This REU Site award to the University of Minnesota - Morris, located in Morris, MN, will support the training of a minimum of 6 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2014- 2016.  This project is supported by the Division of Biological Infrastructure in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the International Science and Engineering section in the Office of International and Integrative Affairs at NSF. Students with interest in biodiversity, biological systems, and traditional ecological knowledge will conduct research on the island of Borneo in Malaysia and at the University of Minnesota - Morris. Students can select from a number of interdisciplinary projects under the mentorship of both U.S. and Malaysian scientists. Research projects on plants, microorganisms, and other systems used to produce natural products are available for students to investigate. Students may also pursue projects in microbial biodiversity --  studying exotic terrestrial, freshwater, or marine microbes.  Students will interact with U.S. and Malaysian faculty and students, as well as tribal "community scientists" from several Indigenous groups on the island of Borneo. Students will learn biological and chemical analyses using modern scientific methods, in the context of traditional ecological knowledge. All students will receive training in laboratory/field safety, ethics and the responsible conduct of research, Indigenous rights, intellectual property, and communicating their work to other scientists and the public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Students will apply through the online application system at http://www.embrs-mn.com/training-international-programs/ and will be selected based on letters of recommendation, statement of intent/interest, prior academic performance, and an IP-based video conference or in-person interview.  Students from groups that have been historically underrepresented in the sciences are strongly encouraged to apply.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Success of the program will be assessed using the REU common assessment tool available online. Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting http://www.embrs-mn.com/training-international-programs/, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Michael Ceballos at rceballo@morris.umn.edu)</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The International NSF "REU Site: Indigenous America to Indigenous Borneo - Adventures in Biology and Biodiversity" project provided more than 24 student participants with opportunities to conduct research in Sarawak, Malaysia on the island of Borneo.  Approximately half of the 10-week summer activity during each of three years was spent collecting samples and data in Sarawak with the remainding weeks of each year spent at a field site near the Chippewa Valley National Forest in northern Minnesota.  The latter part of each summer was spent organizing, analyzing, interpreting and preparing presentations of the resulting data.  100% of the students participating in this project were from racial/ethnic or gender (i.e., women) groups that have been historically underrepresented in the sciences.  Native American and Alaska Native students were strongly encouraged to apply and approximately 1/2 of the students served over the 3-year funding period were from this demographic.  Because of the target population served, there was emphasis on data analysis and technical writing as part of several professional development activities during the internship periods.  Most of our student participants had never traveled to a foreign country (and would not have the financial means to participate in Study Abroad "student pay" programs).  The cross-cultural component of the project provided a "global perspective" to the science that was conducted.  100% of the student participants produced powerpoint-style presentations, many of which were delivered at venues in the students hometown (e.g., at libraries, schools, churches) to promote community awareness.  About one-quarter of the students presented research at regional, national, or international conferences.  Several students earned co-authorship on peer-reviewed scientific publications emanating from the research experience.   In summary, outcomes from this project contributed to national efforts to increase diversity and inclusion in the sciences (i.e., broaden participation) and to the mainstream scientific community through presentation and publication of results emerging from this effort.
