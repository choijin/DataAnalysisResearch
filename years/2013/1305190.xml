<AbstractNarration>Despite significant progress in Neural Engineering in recent years, overall progress in the field does not appear to have been commensurate with the scope of investment. It has become evident that the field can benefit from a new paradigm in research and development that focuses on robust algorithm development. The purpose of this planning grant is to develop community support for the creation of the Neural Engineering Data Consortium (NEDC) at Temple University. The NEDC is focusing the attention of the research community on a progression of research questions as well as generating and curating massive data sets to be used in addressing those questions. Under this award, we are conducting an extensive series of workshops and site visits to build consensus amongst various research groups from academia and industry. Guided by this site research, we are developing an operational model for the NEDC that is simultaneously relevant to academic research, industry R&amp;D, and government funding agencies. The NEDC is structured to significantly accelerate research progress and provide resources that promote the development of more robust technology. We are also broadening participation in neural engineering research by making data available to research groups who have significant signal processing expertise but who lack capacity for data generation. The impact of funded research is thus improved by enticing more participation in focused evaluation tasks. Finally, the NEDC is accelerating the transfer of technology to the healthcare marketplace, where it can directly enhance quality of life for a variety of patients.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The purpose of this project was to determine how best to create a consortium for creating and curating large biomedical datasets for the greater benefit of the biosignal processing community. Hospitals, clinics, and research laboratories around the world create immense catalogs of biomedical data every day. If sorted, organized, and made publically available, these may be mined to achieve unprecedented insight into the human condition. Unfortunately, legal, ethical, and cultural barriers have stymied efforts at data liberation, with the net result that powerful machine learning engines and computers have not been used to their fullest capacity to guide and inform biomedical discovery.  Under this grant, we created the Neural Engineering Data Consortium (NEDC; www.nedcdata.org), which is a group dedicated to creating, curating and distributing biomedical signal data to the public. As a proof of concept, the NEDC has published the world?s largest publically available set of clinical electroencephalogram (EEG) data, comprising over 25,000 records.

Although our efforts to date have focused on so-called "found data", our eventual goal for the NEDC is to create custom datasets at the request of the greater biomedical community by pooling funds and resources. Our research through this work have suggest that although many others stakeholders seem to find the idea meritorious, there is still a significant cultural reticence to be overcome.
