<AbstractNarration>Monsoon systems cover much of the tropics and subtropics, and monsoon rains provide the agricultural and domestic water resource for much of the world's population. Thus, variations of the monsoons can have dramatic human consequences, and a better understanding of the processes which cause monsoon variability is desirable.  Research to date has shown that some portion of monsoon variability can be linked to anomalies in remote sea surface temperatures (SSTs) such as those associated with El Nino events, which cause large-scale changes in atmospheric circulation that modulate rainfall in the monsoon regions.  A second potential cause of monsoon variability is the condition of the local land surface, which is affected by rainfall and can potentially have a further influence on rainfall through a variety of land-atmosphere feedback processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project seeks to identify the separate effects of remote SSTs and local land-atmosphere interactions in modulating rainfall and atmospheric conditions over monsoon regions.  The research is focused on two regions chosen to represent subtropical and tropical monsoon systems, China and Northern Australia respectively.  Previous work by the Principal Investigator (PI) suggests that modification of the land surface by a reduction in vegetation cover produces opposing results in the two regions, with an earlier summer monsoon onset in China (linked to greater ocean-land thermal contrast) and enhanced springtime rainfall, and a delayed and weaker monsoon in Northern Australia (linked to reduction in the source of moisture for precipitation due to transpiration from plants).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The research addresses the relative roles of remote SSTs and local land-atmosphere interactions through a suite of regional climate model experiments and statistical analysis. The model simulations will examine the role of land-atmosphere feedbacks through experiments in which aspects of the land surface are held fixed (e.g. fixing the leaf area so that vegetation does not wilt under dry conditions).  The statistical analysis uses a technique pioneered by the PI known as Generalized Equilibrium Feedback Analysis (GEFA). The method uses multivariate lagged correlation to identify causal relationships between monsoon precipitation and forcing from remote SSTs and local land surface conditions (including vegetation as represented by the Leaf Area Index).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As noted above, monsoon variations have strong human impacts, including impacts on crops, livestock, and the duration of the Australian fire season.  If successful, the research performed here may lead to improvements in models used to forecast monsoon precipitation.  In addition, the PI plans to lead a 2-day workshop on land-atmosphere interactions, regional climate modeling and land surface modeling, which will serve to introduce students and early-career scientists to methods used for research on regional climate and land-atmosphere interactions.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project combined a high-resolution regional climate model and observational data to investigate land-ocean-atmosphere interactions on the seasonal-interannual time scale across two monsoon regions within the tropics (northern Australia) and subtropics (China).  Through the application of an advanced statistical approach and carefully designed model experiments, the individual impacts of different ocean basins and the land surface (vegetation, soil moisture) on atmospheric conditions were diagnosed in the two monsoon regions.  The project addressed two primary questions. (1) What are the dominant oceanic controls of the summer monsoons of China and Australia?  (2) Do vegetation feedbacks uniquely impact tropical versus subtropical monsoon regions?  Key findings include: (1) an observed negative vegetation-rainfall feedback was identified over the Australian monsoon region, deviating from most previous modeling studies that concluded a positive feedback; (2) model-simulated leaf area variability over the Australian monsoon region has a clear impact on the temporal distribution and intensity of rain events; and (3) convectively-active phases of the Madden Julian Oscillation (mode of tropical variability) support an enhancement of vegetation-rainfall feedbacks over northern Australia.  Our findings can support improved seasonal prediction for the monsoon regions.  The project resulted in 8 scientific publications and 13 oral/poster presentations.  The PI provided training and guidance in terms of career development to one graduate student, one assistant researcher, and one undergraduate student.
