<AbstractNarration>The Seattle Community College District VI in partnership with the Ocean Inquiry Project will host an REU Site for Marine Science Research in Puget Sound for Community College STEM Students. This three-year project will support eight community college STEM majors annually from a variety of disciplines. Students will be selected from 16 community colleges in the Puget Sound region and will participate over the course of a year. This regional and year-long approach was designed to provide research opportunities to students who have few other opportunities to participate in research. Participants will engage in university-level in-situ marine science research contributing to the understanding and preservation of Puget Sound.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI's, Ann Murkowski (faculty at North Seattle Community College) and Co-PI Marina Halverson (faculty at Seattle Central Community College) are partners on this project and together will provide the intellectual, administrative and mentoring leadership for the project. The eight students will be working in pairs, with two pairs assigned to each PI. The Seattle Community College District will serve as the fiscal lead. Central and North will provide lab space and computer support for lab processing and analysis. The Seattle Maritime Academy (SMA) (a division of Central) will provide the ship(s) and crew for cruises. Senior Personnel, Fritz Stahr and the Ocean Inquiry Project (OIP), will organize the cruises, provide instructors for the cruises, and provide any needed equipment and technical assistance for data collection. Faculty from the University of Washington's, School of Oceanography and scientists from King County Metro's Environmental Lab will be research mentors to the students.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Early research experiences are widely recognized as a high-impact practice that can recruit and retain diverse students in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). The Marine Research in Puget Sound REU was a novel REU designed specifically to accommodate the unique needs of students at two-year colleges. As many of these students are place-bound, this program spread out the activities of a traditional REU program across the academic year instead of in a summer-intensive experience. In addition, the program provided substantial skill-building activities to help these early career students successfully complete an array of research-related activities including: accessing and reading primary papers; performing a literature review; communicating effectively with experts in the field; and formulating authentic and meaningful research questions. Skill and cohort-building activities were scheduled on Saturdays, online, and during breaks between quarters to better accommodate the complex lives of two-year college students. Several external partners, including the Ocean Inquiry Project, provided additional expertise and mentoring to the participants.</p> <p>With the help of the external partners, the PI, co-PI, and other research mentors, students worked collaboratively to develop their own, authentic research question and design their experimental approach. Student teams then collected their data using a variety of lab, field, and ship-based methods. Results were analyzed and presented publicly, most often at the University of Washington's Undergraduate Research Symposium. While the research findings of many of the teams were compelling and important, the broader outcome of the project was nurturing resilience and STEM identity in this important, and often overlooked, population of potential STEM graduates.</p> <p>The Marine Research in Puget Sound REU served a total of 26 students from eight two-year colleges in the Pacific Northwest. Of the 26 participants, 24 (92%) successfully completed their year-long program. Sixty-five percent of participants were first generation students and 12% were returning veterans. While long-term tracking of students is challenging, to the best of the PI's knowledge, all but one of the REU participants are currently either on track to complete a STEM degree or working in their discipline. In addition, two of the participants are now working towards Ph.D.'s in oceanography. This result is particularly powerful in a community college setting where nationally only a third of students successfully transfer to a four-year institution within six years.&nbsp;</p> <p>This REU program has both powerfully impacted the lives of its participants as well as helped the directors pilot and improve the curriculum and supports necessary to successfully mentor early STEM students in authentic, student-centered research experiences. The lessons learned from this program will continue to inform the design and implementation of future research offerings for two-year colleges students, a promising and largely untapped pool of future scientists.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/27/2019<br>      Modified by: Ann&nbsp;J&nbsp;Murkowski</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1358835/1358835_10298850_1553706456168_REU1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1358835/1358835_10298850_1553706456168_REU1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="REU Cohort Presenting at a Research Symposium"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1358835/1358835_10298850_1553706456168_REU1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="REU Cohort Presenting at a Research Symposium"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">REU participants included students from an array of two-year colleges in the Pacific Northwest.
