<AbstractNarration>This Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Particpation Bridges to the Baccalaureate Alliance is named "CIMA" ("Summit" in Spanish). CIMA consists of five Hispanic Serving Institutions in Texas led by the only college in the nation with both a Hispanic Serving Institution and Historically Black Colleges and Universities designation. The CIMA project will broaden participation of minorities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields by involving at least 900 underrepresented minorities (URM) STEM majors in CIMA activities, increasing minority STEM student enrollment by as least 10 percent and increasing the successful transfer of community college into STEM majors at 4-year institutions by 20 percent from baseline. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The CIMA Alliance will provide: undergraduate research; peer mentorship; faculty mentorship; tutoring; Supplemental Instruction (SI) especially in math; STEM student academic development; STEM student clubs; faculty professional development for advising for STEM pathways and teaching best practices; training for college recruiters, advisors and developmental math teachers to improve recruitment of underrepresented minorities into STEM; and development of additional STEM articulation agreements.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Historically Black College and University St. Philip?s College (SPC) and San Antonio College (SAC), Palo Alto College (PAC), Northwest Vista College (NVC) and Northeast Lakeview College (NLC), all Hispanic Serving Institutions, worked together to increase the number of underrepresented minority students (URMs) who attain bachelor?s degrees in science, technology, engineering or math (STEM) through an LS-AMP B2B alliance called CIMA ("Summit" in Spanish).  The CIMA Alliance provided: undergraduate research; peer mentorship; faculty mentorship; tutoring; Supplemental Instruction (SI), especially in math; STEM student ?incubators;? STEM student clubs; training for college recruiters, advisors and developmental math teachers to improve recruitment of URMs into STEM; and development of STEM articulation agreements.  Programmatic emphasis was placed on transforming undergraduate STEM education through innovative, evidence-based recruitment and retention strategies, and relevant educational experiences in support of URMs in STEM disciplines. The LSAMP program also supported knowledge generation, knowledge utilization, impact and dissemination- type activities.  During year four, we focused on increasing opportunities for undergraduate research projects on three of alliances campus, maintaining comprehensive program evaluation, and program improvement.     The Broader Impact of the CIMA LSAMP program includes exposure for at least 127 low-income, first-generation-in-college minority/female students to real-world research, travel, and intellectual activities.  Students have shared experiences with peers and faculty that they would not otherwise have participated in. Several of our CIMA participants have shown strong STEM leadership qualities and most have become committed to a future as researchers/inventors in their fields, and across STEM fields. As community colleges, we know that when one URM student succeeds, members of their family, especially their siblings, are more likely to attempt and attain higher education credentials, which can increase skill levels of our society, and the income level of our citizens. A more skilled workforce can attract industry and high-paying jobs to an area where over half of children are economically disadvantaged.      The Intellectual Merit of the CIMA LSAMP lies in the proof offered by the results of the program that, across STEM disciplines, URMs at community college students who are given academic and peer cohort support and/or undergraduate research opportunities will enroll in and be retained in STEM fields in higher education, and will transfer into four-year STEM programs at higher rates than their peers who are not provided these opportunities.     Outcomes:  1)      As of Fall 2016, URM students declaring a non-medical STEM major increased 11.4% at CIMA Alliance institutions.  2)      As of Fall 2016, the numbers of URM students who were retained Fall-to Fall had increased 7.9%, despite a slight decrease in overall enrollment at CIMA Alliance colleges.  3)      CIMA Alliance colleges have experienced a 168% increase in STEM transfers to four-year programs within three years over the course of the first three years of the program.
