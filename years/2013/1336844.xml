<AbstractNarration>PI: McIntyre, Paul&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1336844&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Stanford University&lt;br/&gt;Title: Research into Emerging Nano-structured Electrodes for the splitting of Water (RENEW)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will focus on photoelectrochemical splitting of water into hydrogen and oxygen.  Oxidation of water at the anode surface is a kinetically difficult process, typically requiring overpotentials of several hundred millivolts even on the most efficient catalysts, noble metals such as Ir or Ru and their oxides.   The PI will study atomic layer deposition (ALD) for ultra-thin film deposition, nanostructuring and surface alloying to minimize the use of these metals in highly efficient water oxidation catalysts, and to explore more Earth-abundant catalyst alternatives for both oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in both single-junction and tandem photoelectrochemical cells. Well-established in semiconductor device fabrication, ALD is now being investigated for energy applications, enabling high-impact discoveries.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project would be an international partnership supported jointly by NSF, Science Foundation Ireland, and Invest Northern Ireland through the US-Ireland Research and Development Partnership Program.  If supported by NSF, the RENEW project would bring to bear the efforts of four PI?s at three universities (Stanford, Tyndall National Institute/UCC, Queens University Belfast) with complementary expertise. The approach integrates activities at our universities to provide both significant intellectual benefits and unique broader impacts of the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI will focus on the nanoscale engineering of water oxidation catalysts deposited on ultrathin, ALD-grown tunnel oxide supports.  Consistent with the recent work on pinhole-free tunnel oxides for efficient and stable photoelectrochemical water oxidation on silicon, the PI will test if these layers achieve corrosion protection of a variety of Earth-abundant semiconductor absorbers with appropriate band edges for efficient solar-driven water splitting. With ALD as a versatile tool for nanoscale materials design, the goals are to study ultra-thin film and nanoscale island catalysts, and surface-alloying of noble metals in tunnel oxide layers. The latter structures constitute an ultrathin, ALD-grown analogue to the much thicker RuO2-TiO2 dimensionally stable anode coatings used in the electrochemical industry. RENEW team efforts will include screening of Earth-abundant, nanocrystalline OER catalysts by wet chemical synthesis methods and development of ALD processes for their deposition.  The PI will also explore II-VI semiconductor absorbers for single-junction and tandem photosynthesis cells with corrosion-resistant photoanodes and cathodes.  Possible applications of this research include grid-scale storage of solar energy and solar-driven synthesis of more complex and energy-dense hydrocarbon fuels, for which water oxidation is likely a required step.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of this project would flow from both international personnel exchanges, including extended student researcher-in-residence visits, across the RENEW team universities, and the coupling of energy and materials research with undergraduate science education at Stanford. In one of two joint efforts in education and outreach, the PI plan to collaborate in the development of a freshman-level electrochemistry course module, using electrolysis of water and corrosion protection of metals as examples of practical applications of electrochemistry. The module will be available for free download from the internet and will include sufficient material for 2-3 lectures in a semester-long introductory chemistry course. The PI also plan to involve undergraduate researchers from other US universities in this project by leveraging existing NSF summer REU programs at Stanford, with special attention given to identifying and recruiting promising female and under-represented minority students as summer researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The RENEW (Research into Emerging Nano-structured Electrodes for the splitting of Water) project ($407,100; 9/01/13 - 08/31/17) was a US-Ireland Research and Development Collaboration Project involving Stanford University, University College Cork (UCC)/Tyndall National Institute in Ireland, and Queens University Belfast (QUB) in Northern Ireland.  Intellectual Merit: In RENEW, the Stanford team investigated the role of different materials combinations and structures in devices that combined efficient light absorption by silicon with efficient oxidation of water by a surface catalyst layer.  By oxidizing water, oxygen and hydrogen are produced, through a process that mimicks natural photosynthesis.  The resulting hydrogen fuel can be collected as a method to store solar energy when the sun does not shine.  Research conducted in this project determined the factors which permit operation of such integrated photovoltaic-electrochemical devices at high efficiency.  In particular, the role of a titanium oxide protection layer which had been previously demonstrated by the PI's research group, was studied and optimized because of its ability to impart corrosion resistance to these devices.  An important outcome of the project was the demonstration of world-record voltages produced by silicon-based integrated photosynthesis cells.  Moreover, we identified a previously-unknown mechanism for voltage loss in such structures and showed how to minimize this loss.  These results may also be important for development of certain types of solar cells.  In another outcome of the project, we used a technique called atomic layer deposition (ALD) to produce a metal oxide alloy which can coat semiconductors such as silicon to protect them from corrosion, build-in a high voltage for photovoltaic energy conversion and also catalyze water oxidation.  These alloy layers have also been discovered to be very efficient for chlorine evolution, an important industrial process.  However, they use orders of magnitude less platinum group metals than standard chlorine evolution electrodes to achieve similar performance.  Broader Impacts: A major aspect of the RENEW project was international collaboration involving graduate student visits to partner institutions across the Atlantic Ocean.  In May 2015, Stanford Ph.D. students Olivia Hendricks (Chemistry) and Andrew Scheuermann (Materials Science &amp; Engineering) each spent three weeks visiting RENEW collaborators at UCC and Tyndall in Ireland, and at QUB in Northern Ireland.  At QUB, they learned about recent results by Andrew Mills? group on novel water oxidation catalysts, and helped his group set up and test a new measurement system, similar to the one at Stanford.  At UCC and Tyndall, Olivia and Andrew performed ALD of titanium oxide protection layers using precursors and plasma sources not available in their lab at Stanford.  In June and July of 2015, Adrian Walsh, a graduate student at UCC, visited Stanford to study highly conductive titanium oxide films he had deposited.  These collaborative activities not only resulted in joint publications, but also provided important professional development and cross-cultural experiences for the students involved, which would not have taken place without this project.  RENEW also promoted undergraduate research.  Two Stanford undergrads were engaged in the project, first as summer research students supported by Stanford, and then as part-time researchers during the academic year.  Peter Satterthwaite is first-author on a paper describing controlled layer thicknesses boost ALD oxide-protected device performance, and John Lawrence, an African American undergrad who recently completed his co-terminal M.S. degree at Stanford, is coauthor of another paper.  Andrew Scheuermann completed his Ph.D. in 2016, and was recipient of an MRS Gold Graduate Student Award (2015) and the TMS Ross Tucker Award for Outstanding Research in Electronic Materials (2016). Scheuermann was also named one of Forbes Magazine?s 30 under 30 in Energy (2015).         Last Modified: 10/30/2017       Submitted by: Paul C Mcintyre]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
