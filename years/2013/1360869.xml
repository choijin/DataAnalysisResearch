<AbstractNarration>Understanding how and why human languages package information in particular ways can shed light on human cognitive processes.  Humans overwhelmingly organize information in order to facilitate maximum comprehension.  In spoken and signed language, salient information is most often presented to the conversant first.  This is then followed with a contextualizing comment or additional modification.  This organization of information is thought to facilitate comprehension.  The main meaning of a word, for example, often comes first, and then, may be followed by suffixes that lend further modification, e.g. English 'like' and 'liked'.  There are a small set of languages worldwide that place all or most modifying information at the beginning of the word, that is, in prefixes rather than in suffixes.  These languages challenge theories of how speakers package information so that hearers can best comprehend a message.  Many such prefixing languages are endangered so that the key to the cognitive processes that allow for comprehension even in the face of unexpected information organization will soon be lost.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The highly endangered Siouan Native American language Omaha is one such complex prefixing language.  This project will lead to valuable documentation of a variety of genres of Omaha from the few remaining elders who speak the language fluently.  The data gathered will inform theories on the cognitive processing of word structure where comment and modification precede the semantic core of the word.  In addition Omaha data will contribute to morphological theories on the organization of affixes:  most languages organize derivational morphology before inflection but in Omaha inflectional and derivational morphology are interdigitated.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Community members Micheal Oltrogge and Alice Saunsoci of the Omaha language department of the Nebraska Indian Community College will work with the tribe's Elders Language Advisory Council to create a database of conversational and narrative discourse in Omaha from thirty fluent Elders.  The team will use state-of-the art language documentation protocol to collect, transcribe, and translate the data.  This work will be conducted in collaboration with linguist Ardis Eschenberg who will also help the team produce a book on Omaha verbs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Both the audio and video documentation and material on Omaha verbs will be accessible from the Sam Noble museum.  The project will broaden participation of Native American language experts through the training in documentary linguistics they will receive as a result of this project.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Outcomes Report:  Discovering Omaha Linguistic Structure through the Documentation of Fluent  Omaha Elder?s Voices  National Science Foundation  Documenting Endangered Languages (DEL)  NSF ID BCS-1360869  PI Michael Oltrogge, Ph.D. Co/PI Alice Saunsoci  The Nebraska Indian Community College (NICC) and the Omaha Language Center implemented award BCS-1360869 Discovering Omaha Linguistic Structure through the Documentation of Fluent Omaha Elder?s Voices to document the linguistic and cultural knowledge of the remaining fluent elders of the Omaha Nation and produce resources for language learners, teachers and interested researchers.  Omaha is a critically endangered North American indigenous language spoken by the UmoNhoN Nation in eastern Nebraska.  The college established a Fluent Elders Advisory Council to assist with the project development planning and provide cultural consultation throughout the project.  The Council played a critical role in the project implementation and identification of fluent elders for participation in the project.  Project Co/PI Alice Saunsoci, Omaha Nation member and first language speaker of Omaha, collaborated with linguist Ardis Eschenburg, Ph.D. to produce and publish the book 500+ Verbs in UmoNhoN (Omaha) providing a critical resource for language learners and teachers.  The books printed by this project where widely disseminated to area schools with Omaha Language classes, Omaha Nation Public School, Village of Walthill Public School, St. Augustine?s School and Omaha Nation Head Start. Copies of the publication where also distributed to NICC Omaha language students in Macy and the city of Omaha Nebraska, community members attending language programing, and attendees of the annual Dhegiha Language Conference.  Copies of the publication have also been provided to the linguistics department libraries of the Sam Nobel Museum at the University of Oklahoma, University of Virginia Linguistics Department Library, Language Library University of Paris III: Sorbonne Nouvelle, France, and the Museum of Ethnology Archives in Berlin, Germany.  Additional outcomes of this project are the video and audio recordings, and transcriptions of interviews with fluent elders, an instructional video for playing hand game utilizing the Omaha language, genealogical information.  After the unfortunate passing of Co/PI Alice Saunsoci, shortly after completing work on the 500+ Verbs in UmoNhoN (Omaha) book, documentation assistants Pierre Merrick and Alison Saunsoci worked with the Fluent Elders Advisory Council to continue documentation of important tribal linguistic knowledge from persons identified by the Council.  The project materials have been deposited with the Sam Nobel Museum of Natural History Department of Native American Languages at the University of Oklahoma to add to the largest collection of Dhegiha Language materials.  The project materials are also deposited with the NICC library and the Omaha Language Department archive at the NICC Macy Campus.    Intellectual Merit   The creative and original concepts explored by this activity are the true collaboration of researcher and community, with importance given to community needs rather than just researcher interest. The project has increased the amount of educational materials concerning the Omaha language and made the materials accessible to community members and interested learners.  500 + Omaha Verbs is now utilized in all Omaha Language classes at the Nebraska Indian Community College and recorded interviews with fluent elders produced by the project are incorporated into syllabi and course work for language classes. Through increased accessibility, students, researchers and tribal members will be able to investigate a wide array of topics utilizing the products of this project.  This community focus broadened the participation of underrepresented groups, Native Americans and senior citizens in National Science Foundation project activities.
