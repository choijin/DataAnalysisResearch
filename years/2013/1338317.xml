<AbstractNarration>ELT Collaborative Research: Perturbation of the Marine Food Web and&lt;br/&gt;Extinction during the Oceanic Anoxic Event at the Cenomanian/Turonian&lt;br/&gt;Boundary&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;by&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Timothy Bralower, Penn State University, EAR-1338316&lt;br/&gt;Bradley Sageman, Northwestern University, EAR-1338312&lt;br/&gt;R. Mark Leckie, Univ. Massachusetts, Amherst, EAR-1338317&lt;br/&gt;Julio Sepulveda, MIT, EAR-1338318&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;br/&gt;The expansion of oxygen-deficient waters, known as hypoxia, is occurring seasonally in places such as the Gulf of Mexico as a result of warming and pollution.  Hypoxia can affect all marine organisms through the loss of habitat, changes in predator-prey dynamics, and availability of nutrients for primary production. Ocean acidification resulting from the input of anthropogenic CO2 is already impacting the ability of many organisms to grow shells.  The geological record contains a series of natural experiments that allow us to address the biological response of the biota to ocean acidification and widespread oxygen deficiency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Cenomanian-Turonian boundary (94 million years ago in the middle of the Cretaceous Period), a time interval marked by mass extinction, was also characterized by global oxygen deficiency and likely ocean acidification.  Thus, the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary is an excellent ancient model for the impact of anthropogenic activities on marine ecosystems.  A superb opportunity exits to explore the impact of oxygen deficiency and ocean acidification during the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary in rock outcrops from the western and southern margins of the US Western Interior Seaway.  In Utah, rocks contain original ammonite aragonite as well as remains of large marine reptiles.  In Texas, British Petroleum has made available a unique core and exclusive access to outcrop sections.  Back-hoeing of rock outcrops will unearth pristine fossil shells suitable for reconstruction of ancient environmental conditions using geological proxies, and coring will provide rocks that can be studied to determine changes that took place over centuries. The insight gained from the CTB can be applied to other intervals of biotic upheaval in Earth history and will help improve projections of the impacts of human activities, including hypoxia and ocean acidification, on modern ecosystems.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Cretaceous Period (144-66 Ma; Ma = mega-annums or millions of years ago) ended with a mass extinction that wiped out the dinosaurs and as much as 75% of all species. The Cretaceous lacked polar ice caps and was warmer than today due to elevated CO<sub>2</sub>emissions from volcanism and much higher global sea levels. Subduction of oceanic crust along the western margin of the North American continent created an active volcanic arc and an extensive foreland basin in the western interior of North America that extended from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. High global sea level during the mid- to Late Cretaceous (~100 to 70 Ma) resulted in a wide, relatively shallow epicontinental sea, called the Western Interior Seaway (WIS). The WIS was fed by cooler, fresher waters entering from the north, and warm, more normal marine waters entering from the south. These cooler Boreal water masses generally flowed south along the western side of the seaway, while warmer Tethyan water masses flowed north through the center and along the eastern side.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This project was designed specifically to test how shallow marine ecosystems responded to times of extreme global warmth in the geologic past. The Cenomanian-Turonian (C-T) boundary interval (~94-93 Ma) is well represented in the U.S. WIS. The C-T interval records extinction and turnover events associated with a global Oceanic Anoxic Event (called OAE2). The WIS is an excellent natural laboratory to investigate the impact of global climate change on the coastal and shallow marine biosphere.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>This was a collaborative project between UMass-Amherst, Northwestern, Colorado, and Penn State. Our primary study site was in south-central Utah (Big Water; western edge of the WIS during C-T time) where we conducted field work in 2014 to collect outcrop samples and core samples drilled through the same strata by the U.S. Geological Survey. The UMass contingent of this collaborative research project also collected outcrop samples from a section in south-central New Mexico (Carthage) in 2016, and from a drill core in northeast Kansas in 2018. We also analyzed samples collected years earlier from a section in Billings, Montana. We have correlated the data collected from these four new sections with previously published data from across the WIS to arrive at a new synthesis of how WIS ocean circulation and productivity changed with rising sea level and inundation of new water masses into the seaway, and how the marine biota responded to the onset of OAE2, increased productivity in the seaway, and the incursion of an oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) from the south.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>UMass research focused on the record of planktic and benthic foraminifera; single-celled marine protists that precipitate a calcium carbonate shell (like that of a clam shell). These sand-size microfossils are not at the base of the food chain (i.e., they are not primary producers), but they are abundant and sensitive proxies of conditions in the near-surface ocean (planktic forams) and at the seafloor (benthic forams). We discovered that both the planktic and benthic ecosystems were affected by OAE2 in the WIS. There were distinct assemblages of planktic and benthic foraminifera related to water mass characteristics, productivity in the sunlit surface waters, and dysoxia or anoxia at the seafloor. There were important south-north and west-east differences across the seaway related to water mass sources, circulation, productivity and oxygenation. There were abrupt changes in assemblages responding to these environmental variables; some of the changes were isochronous across the seaway (everywhere the same age) and some were diachronous (not everywhere the same age). In working with our biogeochemical colleagues on this project, we have discovered, or confirmed previous hypotheses about, the preferred habitats of the key planktic and benthic foram species of the C-T interval in the WIS.
