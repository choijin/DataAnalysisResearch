<AbstractNarration>Multi-modal communication -conveyed both verbally (e.g., speech) and visually (e.g., facial expressions, gestures)- can facilitate children's language learning and development. In particular, accompanying auditory speech with visual cues (e.g., gestures) enhances children's vocabulary development, especially children from racial/ethnic minority groups and lower income households. Typically, these children possess substantially smaller vocabularies than their White middle-class peers. This pervasive "word gap" is evident before children enter school and has potent implications for later achievement and education attainment. Thus, exposing at-risk children to interventions involving multi-modal communication, such as gesture-accompanied speech, may be particularly effective in increasing vocabulary knowledge and bridging the persistent word/achievement gap.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research examines the relationship between gesture and language across racial and socioeconomic status (SES) groups from infancy through first grade. Observational studies will examine how 10- to 24-month-old infants and their mothers communicate through gesture and language during naturalistic interactions (e.g., book reading, play). Experimental studies will examine the impact of multi-modal communication (i.e., gesture + words) on preschool children's ability to learn new words. Finally, a classroom-based intervention study will assess the efficacy of multi-modal (i.e., gesture-accompanied speech) vocabulary instruction with low-SES African American children, who continue to be at risk for poorer academic and educational outcomes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will provide valuable insights into the utility of multi-modal communication (i.e., gesture-accompanied speech) in children's early vocabulary and language development. Moreover, this research has the potential to transform educational practices by creating early and effective learning interventions for all children at risk for language delays or deficits. Furthermore, this program of research will increase research participation of underrepresented, racially and economically diverse groups and provide undergraduates students from underrepresented groups with hands-on laboratory- and community-based research experience through a collaborative partnership with North Carolina Central University, a historically black university.</AbstractNarration>

We found that between 12-18 months, infants start to use pointing to acquire information from their caregivers. When infants point toward an object and receive a label, they more readily learn the word for that object, than when they merely reach toward an object. By 18-months, infants have come to expect a label in response to their points, but do not have the same expectations when they reach for objects. Thus, by 18-months, pointing reflects a readiness to learn, highlighting that infants are actively contributing to their <em>own</em> development by altering their gestures. Therefore, consistently providing labels in response to pointing gestures can help infants build strong vocabularies.</p> <p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Parents Matter</em>. We found that parents (mothers) intuitively alter the way they talk to their infants, shifting the language emphasis as infants develop. Mothers tailor their responses to their infants' communication level. We show that infants start to point significantly more at 14-months and increase their pointing at 18-months. Additionally, mothers are more likely to provide labels in response to infants' pointing, yet offer function information (e.g., what an object <em>does</em>) in response to infants' reaches. These shifts in mothers' responses influence infants' vocabulary development over the second year of development.</p> <p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Culture Matters. </em>When viewed through a socio-cultural lens, we found that Black/African-American and white infants produce communicative gestures (pointing) at similar rates. However, Black and white mothers differ in their responses to these gestures. While both groups consistently provide labels in response to their infants' points, only Black mothers alter their behavior when their infants reach. It appears that Black mothers are sensitive to <em>changes</em> in their infants' behaviors (points vs. reaches), whereas white mothers are more aware of labeling opportunities. Although Black and white mothers differed in how much they talked, they didn't differ in the diversity of language they used. This suggests that Black mothers were efficient in maximizing their language diversity, while saying fewer words, whereas white mothers seemed to favor repetition, particularly when labeling. Importantly, these mothers did not differ in SES, highlighting differences in cultural practices and norms instead of education or income. Also, contrary to popular belief, we found that African-American English (AAE) dialect variation does <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span></em> relate to Black children's academic motivation.
