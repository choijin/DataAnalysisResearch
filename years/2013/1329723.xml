<AbstractNarration>Intellectual Merit&lt;br/&gt;The immobile nature of the plant lifestyle requires an ability to continuously monitor local conditions and trigger responses to help cope as these conditions change. Stimuli are often highly localized, yet responses must occur throughout the plant body. Thus, the signaling networks within plants must broadcast information not only within the cells directly receiving the stimulus but also over much longer distances. This project seeks to define how the calcium ion plays a role in this long-distance signaling system. Preliminary work has revealed that in response to local stress, such as wounding of the leaf or increasing levels of salt around the root, waves of Ca2+ propagate from the site of stress perception to distant regions of the plant within seconds. This preliminary analysis has also highlighted a potential role for reactive oxygen species (ROS) and an ion channel named TPC1 in this rapidly propagating Ca2+ wave system. The major research goals to be undertaken in this project are therefore to use plants engineered to produce protein-based Ca2+ reporters to monitor and characterize the Ca2+ changes both at the site of stress perception and in the tissues transmitting this signal. Molecular changes dependent on the Ca2+ wave will then be monitored to define the relationship between the Ca2+ wave and other well-defined plant stress response pathways such as those triggered by ROS and the defense hormones jasmonic- and salicylic-acid. The third goal will be to engineer the TPC1 gene to alter the regulation of this ion channel such that it should no longer respond to ROS or Ca2+. The ability of these mutated versions of the channel to support the movement of the Ca2+ wave will then be assessed. Through pursuing these three goals, this research program will help define how this newly discovered Ca2+ wave signaling system plays a role in helping plants adapt to a constantly changing environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;br/&gt;This project will integrate research and education. Research opportunities for undergraduates will be  offered through programs such as the Undergraduate Research Scholars Program and recruitment from members of the Posse Foundation that promote the representation of underrepresented groups in science. Opportunities for high school researchers will also be made available. Along with their research training these scholars will be encouraged to present their work at local, national and international meetings. In addition, efforts at outreach to the general public will be made at the local level through events such as the Wisconsin Institutes of Discovery Science Festival, Wisconsin Science Expeditions and Saturday Science at The Wisconsin Institutes of Discovery. A plant biology movie resource, disseminated through outlets such as YouTube, will also be developed. This resource will be directed towards engaging the general public through movies and explanations of plant responses, whilst also providing them with access to the science behind the images.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This research has been focused on characterizing a rapid, plant-wide signaling system that transmits information about local stresses, such as wounding or high salt treatment, to trigger responses in distant parts of the plant. The major conclusion from the work is that plants are able to sense a wide range of environmental factors that arrive very locally on the plant body, such as the chewing of a leaf by a caterpillar, but a network of cellular signaling events then combine to tell the entire plant that this local event is happening. This information is then used by the plant to mount preemptive defenses or adaptations at the whole-plant level. The work has revealed roles for local cellular signaling events triggered by the calcium ion coupled to an emerging key cellular regulator in plants, reactive oxygen species. These signals interact with an amplification system operating at the internal vacuole membrane. The research has defined some of the controlling elements of this system down to the molecular level, identifying some of the calcium transporters and reactive oxygen species generating enzymes involved in these processes. In collaboration with the John Innes Center in the UK, this system has been mathematically modeled, allowing predictions to be made about the role of the various molecular components of the propagating signal. Together these molecular elements generate waves of signals moving through the plant at speeds of up to millimeters per second. The signals are carried in specific tissues, suggesting a long-range signaling network that is &lsquo;hard-wired&rsquo; into the architecture of the plant. Not all stresses trigger identical waves and some, such as damage by aphid attack, trigger only local changes at the aphid feeding site, suggesting the aphids use a mechanism to suppress the long-range defense signaling systems. The research outcomes of this project have also facilitated an outreach program built around delivering regular plant cell biology &ldquo;exploration stations&rdquo; where students and members of the general public were introduced to plant cell responses and signaling with hands-on access to microscopes and plant samples. In addition, the research has involved several undergraduates who have been trained in plant cell and molecular biology who have either gone on to pursue careers in research science and medicine or are still pursuing their undergraduate studies.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/21/2017<br>      Modified by: Simon&nbsp;Gilroy</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
