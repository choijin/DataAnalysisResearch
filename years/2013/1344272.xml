<AbstractNarration>This INSPIRE award is partially funded by the Geobiology &amp; Low Temperature Geochemistry Program in the Division of Earth Sciences in the Directorate for Geoscience; the Human Centered Computing Program in the Division of Information &amp; Intelligent Systems in the Directorate for Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering; and the Virtual Organizations as Socio-technical Systems Program in the Division of Advanced Cyber-Infrastructure in the Directorate for Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will develop new scientific work practices and cyberinfrastructure tools to advance the fields of hydrology and limnology (lake ecology). The project will develop a socio-technical model of "organic team science" in which scientists are motivated to collaborate across diverse scientific communities and to share and normalize data to solve scientific problems through an open framework. potentially creating new cross-disciplinary collaborations around the modelling problems. The project will advance hydrology by making already-collected geospatial data more usable for analysis and simulations. It will advance limnology by developing an integrated hydrodynamic model of lakes as connected to the broader hydrologic network to quantify water, material, nutrient and energy fluxes, which is potentially transformative for limnology. The project will be carried out with collaborators including the NSF Susquehanna/Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory and the GLEON projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project will provide benefits by developing cyberinfrastructure to provide access for limnology to climate and geospatial data and models as well as novel practices for supporting organic team science. The later is potentially a significant and transformative contribution to the infrastructure for science. The hydro-dynamic model could be useful for those managing lakes. The proposal includes plans for outreach to the scientific community to share these findings.</AbstractNarration>

This research has also improved the capacity for: 1) starting communities&nbsp;who have common research interests, 2)&nbsp;inclusion&nbsp;of newcomers, 3) retaining members, 4) fostering contributions, 5) encouraging commitment, and 6) regulating behavior. These principles have guided the design of our organic data science framework and in the evolution of model and data services in support of hypothesis-driven research&nbsp;(<a href="http://www.organicdatascience.org/">http://www.organicdatascience.org</a>).&nbsp;</p> <p>From the physical science perspective,&nbsp;the research focused on theoretical and experimental aspects of the &ldquo;age&rdquo; of water and carbon in lake-catchment systems.

We note that each of our communities have developed an observing system for isotope ratios of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and other environmental tracers but with very different science questions. In this research we have developed a framework using models and data for defining a unified &ldquo;landscape&rdquo; for the catchment-lake system, forming a richer and more collaborative shared research strategy including development of open national data services (<a href="http://www.hydroterre.psu.edu/HydroTerre/Help/Ethos.aspx">http://www.hydroterre.psu.edu/HydroTerre/Help/Ethos.aspx</a>).&nbsp;</p> <p>Our hypothesis is that the lake-catchment provides an experimental basis for predicting flow paths, residence times and the relative age of water and dissolved solutes in space and time, and that understanding these spatiotemporal patterns will provide a deeper understanding of fundamental biogeochemical processes including carbon,&nbsp;phosphorus,&nbsp;and nitrogen cycling within the lake-catchment system (see&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/lol2.10070">https://doi.org/10.1002/lol2.10070</a>).&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/10/2018<br>      Modified by: Christopher&nbsp;J&nbsp;Duffy</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1344272/1344272_10279196_1531237737562_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1344272/1344272_10279196_1531237737562_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Northern Lakes"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1344272/1344272_10279196_1531237737562_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Northern Lakes"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The Northern Lakes Long Term Ecological Research Observatory</div> <div class="imageCredit">P.
