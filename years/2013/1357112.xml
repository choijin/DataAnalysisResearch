<AbstractNarration>How tropical rain forests respond to rising temperatures and carbon dioxide levels in the air has major implications for global climate change and biodiversity conservation. Over the last 50 years, annual increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide have been strongly affected by changes in the amount of carbon stored in the land tropics, with greater tropical carbon dioxide emitted from the forest in warmer years. Warming has been rapid across the tropics and is intensifying, and the next five year period is likely to bring new records.  In spite of the global importance of tropical rain forests, there are few field data to assess the sensitivity of these forests to changing climate. The research in this project will extend for a further five years the longest running study of tropical rain forest productivity and dynamics and their relation to climate. The research is located in old-growth lowland rain forest at La Selva, Costa Rica, in a network of plots designed for making measurements at the landscape scale. The measurements are continuous since 1997 and will provide a further five years of annual field measurements of carbon storage in the forests, and of how the forests are responding to changing climate. Previous research in this project has shown strong negative effects of increased temperature and drought stress, while positive effects of increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide on forest productivity are by comparison very small.  Further measurements will enable researchers to address important and unanswered questions about the future of tropical rain forests on a warmer plant with higher levels of carbon dioxide.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader scientific impacts of this project include extensive research training and development of unique long-term datasets. Already dozens of undergraduates, graduate students and post-docs have participated. The project has produced almost 100 peer reviewed publications and theses and has provided the datasets needed  to stimulate other related research. The next five years will bring continued development of the project website as a principal tool for completely open global access to all of the project data. In addition, the researchers will continue to develop collaborations with educational and non-governmental organizations to encourage use of project data in broader general public settings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Tropical rain forests (TRF) contain a significant portion of the world?s plant and animal species and also store massive amounts of carbon.  How these ecosystems are affected by global climate change will determine the survival of many thousands of species.  In spite of the importance of understanding how TRF interact with climate, there have been very few studies on this topic.  TRF are difficult to study.  Tropical rain forests are generally in remote areas, are hot and extremely wet, and are often located in areas where scientific study is difficult due to local political or health conditions.  The trees, the organisms that make up the biological and physical structure of the forest, can live several centuries, long beyond a researcher?s lifetime and even further beyond the period typically covered by research grants.  In addition, the tropical rain forest that a researcher sees today may have been impacted by events that took place decades or even centuries ago, and discerning the legacies of climatic events or human impacts in real time is not easy.  The research described here successfully addressed many of these challenges.  We called this project the CARBONO project, using the Spanish word for carbon.  Our principal goal was to understand the sensitivity of tropical rain forests to changing climatic factors in order to predict the likely future for these forests.  We worked in the Republic of Costa Rica, a remarkably welcoming and safe place to set up the long-term research required to study the growth and survival of the hundreds of tree species that makes up a tropical rain forest.  In an undisturbed lowland rain forest, we set up a network of 18 study plots strategically sited across a large natural landscape.  Every year from 1997-2019 we intensively measured many key aspects of the forest?s carbon use and carbon storage.   This research was funded by a National Science Foundation (NSF) program that specifically supports long-term research.  Maintaining research like this over multiple decades in a tropical country is relatively expensive.  By training local residents to take all of the field measurements and work with us as long-term project participants, we ensured the consistency of the field data and also lowered project costs.  NSF emphasizes that the results of NSF-funded research must be made freely and publicly available.  We are proud to have been leaders among tropical forest scientists in making the project?s data, and the associated information necessary to understand and use these data, freely available for downloading from the internet.   We discovered that the TRF we studied is tightly linked to current weather conditions.  Trees grow significantly less in years with warmer nights and in years with drier air during the dry season (Figure 1).  All major science academies and professional organizations worldwide agree that the earth is warming due to humans? activities, including our production of greenhouse gases like CO2.  Based on our research findings, it is clear that increasing temperatures, even as little as 2-4o F, will significantly reduce tree growth and increase death rates for the tree species currently living in this forest.  The forest we studied may not disappear as the earth warms, but the species there will certainly change as the more temperature- and drought-sensitive species succumb.  To date, the CARBONO Project is the only research study in the world that monitored all major aspects of the above-ground carbon cycle over an entire TRF landscape annually for two decades.  It was only because of this intensive approach that we were able to detect and measure the high degree of linkage between local weather and the forest?s productivity.  We and our colleagues have communicated the project?s findings to the public in more than a hundred publications over the life of the project.   We are in a period of unprecedented rapid change for tropical rain forests.  Deforestation, resource extraction and global climate change are creating a perfect storm of assaults on these complex ecosystems.  The CARBONO project has created and made publicly available the most complete description ever attempted for an intact TRF forest landscape.  These data will for the foreseeable future be a baseline against which future tropical rain forests will be compared.
