<AbstractNarration>1351721&lt;br/&gt;Grieshop&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to help solve a challenging problem that impacts at scales from personal to global: the human health and global climate impacts of indoor biofuel use by the poor, nationally and internationally. This problem-oriented research is inherently interdisciplinary and uses engineering, aerosol science, education and outreach activities to achieve robust and sustainable outcomes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The central question is: What do we need to know to constrain uncertainties in the impacts of emissions from current and future biofuel burning practices, make good decisions and avoid unexpected outcomes? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The following goals define the scope of the program: &lt;br/&gt;1) Explore how combustion conditions and atmospheric influences dictate the "aging" of aerosol emissions from biofuel burning, and thus their effects on air quality and climate; &lt;br/&gt;2) Bridge lab and field measurements and develop currently lacking approaches to simulate real-world emission and aging processes that control the net impacts of various stove and fuel types; &lt;br/&gt;3) Cooperatively develop and deploy a simple approach to assess stoves in households during new technology roll-out, support monitoring efforts and reduce uncertainty in large-scale emission estimates; and, &lt;br/&gt;4) Engage students from high school to graduate levels and international partners in hands-on learning and research activities to develop skills, excitement and interest in environmental engineering and science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Primitive biofuel use for household energy has massive impacts on human health and the global climate. Indoor biofuel use kills millions each year, and this and other biomass burning are a dominant source of black carbon aerosols and other species with strong impacts on the global climate system and regional air quality worldwide, and possibly even the quality of sources of water used for drinking water. Therefore, reducing emissions from household biofuel burning has rightfully garnered recent attention as a means to provide both enormous global health and climate benefits. However, the actual impacts of current practices and improvements associated with "improved" stoves are both highly uncertain due to limited scientific understanding and the complexities associated with actual stove use and performance. Real-world biofuel burning emission rates and characteristics are not recreated in the lab, hampering the development of effective technologies. Fundamental scientific uncertainties stem from the dynamic nature of biomass burning emissions, which continually evolve (That is these emissions age with time and change in their composition) via complex atmospheric chemistry. Aging of emissions forms secondary organic aerosols, which may fully or partially counteract the warming impacts of the emitted BC through direct (shortwave scattering) and indirect (cloud) climate effects. Thus, aging may dictate the air quality impacts of biofuel burning emissions and whether they have net warming or cooling climate effects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project endeavors to build fundamental understanding of biofuel combustion emissions and how they evolve in the atmosphere, and will bridge the gap between the laboratory and household settings. The resulting knowledge and tools will support the activities of those developing and monitoring new stoves. Insights into the aging of all biomass burning emissions and inputs into global and regional models will be used to understand our current atmosphere and anticipate the benefits or impacts of different development scenarios. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The results of this research will be widely disseminated via publications, presentations at scientific meetings and other, less formal means. A key outcome of the work will be the training of several undergraduate and graduate environmental engineers, and giving them direct experience with the complex, interdisciplinary questions associated with meeting the grand challenges of universal energy provision and environmental sustainability. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition, this program will help build the links between my the University and the Upward Bound program at North Carolina State University, and thus to rural North Carolinian youth who aspire to be the first in their families to earn college degrees. In the end, this project will have impacts far beyond the lab and scholarly arenas by engaging high school students and international implementation partners in the research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Nearly half the world's population burns biomass fuels, often in basic stoves or open fires, for household energy. This leads to exposures to massive levels of indoor air pollution and outsized contributions to regional and global air pollution that are associated with millions of premature deaths annually. Various alternative stove models have been developed and distributed to reduce emissions and impacts, but lab testing often does not represent their performance in the field. Biomass stoves emit gaseous and aerosol pollutants with climate impacts ranging from warming (black carbon, or BC) to cooling (other aerosol components, such as organic aerosols, or OA), which evolve after emission via chemical and physical processes in the atmosphere.

This project aimed to better understand biofuel combustion emissions and how they evolve in the atmosphere and to bridge the gap between the laboratory and household settings. By better understanding the aging of biomass burning emissions, atmospheric models can be improved and lifecycle impacts of stove emissions considered, to better account for the climate and regional/global air pollution impacts of different combustion technologies.  Key outcomes of the study include:  Activity patterns vary drastically between typical stove operation observed in the field and the standard lab testing approach, with the former showing a broader and/or bimodal distribution versus the uni-modal distribution seen in lab tests. An alternative protocol, developed to mimic the distribution of field carbon concentrations in the lab, closed some of the gap between emission factors of primary species observed during lab and field tests.  A Field Oxidation Flow Reactor (F-OFR) was developed to rapidly age cookstove emissions during laboratory and field testing. F-OFR experiments with stoves ranging from an open fire to an advanced gasifier model showed substantial production of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) with aging, which decreased for stoves with increased efficiency. SOA production peaked at ~2-4 days of equivalent atmospheric aging, after which OA was reduced, consistent with a shift from functionalization- to fragmentation-dominated chemistry.  Experiments varying fuel type and OFR operation showed that combustion conditions have a dominant influence on SOA production and chemical character. This suggests that SOA formation observed in OFR experiments is not highly sensitive to fuel type variation or operation at 'non-ideal' conditions. Increased combustion efficiency and greater aging led to decreases in OA mass spectral fragments used as biomass burning tracers and increases in fragments associated with oxygenated organics. The most efficient stove produced highly oxygenated OA, and aging had a relatively small effect on the quantity or level of oxygenation of these emissions.  Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis of SOA mass spectra routinely extracted two MS factors, with a 'more oxidized' factor becoming progressively dominant with more aging. The more oxidized factor is relatively consistent across different stove types/experimental conditions, while the primary and less-oxidized factors were more variable.  A field campaign in a 'simulated field kitchen' in rural Mexico showed that simpler, field-portable measurements (e.g. optical sensors and filter samples) could be used with the F-OFR to measure SOA formation under field conditions to capture real-world stove emissions. These experiments showed that more efficient stoves emitted less primary OA, but determination of SOA formation was complicated by OH-radical-quenching in experiments with less-efficient stoves and insufficient dilution.  A low-cost optical measurement device for PM filters was developed using off-the-shelf components and shown to effectively quantify BC filter loadings.    Other projects that were supported in part through this project showed that:  Volatility and viscosity in complex SOA mixtures were found to be correlated for a range of SOA precursor systems, but an expected relationship between OA average oxidation state and volatility was not observed. Experiments with the OFR at a highway site showed that the seasonality in, and total amount of, SOA formation were dominated by varying contributions from biogenic VOCs, even at a site less than 5 meters from an 8-lane freeway. Thermal-desorption chromatographic analysis of biomass burning emissions can provide an efficient way to provide parameterizations of semi- and intermediate-volatility emission characteristics via the volatility basis set framework.     These results have been disseminated via peer-reviewed journal papers, conference presentations and seminars. The project formed major components of the theses of four graduate students and involved numerous undergraduate researchers, all of whom benefited from experimental, data analysis and technical communication training and experience.
