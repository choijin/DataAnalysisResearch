<AbstractNarration>As is clear from responses to public lectures about human evolution and modern human origins, humans are especially interested in knowing their origin and the implications for how they have arrived to where they are today. Following this, scientific inquiry into the origins of distinctively human behaviors is a cornerstone issue in modern paleoanthropological and archaeological research. In southern Africa, the Middle Stone Age (MSA; ~40,000-250,000 years ago) provides the focus of this research, because during this time, all modern humans originated in Africa and a subset of these fully modern humans expanded out of Africa approximately 50,000 years ago. Within the MSA, the Still Bay and Howiesons Poort industries have become central to understanding of the development of this evolving human behavioral complexity, because both exhibit distinctive and innovate stone technologies as well as several of the earliest forms of evidence for symbolic expression, including the production of engravings and the use of ornaments. However, the specific contexts that stimulated these innovations remain unclear. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With National Science Foundation support, Dr. Teresa Steele and an international team from South Africa, Australia, Germany, and the USA will contribute significant new information by continuing excavation at Varsche Rivier (VR) 003, a newly discovered MSA site in the Knersvlakte of southern Namaqualand, Western Cape Province, South Africa. VR003 provides an exceptional opportunity to investigate human behavioral evolution during this critical phase of modern human origins. Preliminary work at the site has revealed a series of stone industries, along with animal bones, ostrich eggshells and landsnails. However, this sequence is visible only through two small windows into the deposit, but the site preserves much more. Continuing work at VR003 will advance knowledge of the evolution of human behavior during the MSA because the site 1) is one of only very few to preserve the above sequence of assemblages; 2) is located in an environmental zone that is distinct from other long-sequence sites and other MSA sites in general; 3) is situated within the spatial range of sites that preserve evidence of complex human behaviors, such as engraved ostrich eggshell and ochre, and therefore allows the testing of the ubiquity of these behaviors during the MSA; and 4) provides the opportunity to develop a robust chronology for these industries and to test previous models using independent laboratories and methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project provides opportunities for strengthening existing collaborations with American, South African, German, and Australian colleagues and institutions. To train the next generation of researchers, multiple graduate students will participate. Results will be disseminated widely, not only as research papers presented at conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals, but also as raw datasets. The research group is participating in an INQUA HAB COMM Project, which aims to combine technological, behavioural, and environmental datasets from multiple Southern African research projects (including VR003) and make them accessible to others. In addition, results will be shared through formal teaching, local community public lectures, and educational outreach programs in the Unites States and South Africa. All materials that result from our work will be curated and accessible at Iziko South African Museum, Cape Town.</AbstractNarration>

Reoccurring fervor over hominin fossil finds and novel archaeological discoveries highlights the public?s continued strong interest in human evolution and human history, which is at the core of paleoanthropology. Scientific inquiry into the origins of our distinctively human behaviors through research into the Middle Stone Age of Africa is a cornerstone issue in modern paleoanthropological research. In southern Africa, the Still Bay and Howiesons Poort industries have become central to our understanding of these issues, because both exhibit distinctive and innovative stone technologies as well as several forms of evidence for symbolic expression, including the production of engravings and the use of ornaments. This symbolic expression is usually accepted as a unique to our species. Our continuing work at Varsche Rivier 003 (VR003) in the Knersvlakte of Southern Namaqualand, South Africa is advancing knowledge of the evolution of human behavior during the Middle Stone Age because the site is one of only a few to preserve a complete sequence of industries and is located in the Succulent Karroo Biome, a marginal environmental zone that is distinct from most other long-sequence sites and most other Middle Stone Age sites in general.</p> <p>The extended excavations at VR003 have begun to reveal the significance of this site not only to our knowledge of the archaeology of southern Africa, but to our understanding of human behavioral evolution more generally. The site has produced a range of cultural novelties which suggest more diverse behavioral practices during the Middle Stone Age than had previously been known. These novelties appear at multiple points in the sequence, including in the deepest strata excavated so far. Extensive geoarchaeological work confirms that the deposits are substantively intact, with geochronology implying relatively continuous accumulation between 90, 000 and 58,000 years ago, followed by a hiatus that only ended with reoccupation with the last 2,000 years in the late Holocene.</p> <p>The lowest deposits in the site produced an entirely novel Early Middle Stone Age assemblage with no known regional parallels. These innovations, which correlate with an unusual set of environmental conditions, included the production of artifacts from ostrich eggshell, long-distance transportation of marine mollusks, and stone tool technologies focused on manufacture of small flakes and blades from deliberately heat-fractured blocks of silcrete. Intriguingly all of the features that define this assemblage disappear thereafter, even in the younger Early Middle Stone Age, reinforcing that they likely reflect a specific set of adaptations. The results indicate complex and environmentally-contingent processes of innovation and cultural transmission in southern Africa during the Middle Stone Age.</p> <p>In addition to abundant archaeological outcomes, our project has provided abundant opportunities for training, which we hope will contribute to the diversification of our discipline, and in the least, will increase awareness around the value of human evolutionary studies.</p> <p>In total, seven graduate students (five from the USA) have participated directly in the field work and lab work supported by this grant. Additional graduate students have participated in analyses at their home institutions under separate funding. Two post-docs have participated; one from the USA. Most of these graduate students are engaged with the analysis of our data and therefore are co-authors on our publications, providing them with key professional development opportunities. In 2016, three undergraduates participated in four weeks of field work and one week of lab work funded by NSF?s Research Experiences for Undergraduates program. During the lab season, they collected their own primary data for research and honors projects. All three projects were completed and presented at the April 2017 UC Davis Undergraduate Research Conference. Two were submitted as Honors Theses and one as the term paper project for a graduate seminar. One student has continued on to our Ph.D. program (earning an NSF-Graduate Research Fellowship, as well). In one way or another, all of the American graduate and undergraduate students are from backgrounds that are under-represented in science. Our small project is contributing to the diversification of American science ? this is the most significant outcome!</p> <p>Furthermore, the international nature of our project means that five South Africa students from the University of Cape Town participated in our excavations and lab work. One German post-doctoral fellow, two Australia graduate students, and one United Kingdom student have also been involved.</p> <p>To date, we have disseminated our work through three manuscripts, eight conference presentations, five conference posters, four academic talks, and three public talks. The pandemic cancelled a number of additional conference presentations and posters.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 07/31/2021<br>      Modified by: Teresa&nbsp;E&nbsp;Steele</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1324719/1324719_10258806_1627751568823_1VR003beforeexcavation--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1324719/1324719_10258806_1627751568823_1VR003beforeexcavation--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Varsche Rivier 003"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1324719/1324719_10258806_1627751568823_1VR003beforeexcavation--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Varsche Rivier 003"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Varsche Rivier 003 (VR003) before excavation.</div> <div class="imageCredit">SNAP team</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Teresa&nbsp;E&nbsp;Steele</div> <div class="imageTitle">Varsche Rivier 003</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1324719/1324719_10258806_1627751746272_2landscape--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1324719/1324719_10258806_1627751746272_2landscape--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Varsche River landscape"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1324719/1324719_10258806_1627751746272_2landscape--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Varsche River landscape"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The Varsche River and its surrounding landscape, showing the local modern ecology of this marginal environment.</div> <div class="imageCredit">SNAP team</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Teresa&nbsp;E&nbsp;Steele</div> <div class="imageTitle">Varsche River landscape</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1324719/1324719_10258806_1627752442027_3mapandsiteplan--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1324719/1324719_10258806_1627752442027_3mapandsiteplan--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Map, site and site plan"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1324719/1324719_10258806_1627752442027_3mapandsiteplan--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Map, site and site plan"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">A) Map showing VR003 in the context of other MSA sites and their bioregions; B) VR003 under excavation in 2016; C) site plan.
