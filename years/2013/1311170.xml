<AbstractNarration>Although plant adaptations to aridity have been well studied in a few groups, such as cacti, relatively little is known about the diversification of most plants in deserts and other drylands. A group of milkweeds (Matelea subg. Chthamalia) inhabits dry or seasonally dry habitats in Mexico and the southwestern United States, providing a useful system for investigating adaptive diversification in arid bioregions. This group is part of a large, mostly tropical clade of milkweed vines (Gonolobinae) and most exhibit apparent adaptations to aridity. Many have lost their ability to twine (with stems spreading flat on the ground), have small, bell-shaped flowers, or are covered by an abundance of hairs. This research will use the most powerful available techniques to reconstruct the evolutionary history of Chthamalia and to analyze the evolution of adaptations to aridity. Next generation DNA sequencing employing a ?genome skimming? approach will be used to obtain complete chloroplast genomes, partial mitochondrial genomes, and complete nuclear ribosomal gene sequences to robustly estimate phylogenetic relationships, which will serve as a framework for evolutionary analyses of morphological adaptations.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will resolve the classification of little-known plants that have been taxonomically controversial. Several species of Chthamalia are exceedingly rare; resolving taxonomic questions and greater knowledge of their evolution will contribute to future conservation efforts of species and habitats. Integration of traditional systematic approaches with new molecular methods is critical to address hypotheses about evolution, adaptation, and speciation. Graduate and undergraduate students will gain laboratory and bioinformatic training as well as the opportunity to present research results at national meetings.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This award enabled the collection and analysis of genomic scale data to enhance co-PI Angela McDonnell?s dissertation, "Phylogeny and Evolution of New World Milkweed Vines (Apocynaceae, Gonolobinae) with an Emphasis on the Nontwining Species of Matelea subgenus Chthamalia". Few studies have addressed evolutionary hypotheses in this large (~450 spp.) group, because of a lack of understanding of species relationships and generic taxonomy. One important group of these vines, Matelea subgenus Chthamalia, is especially interesting because it contains approximately 20 species from the southern US and northern Mexico that vary in hairiness, ability to vine, and flower shape.

We sought (1) to develop an evolutionary foundation for classifying the species and genera of the milkweed vine subtribe Gonolobinae, (2) to determine relationships among the species of Matelea subgenus Chthamalia, and (3) to analyze patterns of evolution in traits thought to represent adaptations to aridity in these vines.  As a result of funding, 768 low copy nuclear genes, chloroplast genomes, and other high-copy genomic regions were successfully sequenced from 150 samples, representing about 100 species of milkweeds. Our results have illuminated the phylogenetic relationships among lineages of Gonolobinae and will be useful for future systematic and taxonomic studies.
