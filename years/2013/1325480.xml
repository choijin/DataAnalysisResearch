<AbstractNarration>Computers were invented to automate tedious and error-prone&lt;br/&gt;tasks, especially in the context of numerical calculations for&lt;br/&gt;scientific simulation. Given the importance and difficulty of &lt;br/&gt;developing these simulations, it makes sense to study whether &lt;br/&gt;computers can assist in their production as well.  This project &lt;br/&gt;focuses on the open-source project Sundance, which provides&lt;br/&gt;high-level syntax to describe finite element methods (FEM) for the&lt;br/&gt;numerical solution of partial differential equations, freeing users &lt;br/&gt;from the burdens of low-level programming. This approach can reduce &lt;br/&gt;development time from months to days or even hours, allowing &lt;br/&gt;scientists and engineers to get correct answers more quickly. &lt;br/&gt;Sundance is useful software starting from a solid theoretical basis,&lt;br/&gt;where the structure of finite element operators are derived and&lt;br/&gt;analyzed from software-based Frechet differentiation of variational&lt;br/&gt;forms.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Via this domain-specific embedded language, Sundance users (domain&lt;br/&gt;scientistis and engineers) can express and simulate nonlinear processes &lt;br/&gt;with little more difficulty than linear ones; Jacobians are calculated &lt;br/&gt;internally and automatically.  This robust system automates not only &lt;br/&gt;standard simulations, but also sensitivity calculations, eigenvalue&lt;br/&gt;problems, and PDE-constrained optimization, all through the language of&lt;br/&gt;differentiation, providing a simple gateway to efficient ``embedded''&lt;br/&gt;algorithms for optimization and control.  Furthermore, in this project, &lt;br/&gt;Sundance will be extended to run on emerging architectures such as &lt;br/&gt;multicore CPU and GPU machines.  New low-complexity finite element &lt;br/&gt;algorithms based on Bernstein polynomials will be developed and included &lt;br/&gt;within Sundance to further exploit this new hardware.  Thus, this project &lt;br/&gt;represents concrete transformational contributions not only automating&lt;br/&gt;mathematical software but in core numerical algorithms, broadening the&lt;br/&gt;circle of domain specialists with access to leading-edge simulation&lt;br/&gt;technology.</AbstractNarration>
