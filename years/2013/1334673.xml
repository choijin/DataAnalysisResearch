<AbstractNarration>Under downwelling conditions, buoyant coastal currents can transport river-derived material hundreds of kilometers down the coast.  The fate of this material is ultimately determined by the extent of mixing with the ambient coastal waters.  Despite the importance that mixing plays in controlling the along-shelf dispersal of river-derived materials, few studies have directly measured mixing in the far-field of river plume.  This study will quantify mixing and circulation in the Chesapeake Bay by combining a comprehensive field program with numerical models.  The Chesapeake is ideal for this study because of its predictable coastal current and its proximity to extensive research infrastructure at the USACE facility in Duck, NC.  The four primary objectives of the study are: to quantify mixing within the nose region, the interior, and the offshore edge of the plume during downwelling conditions, to obtain detailed measurements of plume propagation speeds and the structure of the circulation behind the nose in a buoyant coastal current under downwelling favorable winds, to identify the dominant mechanisms responsible for mixing and entrainment of salt into the coastal current, and to document the dominant dynamic balances that govern plume propagation during downwelling conditions under a range of wind forcing.  This comprehensive field program will consist of moored, shipboard, and microstructure-AUV observations of circulation and mixing within the plume.  High resolution simulations using ROMS will complement the field program by providing more comprehensive estimates of mixing, diagnose the dynamics of the plume, and assess the role of wind, waves and internal shear in driving plume mixing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Coastally-trapped river plumes represent a class of gravity currents that have been extensively studied using numerical models and laboratory experiments.  Detailed field observations resulting from this study will provide new insights into mixing and circulation processes in a buoyant gravity current.  This project will provide unprecedented measurement documenting the relative roles of mixing and advective straining in modifying the plume?s stratification.  The relative importance of mixing in the nose region versus broadly distributed mixing behind the plume due to winds and waves will also be examined.  Results will also elucidate the role of ageostrophic dynamics in the nose region and along the off-shore edge of the plume, once isopycnals become vertical.  The field program will use adaptive sampling that combines both ship-based surveys and AUV-microstructure observations of a propagating coastal current.  Utilizing the AUV to adaptively sample an ephemeral coastal feature is expected to lead to technological advances in observational oceanography.  Lagrangian data will be complemented by a mooring array that will provide unprecedented near-surface resolution of stratification and shear in the far field of a river plume. Detailed near surface observations of turbulence will help to identify the dominant mixing mechanisms responsible for entraining ambient sea water into the plume.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will serve as the basis for one graduate student's thesis at Rutgers.  Several undergraduate students will also be included in the field effort through the NSF-funded Research Experience for Undergraduates at Rutgers and Woods Hole. The objectives for Broader Impacts are to translate the science themes and data sets from this study into innovative undergraduate teaching materials and to encourage STEM learning for future scientists (grades K-12) through hands-on activities related to the research.  The expertise of the NSF-funded Centers for Ocean Science Education Excellence Networked Ocean World  and the Ocean Observing Initiative's Education and Public Engagement (OOI EPE) Implementing Organization (IO)  will be leveraged to create an online learning module for undergraduates.  These lessons will be disseminated broadly through an OOI EPE online portal and workshops at ocean science meetings (e.g., AGU and ASLO Oceans). The modules will highlight the benefits of teaching with authentic data with the focus of engaging undergraduates in the scientific process.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ River plumes are important pathways that deliver carbon, nutrients, contaminants, sediment and larvae from estuaries to the ocean.  The physical processes that control the transport and mixing of buoyant river plumes ultimately determine the fate of these biogeochemically important materials.  In this study, we conducted detailed field measurements of the transport of the buoyant Chesapeake Bay plume along the coast of Virginia and North Carolina.  We used both ship-based and moored observations to quantify the physical processes that control the transport and mixing of fresh water derived from Chesapeake Bay as it moves along the coast.  The moored instrumentation included unprecedented measurements of the vertical structure of the plume under a wide range of forcing conditions.  We deployed two wave-driven autonomous Wirewalkers that made high-frequency (every ~ 2 minutes) vertical profiles of the temperature and salinity structure of the water column.  The vertical structure of the currents was measured at 11 locations, including from two sub-surface moorings that provided high-resolution measurements of the near surface velocity structure.  These measurements allowed us to measure the dominant terms in the across-shelf momentum balance and show that common assumptions about the physics of river plumes do not hold under moderate to strong wind forcing.  Interpretation of our field observations was aided by high-resolution numerical simulations of the coastal current system using a ocean circulation model.  Additionally a rapidly sampling (4Hz) current profiler measured the plume as it transited down the coast, providing a detailed description of the circulation at the nose of the plume.  Ship-based surveys used a rapidly sampling microstructure profiler to spatially resolve the structure of the plume and directly measure turbulent mixing at the nose.  These are perhaps the most detailed field measurements ever made at the nose of a buoyant gravity current and have been used to directly measure the rate at which fresh water from the plume mixes with the surrounding ocean.  Consistent with laboratory experiments, we found that the most intense mixing is limited to a relatively narrow region near the nose of the current.  Our results suggest that this mixing is augmented by large-scale coherent structures that are not present in laboratory experiments.  Finally, an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) was used to measure the across-shelf structure of the plume under upwelling favorable winds.  The AUV made repeated across shelf transects over a 30km range continuously for 48-hours.  In addition to measuring the density (temperature and salinity) and velocity structure, the AUV also made direct measurements of turbulent mixing.  It is commonly assumed that the majority of mixing occurs during upwelling conditions, but direct field observations with this spatial and temporal resolution have not been made to date.
