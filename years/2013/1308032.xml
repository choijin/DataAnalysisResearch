<AbstractNarration>NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:&lt;br/&gt;Research on bismuth-containing perovskite materials has grown steadily over the last decade due in part to energy efficiency considerations and environmental standards such as the Reduction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) directive.  These same regulations were the motivation for the development of Pb-free solders that were broadly implemented across the electronics industry.  While interest in bismuth perovskites as a potential materials replacement for Pb-based electronic materials has grown in recent years, there have been few studies on the role of point defects (e.g. cation and anion vacancies) in these materials.  This project contributes to the fundamental understanding of the role of defects in bismuth perovskites to help guide the development of these sustainable materials for emerging applications.  This research is critical because point defects ultimately have a profound influence on phenomena (such as piezoelectric fatigue, aging, reliability, and high temperature resistivity).  Fatigue behavior can be a limiting factor in high performance microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) devices, such as ink jet printers, accelerometers, and actuators. This work also impacts the development of capacitor materials for high temperature and high electric field applications because robust electrical properties are important for devices for down hole drilling electronics for geothermal systems, high temperature SiC-based passive components, and others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;TECHNICAL DETAILS:&lt;br/&gt;This project combines synthesis, analysis and computational approaches to investigate the dominant defect species and relevant defect equilibrium conditions for bismuth-containing perovskites to help guide the development of these materials for emerging applications.  Point defects are prevalent in these systems given that many Bi-based perovskites feature tetravalent Ti on the B-site which has been shown to exhibit oxygen non-stoichiometry at high temperatures from a reduction reaction.  Furthermore, the common A-site cations of Bi3+, Na+ and K+ are all known to be volatile under the typical processing conditions of both ceramics and thin films. This project involves three experimental tasks including synthesis of ceramics with controlled cation and anion non-stoichiometry, characterization techniques to identify the nature and concentration of the defect species, and establishing the linkage between the defect chemistry and the materials properties through measurements of the dielectric and piezoelectric properties and electrical resistivity.  Finally, computational (first principles) efforts are integrated throughout this project to complement and verify the experimental results and to help guide future experiments.  In addition to training and mentoring undergraduate and graduate students in materials research, this project incorporates a high-impact K-12 outreach activity by hosting two high school students into the laboratory at OSU each summer as part of the Summer Experience in Science and Engineering for Youth (SESEY).</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to develop a fundamental understanding of the role of defects in a new class of functional materials based on bismuth-containing perovskites.  Defects come in many forms, but one of the most common types is a point defect which is based on a vacant atomic lattice site in a crystalline material. Understanding the role of defects is of paramount importance because defects interact in ways that can help or harm the properties of a material.  This is especially important for many demanding applications (i.e. materials used at high temperatures, high voltages, large number of cycles, etc.) because ultimately the performance of the material depends upon defects.  Perovskite materials with Bi3+on the A-site have been the focus of great technical interest over the last decade. As one example, a number of Bi-based perovskite materials have shown great promise as a replacement for Pb(Zr,Ti)O3(PZT) for piezoelectric applications.  In addition, a number of compositions based on Bi-perovskites (e.g.(Bi,Ba)(B2+,Ti)O3) are being studied for high energy density (or high temperature) capacitor applications.  The technological impact of these materials is expected to grow because research in this area is being driven by increased environmental regulations and energy efficiency considerations.  While there has been progress in improving the materials properties of these new Bi-perovskites, the underlying defect chemistry of these systems is relatively unexplored.  This project helped to develop a framework for understanding the inter-relationship between point defects, processing conditions, and properties.  In one example, for the piezoelectric material based on sodium bismuth titanate, it was shown that the variation in the stoichiometry of the bismuth/sodium ratio resulted in the formation of point defects that destabilized the polarization, which in turn affected the piezoelectric properties.  In another example, for the dielectric material (Bi,Ba)(B2+,Ti)O3, it was shown that the introduction of Bi3+ onto the A-site and a corresponding low-valence cation (e.g. Zn2+) resulted in a high concentration of oxygen vacancies.  With careful control over the stoichiometry to introduce excess charge (i.e. high valence cations), it can be possible to greatly enhance the resistivity.  This is very important for applications that require that capacitors operate at high temperatures or under high voltages, because leakage currents often lead to breakdown and device failure. Interestingly, it was also found that through introduction of lower valance cations to (Bi,Ba)(B2+,Ti)O3 the ionic conductivity increased dramatically.  With experiments using oxygen isotopes, it was observed that oxygen conductivity was greatly enhanced and conductivity levels could be increased to values approaching 0.1 S/cm at 600&deg;C in compositions with 15 to 30 mol% Bi.   These materials show great promise, and with improvements in the properties guided by the results of this project, there are many potential applications that can be considered such as intermediate temperature solid oxide fuel cells, dual phase membranes, and other energy applications.
