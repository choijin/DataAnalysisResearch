<AbstractNarration>This award represents the transfer of a continuing grant for the research of Professor Matthew Strassler from Rutgers University to Harvard University. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The LHC is the world's foremost high-energy physics experimental facility, and will probe distances shorter, and energies higher, than ever before. It will examine the weak interactions, responsible for many natural phenomena, and seek the origin of the masses of the known fundamental particles, known to arise from a Higgs mechanism whose precise nature remains unclear. The LHC might also shed light on dark matter, and might revolutionize our understanding of space-time, through discovery of extra dimensions or Supersymmetry. A full LHC research program requires experts who can work at and across the interface between theory and experiment. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is aimed at strengthening this interface at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) and Rutgers University theory groups, which already work closely with the Rutgers and Princeton University experimental groups and Princeton theory group. The purpose is to augment their LHC research programs in order to close the scientific gap located at the Theory/Experiment Interface, by hiring and hosting experts who can provide tools and knowledge required by both theorists and experimentalists working on LHC physics. This will greatly expand the range of LHC research possible at these institutions, especially assisting with personnel-intensive activities including standard model background studies, development of Monte Carlo tools, and investigations of search strategies for new physics.  The PIs will be involved in both developing new models to describe Beyond the Standard Model Physics, as well as creating an effective theory approach for analyzing and interpreting directly the results coming from LHC. The proposed research includes studies on background removal, using Monte Carlo tools. If a novel signal is seen at the LHC, neither a model-independent approach nor a fully model-dependent approach is appropriate. The PIs propose that once a signal is seen at LHC, they will proceed to build a "model fragment", which in many cases will take the form of an "on-shell effective theory" (OSET). Model fragments were used by the PIs in their successful analysis at the first LHC Olympics workshop, and were developed further into a Monte Carlo tool for wider use. The essential idea is to build a semi-consistent theoretical framework that makes predictions for LHC signals without requiring a fully consistent TeV-scale theory, or in the case of an OSET, possibly without even a fully consistent effective Lagrangian. The PIs will also investigate the Effects of Multiple Soft Jets on Reconstruction and Analysis. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact is to create the nucleus of an LHC center on the East Coast. The IAS and Rutgers, along with Princeton, will form the nucleus of such a center, helping to anchor and enhance the diffuse but substantial research program on the East Coast, which is currently scattered around many institutions. In particular, by training new students and broadening the postdocs at the Theory/Experiment Interface, it would help, over time, to strengthen the entire US particle physics community. Also, by hosting training and research workshops, it would directly benefit other institutions, particularly in the local and regional neighborhood. Most directly, the quick-reaction workshops would foster a more rapid response from the US community to events at the LHC. The PIs also plan a series of  training exercises based on the successful "LHC Olympics" model to  help in the process of training young students and in retraining postdocs from more formal areas of high-energy theory.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world's foremost high-energy physics experimental facility, and probes distances shorter, and energies higher, than ever before.  LHC scientists have recently discovered the Higgs boson, and detailed study of this particle will allow them to gain insight into the ``Higgs mechanism'', the origin of the masses of the known fundamental particles, whose precise nature still remains unclear.  The LHC continues also to search of other phenomena that might clarify why the Higgs mechanism occurred in the early universe, learn whether there are other types of Higgs particles, shed light on dark matter, and/or revolutionize our understanding of space-time.  Because of the complexity of the LHC's proton-proton collisions, a full LHC research program requires experts who can work in several different specializations, and who can cross the interface between particle physics theory and experiment.  This grant originally aimed at strengthening the theory/experiment interface at the Institute for Advanced Study and Rutgers University collider-theory groups, which were already working closely with the Rutgers and Princeton University LHC experimental groups and Princeton's theory group.  Funding cuts at Rutgers University significantly limited the ability of the institutions to meet the initial goals, and eventually the collaborative effort was terminated, with the Rutgers Principal Investigator moving to Harvard for 2013-2015. Nevertheless, many of the scientific and educational goals of the grant were met.  Scientifically the grant produced many studies relevant to LHC research at the ATLAS, CMS and LHCb experiments, as well as at related dark matter experiments of various types.  Much of the research involved pointing out loopholes in experimental search strategies and suggesting ways to fill the gaps.  This is a crucial role of collider theorists in the big-data era of the LHC, since LHC experimentalists often lack the theoretical breadth (and the time) to step back far enough to evaluate their activities in an overarching way.  Many new classes of LHC measurements were proposed and studied in detail; some have now been carried out by the LHC experimenters, most notable among them searches for decays of the Higgs particle to currently unknown ``hidden'' particles. New links between dark matter and LHC experiments were also suggested, along with new proposals for how to find evidence of various types of possible dark matter particles.    This research program took place in the context of extensive discussions with LHC and dark matter experimenters, and the results obtained (and a website summarizing some of them, http://exotichiggs.physics.sunysb.edu/web/wopr/ ) were important in furthering those discussions.  Entire workshops now take place on subjects that this grant helped initiate and promote, such as on particles that travel an observable distance before they disintegrate, on unexpected decays of the Higgs boson to new, as yet unknown particles, and on innovative ideas concerning what dark matter particles might be and how they might be found.   While university funding cuts prevented the the grant's recipients from establishing their intended world-leading center of LHC research on the U.S. east coast, the grant was still a major success in at least two areas.  The broader impact of this grant has been to improve the LHC research program, to which the United States is a major contributor, and to train young American physicists in how to do theoretical physics at the LHC (and future colliders) with close attention to experimental considerations.  Research conducted under this grant improved the ability of the LHC experiments to collect data more effectively and to assure they are sensitive to a number of phenomena for which the experiments were not initially designed.  New ``triggering'' strategies, which are approaches to selecting collisions for permanent data storage, were developed directly a...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
