<AbstractNarration>This action funds Mathew Wolak of Tufts University to conduct a research project in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences area during the summer of 2013 at Okayama University in Okayama.  The project title is "Following Algebraic Fingerprints of Curved Symmetries as they Flatten." The host scientist is Prof. Tomoyuki Kakehi.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project is to characterize the generators of the algebra of invarient differential operators on Cartan motion group. If the cartan decompostion of the original semisimple lie algebra is g = k + p, it is conjectured that the high p-degree terms of the generators of the invariant differential operators on G generate the invariant operators on the contracted group G zero.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of an EAPSI fellowship include providing the Fellow a first-hand research experience outside the U.S.; an introduction to the science, science policy, and scientific infrastructure of the respective location; and an orientation to the society, culture and language.   These activities meet the NSF goal to educate for international collaborations early in the career of its scientists, engineers, and educators, thus ensuring a globally aware U.S. scientific workforce.  Furthermore, Japan is a center for research in Lie group theory and harmonic analysis, and so it is particularly important to enhance partnerships with Japanese mathematicians in these fields.</AbstractNarration>
