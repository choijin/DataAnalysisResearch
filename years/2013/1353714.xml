<AbstractNarration>Under the supervision of Prof. Graham Jones of MIT, Ph.D. student Shreeharsh Kelkar will study edX, a non-profit online learning enterprise jointly founded by MIT and Harvard, focusing on three communities that have organized around this infrastructure--programmers and computer scientists, educators, and learning scientists--as they go about producing the infrastructure by coding software, making online course-ware and analyzing online student activity. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will result in a better understanding of MOOCS (Massive Open Source Online Courses). University administrators and faculty will be better informed as a result as they consider deploying MOOCs to address curricula in US higher education.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The New York Times declared the year 2012 as the "Year of the MOOC," referring to the proliferation of potentially transformative Massive Open Online Courses or MOOCs.  Through these MOOCs, organizations like edX, Udacity or Coursera, along with universities have leveraged the power of networked computing to offer prospective students anywhere in the world an interactive distance learning experience that combines lectures, elite college-level course material, and assessments through quizzes and exams.  Focusing on edX, a non-profit online learning enterprise jointly founded by MIT and Harvard, my dissertation ethnographically tracks the development of its computing infrastructure across multiple institutions: edX, MIT, Harvard, Stanford and Berkeley.  I studied three communities that have organized around this infrastructure&mdash;software engineers, instructional staff, and learning researchers&mdash;who centrally participate in edXÃ†s stated mission of reinventing higher education, as they go about producing this infrastructure by coding software, making online course-ware and analyzing online student activity respectively.  For this project I conducted fieldwork for almost two years from Sep 2013 to June 2015, about half of this period in Cambridge, MA, looking at edX, MIT and Harvard, and the other half in the Bay Area, looking at Berkeley and Stanford.  I also followed the wider community of learning researchers by attending more than 6 conferences and one summer school in learning science.    My fieldwork suggests that MOOC infrastructures (or "platforms") are a step in what I call the "platformization" of higher education.  More specifically, I show that the MOOC platform-builders draw self-conscious inspiration from the technical precedents and corporate practices of Internet platforms like Amazon and Google. In so doing, these software engineers and computer scientists transfer their expertise in building such platforms to the process of teaching and learning (for example, "peer grading" becomes a crowd-sourcing problem), subtly but fundamentally transforming the nature of work and the division of labor within education. I ultimately show how these activities challenge the authority of established learning sciences by redefining the meaning of learning itself, with profound implications for the future of education research.  This research will result in a dissertation (due in summer 2016) that consists of five chapters (bookended by an Introduction and a Conclusion).  Two of these will be submitted as journal papers.  The dissertation will also be turned into a book at a later date.
