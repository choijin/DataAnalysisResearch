<AbstractNarration>The research project synthesizes theory, computation and experiments to create multiscale models of dense particulate flows, ranging from microstructural dynamics of nearly contacting particles to the macrorheological properties of dense suspensions. The theoretical core of the project includes both mechanistic models of nearly contacting groups of particles, and continuum modeling and analysis of the dynamics of dense suspensions. The research develops new Stokesian Dynamics algorithms to resolve the slow particle interactions in dense suspensions, and uses simulations of how particles collectively reconfigure on the micro-scale to accommodate applied external strains to construct a continuum model for suspension rheology. New theory is supported by experiments carried out in the Applied Mathematics Laboratory at UCLA to test predictive models of suspension rheology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Particle laden flows are important in many industrial applications including oil and gas extraction, coal processing, mining of minerals, and waste-water treatment.  Results from this basic research project can be used to develop quantitative models for such diverse applications as spiral separators in the mining industry, cell separation in inertial microfluidic devices and aggregation of microbes. The project supports both graduate student research and undergraduate research involving experiments and theory.</AbstractNarration>

Results from this basic research project can be used to develop quantitative models for such diverse applications as spiral separators in the mining industry, cell separation in inertial microfluidic devices and aggregation of microbes. The project supported both graduate student research and undergraduate research involving experiments and theory.  Inertial microfluidic devices are used to filter rare circulating cancer cells from whole blood, and to deliver droplets at precisely controlled points and time within labs-on-a-chip. In these devices, very small amounts of fluid are moved around at high speeds.  A major outcome of this project is the development of a theoretical framework that allows particle movement in straight channels to be predicted using analytic formula; unpacking the role of particle size and channel geometry in ways that can be used to guide experiments. We then confirmed experimentally the predictions of this theory by creating new image analysis tools. We also extended the theory to study how several particles within a channel self-organize into evenly spaced crystals. Our theory explains the crystal spacing in terms of the size of the particles and the speed of flow in channels. These ideas can be used to control particle separation and therefore to design better microfluidic chips.  The second major result of this project is to develop theory for how flow of red blood cells affects the distribution of cells travelling through a network of small blood vessels. We use zebrafish blood vessels as our model.  We show that feedbacks of cells entering the finest vessels behave like traffic on freeways when they reach their carrying capacity. This behavior controls how red blood cells are distributed among the finest vessels, and that such networks are, in fact, optimally tuned to ensure that every fine vessel receives red blood cells and oxygen at exactly the same rate. Our result reveals an organizing principle that underlies the healthy function of microvascular networks. A third result of this project concerns the behavior of multispecies particle laden slurry flow which is relevant for many industrial applications including the food processing industry, waste water treatment, and mining.  We developed a new theory and model for gravitationally driven flow with different particle types such as glass and ceramic beads, which are readily available for laboratory experiments.  The theory involved the study of a new system of partial differential equations for the different species and the background fluid carrying the slurry.  We performed analysis of these equations to show that shocks &ndash; in which the concentration of one of the species changes suddenly from one location to another &ndash; can explain the dynamics of the laboratory experiments.  This work has direct implications for developing a predictive theory for spiral separators used in the mining industry.
