<AbstractNarration>Rapid changes in water availability, due to climate change or land and water management practices, can present extreme challenges to arid land agricultural systems, ecosystems, and economies.  In the American West the existing risks of water shortage, desertification, and low sustainability in arid lands have been compounded over the last hundred years by the increased removal of water resources from rural watersheds for use in cities.  Agricultural arid land communities struggle as they simultaneously face climate change, variable water availability, encroaching urban development, increasingly polarized agricultural politics, and rapid inflation in the costs of business.  Climate change and changes in water and land management policy can result not only in destabilization of local agriculture and economies, but can also have detrimental environmental effects, altering ecological systems and processes.  In the face of these challenges, households, communities, and governmental resource management agencies will have to make changes in order to cope; however, strategies to adapt to new conditions will depend on perceptions of climate change, water availability, and how these affect the local agricultural resource base.  Studying the effects of changes in water availability on arid lands and their key stakeholder groups has been particularly challenging because the impacts of climate change and water policy are felt at a variety of scales, including Federal, State, regional and local.  At each scale individuals perceive the changes differently and respond in unique ways shaped by cultural and institutional influences.  This project will examine how various stakeholder groups at different scales perceive climate and water policy changes and how these perceptions affect natural resources and management decisions.  The investigators will examine historical data on climate, water availability, and vegetation, combining this with interviews, participatory GIS, documented water management policies, and historical personal accounts of environmental change and response in order to assess the relationship between measured and perceived environmental change as well as to understand better how people's perceptions shape the effectiveness and long-term sustainability of coping strategies.  By studying the human and natural systems together, the investigators will be able to examine the complex feedbacks between them through time and across spatial scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will have significant implications for land management, water policy, and biodiversity conservation planning in semi-arid lands and other water-limited environments.  Our empirical analysis will allow replication and model development for other systems or locations to examine the resilience and sustainability of local practices and government policies.  The results of this study will contribute to developing sustainable approaches to coping with variable water availability and policy shifts by helping land managers understand the past and plan for the future.  The results will also contribute to better understanding of the dynamic relationship between climate, water availability, and vegetation communities in the Eastern Sierra region, which will be of interest to land managers developing conservation and range management plans.  Water policy and conservation planning have traditionally been a top-down exercise, ignoring scale, changes through time and from place to place.  This project will generate new knowledge about how environmental perception and response vary with scale and time, and how this knowledge can be used to adaptively manage coupled natural and human systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Coping with Change: Water Availability and Arid Land Management project sought to establish an understanding of the environmental changes in water and vegetation in the Owens Valley, California, over the last fifty years, the causes of such changes, and the ways in which these changes are perceived of and responded to by water and land management agencies and local communities.  Over the course of the project, over 200 vegetation and spectrometry transects, 110 sites mapped with community participants, over 200 historic documents analyzed, and two dozen elders in the stakeholder communities interviewed in order to address both environmental change over time and the ways in which institutions and individuals in local stakeholder communities notice and remember these changes.  A replicable mixed methods approach was employed that engages community members through a participatory, citizen-science model and that communicates concerns of local communities to land and water management agencies in ways that render stakeholders (and stakeholder groups) anonymous.   Furthermore, a replicable mixed methods approach was successfully utilized to generate independently collected and analyzed data with regard to establishing the presence or absence (and type) of vegetation change over time &ndash; and to investigate divergence between such data and the ways in which it has been perceived, conceptualized, and communicated in stakeholder institutions and groups.  Significant divergence between the ways in which institutions and local community members notice, remember, and respond to environmental change were apparent &ndash; in terms of scale, perception, and communication of memory, as well as relationship between memory and management action.  This has direct, significant implications for studies of climate change risk analysis and communication about climate change to the public.  Findings were presented at over a half dozen academic conferences and have been submitted for publication to a peer-reviewed journal (with more papers currently in the writing process).  After all publications are under review (in 2017-2018), the datasets (with the exception of interview transcripts, due to agreements about confidentiality) will be made available via the online participatory mapping website (www.participatorygis.com).   Additionally, the project had significant impacts on providing educational opportunities, particularly for women and minority students.  The lead institution, CSU Northridge, is a Hispanic-serving institution.  The project spurred significant research-based learning opportunities for students in two geography classes, a field biology class, and an anthropology class across two years of the project period.  Four graduate students, two undergraduate community college students, and one post-graduate research assistant were provided paid research assistantships across three years of the project.  Of those seven students, three were Native American, four were ethnic minority students, and four were women.  Two of the seven have since been employed in full-time research-based positions post-graduation (one in the field study area).   Finally, the project has broader impacts for the local communities in the study area.  Preliminary findings have been presented to community stakeholder groups in a series of three local presentation meetings in different towns.  In addition, when analysis is complete (in 2017), presentations will be offered to land and water management agencies, to Tribal governments, and to local stakeholder groups through organizations such as museums and libraries.  The anticipated impact of these communications is both an increase in citizen-science (through the online participatory mapping website) and local engagement in discussions of environmental change and a decrease in conflict between management agencies and local communities (if management agencies take local communities? concerns about environmental change into their annual evaluation and strategic planning efforts).
