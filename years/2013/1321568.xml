<AbstractNarration>This project will improve our knowledge and understanding of the nature and variability of African easterly wave characteristics and the processes that determine the predictability of African easterly waves at daily-to-intraseasonal timescales. The work is planned around two complementary themes: (i) variability of AEWs and (ii) predictability of AEWs. The variability-work will combine statistical analysis of observations and NWP analyses supported by idealized modeling and a case-study approach to determine the extent to which AEW characteristics vary at daily-to-intraseasonal timescales and why. The predictability work will be explored using forecast sensitivity analyses and will interact strongly with and benefit from the variability work.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;AEWs provide an opportunity to understand atmospheric predictability for a class of phenomenon where dry and moist dynamics are of equal importance, unlike midlatitude systems that are primarily associated with dry dynamics. Increased knowledge and understanding of the variability and predictability of AEWs is important for weather forecasters concerned with the West African region as well as those interested in the potential for tropical cyclogenesis downstream. The knowledge gained in this project will be used to update the diagnostics on our webpages used for routine monitoring of AEWs and AEW-activity that are used by such forecasters. AEWs are responsible for a significant amount of rainfall during the boreal summer, this work is also applicable to a range of applications important for society including hydrology (and flood prediction), agriculture (and crop prediction) and health (including malaria risk assessments). While such applications will not be dealt with in this project, efforts will be made to communicate the results of this research to the relevant communities. One way to do this will be through communication with scientists working in these areas within the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) project.</AbstractNarration>

PhD student Yuan-Ming Chen earned his PhD based on this work.     The second major thrust of this project was to understand the factors that modulate our ability to predict the evolution of AEWs.  This was accomplished by analyzing AEW forecasts from the ECMWF ensemble prediction system.  This system provides multiple forecasts that are initialized at the same time; therefore, if the simulations have different forecasts of the AEW, it is indicative of a lack of ability to predict that feature.  This analysis was carried out over two periods (2007-2009 and 2011-2013), which were characterized by significant numbers of AEWs, but different versions of the ECMWF model.  AEW position and intensity forecasts from 2007-2009 were less skillful than forecasts from 2011-2013. One of the reasons for the less skillful forecasts from 2007-2009 is related to how the two versions of the model simulate convection.  In the 2007-2009 version, the model produces excessive rainfall and convection relative to satellite-based observations, which in turn causes the AEW to become too intense in the forecast.  By contrast, the 2011-2013 forecasts show a weaker relationship between convection errors and AEW errors.  The second phase of this work investigated whether certain locations or situations are associated with less predictable AEWs.  Less predictable AEWs are characterized by higher relative humidity in between 2-5 km above the ground, which in turn results in more variability in rainfall and convection, and hence in the AEW itself.  By contrast, the variability in AEW forecasts does not appear to be sensitive to non-convective processes that could also lead to the intensification of AEW. This work provided training in atmospheric prediction and dynamics for Travis Elless, who earned a Ph.D. through this project.
