<AbstractNarration>The PIs plan to establish the effects of climate change on terrestrial organic carbon (OC) dynamics in the Ganges-Brahmaputra/Bengal Fan system since the Last Glacial Maximum. Sub-millennial resolution records of sediment and OC burial in the Bengal Fan will be developed using inorganic proxies of sediment composition and delivery and paired stable isotope/radiocarbon measurements. These records will enable reconstructions of variations in monsoon strength, paleo-vegetation, and OC residence time, providing insight into the relationships between climate change, geomorphic response, vascular plant biomarkers, and terrestrial OC dynamics in the Bengal Fan. The proposed work will support two early-career scientists, and will train two undergraduate students from underrepresented minority groups. The project will strengthen international collaborative ties through data sharing and synthesis efforts with Swiss and German researchers.</AbstractNarration>
