<AbstractNarration>PI: Dalal, Vikram / Schiff, Eric&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1336134 / 1336147&lt;br/&gt;Institution: Iowa State University / Syracuse University&lt;br/&gt;Title: Collaborative Proposal: Fundamental Research on Physics of Instability of Organic Solar Cells&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will to systematically study, identify, and potentially overcome the various physical phenomena in both materials and in devices that lead to degradation of organic solar cells when subjected to light.  Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices are an increasingly important photovoltaic (PV) energy conversion technology. Recent advances in efficiency to ~12% range in both single and tandem junction OPV solar cells are very encouraging for eventual commercial deployment. However, the devices are known to degrade rapidly when exposed to light, losing 20-30% of the initial efficiency within ~100 hours of illumination, even when encapsulated or kept in inert atmospheres. A major market for this technology is building-integrated products, since in principle, the OPV devices can be laminated onto existing window frames. For such commercial deployment, it is essential that the degradation be reduced significantly, to &lt;10% range over the lifetime of the product, which is typically ~20 years for building products. Similarly, another major market segment, providing power for rural populations in developing countries, also requires relatively long life, even though they do not require the same power conversion efficiency as grid-connected central power in the U.S.  This project will systematically investigate the changes in fundamental physical parameters such as optical absorption, hole mobility, deep state densities in both the absorber materials and at the hetero-junction interface when OPV materials and devices are subjected to illumination. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PIs will study the evolution of defects using both electrical measurements such as capacitance-frequency at different temperatures, and structural measurements such as spin resonance. PIs will study the kinetics of defect evolution over time under varying intensities of light so as to establish kinetic laws that govern defect evolution. Then, the PIs will systematically explore the thermal annealing of these defects over time, thereby finding out activation energies for annealing.  The PIs will correlate these kinetics and annealing energies to the structure, morphology and composition of the organic materials, and the specific technology used for fabricating the devices. A number of different materials such as P3HT and PCDTBT will be studied and the relationship between the various kinetic parameters to the nature of the bonding in the materials will be established. We will use these results to design and fabricate better polymers which are likely to be more stable while maintaining power conversion efficiency. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader impact consists of the industrial impact of the work, and in educating both graduate and undergraduate students in the field of OPV devices and materials in particular, and solar energy conversion devices in general. Significant attention will be paid to transfer the research results into education by including new lab sections in existing courses. Both women and under-represented minority group students are expected to play a significant role in the research. The results of the research will be broadly disseminated to scientists and engineers through publications, and by offering webinars through IEEE. Dissemination to the general public will be done by giving talks both in the U.S. and overseas.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This NSF award explored the conversion of solar energy into electricity using two types of solar cell. The first type was cadmium telluride, which was invented forty years ago. The second was "perovskites", which have burst into prominence in just the last few years. They are a new photovoltaic material that apparently mixes aspects of organic electronic materials (such as are used in OLED television sets) and inorganic electronic materials like silicon and cadmium telluride.  The most fundamental intellectual question that the project explored in both cells was the limit to the efficiency of solar energy conversion. The actual approach in both cases was to measure the "mobility" for the electrons, which is the ratio of the speed of an electron to the electric field that drives its motion. Mobilities have not been explored very well in either material, but since both cells are about 20% efficient, most investigators have assumed that the mobilities must be fairly large &ndash; around 100 cm2/Vs in quantitative terms. We found that the mobilities are much lower than this with actual working cells &ndash; mostly less than 1 cm2/Vs. For perovskites, we also discovered that the mobilities are "dispersive", which means that mobilities calculated from a measurement that tracks the electrons for a microsecond are much lower than mobilities from a picosecond measurement. It is intriguing and unexpected that these cells work so well with mobilities much lower than crystal silicon, which is the material used for most solar cells today. The mobilities also offer insights into the atomic scale motions of the electrons, such as whether they bounce off boundaries between the internal grains or they?re confined to some type of internal maze. We reported on our results in two publications, a doctoral thesis, and an undergraduate honors thesis.  The broader impacts of the project are of two types. Solar cells are a technology that is giving the US options about how to generate the electricity we use. Most scientists are concerned about our use of fossil fuels like coal for this purpose because of their emission of waste gases that may damage the atmosphere. Regular crystal silicon solar cells are becoming quite inexpensive, but cells made from thin films like perovskites can be used in applications like architectural coatings that aren?t accessible to silicon. They may also be useful for improving the electricity output by combining them with silicon solar cells.  The second impact lies with the training of students for science &amp; technology jobs, and the education of citizens about options for future energy generation.  During this project, four students did thesis research in the laboratory for their undergraduate and graduate degrees, and many others took courses taught by the investigators about solar energy that were informed by the ongoing research project supported by NSF.
