<AbstractNarration>****Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;This project will explore the quantum dynamical properties of "macroscopic" objects, namely, single-molecule magnets (SMMs) and Josephson devices.  Each of these systems can be thought of as an artificial atom capable of telltale quantum phenomena such as tunneling and superposition states.  As such, they hold promise as qubits in the burgeoning field of quantum computing.  In this project, some novel quantum phenomena will be investigated in these systems, potentially illuminating their suitability as qubits.  Microwave spectroscopy of SMMs will be used to explore "forbidden" transitions in which a selection rule is lifted by spin tunneling.  Such forbidden transitions are expected to have non-linear power dependence due, in part, to dynamical phase interference effects.  Geometric (or Berry) phase interference will be investigated in both SMMs and Josephson devices by looking for the suppression of dynamical processes, such as tunneling, when the interference is destructive.  The research will be conducted primarily at an undergraduate institution with active participation of undergraduate student-scholars, a graduate student, a postdoc and a faculty member.  The research activities will afford amply opportunities for training and mentoring that will help the participants develop the technical and leadership skills needed in their future scientific and technical careers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;****Non-Technical Abstract****&lt;br/&gt;Quantum computers harness the counterintuitive laws of quantum mechanics to solve some problems more efficiently than any classical computer could.  Qubits, the processing elements of quantum computers, need to be large enough to be individually addressable yet small enough to be able to maintain well defined quantum states for long periods of time.  This project will investigate the quantum properties of artificial quantum objects (magnetic molecules and superconducting devices) that occupy this middle ground.  Microwave spectroscopy will be used to explore "forbidden" transitions in magnetic molecules that will illuminate their quantum properties and may herald their viability as qubits.  Quantum interference (one of the most counterintuitive of quantum effects in which an object seems to take two or more mutually exclusive paths simultaneously) will be explored in both magnetic molecules and superconducting devices to reveal the extent to which such a telltale quantum effect can be observed in "macroscopic" objects.  The research will be conducted primarily at an undergraduate institution with active participation of undergraduate student-scholars, a graduate student, a postdoc and a faculty member.  The research activities will afford amply opportunities for training and mentoring that will help the participants develop the technical and leadership skills needed in their future scientific and technical careers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project focused on studies of the quantum properties of molecular nanomagnets &ndash; molecules that behave as tiny magnets.  These molecules show uniquely quantum mechanical properties such as "tunneling", in which the magnetic moment can reverse direction without having sufficient energy to overcome an energy barrier.  Because of their quantum nature these molecules hold promise as potential qubits, the processing elements for quantum computers.  The work done in this project involved both experimental and theoretical work to study fundamental quantum properties of molecular nanomagnets, often using spectroscopic methods.  One key finding of the research was the observation of photon-induced transitions in which the molecule?s angular momentum state changes by several units when absorbing a photon that carries only one unit of angular momentum, a process that is normally highly forbidden but that is enabled by the molecule?s intrinsic quantum mechanical tunneling.  The research has also involved the development of new techniques and tools for performing spectroscopy.  Apparatuses for controlling the orientation of a crystal within a spectrometer were developed and implemented.  A design for a new kind of microwave resonator used in spectroscopic experiments was developed and a patent application for the design has been submitted.   The research involved the participation of numerous personnel, including a graduate student, a postdoctoral researcher and numerous undergraduates.  The research was carried out at Amherst College, a premier undergraduate institution where students often work on original research projects.  Several students worked on the project during summers, often continuing part time during the academic year.  Three students performed yearlong honors theses, a capstone experience that involves research and the production of a lengthy document.  Each of the students working on the project had a substantial research experience doing cutting-edge work using state-of-the-art equipment.  Many students became coauthors on publications and/or gave posters on their work.        Last Modified: 11/29/2017       Submitted by: Jonathan R Friedman]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
