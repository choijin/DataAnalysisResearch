<AbstractNarration>The objective of this Workshop proposal, supported by the Energy, Power and Adaptive Systems program in ECCS is to increase the participation of faculty across the nation in three workshops planned to disseminate educational material and approaches developed at the University of Minnesota through two ONR Grants "Center for Reforming Undergraduate Education in Electric Energy Systems" and 2) "Center for Developing and Disseminating a Graduate/Undergraduate Curriculum in Electric Energy Systems to Universities and Practicing Engineers."  This effort was aided by a previous NSF grant "ONR/NSF-Sponsored Workshops on Reforming Graduate/Undergraduate Curriculum in Electric Energy Systems". Through these grants, eight faculty workshops were held and three more are planned to promote curriculum reform in undergraduate education in Electric Energy Systems.</AbstractNarration>
