<AbstractNarration>This program will analyze over 100 IRS archival spectra from the Spitzer Space Telescope with the objective of understanding infrared emission from dust structures in active galactic nuclei (AGN).  The investigation will address a number of important questions about dust in AGN, and will determine if the simplistic dust torus plus orientation explanation for the differences between Seyfert Type 1 and Type 2 galaxies requires significant revision.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader impacts of the work include training of undergrad and graduate students, and outreach to local K-12 schools by educating students on cutting-edge astronomy topics.</AbstractNarration>
