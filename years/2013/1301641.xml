<AbstractNarration>Random Schrödinger operators describe an electron moving in a medium with random impurities.  In the widely accepted picture, in three or more dimensions there exists a transition from an insulator region, characterized by localized states, to a very different metallic region, characterized by extended states, while in one or two dimensions there are only localized states. This proposal aims to further the mathematical understanding of this picture and of related topics. Arguably the most important open question is the existence of delocalization in three or more dimensions.  Since localization has only been proved by a multiscale analysis (or by the fractional moment method, if applicable), in practice the region of localization is the spectral region where the multiscale analysis can be performed.  We propose to make progress on delocalization by proving the existence of a spectral region where the multiscale analysis breaks down, i.e., some consequence of the multiscale analysis is violated, and by showing delocalization properties (e.g., transport) in this region. We will continue our study of the ac-conductivity in linear response theory for the Anderson model to obtain insight on localization and delocalization. We will investigate the continuity of the density of states for Schrödinger operators in four or more dimensions, and for Schrödinger operators with a magnetic field in two or more dimensions.  We will extend the bootstrap multiscale analysis to the multi-particle continuous Anderson Hamiltonian, an interacting multi-particle random Schrödinger operator, obtaining Anderson localization with finite multiplicity of eigenvalues, dynamical localization, decay of eigenfunction correlations, etc.  We will also investigate localization for multi-particle continuous Anderson Hamiltonians with no assumptions on the single site probability distribution except for compact support, allowing for Bernoulli and other singular single site probability distributions. We will investigate localization for the (discrete) Anderson model in two or more dimensions when the single-site potential is a Bernoulli random variable, a longstanding open problem.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Random Schrödinger operators describe an electron moving in a medium with random impurities.  In the presence of impurities, a material that normally acts like a metal (i.e., it conducts electric current) will exhibit localization and behave like an insulator for electric currents. The impurities create a metal-insulator transition with important practical consequences. This research will contribute to the understanding of electronic phenomena in condensed matter physics, such as Anderson localization and the quantum Hall effect.  Some of the topics of research are suitable for PhD theses, and will be used for the training of future researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This proposal aimed  to further the mathematical understanding of disorder induced phenomena in Quantum Mechanics, as in random Schrodinger operators and many-body localization.  There is an intensive effort in the physics community to create a coherent theory of many-body localization (MBL). On the mathematical side, not much progress had been made, besides studies of exactly solvable models.  The XXZ Quantum spin chain in a random field has received considerable attention in the physics. What makes this model accessible to rigorous analysis is that it is particle number preserving. This allows the reduction to  the study of an infinite system of discrete N-body Schrodinger operators on fermionic subspaces.  In particular, for the Ising phase of the XXZ chain, in the absence of an external field, the low energy states above the ground state are characterized by a droplet regime. In this regime, spins form a droplet, i.e., a single cluster of down spins in a sea of up spins.  The PI and his collaborators developed a strategy and proved dynamical exponential clustering for eigenstates in the droplet spectrum. The PI and his collaborators established dynamical manifestations of localization in the droplet spectrum for the spin chain, including non-spreading of information, zero-velocity Lieb-Robinson bounds, and general dynamical clustering.    The PI and his collaborator investigated localization for the random XXZ Quantum spin chain in the multi-cluster spectrum.  Localization in the multi-cluster spectrum exhibits new phenomena. While localized eigenfunctions with energy in the droplet spectrum have the shape of the hump of a dromedary, localized eigenfunctions with energy in the two-cluster spectrum have the shape of the hump of a camel. A suitable multiscale analysis for proving this new phenomena has been developed in work in progress.  The PI and his collaborator developed a new approach for proving localization (pure point spectrum with exponentially decaying eigenfunctions, dynamical localization) for the Anderson model at high disorder. In contrast to the usual strategy, this approach is not based on finite volume Green's functions. The basic objects studied in this new approach are finite volume eigensystems.  In this approach finite volume localization means eigenfunctions are uniformly localized and eigenvalues are uniformly separated (at that scale).  A multiscale analysis is performed, showing that this happens at larger and larger scales with high probability. The multiscale analysis conclusions are used to derive localization.    The method was first developed for the Anderson model at high disorder, where localization is obtained in the whole spectrum. The method was then extended to prove localization for the Anderson model in an energy interval.  In particular, it yields localization for the Anderson model in a nonempty interval at the bottom of the spectrum (fixed disorder). The original  analysis  relied on a probability estimate for level spacing.  For the Anderson model such an estimate is is  derived from Minami's estimate.  Level spacing probability estimates are not widely known,  imposing a strong limitation on the applicability of the EMSA. The well known methods   previously developed  for proving localization for random  Schrodinger operators use a  more widely available bound, the Wegner estimate. This estimate is proven for a large family of both lattice and continuum random Schrodinger operators, making it possible to establish localization in these contexts. The PI and his collaborator developed an EMSA that relies on the Wegner estimate.   The  PI and collaborators extended the quantitative unique continuation principle to Schrodinger equations with singular potentials and applied it to obtain  bounds on the density of states of  Schrodinger operators with singular potentials. They   obtained a strictly positive, locally uniform lower bound on the density of states for alloy-type random Schrodinger operators in multi-dimensional Euclidean space. They extended the bootstrap multiscale analysis to the multi-particle continuous Anderson Hamiltonian, obtaining Anderson localization with finite multiplicity of eigenvalues, decay of eigenfunction correlations, and a strong form of dynamical localization.  They extended to the two-particle Anderson model the characterization of the metal-insulator transport transition  by the slow spreading of wave packets.

They proved local Wegner estimates for continuous generalized Anderson Hamiltonians, where the single-site random variables are independent but not necessarily identically distributed. As an application, they show that the (differentiated) density of states exhibits the same Lifshitz tails upper bound as the integrated density of states.
