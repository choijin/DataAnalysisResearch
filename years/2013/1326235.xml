<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding for laboratory experiments conducted by coPI Collin Weigel under the supervision of Prof. Stanley Reynolds.    The experiments test the effects of clear economic incentives on individual decision making in dynamic environments.  Research in psychology and marketing suggests that people tend to continue on a course of action once they have sunk resources into their decisions, and that people continue even when it is no longer rational to do so.  The experiments test the hypothesis that a clearly defined environment and clear economic incentives correct this tendency.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous scholars have argued that because people stick with their course of action once they have 'sunk' resources, it is very difficult to change such a course of action.  This has been used as the basis for marketing campaigns and for efforts to encourage the adoption of new technologies.   The new research funded by this award may result in new insights about how to market innovative products.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project studied the Sunk Cost Fallacy, which is well-rooted in psychology but has not been adopted within economics. The Fallacy, or what I will call the Sunk Cost Effect (SCE), is the tendency to continue on a course of action once money or effort has been sunk to pursue that course. The study used two separate experiments that test different aspects of the SCE and use different settings. The first experiment uses a completely abstract setting, removing as many confounding factors as possible. The second experiment frames the subject as an apple farmer who is making decisions, and tests not only for the SCE but to see if it changes based on responsibility for the decision, and also uses a real-effort task as a sunk cost.</p> <p>The first experiment the subjects can choose to quit a round and lose everything they have paid, or keep paying for a chance to win a prize. There appear to be two types of subjects, the risk-aversion-dominant type, and the SCE-dominant type. The risk-aversion-dominated tend to be more willing to quit as they sink more money, which is predicted by standard risk aversion. The SCE-dominant type display the opposite effect, which is that they are less likely to quit as they have sunk more money. The population as a whole shows a small tendency towards the SCE-dominant type, but this experiment used repeated rounds for individuals, making it possible to separate individuals by type. In applications, it is often not possible to separate the population in this manner, which could be a reason why several empirical studies have not found the SCE.</p> <p>The second experiment used a setting in which subjects paid to enter the apple business, and then chose which fields to plant. It was not an all-or-nothing situation like in the first experiment, subjects could abandon sunk costs and still earn a profit. If they planted more costly fields when they had paid more to enter, it is evidence of the SCE. The experiment found that subjects generally demonstrated the SCE. Males were much more likely to show the SCE, and studying economics did not reduce the effect. The experiment also used a situation with no uncertainty; like in psychology questionnaires, subjects are in a situation where they know what will happen but may choose to earn less money in order to &lsquo;honor sunk costs&rsquo;. Subjects were more likely to pay to &lsquo;harvest&rsquo; a field when they had paid more to &lsquo;plant&rsquo; it, controlling for all factors that affect profit. Subjects answered a psychology-style question offering a choice between two trips that they had already paid for: one had cost less but would be enjoyed more, which trip would they choose? Choosing the more expensive and less enjoyable trip demonstrates the SCE.
