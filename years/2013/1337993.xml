<AbstractNarration>This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) grant provides funding for acquisition of an additive manufacturing machine for direct fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) metal components to facilitate integrated research and education. This equipment performs the laser-based direct metal additive manufacturing process (sometimes referred to as 3D printing), which uses a metal powder bed, and selectively melts the powder to fabricate, layer-by-layer, three-dimensional metal components from many different metals, including titanium alloys and stainless steel. This enables the creation of complex components, including those with features that are impossible to fabricate using alternative techniques. The equipment will enable the realization of two research thrusts aimed at (1) advancing additive manufacturing science and engineering, where the proposed instrument will be used as a testbed for research and training on additive manufacturing, and (2) enabling cutting-edge research in medical devices, robotics, and tribology, where the equipment will be used to build unique structures and devices for research projects.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The acquisition of this equipment will have a wide-ranging impact on science and technology of advanced manufacturing by enhancing our understanding of additive manufacturing and by enabling novel discoveries in other fields, such as medical devices, robotics, aerospace and energy systems. The objective of this project is to acquire a laser-based additive manufacturing machine for fabrication of metal parts for research and education. Additive manufacturing processes for fabricating 3D metal components are starting to revolutionize both manufacturing and other science and engineering fields; the acquisition of this equipment will accelerate current efforts. The equipment is also expected to bring new design and manufacturing paradigms that future engineers must learn and practice. The equipment offers important opportunities for the college curriculum. It is also a promising platform for exciting K-12 students about manufacturing--the lack of such interest is one of the most important challenges for the future of manufacturing in the United States.</AbstractNarration>
