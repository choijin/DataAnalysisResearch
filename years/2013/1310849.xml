<AbstractNarration>Luskin&lt;br/&gt;1310835&lt;br/&gt;Park&lt;br/&gt;1310849&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Through this collaborative proposal, the investigators develop numerical analysis and improved surface Cauchy-Born methods to ensure their reliability and improve their efficiency.  The mechanical behavior and properties of nanomaterials is dominated by the effects of surfaces, whose effects become increasingly important with decreasing nanostructure size.  Surfaces can cause unique, non-bulk mechanical properties, including elastic strengthening (i.e. smaller is stronger) and phase transformations, and can serve as the nucleation point for defects such as dislocations and twins.  Major extensions of the numerical analysis of finite element methods for continuum elasticity and its coupling to atomistic models is required to enable the surface Cauchy-Born methods to accurately compute problems with surfaces (defects) and discrete surface microstructure, because the complex multi-well energy landscape of real nanostructures must be confronted. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Many important future nanotechnologies, such as nanoscale resonant sensors, nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS), and stretchable nanoelectronics, can be improved by a better understanding of how localized nanoscale surface effects impact their effective mechanical properties and reliability.  In particular, the numerical analysis of surface Cauchy-Born methods improves the representation of the key atomic-scale surface physics that govern defect nucleation, elastic strengthening or softening, and the failure mechanisms of surface-dominated nanomaterials.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The mechanical behavior and properties of nanomaterials is dominated by the effects of surfaces, whose effects become increasingly important with decreasing nanostructure size.  Surfaces can cause unique, non-bulk mechanical properties, including elastic strengthening (i.e. smaller is stronger), phase transformations, and serving as the nucleation point for defects such as dislocations and twins.  Modeling surface effects in nanomaterials is computationally challenging for a fully-atomistic numerical simulation.  As a result, various continuum-based (i.e. Cauchy-Born) approaches have been proposed to capture surface effects in a computationally efficient (i.e. finite element) framework.  However, these modified continuum models lack a systematic control over the error in the approximation.     The major accomplish of this work is the introduction of a novel approach to efficiently and accurately capturing surface behavior through the use of a predictor-corrector method that possesses a more controllable error and an improved approach to handling surface geometries. In this predictor-corrector method, the Cauchy&ndash;Born method serves as the initial predictor for material behavior, allowing for the usual tools that study bulk behavior to be applied to the surface problem too. As the Cauchy&ndash; Born method works well for the interior, it should serve well for an approximation of the bulk response of the material. The solution for the Cauchy&ndash;Born method is then corrected in the next step to take into account surface effects by minimizing the energy difference between the atomistic energy and the Cauchy&ndash;Born energy about the Cauchy&ndash;Born solution. This correction occurs over a boundary layer near the surface at atomistic resolution. The size of the boundary layer is a controllable parameter in this predictor-corrector method and allows for a systematic control over the accuracy of the approximation. The corrected solution represents the approximation of this predictor-corrector method to the atomistic behavior.
