<AbstractNarration>This EAGER proposal seeks funding to develop a new in-situ H+ eddy correlation (EC) system by adapting and optimizing pH liquid ion exchange (LIX) electrodes that were originally developed for medical use (Ammann et al. 1981). &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project would support the career advancement and research endeavors of a new Postdoctoral Scholar at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. It would also include international cooperation through collaboration with the microsensor laboratory group at the Max Plank Institute for Marine Microbiology and combined with the expertise and EC instrumentation from the University of Virginia, would enable the collaboration between three of the very few research groups presently engaged in aquatic EC research.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The research developed a new and novel instrument (the Eddy Covariance Hydrogen ion and Oxygen Exchange System, ECHOES) that measures the exchange of metabolically important constituents between the ocean and organisms living on and within the seafloor. The instrument relies of the vertical transport of dissolved chemicals that is mediated by ocean currents and their interactions with the bottom, or the turbulent vertical transport. The vertical water velocities were measured using Doppler principles and are combined with high frequency measurements of both oxygen and pH. Oxygen is used as a tracer of benthic photosynthesis and respiration, providing the net metabolism of the benthic community.
