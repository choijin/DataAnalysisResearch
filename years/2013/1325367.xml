<AbstractNarration>Objective: The objective of this program is to explore an innovative concept that leads to microstructured sapphire fibers with porous, anodized aluminum oxide as cladding that further functions as anchor of Au and Ag nanoparticles for chemical sensing and measurements by surface-enhanced Raman scattering at high temperatures. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit is to theoretically calculate mode-field distribution in the porous aluminum oxide cladding to determine the optimal microstructure of the oxide for high mode-field overlap and thus strong light-analyte interactions; to use the calculated results as a guide to coat and anodize Al coating on sapphire fiber to obtain porous oxide-cladded microstructured sapphire fiber; and to evaluate the feasibility of microstructured sapphire fibers decorated with Ag and Au nanoparticles for SERS measurements of hot combustion gas at 500ยบ-1500ยบC. The program is transformative in that it will help usher in a new category of specialty optical fibers for demanding applications where existing fiber technologies are not suitable.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The broader impacts are multi-faceted. Technologically speaking, optically coupled microstructured sapphire fibers could be used as a micro-reactor or test bed for the development and understanding of new catalytic phenomena with laser spectroscopy as a powerful in-situ probing technique. From educational perspective, this program will provide a fertile training ground for a graduate student and a diverse group of undergraduate and high school students. The collaboration with Czech researchers adds a significant international dimension. Dissemination of research results will be achieved via conference presentations and peer-reviewed publications.</AbstractNarration>
