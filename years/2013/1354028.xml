<AbstractNarration>PI:  William Mitch&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number:  CBET-1066526&lt;br/&gt;Institution:  Yale University&lt;br/&gt;Title:    Elucidating a novel photodegradation pathway: impact of halides on the photodestruction of organic contaminants in estuarine and marine systems&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Estuaries have long been considered critical ecosystems, serving as nutrient-rich nurseries for a host of marine life.  However, as populations surge in coastal areas, there are increasing concerns regarding the negative impacts on estuarine organisms of organic contaminants from point sources, nonpoint sources, and even direct loadings from aquaculture or oil spills.  Although photolytic degradation is among the more important controls on contaminant fate, there has been no systematic evaluation of the effect of salt, the defining characteristic of estuarine and marine systems, on contaminant photolysis.  In a recent publication, the PI demonstrated that seawater concentrations of halides enhanced the photobleaching of dissolved organic matter (DOM) chromophores by 40%.  Experiments controlling for ionic strength demonstrated that the effect was specific to halides, and consistent with the formation of oxidants that selectively target electron-rich chromophores; such oxidants include singlet oxygen or reactive halogen species (RHS; e.g., Br?) formed by the direct oxidation of halides by excited state triplet chromophores.  The PI presents preliminary data indicating that halides also significantly enhance the direct photodegradation of tetracycline and the indirect photodegradation of 17Ã¢-estradiol.  Additionally, he employed probes to demonstrate that halides increase the steady-state concentration of excited state triplet chromophores, critical intermediates in the formation of singlet oxygen and halogen radicals.  Lastly, he presents results indicating that promotion of singlet oxygen and halogen radicals may play important roles in organic contaminant photodegradation, and in the case of halogen radicals, may halogenate contaminants.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed research would employ two approaches to systematically evaluate the impact of halides on the photodegradation of organic contaminants subject to both direct and indirect photolysis.  On a practical level, the first approach would quantify the direct and indirect photodegradation rates of contaminants across halide concentration gradients to indicate the importance of halides for the photo-fate of contaminants in estuaries.  Experiments would be conducted with and without ionic strength control to distinguish whether the influence of salts is a generalized ionic strength effect or specific to halides.  On a fundamental level, the second approach would explore the underlying mechanisms.  They will employ a probe to quantify the steady-state concentrations and rates of formation and scavenging of photo-excited triplet states of the organic contaminant (in the case of direct photolysis) or DOM chromophores (in the case of indirect photolysis).  These experiments will be coupled with use of an additional probe to quantify the steady-state concentrations and rates of formation and scavenging of the selective oxidant, singlet oxygen, formed from the photo-excited triplet state organic intermediates.  Although similar probes have not been developed to measure RHS, we will employ a RHS scavenger to indicate whether these species play an important role in organic contaminant photodegradation in estuaries.  As an additional indication of a role for RHS, we will evaluate whether halogenation of organic contaminants occurs.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Despite years of research on contaminant photolysis, there has been no systematic investigation of a role for halides in promoting contaminant photolysis.  Generally, halides are considered to modify ionic strength, not to participate in specific photochemical reactions. Accordingly, reaction pathways applicable to freshwater systems have been applied to saline waters.  The systematic characterization of specific halide-assisted photolysis pathways would transform our understanding of the role of salts in aqueous photochemistry, and enable more accurate predictions of the fate of the increasing loadings of organic contaminants expected in estuaries and marine systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The characterization of specific halide-assisted photolysis pathways would be very relevant to understanding the turnover of marine DOM, an important component of the global carbon cycle.  Moreover, the definition of an abiotic pathway to organohalogen formation would be important as the origin of halogenated organics in marine systems is a significant issue in oceanography.  In addition to the research opportunities afforded to graduate and undergraduate students, a high school science teacher will assist in summer research, with an eye to incorporating experiments into the curriculum over the following year.  With the help of the teacher, underrepresented high school students will be identified to assist in the research over the following two summers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The fate of chemical contaminants in marine waters is an increasing concern.  Population growth is fastest in coastal areas.  The chemical contaminants generated by humans are discharged to coastal waters either directly, or, for inland communities, after discharge of freshwaters into estuaries.  Municipal wastewater treatment plants remove only a portion of chemical contaminants prior to discharge.  Human activity also is promoting harmful algal blooms (e.g., "red tides").  These algal blooms can generate algal toxins.  For example, the largest such bloom ever recorded in the Pacific stretched from California to Alaska this past summer, closing fisheries due to the generation of the toxin, domoic acid.  Understanding the fate of chemical contaminants in seawaters is important for modeling their impacts.  One of the major pathways responsible for contaminant degradation is photochemical degradation.  Photochemical degradation occurs when chemicals absorb sunlight directly.  Alternatively, for chemicals that do not absorb sunlight, they can still degrade when other natural organic matter absorbs sunlight and generates reactive intermediate compounds that in turn degrade chemical contaminants (a process called indirect photolysis).  One category of reactive intermediates are Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS).  These oxygen-containing intermediates are the same species that form in the human body (via alternative sunlight-free processes), and for which humans take anti-oxidants, to minimize damage to important biomolecules. To date, most research on photochemical degradation has focused on freshwaters, since these constitute conventional drinking water supplies.  Our research focused on characterizing seawater-specific photodegradation reactions.  Previously, most researchers had assumed that photodegradation in seawater was largely similar to the processes already characterized in freshwaters.  We found that halides (chloride and bromide, chloride is the main salt in table salt), the key salts distinguishing seawater from freshwater, increase the photodegradation rates of contaminants, including algal toxins, by up to 6-fold.  We demonstrated that sunlit natural organic matter reacts with halides to form reactive intermediates, which we call Reactive Halogen Species (RHS), as an analogy to the Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) in freshwaters.  We also demonstrate the importance of considering these reactions by modeling efforts that demonstrate the these processes can degrade freshwater algal toxins in rivers discharging  into estuaries over the timescale of these discharges.  We also demonstrated that the high salt concentrations, regardless of the nature of the salts (i.e., halides or not), alter photodegradation pathways and the nature of the reaction products.  Altogether, our research demonstrates that photodegradation of contaminants in seawater can be fundamentally different from what occurs in freshwater.  Our research also evaluated the effects of high salt concentrations on engineered photodegradation processes.  High population growth and droughts in the western US are fueling the need for drinking water utilities to find alternative water supplies.  These alternative supplies include municipal wastewater effluents and seawater. In both cases, reverse osmosis membranes are frequently used to remove salts and organic contaminants.  The clean water passing through the membranes is used as a drinking water supply, but these membranes also generate a waste brine containing high concentrations of salts and organic contaminants.  We evaluated the effects of the high salts on photo-driven engineered treatment processes designed to destroy contaminants by generating Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS).  The ROS in turn can react with halides (e.g., chloride and bromide) to generate RHS.  While previous research had assumed that the efficiency of contaminant degradation would decline due to the decrease in ROS, we demonstrate that the RHS ...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
