<AbstractNarration>The research objective of this award is to learn the sensor fabrication method, the optical cross-connecting architecture, the network framework topology and the system autonomy that is required to create a cognitive and fault-tolerant fiber optic sensor network for structural health monitoring under harsh conditions. The approach is to examine and learn from the unique sensing features of the spider orb-web, formulate the critical sensor and network parameters, and apply this knowledge to the design and demonstration of a robust fiber optic sensor network. Specifically, a new method will be derived for fabrication of robust fiber Bragg grating sensors using high repetition rate femtosecond laser pulse trains.  A new lossless cross-connector will be designed to enable the meshed sensor network. The theoretical model of the optical network topology will be established to obtain a fault-tolerant network management methodology for multiplexing and organizing a large number of sensors. The interactions between the pump and probe signals will be studied to find a  time-domain technique for fast and fault-tolerant sensor interrogation.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If successful, the research will result in an enabling sensing technology for in situ monitoring of the health status of critical civil infrastructure under harsh conditions.  The studies will enrich the knowledge base of monitoring technologies for safe operation of the nation?s civil infrastructure, especially for improving mission-critical services and emergency responses during extreme events such as earthquakes. The research will also be integrated into academics through various educational and outreach actives such as undergraduate and graduate course enrichment, support of senior design projects, hands-on workshops for 7th/8th grade students, and outreach to high school students.</AbstractNarration>

The work included four major parts: 1) design, fabrication and demonstration of various robust fiber sensors for SHM, 2) packaging of these fiber sensors for operations in harsh environments, 3) investigation of new methods to integrate a large amount of fiber sensors, and 4) validation of the concept of spider-web based fiber sensor network.</p> <p><strong>Robust fiber optic sensors</strong>: a number of new robust fiber optic sensors are designed and fabricated for this project. The first sensor is a microcavity extrinsic Fabry&ndash;Perot interferometric (EFPI) fiber-optic sensor for strain measurement at high temperatures. The second sensor is a novel cantilever based fiber optic acoustic sensor fabricated by femtosecond laser micromachining, which is useful to monitor the network behavior (mimicking the sensory function of a spider) as well as to sense the acoustic signatures of the civil infrastructure. The third sensor is a ferrofluid based optical fiber magnetic field sensor with high performance. The fourth sensor is a new high-order mode fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor fabricated by femtosecond laser point-by-point irradiations, which shows great stability at 800&deg;C.</p> <p><strong>Packaging fiber optic sensors for operations in harsh environments</strong>: A hybrid extrinsic Fabry-Perot interferometer (EFPI) and intrinsic Fabry-Perot interferometer (IFPI) sensor was successfully embedded in a six-layer unidirectional laminate to study fabrication process. The results were also investigated to improve the performance of composite materials by optimizing the fabrication process. We have also studied the techniques to embed the FPI optical fiber sensors into the bulk ceramics by additive manufacturing and laser sealing. Using laser sintering, we can protect the fragile sensor from damage at high temperatures.</p> <p><strong>Sensor networking:</strong> We first work on using a femtosecond laser to fabricate fiber in-line waveplates and polarizers to integrate a large number of sensors and route the optical traffics through the network. We have also invented a new method to reconstruct the individual interferograms of cascaded FPI sensors by using microwave modulated optical signals. We then successfully demonstrated a new distributed fiber optic sensing network using microwave assisted separation and reconstruction of optical interferograms in the spectrum domain. The new concept was successfully validated using three cascaded FPI sensors.</p> <p><strong>Network demonstration:</strong> Two types of fiber sensor networks were investigated in this project including the microwave-photonics sensing network and the Brillouin sensing network with self-healing nodes. The microwave-photonics sensing network is a new distributed fiber optic sensing technology that can be implemented in different types of optical fibers and sensors. Spatially continuous, fully distributed temperature and strain measurements were used as examples to demonstrate the capability of the proposed concept. We also demonstrated a self-healing spider-web distributed sensor network for SHM by combining Brillouin sensing and localized robust sensor nodes. A Brillouin sensing network with self-healing nodes was constructed and then validated by the strain measurements of a three-point bend beam. The results show that the stress state of the RC beam can be successively detected, even when some sensors failed or when the sensing line was broken. The proposed self-healing network markedly improved the continuity of strain and/or temperature measurements and the robustness of the sensing network.</p> <p><strong>Broader Impact</strong></p> <p>The theoretical and experimental studies in this project provides broad impact on societal safety and human welfare as it represents an advance in SHM technology to ensure the safe operation of the deteriorating civil infrastructures around the world. The developed new robust fiber optic sensors, devices, packaging methods, signal processing techniques, instrumentation, and sensor networking methods greatly advanced the research, technology and infrastructure to deal with structural health monitoring. In addition, the developed technologies, with their breadth and depth, will have very deep impacts in many other fields such as industrial process control, health care, defense and advanced manufacturing.</p> <p>This project resulted in 10 journal papers, 7 conference papers, 5 invited/keynote presentations at international conferences, two Ph.D. dissertations (Amandeep Kaur, Jie Liu) completed.

The networked/distributed sensor system were tested under controlled inputs and the data were recorded in correlation with the inputs.
