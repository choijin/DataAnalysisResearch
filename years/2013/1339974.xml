<AbstractNarration>This project will measure, map and analyze economic forms of production, consumption, exchange, finance, and governing of common resources that pursue social and environmental sustainability associated with the broad range of activities known as "the solidarity economy."  Organizations participating in the solidarity economy are considered to be those that prioritize ethical commitment to cooperation, democratic participation, ecological resilience and social inclusion.  Examples of organizations in this group include worker cooperatives, such as Cooperative Home Care Associates in the Bronx and Isthmus Engineering and Manufacturing in Wisconsin; consumer cooperatives, such as REI and Lancaster Farm Fresh; community land trusts, such as the Champlain Housing Trust in Vermont; credit unions; food cooperatives; and other enterprises, such as Wikipedia and local bike-sharing programs.  This interdisciplinary research project will gather information about the solidarity economy in the United States, with its core hypothesis being that the U.S. solidarity economy has substantial and often unrecognized impacts on local communities in terms of increasing economic activity, employment, well-being, and overall socio-environmental sustainability.  The investigators will use mixed methods from geography, economics, and other social sciences, including geographic information system-based analyses, surveys, in-depth interviews, and economic impact modeling.  They expect to produce the first estimate of the spatial distribution, economic output, and locally significant influences associated with the solidarity economy in the U.S., both nationally and at local levels in Philadelphia, New York City, and Massachusetts. The project will make available a website for research, education, and participatory mapping of the solidarity economy, and it will generate a guide to enable replication of the analysis across the country by researchers, community groups, and policymakers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will establish the groundwork for the solidarity economy as a new object of geographic, economic, and social research in the U.S., and it will develop methods for analysis of its nature and influence.  The mapping and measurement of the role of the solidarity economy will help identify place-based strategies for local economic development.  Project findings will contribute to efforts to create more socially and environmentally sustainable economic institutions that produce equity alongside jobs, goods, and services. With local community members participating in the project as researchers along with senior researchers and both graduate and undergraduate students, the project is expected to yield new insights regarding the efficacy with which solidarity economy organizations generate solutions to the pressing social problems of inequality, unemployment, and ecological unsustainability.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>"Collaborative Research: Mapping the US Solidarity Economy" was an interdisciplinary collaboration across three sites&mdash;Worcester Massachusetts (and surrounding region), Philadelphia Pennsylvania, and New York City. In each location we gathered quantitative, spatial, and qualitative data about a range of economic organizations and practices (what we refer to as solidarity economy entities) that foreground cooperation, democratic deliberation, sustainability and democratic social inclusion. Such organizations include, but are not limited to community supported agriculture (CSA), worker cooperatives, housing cooperatives, credit unions, time banks and freecycle networks, community land trusts, and community gardens. Many of the elements of SE exist throughout the United States but they are not linked together and when they receive attention from academics and policy planners they are usually studied individually. The overarching goal of this project is to discover, map, and analyze the US solidarity economy and measure its impact on regional economies and communities. Our central hypothesis is that the solidarity economy has a substantial and often unrecognized significance and positive impact on the cities and regions in which it is located, in terms of increasing economic activity, employment, well-being, and overall socio-environmental sustainability.

Co-PIs in Worcester focused on qualitative interviews in that city whereas co-PIs in New York focused their research on gathering spatial and economic data on a narrower set of solidarity economy entities, including especially credit unions and worker, food, and housing cooperatives. In Philadelphia and surrounding PA counties, we (1) conducted an inventory of solidarity economy entities; (2) gathered data on the economic performance of many of these organizations; (3) mapped their locations against census data on race and income; (4) conducted over a dozen qualitative interviews with practitioners; and (5) conducted focus groups with community leaders in low-income communities to assess more informal solidarity economy practices. Overall, we identified approximately 800 organizations in the Philadelphia region, including over 465 community gardens, over 82 credit unions with 195 offices, 17 community supported agriculture organizations (CSAs) with 149 pick-up locations, and over 75 cooperatives and collectives, among other entities. When we mapped their locations against demographic data we found distinct clusters of solidarity economy organizations (and especially cooperatives) in &ldquo;border zones&rdquo; separating racially segregated neighborhoods. These areas tend to have a greater mix of races and classes than the adjacent neighborhoods of the city. We have also found that, unlike many of the other organization types, community gardens stand out for their significant presence in some of the poorest Black and Latino regions of the city. This spatial analysis was complemented by qualitative interviews that sought to understand the organizational histories and missions, governance structures, and community relations. We also teamed up with community researchers to run two focus groups with residents in low-income Latino communities, where we inquired both about their experiences with more informal forms of economic solidarity in their community and about their thoughts on the geography of more formal entities. Where feasible, the interviews and focus groups were recorded, transcribed, and archived. This qualitative research provides evidence of solidarity economy organizations very actively taking measures to grapple with racial and economic division in their communities. They also reveal the importance of social trust and the difficulties of finance. Our economic impact study was primarily focused on cooperatives and credit unions. We found that Philadelphia-area coops and credit unions employ over 2,300 full-time and 600 part-time employees, pay over $161.5 million in employee compensation, and generate over $418 million in revenue.
