<AbstractNarration>The 2013 Richard Tapia Celebration of Diversity in Computing Conference is the seventh in a series of conferences devoted to engaging a diverse community of researchers, educators, scholars, and students in discussions about opportunities and challenges in disciplines involving computer science.  The conference, held in Washington, DC, Feb 7-10, 2013, has keynote speeches from leaders in computer science from across academia, government and industry, including ACM President and Google Vice President, Vint Cerf.  This year the conference features a Cyber Security Education Track to raise awareness cyber security and increase participation in the development of the cyber workforce.  This award supports eight (8) student scholarships, providing opportunities to these students, who might not otherwise be able to attend and participate in the conference.</AbstractNarration>
