<AbstractNarration>Analysts in all areas of human knowledge, from science and engineering&lt;br/&gt;to economics, social science and journalism are drowning in data. The&lt;br/&gt;proliferation of digital information requires tools and techniques for&lt;br/&gt;exploring, analyzing and communicating data in a manner that scales as&lt;br/&gt;both the data and the organizations analyzing it grow in&lt;br/&gt;size. Throughout the data life-cycle, sensemaking is often a&lt;br/&gt;collaborative process. As different analysts each contribute to data&lt;br/&gt;acquisition, cleaning, analysis, and interpretation they contribute&lt;br/&gt;contextual knowledge that deepens understanding. Analysts may disagree&lt;br/&gt;on how to interpret data, but then work together to reach&lt;br/&gt;consensus. Many data sets are so large that thorough exploration by a&lt;br/&gt;single person is unlikely. In short, social cognition plays a critical&lt;br/&gt;role in the process of scalable data analysis. New analysis tools that&lt;br/&gt;address human cognitive characteristics, social interaction and data&lt;br/&gt;analytics in an integrated fashion can improve our ability to turn&lt;br/&gt;data into knowledge.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Scalable data analysis requires social interaction and therefore&lt;br/&gt;social context must be embedded in data analysis tools. The goals of&lt;br/&gt;this project are (1) to understand how social interaction and social&lt;br/&gt;context can facilitate successful data analysis, (2) to develop models&lt;br/&gt;and tools for representing and annotating data transformations,&lt;br/&gt;visualizations, and social activity (e.g., textual and graphical&lt;br/&gt;annotations, discussions, links, tags), and (3) to design and test&lt;br/&gt;visual interfaces that leverage our tools to support collaborative&lt;br/&gt;analysis practices, including data entry, transformation,&lt;br/&gt;visualization, and interpretation. Central concerns include (a) a&lt;br/&gt;focus on enabling social interaction throughout the data life-cycle&lt;br/&gt;and (b) the use of scalable data transformation routines that can&lt;br/&gt;return results in a time frame concordant with interactive,&lt;br/&gt;exploratory data transformation and analysis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Further information on this project can be found at: &lt;br/&gt;http://vis.berkeley.edu/projects/scalable_social_data_analysis/</AbstractNarration>
