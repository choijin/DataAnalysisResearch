<AbstractNarration>This project is about understanding the interactions between land-use policies, agricultural rural development and land use change in tropical landscapes, and how these changes affect the resilience of and relationships between human populations and the natural ecosystems present in these landscapes. Millions of hectares of tropical forests have been converted to agriculture leaving behind patches of remnant natural forest embedded in an agricultural matrix. Historically, this agricultural matrix was dominated by subsistence crops and pasture, but in some areas this land is rapidly being replaced with intensive plantation agriculture for soybean, banana, and pineapple production. In contrast with more traditional land uses, these crops require higher inputs of labor, money, agrochemicals, and infrastructure. The impacts of this new land conversion trend are not well understood, but preliminary studies suggest that intensive plantation agriculture may drive dramatic demographic and economic changes in local communities and have profound effects on ecological systems. Ultimately, these impacts will change the ability of these human and ecological communities to maintain resilience to future change. Thus, a better understanding is needed of the relationships among land-use policies, ecosystem structure and function, and the decisions and actions of local communities and land managers that ultimately determine where and how fast intensive plantation agriculture will spread. This project will evaluate these relationships in the model system of the San Juan-La Selva Biological Corridor in Costa Rica. Specifically, this research will address a variety of research questions, such as: What national policies led to the establishment and spread of intensive non-traditional plantation crops? For three focal regions, what is the status of the social and ecological indicators of resilience? How will current and alternative policy scenarios affect future land use patterns, and how will these affect ecological resilience? How does future scenario modeling of projected land use changes influence the perceptions of community members and land managers about their future social and ecological resilience? This effort incorporates stakeholder input at every step of the research; implements two new ecological approaches, functional traits analysis and landscape genetics; and explicitly measures both social and ecological resilience in the same system and at multiple spatial and temporal scales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Findings from this research will advance understanding of how human communities and ecosystems respond to agricultural intensification, and will therefore help scientists and managers better understand how to manage for resilience in the face of global change. At the local scale, findings will be shared through stakeholder workshops with community leaders and regional land managers; these workshops will provide participants with information to make informed land use decisions, and develop community capacity to adapt to change. At the global scale, findings from this research will be disseminated through presentations at the participating universities, at professional conferences, and through publication of peer-reviewed papers in scientific journals.  In addition, this project will contribute to the interdisciplinary research training of multiple undergraduates and five Ph.D. students, all from under-represented groups. This project is supported by the NSF Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems (CNH) Program.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Over the past century, millions of acres of tropical forests have been converted to agriculture to meet the needs of growing human populations. This has created complex landscapes that resemble a quilt, with patches of natural forest embedded in an agricultural matrix. In recent years, a new pattern has emerged in these landscapes: intensive, monoculture plantations of export crops like soybean, pineapple, and oil palm are rapidly replacing less intensive, more heterogeneous agriculture types like pasture with trees. The impacts of this new pattern of agricultural intensification are not well understood, but preliminary studies suggest that the arrival and spread of intensive plantation agriculture may drive dramatic demographic and economic change in local communities, have profound effects on the structure and function of natural forest fragments, and lead to a disconnect between social and ecological systems.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our project aimed to find ways to mitigate these impacts by understanding the linkages among land-use policies, ecosystem structure and function, and the decision-making processes of local communities and land managers. This project was a joint effort between the University of Idaho in Moscow, Idaho and the Tropical Agricultural Research and Higher Education Center in Costa Rica. For our study area, we chose the San Juan-La Selva Biological Corridor (SJLS) in Costa Rica, which is part of the larger Mesoamerican Biological Corridor. The history of land use in the SJLS region reflects a recent pattern in the tropics, where initial deforestation to establish cattle ranching and subsistence crops created a heterogeneous agricultural landscape, which is now being replaced by intensive, monoculture pineapple plantations. Understanding the links between social and ecological systems in the SJLS is a complex problem that called for an interdisciplinary approach, and one of the first successes of our project was building an integrated, interdisciplinary team of students and faculty from the two partner institutions, with expertise in tropical forest ecology, conservation genetics, rural sociology, political ecology, and remote sensing.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Our primary research goals were to: 1) describe the social and economic implications of pineapple expansion, (2) quantify pineapple cultivation&rsquo;s spatial characteristics, and (3) assess the effects of pineapple expansion on surrounding forest ecosystems, on the agricultural matrix and on biodiversity conservation. To achieve these goals, we conducted extensive field work in the study area, including 35 interviews with landowners and community leaders, field surveys to measure properties of secondary forest patches, functional traits of mature forest patches, and to collect genetic data on bats and two understory plant species which rely on bats for pollination and seed dispersal. Using remotely sensed imagery, we produced the highest-resolution land cover map of Sarapiqui, Costa Rica, to date, and disseminated the map to local decision-makers who can use it in future land use planning and research for the region. This included the municipal government planning office, the Costa Rican National Park Service, the Costa Rican Ministry of Agriculture, five local ecolodges, and two research institutions including La Selva Biological Station. Analyses of the field and remotely sensed data revealed the specific impacts of pineapple expansion on important measures of social and ecological resilience, including household-level economic resilience, bat community composition, abundance, and diversity, and genetic connectivity for bats and bat-dispersed plants, and metrics of forest regeneration such as above ground biomass. Our combined analyses</p> <p>ultimately provided empirical evidence that agricultural intensification is simplifying and homogenizing both ecological and economic systems in the SJLS region. Our findings advance understanding of the role of functional characteristics and functional connectivity in conservation, and we hope will help scientists and managers in similar landscapes worldwide better understand how to manage complex landscapes in the face of global change to achieve positive outcomes for humans and the environment.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Throughout the course of the project, we consistently communicated our findings to local stakeholders. We did this through presentations at three initial community-based workshops, by distributing environmental education materials to local ecotourism agencies and non-profits, by presenting at the SJLS committee management meetings, and by developing bat species inventory reports for landowners. In 2015, we organized final participatory stakeholder workshops where results were shared with 30 participants representing local land management agencies, ecotourism companies, community organizations, conservation organizations, and the agricultural sector. We also disseminated our findings to the scientific community through the publication of eight peer-reviewed scientific papers, five PhD dissertations, one book chapter, invited talks at multiple universities and community centers, and more than 20 presentations at professional meetings. Finally, our project provided training and professional development opportunities for five undergraduate students and five doctoral students from underrepresented groups. All of the doctoral students successfully wrote and defended their dissertations during the project and are now employed in diverse sectors, including academia, government, and non-profit work.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/17/2018<br>      Modified by: Lisette&nbsp;P&nbsp;Waits</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1313824/1313824_10266454_1518812591865_1-2015-05-2210.58.19--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1313824/1313824_10266454_1518812591865_1-2015-05-2210.58.19--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Research team"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1313824/1313824_10266454_1518812591865_1-2015-05-2210.58.19--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Research team"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">picture of our interdisciplinary and diverse research team</div> <div class="imageCredit">UI faculty</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Lisette&nbsp;P&nbsp;Waits</div> <div class="imageTitle">Research team</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1313824/1313824_10266454_1518897151617_1-2015-06-1912.23.24--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1313824/1313824_10266454_1518897151617_1-2015-06-1912.23.24--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Workshop"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1313824/1313824_10266454_1518897151617_1-2015-06-1912.23.24--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Workshop"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Landuse change workshop with local stakeholders in the San Juan La Selva Biological Corridor of Costa Rica</div> <div class="imageCredit">Leotina Hormel</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Lisette&nbsp;P&nbsp;Waits</div> <div class="imageTitle">Workshop</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1313824/1313824_10266454_1518897272965_CollectingdatawithmyUIadvisorDr.LisetteWaitsandUIundergradRhiannaHohbein--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1313824/1313824_10266454_1518897272965_CollectingdatawithmyUIadvisorDr.LisetteWaitsandUIundergradRhiannaHohbein--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Bat field work"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1313824/1313824_10266454_1518897272965_CollectingdatawithmyUIadvisorDr.LisetteWaitsandUIundergradRhiannaHohbein--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Bat field work"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Field work mist netting bats in the San Juan La Selva Biological corridor</div> <div class="imageCredit">Bence Mate</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Lisette&nbsp;P&nbsp;Waits</div> <div class="imageTitle">Bat field work</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1313824/1313824_10266454_1518897381319_El-Cairo-Pineapple-fields-1000x666--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1313824/1313824_10266454_1518897381319_El-Cairo-Pineapple-fields-1000x666--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Pineapple field"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1313824/1313824_10266454_1518897381319_El-Cairo-Pineapple-fields-1000x666--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Pineapple field"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Pineapple field San Juan La Selva Biological corridor</div> <div class="imageCredit">Katherine Cleary</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Lisette&nbsp;P&nbsp;Waits</div> <div class="imageTitle">Pineapple field</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1313824/1313824_10266454_1518897487808_VSPEC_lowRES2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1313824/1313824_10266454_1518897487808_VSPEC_lowRES2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Vampirum spectrum bat"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1313824/1313824_10266454_1518897487808_VSPEC_lowRES2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Vampirum spectrum bat"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Vampirum spectrum bat held by PhD student Katherine Cleary</div> <div class="imageCredit">Henry Lara Perez</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Lisette&nbsp;P&nbsp;Waits</div> <div class="imageTitle">Vampirum spectrum bat</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
