<AbstractNarration>The I/UCRC for Dielectrics and Piezoelectrics will engage in the continuous exploration for new functional dielectric and piezoelectric materials and new strategies for integration that expand fundamental understanding, that drive the evolution of existing technologies, and that provide the pathways for disruptive innovation. The CDP?s collective expertise merges conventional dielectrics, organic composites, electrochemistry, thin-film science, and microelectronic&lt;br/&gt;materials and methods. The center?s faculty members offer fundamental&lt;br/&gt;academic insight and experimental flexibility to generate the science push towards next-generation materials, while industry partners from across the supply chain bring unique insight regarding new product concepts and consumer needs to establish a technology pull for next generation devices.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The I/UCRC for Dielectrics and Piezoelectrics aims to develop a diverse human capital and enhance scientific research, infrastructure, and societal impact through engagement with industry.  Through targeted recruiting efforts, the CDP plans to integrate a diverse group of faculty and students in the Center, particularly participants from underrepresented groups (females and minorities) and veterans.  In addition, the center intends to develop relationships with strategic international institutions to enhance the research capabilities of the CDP and to provide international research opportunities for graduate students. Center research and human capital development targets impact of our nation?s energy, transportation, security and medical infrastructure by advancing materials that underpin critical technologies for these sectors.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The Center for Dielectrics and Piezoelectrics (CDP) was established in 2014 as a National Science Foundation Industry/University Collaborative Research Center (I/UCRC), with North Carolina State University and the Pennsylvania State University as partner academic institutions. The CDP is now an internationally recognized research center dedicated to improving the science and technology of dielectric and piezoelectric materials and their integration into components and devices. This class of materials underpins the functionality of a broad array of enabling electronic and electromechanical systems for the transportation, energy, aerospace &amp; defense, communications, and medical sectors of the economy. The CDP research portfolio is defined across five technical thrust areas, wherein academic researchers generate the science-push towards next-generation materials and devices, while industry partners from across the supply chain bring unique insight regarding new product concepts and technology pulls. Over the first five years of operation, the CDP added the University of Sheffield as an affiliated international site and attracted 28 global industry members to its industrial advisory board. The IAB now supports approximately 14 research projects and 14 graduate students annually across the three institutions. Major technical outcomes include the discovery of new low-temperature materials-processing techniques that significantly reduce energy requirements in ceramic processing, while enabling the production of new types of composite materials. The center also developed fundamental knowledge related to the mechanisms by which dielectric materials degrade and fail in service, which informs strategies for improving the reliability and lifetime of devices. The CDP provides undergraduate and graduate students with unique opportunities to engage directly with industry and national laboratory leaders. This partnership provides students with a high-level of industry-relevant technical knowledge and enhanced project management and communications skills, which enriches their education and professional development. In addition, as part of the center's broader impact, the CDP enhances the nation's scientific and manufacturing research infrastructure through its shared characterization facilities and via technology transfer to industry.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 06/04/2019<br>      Modified by: Elizabeth&nbsp;C&nbsp;Dickey</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Image         </div> <div class="galControls onePhoto" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation onePhoto" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1361503/1361503_10291586_1559652743655_cdp-logo-final-highres_inside-box--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1361503/1361503_10291586_1559652743655_cdp-logo-final-highres_inside-box--rgov-800width.jpg" title="CDP Logo"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1361503/1361503_10291586_1559652743655_cdp-logo-final-highres_inside-box--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="CDP Logo"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The Center for Dielectrics and Piezoelectrics is an internationally recognized center of excellence in the science, technology, and integration of capacitive and piezoelectric materials.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Jason Maners</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Elizabeth&nbsp;C&nbsp;Dickey</div> <div class="imageTitle">CDP Logo</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
