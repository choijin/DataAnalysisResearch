<AbstractNarration>This study continues a transformation in molecular ecology: the ability to find and study genetic variation affecting phenotypes that are the basis for fitness differences in ecological model systems. Results from this study will connect mechanistically genetic variation encoding a metabolic enzyme to a signaling pathway, development, morphology, physiology and performance in nature, at the level of individuals, populations and (via the research in other labs) a metapopulation. The results are informative for this ecological model system and for a broader understanding of fitness tradeoffs, maintenance of genetic variation in populations by balancing selection, and aging. An insect model system will be used to examine how genetic variation and physiological traits interact with landscape features and population dynamics.  New physiological insight will also be obtained via determination of how the hypoxia inducible factor signaling pathway controls both the development of the oxygen delivery network (tracheae) and mitochondrial aging. This research will examine experimentally how genetic variation in a gene encoding a central metabolic enzyme (succinate dehydrogenase; Sdh) affects life history, differences in tracheal network development and mitochondrial aging in an ecological context.  Complementary experiments employing available Sdh mutants in the model system Drosophila will be used to test mechanistic relationships. The central thesis is that differences in tracheal development affect fitness tradeoffs via effects on flight metabolism, respiratory water loss, survival of summer drying of the habitat, and the rate of aging of flight muscle mitochondria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PI and his students have helped labs in the U.S., Europe and Australia perform their first transcriptome studies. The PI and his team are now scaling up this effort by working with a consortium of more than 100 undergraduate institutions to help them enhance undergraduate teaching and faculty training in functional genomics. The personnel of this project will work with the Genome Consortium for Active Teaching NextGen Sequencing Group (GCAT-SEEK), headed by nearby Juniata College, to instruct undergraduates directly and, via workshops, train interested faculty across the entire array of member institutions. These workshops are tailored for undergraduate educators and students who are novices with respect to NextGen technology and bioinformatics. The workshop training will assist in all stages of experimental design through assessment, and provide participants with active learning modules that are easy to integrate into classes. The PI is also involved heavily in student training (including a number of students who are under-represented minorities and women), and communicating science with the general public.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This research used an insect, the Glanville fritillary butterfly, that is a model system for population dynamics and convservation biology of species living in patchy environments.  Our aim was  to examine how the perception and physiolgoical response to tissue-level oxygen availability is affected by genetic polymorphisms in a Krebs cycle enzyme (SDH) and a protein that plays a central role in oxygen sensing and response (Hif-1a).   Most animal traits, such as human height, are affected by dozens to hundreds of genes, each having a small effect on the trait.  In this case we have discovered that SDH and Hif-1a polymorphisms have unusually large effects on traits such as metabolism, growth, development of the oxygen delivery network, flight ability, and the way flight activity affects the health of muscle tissue.  Polymorphsims in SDH and Hif pathway genes are known in humans, primarily as evolutionary adaptations to high altitude and as familial mutations that cause vascularized tumors (a rare form of cancer).  Our work shows how these genes and physiological processes can also play important roles in the diversity of individuals within a species living at sea level.  Our prior work found that butterflies with certain of these genotypes are better at flying and dispersing to colonize new habitat patches. In the present work, we discovered that gene variants beneficial for flight ability in adults are detrimental for growth rates in larvae.  Such tradeoffs in function at different life stages are the basis for theories about the evolution for aging, but examples of such genes are virtually unkonwn in wild species.  Ultimately, our work on this project may stimulate further reseach examining sea-level variation in oxygen sensing and how genetic variation in these pathways affect performance and aging.  More broadly, our work on this project informs the emerging field of eco-evolutionary dynamics, that is, how changes in gene frequencies and traits affect ecological change, and how ecological change affects gene frequences and traits.  This tight coupling of genetics, physiology, ecology and evolution unites different sub-disciplines of biology and shows very clearly that evolution is not simply a historical thing but rather is a living, breathing part of the way organisms interact with their environment on a daily basis.  Through our outreach with the GCAT-SEEK network, we trained &gt;100 faculty, including many from minority serving institutions, how to perform and teach modern functional genomics.  We estimate that training of nearly 5,000 undergraduate students has been enriched by these activities.  This project involved two post-docs, one graduate student, three undergraduates and two technicians, all of who experienced significant intellectual and scientific growth from their interaction with this project.  In 2015, the PI co-founded a biotech startup company that in 2017 attracted $10M in venture capital funding and presently employs 17 Ph.D. scientists.  The underlying technology is not directly related to this project but rather came about because NSF funding on diverse projects has enabled the PI to conceptualize new scientific possibilities, communicate and collaborate productively with other scientists, and put ideas into action.
