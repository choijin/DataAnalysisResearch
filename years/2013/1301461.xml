<AbstractNarration>With this Grant Opportunities for Academic Liasons with Industry (GOALI) Award co-funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Division of Chemistry and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, Professor Shannon Boettcher from the University of Oregon will (1) study the mechanisms by which three-dimensional (3D) structure and local composition control the oxygen-evolution reaction (OER) activity in Ni hydroxide-based electrocatalysts and (2) identify the key factors affecting performance and durability of optimized Ni hydroxide OER catalysts in prototype alkaline-membrane electrolysis systems operating at practical current densities. The work will be carried out in collaboration with Dr. Kathy Ayers at Proton OnSite (Wallingford, CT). The focus on Ni-based OER catalysts is motivated by recent work in the Boettcher laboratory demonstrating that thin films of Ni-Fe hydroxides with 3D layered structures have higher per-atom activities than other known alkaline OER catalysts including IrO2. The team will also conduct outreach activities with local middle school students during furlough days. The middle school students will engage in hands-on energy storage and sustainability design-challenge activities on the University of Oregon campus.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The development of clean and sustainable energy sources is critical for both the economic and environmental vitality of human civilization. Renewable energy sources such as the sun and wind are intermittent and thus currently difficult and expensive to integrate with traditional energy sources in large amounts. One promising method to store intermittent renewable energy is by splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen gas. The hydrogen gas can be used as a sustainable carbon-free renewable fuel to replace fossil fuels. This research addresses an important challenge in designing water-splitting systems - the inefficiency of the oxygen production part of the reaction.</AbstractNarration>
