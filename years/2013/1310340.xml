<AbstractNarration>The main goal of this research is to address several main challenges in the realization of practical phononic crystal (PnC)-based devices for wireless signal processing at RF frequencies by 1) relaxing the extreme geometry and fabrication constrains, 2) developing practical PnC devices based on surface acoustic-waves that eliminate the need for thin film and undercutting, and with the broad impact of 3) developing efficient low-impedance electro-statically tunable PnC crystals devices that can potentially eliminate the need for piezoelectric materials. To achieve these goals we will develop a new PnC material platform based on an array of pillar structure on a thin slab material or on an infinite substrate (for surface waves) that also constitute the intellectual merits of this effort. The proposed material platform will be used to demonstrate chip-scale spectral analysis at the L band (i.e., 1 -2 GHz) frequencies.</AbstractNarration>

In addition, we demonstrated fundamental devices (especially phononic crystal waveguides and resonators) in these phononic crystal structures with unique features for forming all-integrated phononic crystal systems. Some of the major achievements that provides new research and development directions are as follows;  1) Demonstration of various phononic crystal structures in membrane-based and surface-based architectures with full phononic bandgap  2) Providing the fundamental understanding of the properties of pillar-based phononic crystals through the interplay of Bragg-effect and local-resonance effect.  3) Design methodology for forming phononic crystal waveguides and resonators in different classes of phononic crystal structures  In addition, the use of engineered nanostructures for achieving acoustic properties that are not present in existing bulk materials allows us to expand the library of available acoustic materials by adding novel materials with unprecedented properties (e.g., phononic bandgap, superdispersion, etc.).
