<AbstractNarration>Objective: The objectives of this program are to investigate fiber lasers that support new pulse evolutions in their cavities, and to use the knowledge gained to demonstrate practical instruments with unprecedented performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: The intellectual merit is in understanding of new nonlinear waves. The field of ultrafast science has been built on lasers based on formation of solitons, pulses that balance phase shifts with anomalous group-velocity dispersion. In the last few years, pulse-shaping based on nonlinear gain and loss, in normal-dispersion media, has been introduced. This approach is transformative as it counters two decades of conventional wisdom regarding the generation of light pulses. Lasers with self-similar propagation of light pulses in their gain media exhibit new phenomena, such as the existence of local nonlinear attraction in a laser. The self-similar evolution opens new routes to lasers with very low noise and to lasers that generate pulses that contain only a few cycles of light.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts: The broader impacts are the demonstration of useful (and eventually commercial) instruments with new capabilities for energetic, ultra-short light pulses. These instruments will expand the field of ultra-fast science and will bring short-pulse capabilities to new arenas such as medical clinics. Students will gain experience ranging from theory and numerical simulations to technical aspects of fiber optics and knowledge of applications of ultra-short light pulses. The research on fiber lasers will be coupled to undergraduate and graduate laboratories. Participation in activities sponsored by 4-H will expose rural students to science and technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project Outcomes Report   ECCS-1306035     High-Performance Femtosecond Fiber Lasers Based on New Pulse Evolutions   Frank Wise  Cornell University     Intellectual Merit     Lasers that generate ultrashort light pulses (flashes of light that last less than 10-12 seconds &ndash; a millionth of a millionth of a second) have found many applications in science.  These range from experiments that allow monitoring of chemical reactions as they occur, to new techniques for microscopes that can see deeper into brain tissue, for example.  Such lasers would be very useful for application beyond scientific research, such as machining and surgery, if they could be made from optical fiber.  The challenge is generating high-power short pulses in a fiber laser; pulses tend to get distorted in the fiber.  This project investigated ways to allow high-power pulses to propagate through fiber without distortion.  Significant advances were made in understanding the fundamental limits of ultrashort light pulses, development of lasers that produce ultrashort pulses at infrared wavelengths, and determination of the fundamental limits to high-power lasers. Several lasers that offer new capabilities, or major performance increases over existing capabilities, were demonstrated in the course of this work.      Broader Impacts            Educational/Outreach Activities     In the summers of 2014, 2015, and 2016 we ran workshops for junior-high-school students as part of the "University U" program of the New York State 4-H. The students come from a range of urban and rural portions of the state. Working in groups of two or three, the students build crystal radios. This activity teaches the students some of the basics of electromagnetism and electrical circuits. The students also look at a modern integrated circuit under a microscope for comparison. Graduate students who help run the workshop tell the groups about their background and how they got interested in science.           Development of Human Resources     This award provided partial funding support for two female students who completed their PhD degrees and went to postdoctoral positions in another university and in a national lab, respectively. It also provided partial support for a male PhD student who joined Wells Fargo Bank as a quantitative analyst.           Technology Transfer     We worked to transfer laser technology based on our prior NSF-funded work to a company, and a commercial product was introduced in 2015.
