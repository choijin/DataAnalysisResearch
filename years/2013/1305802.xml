<AbstractNarration>The term tipping point has been used to describe elements of the Earth system that might, in the face of changing climate, behave non-linearly, irreversibly, or both. This study will address the likelihood of various physical components of the Earth system to undergo major and rapid changes (i.e., abrupt climate change) and, as time allows, examine some of the most important potential associated impacts and risks. This study will explore how to monitor climate change for warnings of abrupt changes and emerging impacts and examine gaps in our current scientific understanding and monitoring capabilities.</AbstractNarration>

A 2002 National Research Council (NRC) report entitled "Abrupt Climate Change: Inevitable Surprises" examined the state of the science of abrupt climate change.
