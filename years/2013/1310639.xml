<AbstractNarration>This IBM-UCLA-LLNL collaborative research aims to develop a fundamental understanding of the kinetics of nucleation, growth, and stability of electrodeposited zinc (Zn) thin films for applications in batteries.  Rechargeable batteries, starting with lead-acid batteries, have been integral part of our society. With the surge in consumer electronics along with the recent demand for clean, sustainable energy, recyclable and rechargeable batteries have received renewed attention. Among the several possible candidate systems, zinc-alkaline and zinc-air batteries are attractive owing to their stability, safety, and cost.  However, a major challenge impeding the realization of Zn-based rechargeable battery technology is the formation of high-aspect-ratio Zn dendrites and porous thin films, which reduce performance and operation life time. Progress in this area requires a basic understanding of the factors affecting the morphological evolution during electrodeposition at multiple length scales. This research addresses this issue via electrodeposition of zinc in situ in a transmission electron microscope and in situ in an optical microscope using Hele-Shaw cell geometries, which allow imaging of the interfacial structure during charge and discharge cycles. The acquisition of data as a function of solution chemistry and electrodepostion parameters enables the development of mechanistic insights into factors influencing the formation of smooth Zn thin films, an essential criterion for the realization of rechargeable batteries.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In addition to advancing knowledge important for the development of Zn-based rechargeable batteries, contributions to the society include training of future scientists and engineers with broader awareness of national laboratory and industrial research activities. This collaborative research provides to the postdoctoral scholars and students at UCLA opportunities for interactions with eminent scientists from industry (IBM) and national laboratory (LLNL), hands-on training on some of the most sophisticated state-of-the-art characterization tools, and exposure to industry's perspective on energy-related research.</AbstractNarration>
