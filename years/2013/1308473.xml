<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to provide a comprehensive analysis of interaction of strong ultrashort laser pulses with nanoscale solids, such as dialectic and metal nanofilms. The approach of this research is based on coherent description of electron dynamics within duration of ultrashort (less than 10 fs) laser pulse. Such electron dynamics will be described by systems of nonlinear differential equations, which will be solved numerically. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will provide comprehensive theoretical description of ultrashort laser pulse with nanoscale solids and will determine what kind of optical and transport properties of dielectric and metal nanofilm can be controlled by ultrafast optical pulse and within what extent, how the dynamics of dielectric and metal can be probed by the optical pulse, and under what condition the dielectric or metal show reversible behavior. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;The proposed research will address both fundamental (understanding the interaction of ultrashort laser pulses with solids) and applied (optical control of electric properties of nanoscale devices with high petahertz frequency, which can be used in nanoscale devices) problems. The broad nature of proposed research activity will encourage graduate students to explore different fields of physics, both fundamental and applied. Introductory and illustrative lecture series on modern nanoscale physics will be given to middle and high school students within the Atlanta, GA area. The PIs will develop undergraduate course on optics and transport of nanoscale systems. The PIs will also organize the Science Olympiad team and Math Club team at two Georgia schools.</AbstractNarration>
