<AbstractNarration>THE OBJECTIVE of this research is to explore new avenues for nanoscale photonics and to improve fundamental understanding of physical (including quantum) operational principles of novel class of ultracompact photonic components. THE APPROACH is to develop theory, to numerically model and simulate functional properties of the proposed components and to investigate their potential capabilities. &lt;br/&gt;           INTELLECTUAL MERITS. The proposal implements an exotic property, backwardness, of electromagnetic waves in negative-index metamaterials, unique features of coherent nonlinear-optical coupling of ordinary and backward waves, counterintuitive effects of quantum interference and methods of quantum engineering. It presents unparallel, nonlinear-optical approach to compensating strong losses inherent to plasmonic metamaterials and to control light energy distribution and conversion across metafilms. Recent advances in design of bulk multilayered nanostructured metamaterials make such opportunities crucially important for creation of unique devices. &lt;br/&gt;           BROADER IMPACTS. This research contributes to synergetic interdisciplinary approach to nanotechnology-based, high priority, revolutionary breakthroughs in optical processing technologies. It will also greatly benefit educational efforts for introducing nano and device technologies to undergraduate students. The effort provides excellent opportunities for enhancing the curriculum of related courses in physics and chemistry and for addressing photonics and nanoengineering as the interdisciplinary science and technology areas. Special focus will be placed on incorporating students into a comprehensive computer-enhanced research program in the exciting field of modern electrical engineering and on disseminating its results to society. Interdisciplinary seminar series will be developed for undergraduate students to foster their motivation in learning and to broader their vision of contemporary science and technology.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Light is a set of electromagnetic waves &ndash; oscillations of electric and magnetic fields at very high frequencies. For example, green light corresponds to about six hundred trillions oscillations per second. Electric and magnetic field instances propagate in space with the velocity referred to as phase velocity. Phase velocity in materials is smaller than in a vacuum by n times. The value n is referred to as a refractive index of a material. Magnitude of n depends on composition of a particular medium. In all naturally occurring materials, energy flux of light and its phase velocity are co-directed and n is a positive number greater than one. Advances in nanotechnology have made possible the creation of optical materials (man-made metamaterials) with the properties never found before in nature. This breakthrough has led to a chain of further revolutionary breakthroughs in optics and, consequently, in its numerous applications of crucial importance. One of such breakthrough is the possibility to produce backward light waves, the extraordinary electromagnetic waves with contra-directed energy flux and phase velocity. Many of such man-made materials (metamaterials), which enable the creation of backward-wave light, can be characterized by the negative refractive index.

Because of higher frequency, light can carry many orders of magnitude more information compared to radio waves thus enabling breakthroughs in a multitude of technologies, including a latest great progress in information technologies.   Nonlinear optics with backward light waves opens new horizons in the photonics. The major goal of the given project was to advance understanding and conceptual description of the extraordinary nonlinear optical processes enabled by the backward electromagnetic waves and to explore the related concepts of novel photonic devices with unparalleled operational properties. The project was a looking forward research based on interdisciplinary theoretical studies and extensive numerical modelling and simulations of the underpinning processes and related devices. Uncommon, counter-intuitive nonlinear-optical processes were predicted and their properties investigated. A novel broad class of metamaterials that could meet the requirements for realization of such processes was proposed. Concepts of the all-optically controlled frequency-shifting reflectivity, of related microscopic metamirrors, metaamplifiers, cavity-free frequency-tunable optical oscillators and remotely actuated and interrogated photonic sensors were proposed. Results of the research were reported in numerous topical international conferences and seminars in different institutions, domestic and oversea, discussed with students and published in topical journals. Major achievements on the project were also summarized in the invited chapter in the book written by the international experts and prefaced by one of the founders in the field. T...]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
