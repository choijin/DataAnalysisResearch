<AbstractNarration>This EAGER proposal is a partnership among the Joan Ganz Cooney Center, an independent R&amp;D organization associated with the Sesame Workshop, E-Line media, a publisher of game-based learning products, and the Center for Games and Impact at Arizona State University.  The goal of the project is to inform the development of an impact-based research methodology (IBR) to enable a more direct and overt connections between academic research on games and the development of educational products and services that are sustainable and scalable.  Through consultation with other researchers and developers, the team is conducting series case studies to identify promising practices from three communities: 1) the tech-enabled services sector, particularly the idea of lean start up, 2) the social impact sector; and 3) the learning sciences and educational research sector.</AbstractNarration>
