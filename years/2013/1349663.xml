<AbstractNarration>1349663 &lt;br/&gt;Atsumi, Shota&lt;br/&gt;    &lt;br/&gt;Biosynthesis of valuable chemicals has gained increased attention because of energy, environmental, and economic concerns. Global energy and environmental problems have stimulated increased efforts towards reducing CO2 emissions and synthesizing biofuels and bulk chemicals from renewable resources. Direct routes for conversion of CO2 to chemicals are conceptually preferable and many methods have been reported. However, these reported methods suffer from low productivity rendering them uneconomical thus far.  The proposed research represents a novel strategy to establish and improve the production of valuable chemicals from CO2 using cyanobacteria as biocatalysts. The proposed method will aid in securing both the nation's energy independence and economic growth. With the exploding interests in renewable and sustainable chemical production, the proposed research project has many critical and transformative implications in synthetic biology and metabolic engineering. The PI will train a new breed of interdisciplinary researchers who can build bridges between basic science and engineering. The proposed research will integrate contemporary issues such as CO2 emissions, climate change, and energy production with education.   The benefits of the proposed research to society are widespread, as the resulting technologies will significantly impact the ability to resolve some of humanity's most pressing problems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;While cyanobacteria are naturally able to utilize CO2, they are not naturally able to transform CO2 into compounds such as advanced biofuels. For this reason, synthetic biology is applied to manipulate the cyanobacterial genome to allow generation of specific, valuable compounds. Cyanobacteria have already been engineered to produce a number of different compounds. However, the efficiency of biochemical production by cyanobacteria remains low. Development of a general platform is critical in order to efficiently engineer cyanobacterial species for biochemical production and to predict changes in both relevant, cellular dynamics and traits after targeted engineering. The proposed research possesses three technological impacts: (1) elucidation of tight repression mechanisms in cyanobacteria; (2) establishment of strategies to determine favorable properties for chemical production; and (3) development of whole cellular remodeling to expand the metabolism for chemical production from CO2. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the project, this CAREER award by the Biotechnology, Biochemical, and Biomass Engineering Program of the CBET Division is co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology and by the Mathematical Biology Program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>
