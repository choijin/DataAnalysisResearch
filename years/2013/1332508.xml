<AbstractNarration>Hampton University proposes to implement an HBCU-UP Targeted Infusion Project to reform three computer science gateway courses and to develop an intensive computing summer bridge program for computer science, engineering, and mathematics majors in an effort to enhance student academic performance, increase retention, and improve graduation rates, particularly for  computer science students. The PIs propose to strengthen the students' problem-solving and critical thinking skills by integrating computational thinking into lower-level courses. This strategy will be coupled with a pre-college summer program that will be designed to inculcate the prerequisite skills among prospective students for success in the gateway courses. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed project is in response to observable enrollment and course completion data, results of academic support programs, and student surveys. It will implement a cyclical model as the framework to integrate computational thinking and programming concepts in learning modules and to assess learning outcomes. Faculty also will employ and assess the impact of learning techniques that have been proven effective for STEM students and develop future concepts relevant for Hampton and other institutions seeking to address similar problems.</AbstractNarration>

Overall results of students passing CS3 for the first time taking are not significant: 60% passing in Fall 2014 compared to 58% passing in Fall 2016 (doubled enrollment). With the number of students increase in the program (as a result of the Summer Computing Pre-College, <strong>50% enrollment increase</strong> in CS3), higher number of students enrolled in and passed CS3. </li> <li><strong>Math Readiness</strong>:&nbsp; The Summer Program provided students with Math readiness for Fall semester &ndash; the curriculum in Computer Science required students to be in Pre-Calculus I in Fall semester. Therefore, students attending College Algebra (MAT 105) during summer was able to start their major curriculum as they rolled in Fall semester.&nbsp; Consequently, this increases the enrollment in our gateway courses (<strong>20% of students were able to take CS1 because they fulfilled MAT requirement during summer</strong>).&nbsp; </li> <li><strong>Career Readiness</strong>: The Summer Program hosted guest speakers from industries as well as academia. This allows students to see the impact of computer science in all fields of students and everything in their daily lives.&nbsp; Because of their attendance in the summer, the students have more opportunities to apply and acquire for summer internship positions.
