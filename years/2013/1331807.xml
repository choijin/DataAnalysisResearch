<AbstractNarration>This project develops a novel computational Green Infrastructure (GI) design framework that integrates interactive, neighborhood-scale, collaborative design by multiple stakeholders ("crowd-sourced" design) with multi-scale models of ecosystem and human impacts. The following research questions are being addressed: (1) How well does coupling of site-scale ecohydrology with catchment-scale hydraulic routing improve predictions? (2) How well can stakeholder preferences be predicted using design image feature extraction and machine learning? (3) What interactive optimization and visualization techniques lead to the most rapid and complete consensus among diverse stakeholders? (4) Do stakeholders using interactive cyberinfrastructure tools consider more options and explore more of the GI design space?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A "crowd-sourced" design framework is developed to enable stakeholders to interactively create and evaluate potential GI designs that reflect consideration of the full breadth of social, economic, and environmental criteria. The research questions are evaluated in diverse neighborhoods within three urban catchments in the Baltimore Ecosystem Study, working closely with environmental non-governmental organizations to ensure that the results will provide significant benefits to community stakeholders. The models developed in this project are the first to integrate criteria for human and ecosystem wellbeing with site- and watershed-scale hydrologic processes, a key advance for improving understanding and implementation of GI design. Map and image visualization identifies which visualization approaches best support improving stakeholder engagement for achieving consensus using interactive collaborative design. This makes technical advances in interactive optimization and model parameterization accessible to the broad range of stakeholders, from regulators and planners to contractors and homeowners.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A significant outcome of this project is creation of an online cloud-based application titled, ?Integrated DEsign and Analysis System for Green Infrastructure (IDEAS-GI)? that supports green infrastructure siting and evaluation.  IDEAS-GI tool uses Google ? satellite view, Google ? street view, empirical models, and numerical urban hydrology models to provide estimations of cost and reductions in stormwater peak flow and volume reduction, air pollutant deposition, and nitrogen loads, as well as their uncertainty bounds. The tool also allows users to select the locations of individual trees or rain gardens through a semi-realistic representation of the landscape in Google ? street view, facilitating the incorporation of participatory design.  The tool has been calibrated for two small (&lt; 1.5 km2) watersheds in the Baltimore metropolitan area and was demonstrated to stormwater practitioners and managers gathered at a workshop on April 27th 2017 at USGS water science Center in Baltimore, MD. This tool provides a framework for use in any watershed with existing hydrologic models, and is available at:  http://www.hydroshare.org/resource/75dfc27015f1467388d712b562657835  This study also applied the IDEAS-GI tool to provide a quantitative analysis of environmental and economic costs and benefits of GI using two metrics, benefit-cost ratios and nutrient removal costs.  Results indicated significant economic benefits of distributed green stormwater infrastructure, relative to larger-scale centralized treatment practices.  Results also indicated that these relative economic benefits diminish with increasing land area of the catchment.     Results from this project were presented in five presentations at three professional conferences.  Three papers for scientific journals are being prepared from this project.  This project also provided partial support for. one M.Sc. and two Ph.D. students,                Last Modified: 02/11/2019       Submitted by: Arthur R Schmidt]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
