<AbstractNarration>The five-year Targeted Partnership and Implementation project, Designing for Equity By Thinking in and about Mathematics (DEBT-M), is a community of mathematical practice devoted to closing the opportunity gap for marginalized secondary mathematics students in Pittsburgh. Core Partners in DEBT-M are the Education Development Center (EDC) as the lead, and the Pittsburgh Public Schools (PPS), the University of Pittsburgh (UPITT), and the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU). The project team is investigating how the opportunity gap can be addressed through a focused program of professional development that involves teachers, mathematicians, and mathematics educators as equal partners.  The context for this work is the mathematics program in grades 6-12 in PPS with around 4000 students in this grade band, more than one quarter of whom are struggling, underrepresented mathematics learners.  The target audience is the teachers of these students, as well as the IHE faculty in Core Partner institutions. The primary STEM field involves mathematics that surrounds high school algebra. Goals for the IHE partners include close alliances with the teachers in Pittsburgh and participation in the development and implementation of new experiences for the whole partnership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEBT-M's inaugural year is followed by two consecutive two-year cycles of immersive summer professional development with intensive school-year follow-up. During each year, four follow-up activities support teachers in shifting practice in the classroom and furthering the community of doers of mathematics: colloquia, monthly seminars, bi-weekly study groups, and visits by all partners to participating schools. Regarding thinking about mathematics and mathematics learning, the project team focuses on what mathematics is and how experiences have shaped teachers' perspectives. Teachers also focus on how mathematics education has shaped learner identities. DEBT-M provides experiences and opportunities to construct what they conjecture are critical perspectives, dispositions, and expertise that in turn enable all partners to collectively determine what aspects of practice to address and how to address them. The last week of each summer is focused exclusively on this collaborative, professional effort. Partners and participants together draw on their summer work and learning to make decisions about implementing classroom practices in courses with struggling students', decisions that are supported, studied, and analyzed throughout the school year with the study groups, seminars, equity fellows, etc. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;DEBT-M includes both an external evaluation and a design-based, internal research component. The internal research study investigates, tests, and refines a set of conjectures about how school districts can, at scale, both transform teaching to embody a rigorous disciplinary approach and significantly reduce mathematics opportunity gaps that exist for African-American and low-SES students who have been systemically marginalized over time. A mixed-methods approach is used to answer the research questions, with analyses of a variety of data, including student surveys of identity and connection to teacher; PD and classroom video; teacher habits of mind assessments; district artifacts; recordings of parent-and-child focus groups; and annual interviews with teachers and school- and district-leaders. The external evaluation is designed to assess the quality of the professional development, its impact on teachers' instructional practices, and its impact on student achievement. Teachers are recruited from the one urban school district (PPS), with a focus on high schools and their feeder middle schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Products of the DEBT-M project are expected to include new professional development materials that integrate mathematical content with explicit treatment of both the practice of mathematics and the practice of  engagement for all students with a clear focus on working with marginalized students. The project team brings together instruments that assist in the diagnosis of aspects of high school settings that impact on mathematics professional development and student learning efforts.</AbstractNarration>

Lead institutions included EDC, University of Pittsburgh&rsquo;s Center for Urban Education, Iowa State University, and Pittsburgh Public Schools. Duquesne University was the external evaluator.</p> <p>The project developed resources and models for educator learning and implementation. The resources include<em> </em>a<em> </em>modular<em> </em>360-hour professional learning curriculum for teams of teachers and administrators, a train-the-trainer curriculum, a variety of introductory programs, and an assessment designed to empower districts to develop understanding of the nature of their local racial opportunity gaps and make productive decisions about where and how to act. &nbsp;</p> <p>DEbT-M also developed or expanded 3 unique theoretical and practical models to support addressing racial opportunity gaps using the systematic approach of multi-stakeholder <em>plan-do-study-act</em> cycles. The <em>ASSA-IPS Change Agency Model</em> (see attached image) was developed explicitly to leverage such cycles in system change while managing the complexities and challenges unique to addressing racial equity, particularly educators&rsquo; reluctance to acknowledge their role in system maintenance. ASSA-IPS attends to this from the outset, helping all educators understand how we all have a hand in perpetuating inequitable systems; moreover, it provides a roadmap to gaining deeper insight into local racial inequity to develop interventions that enable productive and thoughtful resolution.</p> <p>As part of this, a new practice emerged: <em>MathEquity.</em> Though often treated separately, in DEbT-M, we recognized that the very way we engage and have learners engage in content connects to our perspectives of equity; thus, to ensure mathematics is an accessible discipline, we must abandon acultur alperspectives and consider how mathematics teaching and learning can perpetuate or disrupt power systems. <em>MathEquity</em> is an integrated practice by which we inquire into mathematics engagement with an eye to how it affects those who do it.</p> <p>The DEbT-M project&rsquo;s impacts extend well beyond the specific work that we did with our teachers&mdash;work that has been detailed and shared in over 25 talks at national conferences, multiple article and chapter publications, a 200-page National Council of Supervisor of Mathematics monograph (image attached), and a website with freely available resources, <a href="https://equityinschoolmathematics.us/">https://equityinschoolmathematics.us/</a>. This dissemination has led to new collaborations in states including MA, NY, CO, and NJ; it has also jump-started other racial equity work funded by NSF.</p> <p>Quantitative results provided insight into ways the program impacted involved teachers and their learners. Focusing on teacher evaluations by both their supervisors and students, we know that teacher growth was observed in both groups. In our urban setting, DEbT-M teachers were rated by their supervisors using a modified Danielson Framework using 12 (of 23) power components in four areas; Cohorts 1 and 2 both demonstrated significant overall growth (at the <em>p</em>&lt;.05 level) over the course of their respective programs on their composite weighted evaluation scores. Only Cohort 3, which comprised 4 teachers who were in both prior cohorts, did not show significant growth, likely due to the small numbers. Difference in growth between Cohorts 1 and 2 is observable on the power component subscales. While Cohort 1 teachers showed such growth on only 2 of the 12 subscales, Cohort 2 teachers showed significant subscale growth on 8, including <em>Creating a Learning Environment of Respect and Rapport</em>, <em>Communicating with Students</em>, and<strong> </strong><em>Implementing Lessons Equitably.</em><strong> </strong>While teachers were assessed on their growth in the use of mathematical habits of mind, and Cohort 1 showed significant growth in this area, we did not have enough Cohort 2 teachers take the post-assessment to determine if they showed similar growth. Case studies suggest though that similar growth is possible.</p> <p>DEbT-M teachers, most of whom were white, were also rated by their students, ~60% of whom were non-white, using the valid and reliable Tripod (https://tripoded.com) survey. The Tripod results along 2 of 7 indicators demonstrate changes in how students experienced their mathematics classes. Student surveys suggest Cohort 2 teachers grew significantly in <em>encouraging and valuing students&rsquo; ideas and views! </em>This is central for relationship-building, developing disciplinary identities, and students&rsquo; asset perspectives, all of which are central to equity. Students highlighted that teachers in Cohorts 2 and 3 grew significantly in <em>classroom management</em>. This seems startling given DEbT-M did not focus here. However, from the student perspective, this means that teachers fostered respectful on-task behavior, enabling learning and establishing a positive classroom climate.</p> <p>Based on our outcomes and drawing on related research about the impact of empowering teachers as change agents, we conjecture that if students of color can remain over time with teachers who are change agents for racial equity, these students would not just experience shifts in their perceptions of their mathematics classrooms, but they would also grow significantly in their mathematical learning and performance.</p> <div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/30/2019<br>      Modified by: Eden&nbsp;M&nbsp;Badertscher</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1321216/1321216_10283176_1572470094540_ScreenShot2019-10-30at5.13.35PM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1321216/1321216_10283176_1572470094540_ScreenShot2019-10-30at5.13.35PM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="NCSM Monograph"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1321216/1321216_10283176_1572470094540_ScreenShot2019-10-30at5.13.35PM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="NCSM Monograph"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Cover of the 2019 NCSM Monograph, available through NCSM.</div> <div class="imageCredit">EDC (Eden Badertscher)</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Eden&nbsp;M&nbsp;Badertscher</div> <div class="imageTitle">NCSM Monograph</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1321216/1321216_10283176_1572470269783_ScreenShot2019-10-30at2.40.52PM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1321216/1321216_10283176_1572470269783_ScreenShot2019-10-30at2.40.52PM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="ASSA-IPS"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1321216/1321216_10283176_1572470269783_ScreenShot2019-10-30at2.40.52PM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="ASSA-IPS"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The ASSA-IPS Change Agency Model</div> <div class="imageCredit">EDC (Eden Badertscher)</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Eden&nbsp;M&nbsp;Badertscher</div> <div class="imageTitle">ASSA-IPS</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1321216/1321216_10283176_1572470358978_ScreenShot2019-10-30at2.41.59PM--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1321216/1321216_10283176_1572470358978_ScreenShot2019-10-30at2.41.59PM--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Systems Pyramid"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1321216/1321216_10283176_1572470358978_ScreenShot2019-10-30at2.41.59PM--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Systems Pyramid"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">The DEbT-M Systems Pyramid Model</div> <div class="imageCredit">EDC (Eden Badertscher)</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Eden&nbsp;M&nbsp;Badertscher</div> <div class="imageTitle">Systems Pyramid</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
