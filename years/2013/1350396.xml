<AbstractNarration>An Abelian differential defines a flat metric on the underlying Riemann surface. Varying the flat structure induces an action on moduli spaces of Abelian differentials; this is called Teichmueller dynamics. A number of questions about the geometry of Riemann surfaces boils down to the study of the orbits under such dynamics. The proposed project aims to explore Teichmueller dynamics using tools in algebraic geometry and to develop applications to the geometry of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces. The ultimate goal is to establish a correspondence between dynamical properties of these orbits and the intersection theory of their closures in the moduli space. Moreover, the intersection calculation can determine the cycle class of an orbit closure in the moduli space, which in turn provides crucial information towards understanding the cone of effective divisors, cone of curves, Chow ring structure, and birational models for the moduli space. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Algebraic geometry and dynamical systems are two important branches of modern mathematics. The former uses algebraic (polynomial) equations to study geometrical structures, while the latter applies analytical tools to describe the time dependence of a moving point. Despite the fact they initially seem unrelated, the principal investigator plans to explore their inner connections by constructing algebraic equations to measure the behavior of Teichmueller dynamics. In a sense this is analogous to introducing coordinates in Descartes geometry. The proposed project also opens many avenues for student and postdoctoral research. The principal investigator will continue to integrate his research with undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate training as well as workshop organization. More precisely, he plans to develop a student mathematics symposium, advise student research projects, design new courses in algebraic geometry, create a junior scholar visiting program, and organize a series of conferences and workshops with a focus on students and young researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The PI is grateful to the NSF CAREER grant support.  During the support period the PI wrote about 20 papers on the proposed project and gave about 60 lectures worldwide to disseminate new knowledge.  The results and techniques out of the PI's project can help people better understand the physical world in terms of geometry, dynamics and combinatorics on complex curves.  A powerful tool employed in the PI's research is by using polynomial equations to explore analytic geometry, which in a sense is analogous to establishing coordinates to investigate Euclidean geometry.  Another novel idea is to study smooth objects via degenerations.  For instance, a pretzel can split continuously into three donuts (if one does it carefully with patience).  Thus by studying a donut as a simpler object, one can conversely recover properties for a pretzel as a more complicated object.  Moreover, the PI mentored a number of students and junior scholars by providing them introductions and open problems related to his research.  The PI also wrote several expository surveys which are accessible to general readers in order for them to learn the subject more easily.  In addition, the PI co-organized a series of conferences, workshops and seminars, nationwide and worldwide, in-person and online, with a focus on increasing diversity, supporting underrepresented groups and training the next generation of mathematicians.
