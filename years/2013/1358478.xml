<AbstractNarration>This grant will help support the attendance of six graduate students and six post-doctoral researchers at the The Minerals, Metals, and Materials Society (TMS) Annual Meeting to be held in February in San Diego. A special symposium on Bulk Metallic Glasses and another on Shape Casting will be held during the conference. Both will focus on the fundamental science associated with the processing and mechanical behavior of materials in each class.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The students, who represent the future generation of materials scientist and engineers, will have the opportunity to gain technical knowledge as well as to meet and interact with many of the established leaders in the field. Funds will be used for the students' registration and partial travel support.</AbstractNarration>
