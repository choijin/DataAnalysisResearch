<AbstractNarration>Research and development in cloud-based distributed systems is currently&lt;br/&gt;hindered due to the incredible difficulty of running such systems at&lt;br/&gt;scale. The Wisconsin Pocket Datacenter (PoD) project directly addresses this&lt;br/&gt;dilemma by enabling researchers and developers to run large-scale distributed&lt;br/&gt;systems on modest hardware resources. The key novel idea behind PoD is data&lt;br/&gt;elision, which removes actual application data from the underlying disks,&lt;br/&gt;memories, and network transfers of the distributed system under test. PoD thus&lt;br/&gt;enables many virtual instances of such a system to be run upon just a few&lt;br/&gt;physical machines, thus making testing, debugging, and in general development&lt;br/&gt;simpler, faster, and less resource-intensive.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cloud-based distributed systems represent a critically-important piece of&lt;br/&gt;modern computing infrastructure. As users and corporations migrate their data&lt;br/&gt;and computation into such facilities, it is increasingly important to ensure&lt;br/&gt;that such systems operate correctly and efficiently. PoD enables developers to&lt;br/&gt;debug existing systems and test new designs without excessive hardware&lt;br/&gt;resources; with such a tool in their workbench, system developers will be able&lt;br/&gt;to more readily build and test the next generation of cloud-based systems to&lt;br/&gt;support the needs of a growing percentage of society.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>
