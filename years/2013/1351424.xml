<AbstractNarration>The objective of this research is to investigate how the unique electronic properties of graphene impacts the nature of photo-induced carrier injection, transport and recombination at heterojunctions of graphene with a range of semiconductors and nanomaterials; and to potentially harness these mechanisms for various advanced optoelectronic applications. The approach will be to study photo-absorption, photocurrent, and photoluminescence spectroscopy at junctions of graphene with materials such as silicon, zinc oxide, molybdenum disulphide, and bismuth selenide at different photon energies, doping levels, and gate voltages.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit: Photo-induced carriers injected across a heterojunction into graphene demonstrate a number of unusual and intellectually stimulating properties. A comprehensive investigation of these carrier dynamics will lead to rich new physical insights related to the nature of injection/recombination across atomically thin interfaces, and its interplay with ultrafast mobility and constrained density of states in graphene.  A variety of junctions will be investigated, and the engineering knowledge thus acquired will be utilized to develop a range of exceptionally sensitive photo-switching, photo-harvesting, photometry, imaging, and spectrometric applications.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impact: The proposed research and education program can potentially result in transformative changes in imaging, detection, analysis, communication and energy-harvesting technologies. It will create exceptionally skilled graduate and undergraduate students qualified to pursue both academic and industrial careers in some of the most topically impactful research areas. Local high-school students and teachers will be exposed to world-class, research-based, learning-enhanced and career-catalyzing education. Traditionally under-represented communities will be proactively integrated into a stimulating environment of research and education in STEM fields.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>Since the birth of graphene as a stable monolayer material in 2004, scientists and engineers have developed and investigated a wide range of atomically-thin, layered, or 2D materials, in order to reveal their fundamental physical properties, and their potential for developing a variety of applications. The aim of this 5-year CAREER project was to investigate the optical and optoelectronic properties of a specific sub-class of graphene-based materials, i.e. materials in which graphene formed a junction with another functional material or component. Such combined structures, or heterostructures, have remained the backbone of science and technology in the twentieth century, providing us with transistors, LEDs, memory devices, sensors, solar cells and many other valuable technologies. This project started with the aim to explore how similar principles can be exploited in graphene-based junctions, or graphene-enabled heterostructures. The resulting research revealed fascinating new ways in which quantum particles such as photons and electrons interacted at these junctions, leading to new types of photodetectors with unprecedented sensitivity and operational range. In doing so, graphene-based systems were also found to be excellent ion sensors, GHz resonators, infrared detectors, solar cells, super capacitors and much, much more. Beyond graphene, the discovery of other 2D materials further enriched the scientific findings, leading to many fundamental discoveries related to how photon-excited electrons, phonons, and excitons undergo relaxation - pathways towards equilibrium- in femto-to-pico-second timescales. These are the very timescales at which computer programs operate, and hence the research provides enormous insight on how such materials can be the basis of next-generation computational materials.</p> <p>The broader impact of this research program is wide-spread. Several PhD students were supported, who have gone on to join the STEM workforce either within the Industry, or continued as academics with highly regarded posdoctoral awards. UG researchers have enhanced both their intellectual acumen in a field which is at the forefront of material science, and skillsets that place them at par with the best in terms of materials synthesis, data analysis, public presentation, and solving technically-difficult problems. UG students who have worked the project have gone on to join highly sought after Graduate programs, both nationally and internationally. Research from the project has resulted in multiple intellectual properties, which are being pursued for patents. A spin-off company was founded based on ultra-sensitive ion sensors that resulted from this NSF-funded research. The company has continued its R&amp;D exploring several areas of sensing and detection, including radiation sensing, mass spectrometry, pressure sensing and other commercially-attractive areas. The research was performed by a number of traditionally under-represented STEM participants, including women, persons of different faiths, first-time unversity-goers, a high-school-student, veterans, and other minorities. Most of the participating students pursued active research that led to inventions and publications in major, peer-reviewed journals. Taken together, the broader impact of this project has been wide-ranging and highly impactful.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/05/2020<br>      Modified by: Swastik&nbsp;Kar</p> </div> <div
