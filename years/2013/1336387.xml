<AbstractNarration>PI: Monroe, Charles&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Number: 1336387&lt;br/&gt;Institution: University of Michigan Ann Arbor&lt;br/&gt;Title: GOALI: Experimentally validated multiscale modeling of Li/O2 cathodes&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collaboration project between the University of Michigan (UM) and Robert Bosch Research and Technology Center (Bosch RTC) will focus on development of robust multiscale models of rechargeable Li/air cathodes. A viable Li/air battery would speed efforts to electrify transportation. Conservative projections suggest that Li/air stacks could achieve energy densities near 1 kWh/kg. This allows single-charge driving distances of 400 miles, matching combustion-driven cars. The PIs propose to show what phenomena most impact Li/air cell performance by informing predictive continuum electrochemical models with electronic structure calculations and experimental data.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The hybrid multi-scale modeling/experimental approach will elucidate discharge/charge mechanisms, voltage response, and performance of rechargeable aprotic Li/air cells. The team combines expertise in continuum modeling, ab initio computation, and experimental electrochemical and structural characterization. The academic/industrial collaboration will support the Energy for Sustainability Program objective to improve the fundamental understanding of advanced energy-storage technologies for transportation, for two primary research objectives: (1) to develop a flexible, experimentally benchmarked multi-scale modeling framework. Simulations will incorporate both experimental measurements and ab initio predictions of material properties into a predictive continuum-scale Li/air cell model with a 3-phase cathode structure; and (2) to use the modeling framework to identify, quantify, and predict performance-limiting phenomena in rechargeable Li/air cells. The mechanistic insight gained will reveal strategies to overcome limitations and accelerate development of viable Li/air batteries for vehicles. Simultaneous theoretical and experimental efforts will parameterize and validate the multi-scale theoretical model, reliant on molecular-scale thermodynamic, kinetic, and transport properties, to simulate the macroscopic response of Li/air cells during discharge or charge. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The approach will improve the field?s limited knowledge about elementary reaction mechanisms in Li/air-battery cathodes, and will correlate atomic-scale bulk and interfacial material properties with cell-level performance metrics such as accessible capacity, rate capability, and efficiency. Building on a current collaboration with Li/air researchers at Bosch RTC, scientific exchanges will be strengthened by student internship experiences at Bosch and visits of Bosch researchers to UM.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The outreach activities will foster the natural connection between research and pedagogy. Here the chief aim is to establish a collaborative, diverse environment for electrochemical research to achieve four primary educational goals: (1) Integration of research problems into a course module in a graduate Electrochemical Engineering course, webcast simultaneously to reach students seeking technical degrees; (2) Exposure of undergraduates to energy-storage technology by offering undergraduate research opportunities and developing forums outside the classroom for idea exchange; (3) Outreach to support participation by under-represented minorities and women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics; and (4) Dissemination of research products via peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and biweekly meetings with UM metal/air battery researchers.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[     Energy storage is a cross-cutting technology that impacts portable electronics, the grid penetration of renewable power sources (wind and solar) and the electrification of the transportation sector. By advancing our understanding of emerging battery chemistries, the present project has aimed to accelerate the development of new batteries with much larger energy densities.       More specifically, this project has focused on the development of robust multi-scale models for rechargeable, non-aqueous Li/air batteries. A viable Li/air battery would dramatically accelerate efforts to electrify the transportation sector. Conservative projections suggest that practical Li/air stacks may achieve specific energies of 1000 Wh/kg. This would make possible single-charge driving distances of ~400 miles, equaling the capabilities of combustion-based vehicles. Nevertheless, the viability of Li/air technology remains uncertain due to several performance limitations. A goal of this research is to reveal which mechanisms most strongly impact performance by informing predictive macro-scale electro-chemical models with realistic data from experiments and electronic structure calculations.   Simultaneous experimental and theoretical efforts were used to parameterize and validate the multi-scale theoretical model, reliant on molecular-scale thermodynamic, kinetic, and transport properties, to simulate the macroscopic response of Li/air cells during discharge or charge. Our approach has improved the field?s limited knowledge about elementary reaction mechanisms in Li/air-battery cathodes, and correlated molecular-scale bulk and interfacial material properties with cell-level performance characteristics such as accessible capacity, rate capability, and efficiency.   Major outcomes of this research incluce:  The development of several "multi-scale" models of Li/air battery performance. The publication of 9 battery-related articles in peer-reviewed journals, with a 10th publication in the process of being completed. One book chapter has also been submitted for publication. Filing of an invention disclosure on mechanisms for improving the transport properties of Li/air cathodes. Exploration of new metal-air battery chemistries such as the Mg/air system. Funding from this project contributed to the dissertations of 5 PhD students.       In one instance, the models developed in this project have been used to understand how the performance of Li/air batteries can be limited by charge transport through the solid Li2O2 discharge product. Prior studies suggest that electron tunneling is the main transport mechanism through thin, compact Li2O2 deposits. This project developed a new continuum transport model to explore an alternative scenario, in which charge transport is mediated by polaron hopping (i.e., hopping of localized electrons). Unlike earlier models, which assume a uniform carrier concentration or local electroneutrality, the possibility of nonuniform space charge is accounted for at the Li2O2/electrolyte and Li2O2/electrode interfaces, providing a more realistic picture of transport in Li2O2 films. The temperature and current-density dependences of the discharge curves predicted by the model are in good agreement with flat-electrode experiments over a wide range of rates, supporting the hypothesis that polaron hopping contributes significantly to charge transport. Exercising the model suggests that this mechanism could explain the observed enhancement in cell performance at elevated temperature and that performance could be further improved by tuning the interfacial orientation of Li2O2 crystallites.       A second model developed under this project was used to examine how the apparent capacity of a Li/air cell is affected by macroscopic multicomponent mass transfer, interfacial kinetics, and electronic conduction or tunneling through the discharge product. The model accounts for the three-phase nature of the positive electrode in detail, including an explicit discharge-product layer whose properties and volume distribution generally depend on the local discharge depth. Experimental discharge data was used to validate the model. Several hypothetical positive-electrode reaction mechanisms involving different product morphologies and electron-transfer sites were explored within the theoretical framework. To match experimental discharge-voltage vs. capacity and capacity vs. discharge-current trends qualitatively, the discharge-product layer must be assumed to have electronic resistivity several orders of magnitude lower than typical insulators, supporting the notion that the presence of lithium peroxide does not wholly prevent electrons from reaching dissolved reactants. The discharge product also appears to allow charge transport over length scales longer than electron tunneling permits. The model teaches us that ?sudden death? of voltage in lithium/oxygen cells can explained by macroscopic oxygen-diffusion limitations in the positive electrode at high rates, and by pore clogging associated with discharge-product formation at low rates.
