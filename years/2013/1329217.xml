<AbstractNarration>This engineering education research project seeks to explore whether college admissions files can be structured to improve the decision making of admissions officers. Psychological biases may hinder the ability of admissions officers to make ideal decisions, which could lead to the rejection of well-qualified low-income and minority students. This experimental study will examine whether changing the information included with the application, along with the order in which that information appears, will affect admissions officers' decisions about which applications to accept. The interventions developed here have the potential to be adopted within college admissions processes for engineering majors and for all students.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The broader significance and importance of this project arises through the potential for simultaneously improving the quality and diversity of incoming engineering students. This project may inform not only practices in engineering admissions offices, but also the activities of important national entities such as the College Board and Common Application. This project overlaps with NSF's strategic goal for performing as a model organization by helping colleges and universities attain both excellence and inclusion. Additionally NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by facilitating research that informs educational policies and practices.</AbstractNarration>

Specifically, we explored the presence of biases in the evaluation of engineering admissions applications, and we tested subtle, theory-guided interventions that are likely to reduce or eliminate these biases. The primary bias we examined involves the tendency to underestimate the role that situational factors play in shaping behavior; this phenomenon is so pervasive and problematic that it is sometimes referred to as the "fundamental attribution error."   Within admissions contexts, college admissions officers are likely to inadequately consider the extent to which attending an under-served high school often plays in shaping students? application materials. Another key bias involves the tendency for people to seek out information that confirms initial beliefs. As a result, college admissions officers may form a strong impression about an applicant from an initial scan of her academic indicators while failing to adjust sufficiently for the additional information provided by the extracurricular activities and personal statements (essays).   This study used an experimental design to determine whether such biases are operating in the evaluation of engineering applications. We recruited 311 admissions officers at a national conference to evaluate simulated engineering applications. This study was a randomized controlled trial (RCT).  We had three major findings:  1) Because admissions offices often have inconsistent information on high school contexts, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine whether providing detailed information on high school contexts increases the likelihood that admissions officers would recommend admitting low-SES applicants. Admissions officers in the detailed-information condition were 13 to 14 percentage points (i.e., 26%&ndash;28%) more likely to recommend admitting a low-SES applicant from an underserved high school than those in the limited-information condition, although the limited-information condition provided significant details about family SES and high school context. These findings were consistent regardless of the selectivity of the college, admissions office practices, and participant demographics.  2) Attending a selective college or university has a notable impact on the likelihood of graduation, graduate school attendance, social networks, and career earnings. Given these short-term and long-term benefits, surprisingly little research has directly explored the factors that might promote or detract from equitable admissions decisions at these schools.  We used our experimental data to investigate the impact of admissions office practices and admissions officers' demographic chracteristics on holistic admissions decisions.  Among the descriptive findings, more than half of respondents reported that they consider applicants? demonstrated interest in attending their institution when making a recommendation, about two-thirds review at least 100 applications during busy weeks, and almost half were working at their alma mater.
