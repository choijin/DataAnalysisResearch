<AbstractNarration>The PIs are funded to use surface and body wave tomographic techniques to examine the structure of the upper mantle beneath the Juan de Fuca Plate. OBS arrays associated with the Cascadia Initiative (CI) will be used in conjunction with land arrays to investigate the evolution of the plate?mantle system, from melt production and asthenospheric structure at the spreading center to plate deformation and small-scale convection at the subduction zone, as well as asthenospheric return flow from trench to ridge. Surface and body wave data will be combined in a joint inversion, followed by waveform modeling to refine tomographic images. An additional goal is to constrain the locations and mechanisms of moderate-sized earthquakes that occur before and during the experiment. The project will partner with education and outreach efforts associated with the CI, including mentoring community college students and contributing to the Seismometers@SchoolSites program for high school students. Post-doctoral scholars and graduate students will be trained. Project data will be incorporated into undergraduate coursework and research projects. The PIs will take advantage of the UO cloud computing facility for parts of the research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Intellectual Merit. The plate-scale deployment of ocean bottom seismographs (OBS) as part of the Cascadia Initiative of NSF provides a unique opportunity to study the structure and dynamics of an entire oceanic plate, from its birth at a spreading center to its subduction beneath a continental plate.  Together with the land stations that are part of the amphibious array and other land networks, the OBSs provide coverage at a density comparable to the Transportable Array of Earthscope from the volcanic arc out to beyond the Pacific-Juan de Fuca spreading center segments. Our goals included outlining the shape of the melt production region beneath the spreading center, determining the evolution of the plate and asthenosphere with age, and looking for indications of the pattern of asthenospheric return flow from trench to ridge.  One outcome of our work is that we constrained how mantle flows beneath the Juan de Fuca and Gorda plates, which subduct beneath North America.  Mantle flow beneath the Juan de Fuca plate is consistent with its absolute motion.  However, mantle flow beneath Gorda is distinctly different and suggests that deformation in this region is not directly related to either absolute plate motion or to slab rollback near the southern end of the Cascadia Subduction zone.  One practical implication of our study is that the Gorda region may be a stagnant plate that is not actively underthrusting North America.  This result has implications for assessing seismic hazards in southern Cascadia.  A second outcome of our study is the first ever three-dimensional images of mantle structure near a spreading center and a ridge-transform-ridge system.  Our results test geodynamic predictions made over the past 30 years and allow us to conclude that models of passive mantle flow are not viable. Instead, the observed structures are consistent with models that include dynamic upwelling.  Together with the previous study, the seismic results suggest a more active role for mantle flow beneath in the Cascadia region.   Broader Impacts.
